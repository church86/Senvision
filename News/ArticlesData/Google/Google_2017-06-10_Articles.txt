A huge one. Sangakkara gone. He’s furious with himself, as he was in the first innings.

No sign of Uruguay I’m afraid. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.15am EDT 08:15 Dominic Solanke collects his golden ball as the tournament’s leading scorer. Others to have done so are Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi, Luis Figo, Sergio Aguero and Paul Pogba. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.14am EDT 08:14 In the studio, they’re talking about getting these players game-time, and I agree that it’s important. I still wonder whether any elite talents have failed to make it because of missed opportunities, though. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.11am EDT 08:11 Freddie Woodman has just been awarded a golden glove trophy, with a sponsor’s name pasted over it. It should be Uhlsport or Sondico, but it isn’t. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.10am EDT 08:10 Still no presentation, now that you ask. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.08am EDT 08:08 “Is the best thing for this group to have them sat down tomorrow for a ‘you’ve done nothing yet’ chat?” asks Elliott Carr-Barnsley. “Surely a worse thing than players who’ve achieved nothing getting big heads is players who have.” I think we can allow them tomorrow. Truth is, I’m pretty sure most if not all of them have far grander ambitions. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.07am EDT 08:07 “Interesting how quickly the players seem to have adapted to the video review system as well,” says David Wall. “The England players were making the universal sign for ‘go to the video ref’ after he gave the decision initially, yet they’ll not have encountered the system before this tournament. Do you think fans will adapt and accept it as readily?” Players will do anything to save themselves, I’m sure. And yep, it’d - it’ll, I guess - become part of the game pretty so, and we’ll keep going with it. As I’ve written on here before, personally I don’t care all that much about whether decisions are right or wrong - it’s only football after all - so for me it’s about using replays at the right time, not using them to slot in adverts and stuff, and retaining the integrity of the decision-making process Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.03am EDT 08:03 So, how do England build from here? The likely stars of the team seem to me to be Onomah and Lookman, both of whom are likely to get plenty of football next season. But the truth is that all these lads seem to have a chance, and managers who’ll help them out - it’s exciting to see what they do next. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.59am EDT 07:59 Thinking back to that penalty - and it was a fantastic save - the video refereeing worked perfectly. What it means is that officials can make big decisions when they might not be sure, knowing that they can later be saved; otherwise, the temptation is not to award spot-kicks because giving one that isn’t causes more aggravation than not giving one that is. Updated at 8.01am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.57am EDT 07:57 “Is John Terry going to lift the trophy?” asks Simon Thomas. I’m just relieved there’ll be none of the players’ kids on the pitch.

ENGLAND HAVE WON THE UNDER-20 WORLD CUP! ENGLAND ARE WORLD CHAMPIONS! Updated at 7.54am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.54am EDT 07:54 90+4 min Venezuela 0-1 England Eventually Woodman is ready to continue - we’ll be having another couple of minutes for that. And that’s a change we can all surely get behind, telling us how long the game is. Anyhow, England win a corner, try keeping it in the corner, fail, and Venezuela break. Sosa burns down the right, and Maitland-Niles does superbly to get back and concede a corner. Surely this is it... Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.52am EDT 07:52 90+2 min Venezuela 0-1 England Woodman comes out to smother with Tomori and and Pena following the ball in ... Tomori tramples his buddy’s calf thanks in part to a friendly shove from Pena, and there’s a break while treatment is handed out. In the meantime, Penaranda departs and Hurtado comes on; someone please reassure me that his dressing room nickname is Nelly. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.49am EDT 07:49 90 min Venezuela 0-1 England There’ll be four added minutes as Herrera slips a low pass into the box ... Clarke-Salter gets his feet all over the show trying to clear, slicing towards his own net, and Woodman dives to shovel around the post. Farinez comes up for the corner, and the ball breaks to him on the edge of the box, but he can’t make room for a shot and England block him off! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.48am EDT 07:48 90 min Venezuela 0-1 England Penaranda moves into space outside the England box, finds Herrera and doesn’t move for the return! England break, and Calvert-Lewin again gets away only for Lucena to catch up and rob him. Superb tracking at this stage of the game. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.46am EDT 07:46 88 min Venezuela 0-1 England Excellent from England, moving down the right to win a corner. Ojo and Solanek keep it there briefly, eventually cede the goalkick, and Farinez wellies it into touch! England are nearly there! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.45am EDT 07:45 87 min Venezuela 0-1 England Lovely from Onomah, shrugging off a challenge in centrefield and gliding towards the box. In front of him, Calvert-Lewin is running across the line in search of a through-pass, but when it arrives it turns out he’s gone too early. Right idea from both, though. Updated at 7.45am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.43am EDT 07:43 85 min Venezuela 0-1 England Venezuela win a free-kick on the right, 40 yards out, and again Lucena rips it into the box with menace. But Kenny does enough at the back post to disrupt Pena and England get the ball away. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.42am EDT 07:42 84 min Venezuela 0-1 England England are doing really well here, not sitting back but looking to spring forward on the break. Calvert-Lewin finds himself in space through the middle, and he has Ojo outside him, but decides to have a dig, sending a shot wide and plenty. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.40am EDT 07:40 82 min Venezuela 0-1 England “Danny Mills talking like Nigeria didn’t go further than England at the last World Cup,” tweets Mo; “The way he made out winning AFCON means nothing, he’s so disrespectful,” says Millie. I’d really rather not be talking about this at this juncture, but it’s important so here we are. Here’s a piece on the issues, including what Mills said about Wilfried Zaha, should anyone want to consider further. Updated at 7.43am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.38am EDT 07:38 80 min Venezuela 0-1 England Penaranda burrows forward, but Ojo nuzzles in from behind, knocking him over and taking the ball. No foul, rules the ref. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.36am EDT 07:36 78 min Venezuela 0-1 England I’m not mad about using video evidence, but that penalty was a good example of how it can work. The problem, I guess, is when it’s unclear, but suppose a right or a wrong decision can still be made as before. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.33am EDT 07:33 76 min Venezuela 0-1 England Just before the penalty Sosa replaced Cordova, and now Lookman departs with Maitland-Niles coming on. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.33am EDT 07:33 WOODMAN SAVES PENARANDA'S KICK! 75 min Venezuela 0-1 England Woodman goes right and the ball goes down the middle but somehow he chucks his hands back the other way! It’s a bit Seaman v Sampdoria, I guess - he dives past it, but still saves with a mighty arm. Brilliant! Woodman saves the penalty from Penaranda. Photograph: Lars Baron - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images Updated at 7.43am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.31am EDT 07:31 PENALTY TO VENEZUELA! 73 min Venezuela 0-1 England Penaranda turns inside Clarke-Salter inside the box, right-hand side, and Clarke-Salter piles through him. England insist it’s not a penalty, the ref checks, and of course it is! Updated at 7.40am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.30am EDT 07:30 70 min Venezuela 0-1 England The commentator points out that three of England’s team are eligible for Nigeria. “If the chance comes to play for England you’ve got to take it,” he says - he really does! - explaining that it’s their best chance of “winning competitions that really matter”. I feel unwell. But to be clear, it’s really none of anyone’s business how people identify, there are competitions which really matter outside of those for which England are eligible, and no country is inherently better than any other country.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.26am EDT 07:26 68 min Venezuela 0-1 England The corner goes towards Clarke-Salter at the back post, and his header is deflected over the top for another. That one sees Ferraresi and Solanke going for the ball, and oh dear; Solanke plants face on crown, and accordingly there’s a bit of blood.

Researchers have now found a way to apply that principle to catching identity thieves in the act. Image Source: Monopoly Google Has Finally Killed The CAPTCHA CAPTCHA's are an irritating but necessary evil. The system that is used to verify whether or not a user is human has been around a while and it had to evolve because machines were getting better at reading the text than humans. With its latest iteration, Google says you'll no longer have to input anything at all. Read more One of the biggest issues with identity theft is that if a person has successfully gotten ahold of your personal details, they could use them over and over again. Questions like "what's your mother's maiden name?" have evolved into more elaborate queries like "On which of the following streets have you lived?" But even the second question is easily referencable by a motivated identity thief. That problem is being addressed by a team that recently published the findings of their new study in PLoS One. The mechanism for preventing identity theft is fairly simple but it represents some progress in a field with a lot of potential. The researchers asked a group of 40 people from Italy (yes, it's a small sample size) to answer 6 expected questions, 6 unexpected questions, and 4 control questions that required a yes answer. They were given the same amounts of questions that required a no answer. Half of the group was asked to respond truthfully, while the other half was given a fake profile to memorise. The group that had to fake it was quizzed twice before the test began and they proved that they knew all of the information necessary to answer the questions accurately. The list of yes/no questions. Image: PLoS One By design, the liars would only have to lie on the non-control questions with a yes answer. Everyone did really well with the expected questions and only 2/240 were answered incorrectly. The unexpected questions were unsurprisingly more difficult with the people telling the truth getting 5/240 wrong and the liars getting 82/240 wrong. While the participants were taking the quiz, mouse tracking software was following their movements and a machine learning algorithm (explanation) was later used for analysis. The participants weren't being tested on their response times, though that could also be theoretically factored into this type of system. Obviously, if you know a fake birth date but not the corresponding zodiac sign you'd have to think about it or look it up. What the researchers found was that the liars had a distinctive average mouse movement that was more circuitous than the truth tellers. Even when the liars were telling the truth, it seems that their overall dishonesty was infecting their movements and they could accurately be identified as lying. The researchers then repeated their full experiment with 20 German-speaking subjects to test for cultural differences and they arrived at the same conclusions. They write: From a cognitive point of view, what is interesting here is that, in the experimental design, the mind-set of the liars also extended its effects to questions when they were responding truthfully. To our knowledge, this pattern of results has never been reported before and could be an indication of the level of sensitivity of the technique of mouse-movement analysis. The sample here is too small and the testing procedures are too limited to indicate that this is a viable technique for detecting identity fraud. Plenty more research will have to be done and lots of algorithmic refinement will be necessary to make this in any way trustworthy. But it's an interesting result for a new method and imagine what companies that have access to huge amounts of data could do. How distinct is a users mouse movement? How distinct is it when you know how they respond to various stimulation for hours at a time over the course of years? It seems possible that with machine learning we could one day be analysing mouse movements as a virtual fingerprint across the web.

Here are all the Instant Apps announced at Google I/O Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 2:36pm PDTMay 18, 2017 49 Plus 1 on G+ 140 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares272 Google News Instant Apps were announced one year ago at Google I/O 2016, but only now are they rolling out to a large amount of users. Now any developer can make instant Apps, and Google showed off a massive list of them at a session earlier today (seen above). Some of the highlights include Vimeo for watching videos, Jet for shopping, Periscope for watching live streams, The Weather Channel, and even the New York Times crossword puzzle. Most of these already have mobile web app versions, but the point is that Instant Apps provide a native application experience. Even though the Instant Apps feature is already rolled out to me, I'm unable to use some of these, perhaps indicating that some are still in testing. For example, I couldn't get the Weather Channel or Periscope ones to work, but Vimeo and Jet did. Instant Apps currently work on Android 6.0 or higher.

If you were already using them, you'd have them installed and have no need for an instant app. Shazmil Nassar Well if you're using it you won't get the instant app at all when you search. . . boop I've yet to figure out how instant apps work. DieselBeats Basically the experience of the app without having to download it. It's moreso if you are really only going to use the app once so it's not just hogging up space on your phone and never being used. boop I now that much. I mean I've never been able to pull one up. Sruly J Do you have the Google Play Services for Instant Apps app installed? Michel S. weird, why can't I find that in the Play Store? (on Android O beta, en-US) Sruly J It's not available through the Play Store. Officially the app is supposed to roll out to devices in the background, with the same going for updates. It's available on APK Mirror though. Richard Riker in theory you should get a button when you google for the app. But it may be US only at the moment, having the location set to en-us doesn't help. And at least in the show-off at last years I/O you should have such a button in the play store too. But you'll have to have Play Services for Instant apps and activate them in the play services settings antonio cesar you must have a specific google play services called google play services for instant apps, it dosent come preloaded David Onter It downloads native mini-apps in the background and displays them to you instead of the website when you click on a link. Jpx I remember when I was sent a zillow link from my girlfriend last month. It used instant apps and I freaked out. I was rambling to her like she had any idea what I was talking about. It is such a great feature, that really doesn't feel like a big deal. Which means its amazing. Sir_Brizz "amoutsn" Carson Saldanha "amountsn fo" Sir_Brizz LOL Total Insecurity XDD Total Insecurity XD Carson Saldanha I have instant apps enabled, but they don't show up in search results. (I'm on Google US btw) Renaud Lepage What the HELL is the CBC in there for? abqnm So if you're searching for something and the result points to the CBC, you get the instant app for CBC. Not only Canadians get news from the CBC. Say, for example if you're from the US, you probably won't have the app installed, but you may get a CBC news story or such in your search results, so by providing an instant app, the user gets mostly the same experience as they would if they had the app installed. Renaud Lepage I know the why, I'm Canadian. I'm just surprised they actually gave enough of a shit to do an Instant App. abqnm Alright, point. But it's not like the instant apps are hard if you already have an app. I guess maybe they are focusing on engagement in search more now. That's really what these are. Renaud Lepage If I'm being an insufferable pedant (and trust me, I am), sometimes, a pre-existing app's lifecycle could ACTUALLY *really* not support the Instant App approach. Case in point, applications that have a Shared Account login: I'm not sure that's allowed. skillfulshoe I keep catching my phone "downloading" an update but it is for instant apps and the notification disappears within a second. Anyone know what is happening? Corbin Davenport That's the support library/APK for instant apps updating. skillfulshoe I've seen it do that about 5 times in the past few days. Anyways, thanks for the answer! Mike in KC I've noticed the same thing on my phone as well. Ozl Awesome, i cant wait to ditch my iPhone for a new Pixel 2.0 whenever they are available xD Jack Smith Two of us. Looking forward to getting a Pixel 2. Just hope I can get my hands on one. Ozl Yes, ill be there waiting to click that buy button on day one xD mehmehmeh I have noticed that since I switched back from iPhone to the S8+ that app updates seem smaller. Did they change how apps are updated in the 6ish months I was away from Android? iFeign Delta updates http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/07/23/new-play-store-tools-help-developers-to-shrink-the-size-of-app-updates/ patkoscsaba So. I have Google Play services for Instant Apps installed. I am also a beta user for Google App. How do I get an instant app? Can someone provide a step by step example with a an existing app? João Victor Schiavo What is your country? patkoscsaba Romania. João Victor Schiavo I'm in Brazil, I guess we are out of lucky. 😣 iAndroHacker Mine installed instant-apps services for a month ago but how do i use it?

 The election is an opportunity for Theresa May to finally tax US tech giants properly Sam Shead Jun. 11, 2017, 3:38 AM 904 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Reuters/Beck Diefenbach LONDON — The new UK minority government has a big opportunity to bring in more tax revenue without cutting welfare or ditching national infrastructure projects like HS2. It needs to address tax loopholes that allow flourishing multibillion dollar US tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook to pay very little tax on their insanely low declared UK "profits" instead of UK their much larger UK revenues. US tech firms have long used offshore offices in countries such as Ireland, Luxembourg, and The Netherlands to process their UK sales, dodging HMRC in the process. Google paid just £36.4 million in UK taxes this year despite taking over £1.03 billion in UK sales. Elsewhere, a Reuters investigation this week found that Uber is exploiting UK tax laws to avoid paying £40 million in tax every year. Then there's Apple, the world's largest tech company, which owes €18 billion (£16 million) in back taxes. Following the Uber tax revelation this week, Margaret Hodge, the former chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: "[This is] yet another example of how large companies find loopholes and use the law for a purpose for which it was never intended. "There is a failure to pay tax that should be due. That reduces the money available for public services and is unfair on Uber's competitors." Google's planned London HQ. Heatherwick Studios As US tech giants continue to use clever tax avoidance tactics, small business owners in the UK are facing soaring tax rates, with some of them struggling to survive. It's worth noting that some companies from the UK and other jurisdictions employ similar tax avoidance tactics, but US tech firms are under particular scrutiny due to the size of the sums involved.  If things continue as they are then London, the UK's economic powerhouse, could soon become a soulless city full of megacorporations in tall glass buildings that can be accessed by a tiny handful of people. There are concerns that this is already starting to happen in Shoreditch — a neighbourhood that has experienced rapid gentrification in recent years. If the UK does start asking US tech giants to pay their fair share of tax then there's a chance they'd look to scale back their business operations in the country. To mitigate the risk of this happening, the next UK government could look to offset taxes against R&D spend — something that would incentivise companies like Google and Facebook to hire more engineers in the UK.

Image: Boston Dynamics Alphabet Inc., parent company of Google, has agreed to sell Boston Dynamics and its troupe of robots to Japanese company SoftBank for an undisclosed sum. The Verge reports that the intention to sell Boston Dynamics first surfaced some time in March 2016. This was roughly two years after Android co-founder Andy Rubin left Google. Rubin had spearheaded a number of prominent robotics acquisitions during his time, including Boston Dynamics. Selling Boston Dynamics appears to be part of Alphabet’s overall restructuring and cost-saving strategy that was put into effect by company CEO Ruth Porat in 2016. ADVERTISEMENT SoftBank is a telecommunications and technology company that has a significant presence in the Japanese market. The company also dabbles in robotics technology and has produced the popular humanoid Pepper robot. The acquisition of Boston Dynamics’ robotic assets should boost Softbank’s development of robots for the commercial market and possibly find applications for the robots that Boston Dynamics have already created. “Today, there are many issues we still cannot solve by ourselves with human capabilities. Smart robotics are going to be a key driver of the next stage of the Information Revolution, and Marc and his team at Boston Dynamics are the clear technology leaders in advanced dynamic robots,” said SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son, in a statement. “I am thrilled to welcome them to the SoftBank family and look forward to supporting them as they continue to advance the field of robotics and explore applications that can help make life easier, safer, and more fulfilling.” Boston Dynamics is an engineering and robotics design company that has developed a number of cutting-edge robots such as SpotMini, Atlas, and most recently Handle.

These were Google's first smartphones. The former Nexus line-up was introduced in combination with other manufacturers, including HTC, LG, Motorola, Huawei and Asus. With the Pixel smartphones, Google showed what it's really capable of. Both are premium smartphones with high-end specs and a premium price tag. Not only are the devices provided with the latest Android software, the cameras also received the highest rating ever for a camera phone. In the meanwhile, more information is known about its successor, in the GFXBench benchmark the device is called the Google Pixel XL2. Google Pixel XL2 specs According to the benchmark info, the new Pixel XL2 features a 5.6-inch display with a Quad HD (2.560x1330 pixel) resolution. This is larger than the current screens, a 5" for the Pixel and a 5.5" for the Pixel XL. The new Google smartphone will most likely get a new design with smaller bezels, leaving a larger screen area, which will also change the aspect ratio to about 18:9, just like the LG G6 and Galaxy S8. The Google Pixel XL2 is powered by a 2.4Ghz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and an Adreno 540 graphics card. The device is equipped with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage memory. It is currently unclear whether the Google smartphone will appear in multiple memory capacities, but it will likely appear in two screen formats. Photography with the Pixel XL2 For mobile photography, the Google XL2 is equipped with a 12 megapixel main camera and a 7 megapixel front camera. Both are capable of recording 4K videos. Probably the camera application will not differ much from the current Pixel smartphones. These got a score of 89% from DxOMark, the only smartphone that achieved a higher score since then, is the HTC U11 with 90%. The Samsung S8 got a rating of 88% and the iPhone 7 86%. Gogole Pixel 2 Android 8 smartphone According to the spec sheet, the Pixel XL2 will run on the Android 7.1.1 operating system, but when it comes to market, it will most likely be equipped with the new Android O operating system. The test version has already been made available to developers, the Google XL2 smartphone will probably launch around September / October 2017.    Next  US Cellular to offer 2017 iPad Pro devices    Previous  Rugged Handheld Devices Forecast Report    News by brand:Google    News by category:Smartphones    News by brand and category:Google Smartphones Latest Google announcements Google Android O Developer Preview Levi's smart jacket by Google New Android OS to feature Bluetooth Smart HTC Nexus 9 tablet Android Bluetooth Smart Ready Google Nexus 7 Google Chrome browser update Google Nexus 4 smartphone Google Nexus 10 tablet CRM app for Nexus tablet Google Android Nexus tablet Android 4.1 Jelly Bean Ice Cream Sandwich Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich Google Nexus One   Latest news headlines BMW Formula E sponsored by Harman Kardon Best rugged and secure mobile phone US Cellular to offer 2017 iPad Pro devices Google Pixel XL2 smartphone specs Rugged Handheld Devices Forecast Report Samsung QLED monitor infographic Sprint HTC U11 premium smartphone Sprint to offer new iPad Pro tablet series Samsung QLED monitor awarded Samsung premium QLED gaming monitors Samsung Notebook 9 Pro pre-order at BestBuy Samsung Dex mobile phone docking station Apple macOS High Sierra desktop operating system Apple iMac Pro computer for professionals New Apple App Store with 24 application categories       5G Accessories Android Galaxy iPhone Rumors Premium smartphones Camera Camera test Nikon SLR Underwater photography   CES CeBIT IFA Photokina PMA

The creator of Android explains how his new phone can take on Apple and Samsung Steve Kovach Business Insider June 10, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share View photos Andy Rubin at wired business conferenceMore (Andy Rubin at the Wired Business Conference with the new Essential Phone.Getty Images for Wired) Andy Rubin is best known as the guy who created Android, sold it to Google, and nurtured it into the most popular smartphone operating system on the planet. But Rubin left Google back in 2014, and now he's on his own. His latest gig is Essential, a startup he runs as CEO that's trying to become a new kind of gadgets company. It starts with a phone, called the Essential PH-1, and the plan is to expand into smart appliances and cars from there. Rubin spoke Wednesday at the Wired Business Conference in New York and shed a bit more light on Essential's plans. After the Essential Phone launches this summer, the company plans to release Home, a voice-controlled hub for all the connected appliances in your house. Rubin claims Home will be compatible with the wide variety of smart home platforms, ranging from Apple's HomeKit to Samsung's SmartThings, even though it'd take a wild level of technical wizardy to pull it off. Many are skeptical he can pull it off. He calls this new platform Ambient OS. Beyond that, Rubin teased that he'd like Essential to tackle the car, which is increasingly coming into focus as an area of growth for tech companies. And questions remain how the Essential Phone, which costs $699, can find success in a market dominated by Apple and Samsung. Business Insider and some other members of the press spoke with Rubin following his Wired talk. Below is a transcript of that conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity. (I've labeled each journalist's question as just "Question" since so many people were in the room asking questions. I put my name on the questions I asked.) Q&A with Andy Rubin, CEO of Essential Steve Kovach: I want to talk more about Ambient OS. You were talking a lot about how you’re really confident you’re going to be able to stitch all these various platforms together. Andy Rubin: I didn’t say I was confident. I’m definitely going for it. Kovach: If I’m understanding it correctly, especially with Apple, it’s actually impossible. What they allow people to build into now doesn’t allow what you want to do. Does this thing fall apart if they say no to you? Rubin: You have to understand this approach. There’s a client and a server. And what Apple has with HomeKit is a bunch of individual consumer electronics companies enabling HomeKit with their products. I don’t know what the percentages are, but they don’t all only speak HomeKit. They speak a whole lot of other stuff as well. And what Apple is trying to do is trying to be the screen that drives these things. And that’s excluding anybody in "Android Land" or Windows from driving those things. So the natural effect will be for those companies to support other products as well, and they’re the ones that are plugging into Apple’s APIs. So the trick that I talked about on stage is: I can produce the same APIs. And I can call it Essential Kit. And those same exact APIs that someone has already developed for their Sonos thing or whatever this point product is, I’m compatible with. Kovach: But isn’t that just another product like Samsung's SmartThings? Rubin: No, no, no, no. You know what this is? This is [like] Windows emulation [on a Mac]. This is Windows emulation for IoT. APIs for all these people who are building these islands. And if I emulate eight things and turn it on, I control 100,000 devices. Kovach: And have you been able to do that yet in testing? Rubin: I haven’t launched a product. I’m teasing a product, but it’s going to be awesome. These are all forward-looking statements. Question: How far in advance are you teasing? View photos essential home hubMore (A rendering of what Essential Home will look like.Essential) Rubin: We have round LCDs — big ones. What’s after that is basically everything that’s in a smartphone. Right? There’s a bunch of cool things about starting a company today. I have a system in my lobby where I can print badges for people. There’s some startup company whose job it is to do lobby registration now. And when I used to start companies, those guys didn’t exist. But the other thing that happened, obviously, is smartphones have driven the supply base, based on the volume of the component tree of smartphones. And you’ll find those things going into a lot of products like these home assistant products. So it’s kind of a new era as far as leveraging the economies of scale of smartphones into these other products. Read More Question: So Essential Home is a touch interface. Is it also a microphone? Rubin: Yeah it has far-field speech recognition. It has an array of microphones.  Question: Is there any plan to add video chat to something like that? Rubin: Really good question. So once you do this job of bridging these islands, you kind of rise above all these other UIs, and you become a kind of holistic UI for every other product that might be in your life. So if you think of it purely from a UI perspective: Who is your UI developer? I actually thing developing for smartphones is too difficult. It’s almost like you have to go to school to learn how to be an iOS developer or learn how to be an Android developer. The good ones have four or five years of experience, and the industry is not that old. So the reason we created a new OS is to basically solve the UI problem and redefine the definition of who a developer is. I want the guy who owns the home to be a developer, in some regard. I can tell you today, there’s a $13 billion industry of Crestron or AMX or Control 4, and they’re drilling holes in your wall and installing screens in your home. That’s an outdated approach. But the guys that are doing the UIs for those are the same guys that are drilling the holes in your wall. There’s this whole installer thing with these high-end homes which is not a mass-market consumer value proposition. So I need to change who the installer is. And I think we’ve built enough technology for a consumer to kind of do a drag and drop. Question: There’s this argument that’s been out there that innovation in smartphones has peaked, that they’ve already gotten so good and can do so many things. Where do you see things going? Where does it go from here? View photos essential ph-1 colorsMore (The Essential Phone.Essential) Rubin: When there’s this duopoly with these two guys owning 40% of the market, this complacency sets in where people are like, “Oh what they’re building is good enough. I’ll just go to them.” And that’s the perfect time to start a company like this, when people are complacent and it needs to be disrupted. And the real answer is you guys and the consumers need to tell me if there’s enough new innovation in [the Essential Phone]. I think the 360 camera and the magnetic accessory bus is a pretty good example of the innovation we’re thinking about. And there’s gonna be a string of those things. Let me broadly position this: In the era where smartphones were new and everyone was upgrading from their feature phone to their smartphone for the first time, the product cycle was every six months. There’d be some new thing coming out, everyone’s excited, there was a bubble kind of feeling that you were involved in something completely new and exciting. And then once everybody who wanted a smartphone got one, we’re in a saturated market — at least in the first world. In saturated markets, the upgrade cycle is every 24 months. And the problem with the 24-month cycle, which happens to snap to the carriers’ [ownership] of the consumer, is the consumer doesn’t get to see the innovation. It’s still happening in the background, but it happens every 24 months in these very lumpy onstage announcements. I think there’s a way, and the reason we built this magnetic connector to continuously produce innovation and show it to the consumer happening in real time. It’s almost like software updates for hardware. View photos Andy Rubin at wired business conferenceMore (Rubin and his Essential Phone.Getty Images for Wired) Question: Explain how the Essential Phone is different from a modular phone. From the consumer point of view, it’s, “I’m getting this phone and I can snap a camera on and I can snap on a better battery.” Does it matter if it’s magnetic or not? Rubin: That’s a good question. It’s two things. It’s kind of the core to the way we designed this from a product design perspective. The first one is what’s “modular.” [Google] Ara was the definition of modular, which is you can remove a core component of the phone, like its processor, and replace it with a faster one. We’re not doing that. You buy a phone, the phone works great as a phone. We’re adding stuff onto it. So that’s why I prefer accessory bus as an example. So that’s modular versus accessory. Now, connectors, in my view, are dumb because they get outdated. So a wireless connector is the holy grail. We’re close to that. We transmit power between two pins and everything else is wireless. Actually, the technology we’re using is wireless USB 3.0. So it’s 10 gigabits a second of USB, and we’ve built these transceivers that do that. The benefit of having a connectorless connector is I don’t suffer from what Moto Mod suffered from, which is every phone they come out with in the future has to have that 33-pin connector in exactly the same location so all the accessories you’ve invested in as a consumer still work. So they’ve painted themselves in the corner. They can never change the industrial design of their next phone because it has to match all these accessories. Or they have to trick the consumer into throwing away all their accessories and getting the new one that fits this new thing. A completely wireless thing means I can come out with a phone that’s invisible. And as long as it has this magnetic area on it I can use this legacy of accessories that I’ve purchased. Again, this is a pro-consumer brand. It’s not easy to articulate. We’re trying to do right by the consumer where they don’t have to throw away their stuff every time there’s a connector change. Or get some weird dongle. True story, I went and bought one of those beautiful new MacBooks with the OLED TouchBar. And that’s when they changed to the USB-C thing. And in the IT department in my company I needed to plug in to the Ethernet to get the certificate for the new laptop, and I went to the Apple store and I said, “Do you have a USB-C to ethernet dongle?” And they said, “Oh no we don’t have that yet.” So I had to buy a USB-C to Thunderbolt dongle, and a Thunderbolt to Ethernet dongle. So I had two dongles plugged into each other. And that’s the point where I’m just not feeling too good about being a consumer of those products. Question: Based on the conversations you had today and at the Code Conference, Essential is much more than just a phone company. How do you find that your brand is going to track these consumers? Rubin: It’s anti-walled garden. We chose Android because that’s a big component of that. We have a team of engineers, a lot of them, doing the job of other people to make our products work with theirs. These other companies, especially the walled gardens, they’re sitting here with their ecosystem and they expect people to come to them. And they get to be the toll gate guys and say “yes” or “no.” So we’re actively going out and making our products work with other people’s products because we know that’s how our consumers want to live. Kovach: You spoke a lot on stage today about home and the car as major new platforms, but you didn't mention AR. Rubin: There’s baby steps into AR, and then there’s all-in. Scoble’s all-in is the shower picture… so the glasses might come later. Cellphones have had augmented reality for a long time… What the real question is: 'What is the end product?' What is the developer going to build with augmented reality? And so far I’ve seen interactive media… movies and game-like movies, where you’re both a participant and a viewer, which I think is a little too mixed reality for me. There’s a lean back where you’re a consumer of this stuff and it happens, or you’re a participant like a game. The mixed part of it hasn’t been proven yet. I think when consumers are ready to wear things, whether it’s a motorcycle helmet that overlays a map… or if it’s some goggles that they’ll use for a board game… in the end for these big things I think… One of the problems is the price. It’s just crazy. It’s not ready for prime time. There will be a day where you might have a head mounted display and it costs $199, and you just plug it into your cellphone. And it won’t be 'I’m wearing this 24 hours a day.' It’ll be, 'It’s time to sit down and play Monopoly with the family or something.' It actually might be more social than what you would do with VR. Question: Is that why you started the 360 camera? Because it’s a taste of that? Rubin: This is all speculation, but I’m hoping there’s going to be a format change in the future. I think I can kind of move the needle a little bit in that format change by taking the world’s largest mass-market product and adding something onto it, rather than trying to create something completely new. So it’s more of a slipstream approach.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 11 June 2017 | MYT 12:00 PM Apple product updates you missed at the WWDC Apple demonstrates the new Macintosh operating system macOS High Sierra at the WWDC 2017 developers conference in San Jose. — dpa Most of the excitement after Apple's WWDC summit came from the launch of the HomePod, a louder, fatter and pricier version of smart speakers already on the market.  But the Cupertino-based company is doing far more than just copying Amazon and Google hardware, as an overview of developments announced at the conference shows. Apple watch powered by Siri Just like Google does at its events, Apple sought to use its developer conference to highlight the leaps it has made in artificial intelligence and autonomous learning. Among the products to profit from better AI is the Apple Watch, which is getting more proactive with the information it displays thanks to a new Siri-powered watch face. Siri is also being upgraded with natural language to help it adjust to the individual user. At the same time the data will be secured and can only be called up by the devices used by a particular user, Apple executive Craig Federighi said. VR and better hardware for the iMac For the first time, Apple's iMac computer is being made compatible with virtual reality. Hollywood special effects studio ILM demonstrated how a user wearing special glasses can dive into a VR scene from the Star Wars universe on an iMac desktop. At the same time, Apple has updated the entire range of MacBook notebooks and iMacs with more rapid Intel processors and improved graphics. For those users demanding particularly high-performance computer - video professionals for example – there will be an iMac Pro at the end of the year, said to be "the fastest Mac to date." The company has recently faced criticism that it has neglected professional users, as the model aimed at this market segment – the Computer Mac Pro – has not been updated since 2013. Make payments to Apple users on a new iPad Pro For the iPad tablet there will be a new Pro model with a 10.5in screen, up from the current 9.7in. The iPad version of the iOS mobile system will be upgraded with a number of new functions, for example easy moving of contents and files between apps using drag-and-drop. Text written by hand with the Apple Pencil will be searchable, using machine learning for the user's handwriting. The notes app will get a scanner for documents that can then be changed using the pencil. Meanwhile the iOS photo app is also being improved with new effects backed up by learning capacity. And, as expected, Amazon's video streaming service will be on the Apple TV digital media player. Apple says it will begin setting up obstacles to the online advertizing sector in two ways: Apple's web browser can block the automatic launch of videos, and tracking can be blocked when the user gets the feeling that an advert on a particular theme is following them to all websites. Finally, Apple users can soon delete the PayPal app from their iOS. Apple Pay will enable payments between users, effectively challenging PayPal and other competitors. — dpa Related Stories You May Be Interested Apple product updates you missed at the WWDC Stepping to a great future Breath of fresh air: 4 ways to improve air quality at home 10 last-minute IKEA styling tips for Raya Reasons why mums are our heroes 6 places you must visit in your lifetime Others Also Read Khan takes three wickets but Windies beat Afghanistan Sarawak withdraws rep from Malaysia Tourism Board Ride for Team Malaysia advertisement Latest News Nissan's X-Trail goes semi-autonomous Super Nintendo World theme park concept seen in new trailer E3 2017: Devolver Digital June 12 – how to watch and what to expect Ultra Street Fighter 2: Fighting for relevance Moto G5 Plus: The G force Most Viewed in Tech E3 2017: Devolver Digital June 12 – how to watch and what to expect Nissan's X-Trail goes semi-autonomous Ultra Street Fighter 2: Fighting for relevance Super Nintendo World theme park concept seen in new trailer Moto G5 Plus: The G force Android 7 Nougat for just US$100: Lenovo's new Moto C smartphone OnePlus 5 launches June 20, pop-up events in several cities Sweden beckons for investors seeking to bet on next Candy Crush Facebook’s Detroit status: Feeling determined to build auto ties Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

A follow-up to the rather successful smartphone, the next Pixel has the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the upcoming iPhone 8 to beat, and if we’re to believe the latest leaks, it is poised to be a serious contender against the top smartphone brands in looks and in specs. Google Pixel 2 To Adopt The Galaxy S8’s Infinity Display A Google Pixel 2 variant has been spotted on a benchmarking website, revealing its major specs. To quickly summarize, we’re looking at a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC and 4GB RAM combination plus a 12-megapixel camera out back and 7-megapixel camera at the front; both have 4K video recording. The specs are mostly in line with the rumors so far, but that’s not the main discovery here. According to BGR, you can make out the aspect ratio given the resolution and the size of the screen. This means that the Google Pixel XL 2 has an aspect ratio of almost 2:1, which is about the same as the LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8. With that, we can surmise that Google is almost certainly going for a bezel-less look. As there is no physical home button on the original Pixel, its bezels will likely just be trimmed down. Here’s what it can look like based on a fan-made render. “Google Pixel 2 Image Leaked” Oh dear.. that’s my concept. There's even my nickname under the date. Original https://t.co/rqOMRHTIXC pic.twitter.com/QXWizAyIZt — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) June 8, 2017 It also looks like the Google Pixel 2 is to retain the dimensions of its predecessors. Although the GFXBench website shows a 2,560 x 1,312 resolution and 5.6 inches of screen, it did not add in the navigation bar. If you take that into account, the resolution amounts to 2,560 x 1,440 pixels and the screen might be at 5.7 inches, GSM Arena reported. This hints that the Google Pixel XL 2 will almost be the same size as its predecessor despite having a bigger screen, thanks to smaller bezels. We can pretty much expect the other variants to be the same. Pixel 2 Variant To Have New Qualcomm Processor? The latest development in the mobile industry is that Qualcomm has a slightly improved chip that it is yet to be announced. The Snapdragon 835 SoC was just introduced by the Galaxy S8, but the Note 8 is already taking the next step by using a Snapdragon 836 processor instead, the Inquisitr reports. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 836 chip, which has an octa-core 2.5GHz processor, is a slightly improved version of SD835, which has 2.45GHz. It’s a very small boost in performance, but the Galaxy Note 8 will need every bit of power it can get. Google Pixel XL 2 has been spotted at GFXBench – https://t.co/JXtfkACiZS pic.twitter.com/BBHLTHG2g6 — Rizwan (@rizwansh) June 10, 2017 The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 will be the device to introduce the new chip, but Google Pixel 2 will come a bit later packed with the refreshed version. As we have seen a Snapdragon 835 SoC in the benchmark result above and the ones preceding that, we might only get to see the refreshed version on one variant of the Android smartphone, more likely in the bigger model. But it is also possible that the prototypes being tested at the time will be equipped with the newest chip later on. After all, there are still about four months before the expected debut of the three Google Pixel 2 variants, so some specs may change. As of the moment, the Google Pixel 2 is looking great inside and out, based on the leaks and rumors floating around. With a dual-camera set-up and solid specs, there is not much the smartphone can do more to be another success. Waterproofing and longer battery life can be worked out and we hope Google does. Google Pixel 2 might be the Android smartphone to beat this year, if only it can convince the Samsung-dominated market.

And unless it’s a newer model with recent software updates, your security could be at risk. Two competing operating systems own the real estate in our smart phones: Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. Apple’s phones are expensive — the cheapest model starts at $400, while some Android phones cost less than $50. Android users are more likely to have fragmented security updates than Apple’s streamlined ones. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The closed system Apple has built means that everyone who has an iOS device gets access to the same software and security updates at about the same time. Android, though, is much more fragmented. Mary Madden, a researcher with Data & Society, says low income people are more reliant on their phones as the primary form of Internet access. This is how they pay bills, connect with friends and family, and access education and work opportunities. “All of these differences in digital security are important because they can result in disproportionate levels of surveillance such as law enforcement monitoring during protests or a greater likelihood that low-income smartphone users will experience malware attacks,” Madden told CNNTech. More malware is written for Androids than iPhones. On top of that, almost half of the top 50 Android devices didn't have the most recent security updates by the end of 2016, according to Google. Even if your phone is only a year or two out of date, it’s vulnerable to some very simple hacks, says Nathan Freitas, a fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society. “It doesn’t take much for your adversary to get into your [Android] device, and that's a big problem.” When Google releases an update to Android, it takes a while to get to consumers, unless you have a Google-branded phone like the Pixel. Carriers and device makers customize Android with different apps and services, and there are at least 11 different versions of Android. Each customized version has to be updated separately by the carrier or device maker before rolling out to consumers. Google, for its part, is constantly working to improve device security. Recently, it introduced Google Play Protect, which monitors Android devices and alerts you if there are security risks. And its line of inexpensive laptops — Chromebooks — are regarded by experts as some of the most secure computers you can buy. Last year, the FCC and FTC launched an inquiry into mobile security updates, and asked mobile carriers and device manufacturers to explain the process of releasing security updates. The results have not been released, however the FCC told CNN Tech that they have received responses and are reviewing results. Android is slightly more popular in the United States than iOS, with 53 percent of smart phone users on Google’s operating system, compared with 45 percent on Apple. Globally, Android is significantly more popular — almost 90 percent of phones shipped in the third quarter of 2016 ran Android. But the demographics break out even further: College-educated people tend to buy iPhones over Androids; Androids are more popular with low-income Americans; and African-Americans are more likely to have an Android than an iPhone. This gap between the security haves and have nots is often called the “digital security divide,” which researcher Chris Soghoian described in a 2016 Ted Talk. And the security differences between Android and iOS are also a problem for developers. People who build apps — especially those with secure functionality — have to build multiple versions for Android and potentially decide not to support outdated phones. Beyond security updates, there are other differences between the brands, such as Apple’s default messenger is iMessage, which is encrypted when you chat with other iOS users. Texting on Android isn’t encrypted by default, and full-disk encryption isn’t mandatory on all Android phones.

Google is developing an OS called “Fuchsia,” runs on All the Things Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2016/08/12 2:37pm PDTAug 12, 2016 332 Plus 1 on G+ 2902 Share on Facebook 19 Share on Twitter Total Shares3253 Development News Every single operating system developed by Google to date has one thing in common: they're based on the Linux kernel. Chrome OS, Android, Chromecasts, you name it. Linux has powered Google hardware for years. However, the Linux kernel is not ideal for every situation. Especially in the case of embedded devices like car dashboards or GPS units, full-blown desktop kernels like Linux impact performance and cause other issues. There’s a massive ecosystem of operating systems designed for embedded hardware, and Google may be working on their own. Enter “Fuchsia.” Google’s own description for it on the project’s GitHub page is simply, “Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System)”. Not very revealing, is it? When you begin to dig deeper into Fuchsia’s documentation, everything starts to make a little more sense. First, there’s the Magenta kernel based on the ‘LittleKernel’ project. Just like with Linux and Android, the Magenta kernel powers the larger Fuchsia operating system. Magenta is being designed as a competitor to commercial embedded OSes, such as FreeRTOS or ThreadX. However, Magenta is designed to scale much better, enabling Magenta to work on embedded devices, smartphones, and desktop computers. For this to happen, Magenta improves upon its LittleKernel base by adding first class user-mode support (a necessity for user accounts) and a capability-based security model (which would enable something like Android 6.0’s permissions to work). But that’s just the kernel; what about the rest of the OS? It looks like Google is using Flutter for the user interface, as well as Dart as the primary programming language. The icing on the cake is Escher, a renderer that supports light diffusion, soft shadows, and other visual effects, with OpenGL or Vulkan under the hood. Shadows and subtle color reflections are a key component of Material Design, so it seems Flutter and Escher could be designed for the Material Design UI in mind. We know it has support for both 32-bit and 64-bit ARM CPUs, as well as 64-bit PCs. If you have the technical prowess, you can even compile it yourself and run it on a real PC or a virtual machine. Travis Geiselbrecht from Google also confirmed it will soon be available for the Raspberry Pi 3. So, why? Why is Google quietly developing a brand new OS and kernel, with support for smartphones and PCs, possibly built with Material Design in mind? The most obvious guess, and the most exciting, is that Google hopes to one day replace Chrome OS and Android with Fuchsia. But perhaps Google will treat Fuchsia like Samsung treats Tizen OS; a lightweight OS used on hardware not suited for full-blown Android. Google’s collection of embedded hardware, such as the OnHub router and Google Home, is growing. Perhaps Fuchsia is only being developed for devices like these? But there is always the possibility that this is simply a Google experiment, and may never see the light of day in a commercial product. Developing an entire kernel and operating system is a massive task, and Google currently seems content to continue using Android, Chrome OS, and their derivatives for their hardware offerings. We shall have to wait and see. Source: Fuchsia repository, Hacker News Tags dart Flutter Fuchsia Google kernel magenta os subscribe ...

Corbin Davenport Well, the name isn't a rumor (although it could be a codename). Now whether or not Fuchsia will actually be relevant at some point is another question. Nkansah Rexford Nothing to lose, except a few bucks now, compared to if it actually becomes something. At that point, DT will tell you, "Huuuuuuge returns on investment, huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge!" Dallas King Either crazy or smart... MeCampbell30 It's crazy because even if Fuchia is real, it's a code name. teolinux Registering FuchsiaPolice is not smart.

Đức Thành Fuchdapolice.com? I'll see myself out. mark "Police for fuchsia", says Google. teolinux Pure genius Neel Gupta No need to Panic... Fuchsia is probably an IoT OS (Internet of Things Operating System) teolinux IoTRTOS (Internet of Things Realt Time OS) ;) Blac Chyna instagram First, there’s the Magenta kernel based on the ‘LittleKernel’ project. Just like with Linux and Android, the Magenta kernel powers the larger Fuchsia operating system. Magenta is being designed as a competitor to commercial embedded OSes, such as FreeRTOS or ThreadX. JSo Hmmm... Franco Rossel I thought Linux was perfect for embedded, considering how many embedded devices already use it without problem. charfarstar Ikr, instead blame Java framework and apps for sucking up the system resources. philosopher_Mk It is and most embedded devices use Linux kernel. But the author on AP is new and we can forgive him. OnlyMe999 The android kernel is very large which increases storage costs for memory chips in things like washing machines etc. hp-fourtwenty A $5 nand chip in a $600 washing machine will be the least of consumers' worries...now a $20 applianve like a toaster, blender, etc on the other hand....that, I will agree with you about. Danny Colin Maybe they want to get ride of GPL license. LittleKernel is licensed under MIT license. Liam Spradlin I'm keeping my hopes low on this for now - Google starts/plays with lots of OSS projects that sometimes don't end up with anything consumer facing. Still, if we do get to see something out of this I'll be excited to see what it is. Soraya Xel The fact that they're going right for some consumer grade devices is very interesting though. Their security model is fantastic, should be drastically safer to use than Android. But of course, from what I could see, there's almost nothing yet in terms of user-facing material yet. They're still working on the super low level code right now. PI I remember one when they showcased 120fps apps for android using Dart , That never took off teolinux Google is huge. Their money is huge. That said, reproducing the complexity of the Linux codebase I think it's too much even for them. And even if they embark in rewriting a new OS, they fund it properly, they threat all OEMs to write drivers for everything... how much time will it take? And how much time before it gets stable? That said, I'm enthusiast about it , if they're serious in going down the road of writing an OS based on modern technology, ditching all the old cruft, legacy and clutter that piled in since the late 70s. But the Wayland project , which is just a graphic server meant to ditch the legacy an cumbersomeness of Xorg, has been under development for 7 years, and still is adopted by no one. Travis Brolund There's a subdirectory called magenta, wonder if T-Mobile is gonna sue... Soraya Xel That's not even a minor directory. Magenta is Fuchsia's kernel. Ethan Campbell And the Google music ai project is named magenta. rockstarr27 Dart is the main programming language? I'll pass. Don't need an OS built on javascript variant. Pez Smith My thought exactly. Should keep at C ... if must C++11 or newer. rockstarr27 Or even make an objective C variant with more C like syntax and call it a day, oh well. Surprised the first response wasn't someone vehemently defending javascript telling me how great it is :). Nope.jpeg Flutter depends on dart, and there aren't many dart libraries. PerhapsNever Dart isn't a JS variant though. It can be compiled down to JS, but it's not built from JS at all. joe hentoesch dart is a decent programming language that you can compile to javascript. if you call it a javascript variant, you can also call java a javascript variant, because you can also compile java to javascript. Raymond Berger Did anyone else notice that this is a new writer that published this article? Hi Corbin! Eumelanin Knight I noticed that as well Hello to the Newbie Corbin Davenport Hello! :D Raymond Berger Should be expecting a post soon about yourself and how you landed a gig at AP? I checked out your blog and it looks like you've worked on some pretty cool stuff. Corbin Davenport Nothing special really, AP was looking for contributors and I applied. That's about it :P MatchstickMan Now expand that into a 1000 word article. By tomorrow. Liam Spradlin Tomorrow? Deadline's in an hour! Corbin Davenport I DIDN'T STUDY FOR THE TEST MeCampbell30 Well, you've definitely got the Android Police writing style down. ReverseCold I remember your name from somewhere... Powered by Redstone? Corbin Davenport Yep, although now it's called redstonecentral.com. mustbepbs Let's see if you can spot Margenta in the article without CTRL F 😉 ConCal Yeah good write up! Really clear and easy to follow. Corbin Davenport Thanks! Darth Vader Hi Corbin. I'm here to offer you a trip to The Death Star and explore the nature of The Force with me. teolinux I must use this pickup line in Tinder crutchcorn Hi! Oup, wait... Not me... It's never me Julian Coronado *fanboy jab at Google saying that they can't focus on one product such as Hangouts instead creating ANOTHER option* /s PerhapsNever To be honest, I'd be OK with another option. With Win10 Mobile not really having any traction, we are stuck with just Android and iOS. Personally, I love Android, but I would always love to see what another Google OS could do; If nothing else than to just change things up. Andy J While I agree in principle.... I'm starting to think Google has ADHD, it would be fine if they continued to develop Android in tandem with this new OS, but they seem incapable of that - they think of a new "ooo shiny" and everything else stops. Nkansah Rexford Google once behaved like a kid (everything thing they see, love it). Google grew, and became reasonable and wise. Of late, Google is growing old age, and going back to their kiddish ways! It is a curve, I'm sorry but that is nature! Andy J Well... Alzheimer's would certainly explain the messaging situation - so you may well be on to something. PerhapsNever They've always had that issue though. Alphabet should really create a TRUE incubator company and do all of these types of projects under that and not under the main Google brand. Arcest Yeah, a modern operating system like that should be able to run Windows+Linux+imacOS+OS+Android apps. Can't wait for it Corbin Davenport I wouldn't quite go that far, but considering the Android compatibility layer in Chrome OS, Android app support might be possible. vyktorjonas People on Reddit were excited talking about how this could be the solution to Android's fragmentation problem, idk anything else but I'm excited nonetheless pfmiller I don't see how this has anything to do with Android fragmentation. Jay T One of the major issues with updating Android devices is that the kernel and the drivers are all mixed together and then compiled. That's one reason Google can't update other manufacturers devices. When you look at how Windows handles it, at least on the desktop, you have the kernel, and then the device drivers are separate, which allows independence with updating. It's true this isn't a magical fix for the issue of fragmentation, bit it could be a step in the right direction. h4rr4r No, just no. The reason that does not work on mobile is there is no PCI. You have no way of knowing what drivers to load during boot. ilmaisin Nonsense, there is nothing that would prevent standardizing the boot sequence on mobile devices. h4rr4r Sure there is, it doesn't work that way. Ypu go convince ARM. Andy J They have already developed a system that allows them to update the base OS and Kernel independently of what is placed on top of that - that;s how Project Brillo works for IoT devices - Google can directly address security flaws in the core OS on live devices in the field without affecting the OEM stuff running on top of that (this is also the first Android based project to use the 2 partition system so the idle system can be upgraded and will be loaded at the next reboot after which the previous boot partition is patched from the updated now-live partition so they stay in sync). I see the boot system on Android N as a step in the right direction - at least part of the Brillo boot system is being used, and we can still hope the next step is to move the OEM stuff to the next layer up allowing Google to update the base OS and Kernel without OEM interference. deltatux The problem is that with Linux but the approach they took for drivers. Unlike say desktop Linux or Windows, they took the embedded approach in the design. What this means is that there's no abstraction layer for the drivers in kernel space. The reason why Android devices always use older kernel trees are as a result of this. Unlike the desktop, we can't use the generic kernel because of the embedded model used. This however won't really solve the Android fragmentation problem, it will only solve the issue about being so far behind on Linux versions. Android fragmentation is always going to be an OEM/carrier problem. Vitor Mikaelson On Phone, Windows also does the same thing. EarlyMon Kernel and drivers mixed together and then compiled - said no developer ever. Zero of that has anything to do with why Google can't update other devices - and it's gobbledygook. vyktorjonas would reddit lie? Lateef Alabi-Oki Linux is more than perfect for embedded devices. It's probably the most used OS for embedded devices outside QNX. You can strip it down to a couple of kilo bytes. David Saintloth yeah ....google is kind of doing a microsoft in some ways by reinventing stuff that they can't possibly make *much* better. To think in a year or two of dev. time they can performance match linux refined in open source fire for the last 20...is super hubris. David Lmao what?? Linux is a horrible OS, filled with flaws and security holes that have been around for years. Even Linus admits this and says he's not going to bother fixing them. Google doing this would be the best move, ditching a flaw, buggy OS and moving toward a closed sorce OS which hsould also fix this fragmentation BS and be much more lightwieght and battery friendly. Face it anroid SUCKS and it just keeps getting worse (not like there's many better options) and making a closed source OS would probably fix 90% of android issues. Lateef Alabi-Oki Closed source products are inherently less secure than open source products because they cannot be publicly and independently audited. jodieisme Yes, it is a mess, but it's a beautiful mess, so much as it enjoys widespread popularity with hardware OEMs. Linux is a heavyweight in all areas except for desktop. It's so popular that now even Microsoft has developed a Linux-based operating system for networking on Azure. Let’s not forget that the share of Linux machines has increased from 25% to roughly 33% on Azure. So, Linux is spreading its wings even on Microsoft's own turf. Supercomputers of the world run on Linux, your routers, printers, Comcast X1, Tesla, pretty much everything runs on Linux. JP If it is for devices other than IoT you better believe they're going to be the only ones managing the OS updates. They've learned from their failures in Android. It's much easier to start off with restrictions and slowly lift them rather than try to make make major changes down the line after things are established. h4rr4r Linux runs on a lot of embedded systems. I don't see thia going anywhere. Soraya Xel Given how much AP editors and authors dislike me... Never thought I'd see the day where a comment I posted was referenced as a source! You're welcome, Android fannerds. I helped. (Basically, I was in their IRC channel before they realized it was publicly known about.) And Android still sucks. Soraya Xel Also, I'm actually excited about this, the security model is vastly superior to Android's. Capability-based security is awesome. Andy J Because.... [email protected] was such an amazing success and we constantly see articles daily about the amazing success of Project Brillo and Project Weave (I mean Google IO16 was jam packed with sessions about this revolutionary technology) .... I feel like Android could probably do with a new messaging client while you are at it Google..... person They had a separate dev conference for iot Andy J yup.... but Brillo was announced last year, it's a year later - where is it? Where are the shipping products that Google claimed partners would be shipping by the end of the year? Is this a scrap everything and start again approach to IoT or is this is going to be a second platform that Google will develop for IoT which will compete with Brillo. -Matoro Zeliph- It's nice Google's dev team is trying new projects, even if they're not going to get a lot of traffic behind it. MastermindDrew Not familiar with Little Kernel.

Which was a OS which ended development after 1 year.. JG Why is Google quietly developing a brand new OS and kernel, with support for smartphones and PCs, possibly built with Material Design in mind? Because Google is known for not duplicating services (cough Hangouts, Messenger, Spaces, Allo /cough)... deltatux Ummm, I don't think the article author realize that Linux does and can work in embedded settings. RTOS Linux does exist and is part and parcel to the Linux project overall. You can compile a real time Linux kernel with the existing sources. My guess is Google not wanting to be dependent on Linux and its GPLv2 licensing. Some people love GPL and others hate it (ask the BSD people). They might want to add features that they want but can't due to licensing conflicts (like the issue for native ZFS support for desktops/servers). Danny Colin I think you are right. LittleKernel is under MIT license. Plus, Dart is under BSD license. They're both permissive license compared to GPL that is copyleft license. Lord Argyris I've been playing too much Pokemon GO, as the first thing I thought when I saw that logo was that it looks like a Lisa Frank-colored Vileplume. TylerChappell Omfg I wasn't the only one! Rami Maybe they want a brand new OS that is going to be used on Android, with different API than Java, to stay far away from Oracle's API. SmilerOnline Pink + Purple = Kernel. Maybe this is just a side project for the team to work on a new kernel before Android gets a native desktop experience in 2017. They may just want to have a little more control over all layers of Android before pitting it against the big boys in the desktop space :) so a native Google kernel may be on the cards for 2017. This could potentially provide better control over kernel related security issues which will be good for the Android for Work project!. JG If you have the technical prowess, you can even compile it yourself and run it on a real PC or a virtual machine. Anyone try it yet? Maybe make a bootable iso for the rest of us to give it a go in a virtual box? Сергей Бугаев Linux is in no way a desktop kernel that negatively impacts performance, quite the contrary: it's highly scalable and very performant. It's the main thing used in both embedded systems and supercomputers, that's how scalable it is. Oh, and also in smartphones, as we happen to know. David Chan What about Brillo OS and Weave?

Google wants to make it easy for carriers to have interoperable RCS messaging Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/07 2:18pm PDTJun 7, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 179 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares272 Carriers Google News Last week Sprint and Rogers announced that users sending messages between the two carriers will be able to make use of RCS. RCS, of course, is the new standard to replace SMS that Google committed to back in 2015. So far each carrier seems to have its own idea for how RCS should work. But Google's recent work in cross-carrier communication is a big step towards ubiquity, and thanks to the tech behind this latest interconnect other carriers can more easily get in on the RCS action. We are deploying a "hub" model, so that carriers can interconnect to the hub once to get access to all other carriers connected to the hub. — Nick Fox (@RealNickFox) June 5, 2017 Google's Nick Fox followed up his announcement on the 1st with an answer to a question posed by our own Artem about how Google's RCS interconnect works. Instead of requiring that carriers individually connect their networks in some capacity to one another to exchange RCS messages, the RCS standards used by Google and the GSMA make use of a hub-style interconnect. The Jibe hub will interconnect with any Universal Profile compliant network, including in-network IMS, other hosted providers and other hubs — Nick Fox (@RealNickFox) June 10, 2017 Google's hub-based implementation of RCS in the recent cross-carrier announcement isn't a new technology, but it is cool. Back in 2013, the GSM Association published a white paper that detailed how RCS could work — and it's very much worth a read if you are even mildly interested in the future of carrier messaging, RCS, or even just networking. The white paper showed a few different methods for RCS implementation, such as using a direct NNI (Network-Network Interface) decentralized network for each carrier interconnection. Unfortunately, that particular solution results in a quickly rising number of interconnects as the number of carriers increases (n(n - 1) / 2), which means for each additional carrier in the network a larger investment needs to be made by those in it. The white paper also talked about a hub model for RCS, which has clear advantages for carriers. Rather than be burdened with developing their own connections to other carriers, each needs only connect to the one central hub presumably provided by Google. But, this centralized system will likely suffer from the same sort of weaknesses that all centralized systems do. For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. A central network is also more susceptible to censorship, attacks, or interference. However, it also provides some advantages, such as decreasing the investment of time and resources for carriers joining the standard. The hub system proposed in the white paper (based on Openmind Networks implementation for SMS/MMS) does have drawbacks, but fewer connections might end up meaning faster deployment. And since Google has already done the work bringing the hub network up for Sprint and Rogers, each additional carrier should only responsible for its connection to that hub, as opposed to managing every link to every other RCS carrier themselves. 4 node interconnect vs 36 Perhaps the recent news might help other carriers be persuaded to adopt Google's version of RCS, if for no other reason than cost-cutting. Why manage a ton of different networks for RCS when they can let Google cough up the cash for infrastructure? After all, if there's one thing carriers love, it's money.

Release 2 of the RCS universal profile which is to contain the needed information for third-party apps (Like Textra) to utilize RCS features will be released very soon. http://i.imgur.com/HLbSwcy.jpg https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit Ryne Hager The beauty of that document makes me feel bad about my Google Docs skills. Jayson Stephenson Trust me, it wasn't anywhere that great to begin with. I really learned a lot with this doc and the amazing features/flexibility that G-Drive has. Snowsky Mountain Does this mean I can use third-party apps like the SMS Backup & Restore app to backup and restore RCS messages? Jayson Stephenson Yes, but even better. RCS Messages are by default synced to your carriers cloud infrastructure. So if you were to change phones/tablets your messages will be in sync with whatever device you use. Snowsky Mountain Where would I go to turn off/on that syncing of messages? Would it be from a messaging app, like the Android Messages app? Or would it be through my carrier? Also, I wonder what (if any) effect that would have on T-Mobile's DIGITS service, which appears to do something similar for SMS/MMS messages... Jayson Stephenson I'm not 100% yet. But I believe your answer might be on what Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en Andy J As the idea is that you could send and receive SMS, MMS and RCS messages (the spec calls xMS and RCS) from any other device connected to your account - like a tablet or any web browser anywhere - then I would image you would need to turn this off via your carrier not via an app. Snowsky Mountain That makes sense. Thanks! :) MJ I have no interest in my carrier storing my messages. No thanks... I hope this can be turned off. Jayson Stephenson I'm sure a lot of people will agree with you. As I mentioned to Snowsky, I believe the option for that will be on whatever Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en Latheryin There goes your privacy. Dmitri Smirnov There was never any to begin with in the SMS world. Latheryin That completely is a matter of the country to live in. Dmitri Smirnov SS7 vulnerabilities prove, that lack of privacy transcends borders :) Also, there is nothing preventing your carrier to store the SMS "for technical reasons" regardless of a country. At any rate, while RCS might be a weird attempt to catch up with the messenger market, it is definitely not worse than the SMS. Latheryin Acutally there is. At least in the states. There are laws that prevent them from being more then a pass through. As for the messaging market. That also depends on the country you live in. Data messengers are bigger in developing countries then they are say in the states. A perfect example is that 3% of the US population even use a messaging app as their primary. SMS or just flat out calling is the preffered. David Ruddock Cool doc, but Verizon and AT&T are both signatories on the RCS Universal Profile. That doesn't compel them to do anything, but it seems unlikely they'd sign if they didn't intend to be compatible with the universal profile at some point, which is what Google Jibe is based on. Jayson Stephenson It doesn't say anywhere they they ever will implement it. In fact I expect they won't for a long time. All it mentions is their RCS is a proprietary format meaning it will work on only their internal networks. Also check out my comment on AT&T. newtonfb ATT showed a demo of it at MWC(I see that you made that comment on the doc, you should include the twitter picture also). I dont see why ATT and Tmobile will not have the UP out by the end of the year. Verizon is a different story as they have not showed or said anything about it. Jayson Stephenson The doc is open source. ;) Latheryin Yes attached showed it but it plans on placing it on top of their SMS setup not as a replacement. wicketr I think what he's saying is that "yes, it's proprietary now, but they planning on having UP with an unconfirmed launch date". The same is true for most of these. T-Mobile's is currently proprietary, but has been rumored to be UP completed by the end of the year. But it's undetermined if it's going to use Google's hub, or implement the RCS UP using Samsung's infratructure across the boards. Jayson Stephenson Yes, sorry for the confusion. I will see if I can design it any better. But so far the only carrier which we know guaranteed is in the process of installing the UP is T-Mobile. Which is mentioned in the doc. Tom Erlandsen Calling it now, I bet Allo gets RCS support fairly soon after this release Joshua Why? Android Messages - which has RCS - is made by Google. They could have implemented RCS into Allo this whole time. Tom Erlandsen Because Google wants Allo to succeed, and the absolute best way they can do that is by having some kind of carrier messaging fallback. They're not going to do SMS fallback, the Allo lead has come out and said that before. But they've never said they won't do RCS fallback. And the fact that Android Messages has RCS support means absolutely nothing. Google is infamous for its A/B tests, so it's hardly a stretch to imagine them having two apps with RCS support. If Allo with RCS fallback proves very popular and successful, I could imagine them discontinuing Android Messages and making Allo with RCS the default messaging app on Android, requiring OEMs to bundle it with their devices. But I only think they'll do that if Allo proves to be a success, as otherwise they'll face massive OEM backlash Joshua They wont discontinue Android Messages because here in Canada where RCS has been out for months, carriers have said in 2018 Android Messages is shipping with all of their devices. Tom Erlandsen Like I said, I don't think they'd discontinue Android Messages unless Allo was poised to take its place (i.e. had a decent userbase). And that would take a while to happen, even with RCS support. So yeah Android Messages will probably stay for a while, until Google has something it feels would make a better replacement, and I think that's what they'll try and build Allo into Chris I wish American carriers weren't such jackasses. Jayson Stephenson You have a very similar theory as I do. I think the point of the renaming of Google Messages to "Android Messages" is to give all AOSP devices a baseline messenger app that is not branded with the Google name, and supports whatever standard your carrier utilizes. (SMS/MMS/RCS) Obviously Allo will not be getting full-SMS support at all for obvious reasons....(https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/53uvvu/why_sms_fallback_isnt_the_holy_grail_you_all/) But it might be possible for it to get RCS support and still allowing it to view, send, and receive SMS messages. As SMS messages are connected to your carriers data infrastructure instead of tied to your phone storage. (If you have an RCS compatible carrier) You can have Allo to communicate to any non-Allo contacts while still utilizing its rich features with Allo-Allo communication. Although I'm not sure if such an app/feature is even possible. If it were, we could see a messenger revolution! Andy J If Allo gets upgraded with RCS - it MUST have SMS too, the UP spec is very very clear on this point, because RCS does SMS fallback by default. This thing a lot of people forget about Android Messages is that part of Google's commitment to RCS was that they would design an open source RCS client that can be used as is or used as starting point for carriers and OEMs. Android Messages is (as far as we know) that open source client. It's nowhere near feature complete - because the UP spec includes pretty much everything that Allo already has - location sharing, sending files, stickers, voice calls and video calls. The Android Messages app has a long way to go to meet all the features of the first release of UP. Jayson Stephenson The RCS spec does mention is must have RCS fallback, that is correct. But it does not specifically mention that it must be a client-side fallback. If it were carrer-side then we could see IMs like Allo have just strictly RCS support with native SMS fallback if needed. I could be wrong about that though, I haven't skimmed through the spec in a while. Andy J It does actually - it's both. The carrier fallback is automatic and awesome because it's fallback on the REMOTE carrier not yours. So if you send a message to a user and for some reason it cannot be delivered (they have no data for example), the remote users carrier will automatically convert the message to SMS and deliver it. The spec is very specific that any app that supports RCS MUST also support SMS. Client fallback to SMS is referred to as CFS and network fallback to SMS is referred to as NFS. Page 216 of the spec states: Android 7.0+ "Any RCS client (embedded or downloadable application) shall only activate its own RCS stack when it is set as the Default SMS app. " and page 219 covers Android <7.0 "If the RCS client loses its’ Default SMS app status it shall de-register" and the entire spec constantly covers SMS fallback for everything - everything from sending messages, sending location, sending files can be achieved over SMS when RCS is not available across the entire route - the recipient receives an SMS with a web link. It's an interesting read - it hasn't changed a whole lot from the 2 pre Universal Profile specs. Jayson Stephenson Very interesting! I've always wondered how that worked. I'll have to take a look at the document again. Thanks! Abraham No this is how I see it. Android Messages is a very generic simple SMS/RCS platform. No real branding, no real benefit for Google. This makes carriers happy as they are not shoving Google on everyones faces by default. Allo, if it gets RCS support. Will be the Google branded, with Google assistant and many more things. But this will be for the user to decide if they want to use. Not set as default to keep the user and carriers happy. What do you guys think? Joshua More likely. Allo will never replace Android Messages. Android Messages is a very lightweight, clean, and basic app. Allo is full of many (some might call pointless) features most don't want or need. Allo is slow to open compared to Android Messages, which could get annoying if you just want to send a quick SMS/RCS message. McStagger are you keeping that spreadsheet updated? Jayson Stephenson Most certainly! .w oh, and google will be in the center of our communication even more! and if someone opts to use basic sms, which doesn't use internet and such one will end up being processed but damn google... how "noble" of them, and they will probably do this also for "free" (i.e. "only" our data will be collected)... 😆😄 Better Google than Amazon, Facebook, or Apple. That's for sure. .w I'm not so sure about that, given google cluster-freck attitude towards messaging apps... None of the above looks great tbh... Nana Adu-Krow Not sure what is so hard to understand about their messaging apps. Each one serves a different purpose. And if you feel like there's apps that lack certain functionality (like web app support or something) you have the option to use something 3rd party. .w ROTFL, I didn't say that it's hard to understand but the purpose of messaging app is, well... messaging. In case of google you have abundance of messaging apps and if they have distinctive functionality it's even worse - there should be single app that handles all the basics and does it well. That's not the case in google messaging ecosystem. Why would I put my feet in that mess? Just to find out that in a couple of months google would introduce yet another messaging app? or in case of operators - say that they were mistaken if not 100% chooses their solution. Bottomline - trusting google services, especially those not well established (like mail, calendar, docs or android ecosystem) is veeeery risky... Cakefish When will RCS come to the UK? NathanDrago My knowledge is that SMS have basically disappeared. I only receive SMS from my bank and my carrier. Everybody is using WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it. What's the purpose of this effort for RCS? Is RCS more capable than WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it? David Ruddock SMS is still widely used in the USA. NathanDrago But don't you suspect that by the time this standard even starts to spread, USA will already have caught up with the rest of the world (that is, abandoning non-data messages)? It seems to me a lot of wasted resources. raddacle Considering how comfortable people are with services like iMessage which discriminates against other OS's, I don't see SMS going anywhere for the US. SMS is as standard as possible for the US right now. The only way to change the standard is by forcing it, hence RCS. Santos Chavez iMessage says nope, sorry. iPhones are actually a lot more popular here in the USA than the rest of the world. Hence people never switch to other apps.Hence those iPhone users messaging an Android user and oops, it's an SMS now because, yeah, Android doesn't have iMessage. The Android user also wouldn't change apps either if their current SMS app allows them to chat with all of their iPhone using friends. Like me, for instance, I'm the only one in my group of 5 friends that uses an Android phone. Hence, my default SMS app, Android Messages,is all I need to talk with them. They don't switch apps because amongst themselves they use iMessage which is enough as they get advanced messaging features. See what I mean? RCS would at the very least make Android---> Android users have those same advanced messaging features they'd get with other apps. Pushing RCS as the standard works for us here because we've never switched out of using SMS apps. .w This highly depends on the country... Peter Obligatory XKCD https://m.xkcd.com/927/ Dat Nguyen Here in Belgium, SMS is still used (well less than before) because when it comes to mobile subscriptions, Belgium is one of the countries that has expensive prices. For example, for 15€ a month, the carrier I use gives you 2,5 hours of calling, unlimited texting and 1,5 Gb of data so it's not like I can enable the data 24/7 And none of the carriers in Belgium doesn't seem to be aware of RCS AbdulB1 keep it on 3g. You will survive within limits Ryne Hager RCS is supposed to be an open replacement for SMS/MMS. But it is really just another competing standard. At least when compared to things like WhatsApp it isn't a private system. Any carrier that wants to can jump on and start using RCS for messaging, while WhatsApp is not so open and requires that you use their app the way they want you to. So TL:DR RCS is just supposed to replace old standards. bekifft Obligatory XKCD: https://xkcd.com/927/ Latheryin Data only messaging services are not really used a lot in the states and many other places. Data rates are just too high where SMS is unlimited free. Kyle Salewski Really hoping that since Google is behind this, and with the recent revamp of Google Voice, that RCS would soon come to GV. Anyone have any insight on the complexity behind that? Or would it be really difficult since Google Voice isn't a traditional "carrier" but more of a middle man. David Ruddock It would make sense as a reason for them bringing it back from the brink of death, if nothing else. bekifft But Google Voice / Hangouts are the core of the Frankenstein monster that is Google Fi. They seem to be trying to kill both brands, so it makes more sense to do this as part of Google Fi. But maybe GV / GFi is just more A / B testing. Willie Chalmers III More like A/B/C/D/E testing for a messaging strategy. Santos Chavez I think Nick Fox also mentioned on Twitter that they're working on bringing RCS to Project Fi. Project Fi uses Google Voice as the back end for most of its functions so perhaps adding RCS to Voice is pretty much necessary for it to come to Fi-- maybe they'll "talk" to the same server, as such. Project Fi numbers are Google Voice numbers after all, technically. Snowsky Mountain Is an Internet connection required to send and receive RCS messages? Jay Yes. h4rr4r So then why bother with it over XMPP? Snowsky Mountain So what would happen if I had a cellular connection but no Internet (no Wi-Fi or data)? Would it fall back to SMS/MMS? Jay Yep, you got it! John Doe VoLTE? Phone service requires Internet now so why not messages? Evan Anderson For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. This is an extremely unlikely situation. Any large network system, such as this one, will have plenty of redundancy and excess capacity to avoid ever overloading the system. Star network topology is standard these days, so this architecture makes perfect sense. Any other topology is highly inefficient. Snowsky Mountain I wonder what would happen if that were to occur, though. Maybe it would fall back to SMS/MMS? Ryne Hager It's definitely unlikely, I'm more concerned about denial of service implications from a centralized system. Decentralized might be more expensive for the carriers, but it would be more robust. Houston Texas Robust how? Borgman Say Android Messages gets RCS on all carriers and stuff. What then will be the incentive to use Allo or other IM? Sruly J Well Allo has bots... Marcellus1 It'll be the particular feature set of each offering. I could use Allo because I like the bot and you could use WhatsApp because you like the stickers, for example, but it wouldn't matter that we aren't using the same app--which would be awesome and would drive competition better. Borgman But Allo won't get RCS, correct? Won't that remain an IM (unfortunately?). Or by some miracle (thanks to RCS) I'd be able to use Allo and message someone on imessage? Or are IM a whole nother story for a later date? (I just wish I could use X app and send messages, full resolution photos, HD video, read receipt, typing notify, to someone on Y app). Marcellus1 I don't know specifically what apps will get RCS and what ones won't. Hopefully all messaging apps will support it at some point. I suspect if there are any holdouts, iMessage would be the main one just because Apple likes to be intentionally incompatible. The goal of RCS, though, is to have exactly what you said is your wish. Borgman Man I sure hope that happens!!! Latheryin Will never take off as the standard. Not for a least 10 years. Joshua Canada already has had RCS for many months. We only have a few carriers, so it can easily be standard in Canada. Latheryin Everywhere has it. It is just a matter of who will be using it and what version they will use. It will end up like Android pay.. It to mention that is a but too much privacy that many people just will not freely Give up. Mainly not with the anti Google movement going on right now. Marty For some reason the headline of this article made me remember what I used to think about Google several years ago. I was of the opinion that the mentality at Google was of forging a future of making everything free...at least free in the phone and service market to start. Back then my impression of Google was that it was lead by activistic, hippy-culture young people who wanted everything in life to be free. I felt Google would try to lead society to forge such a mindset that "profit" was evil and that humanity being free from wants and needs was the future they wanted. Viktor Ivanov Good thing they aren't, I'd be really worried if they were. Marty Maybe they were to a certain extent but couldn't manage to bring their ideals to fruition. The people running the show right now seem to be money-driven. Syukri Lajin Google trying to make the carriers move to a more centralized system. Good thing they showed good example by not making another messaging app just for RCS. :D freshprince_87 I hope the other 3 US carriers (T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T) adopts Google's RCS messaging network so that RCS finally replaces SMS/MMS forever . SMS/MMS needs to freaking die already! When that happens, there won't be a need for iMessage and it's blue bubbles anymore 😒. Because every phone except for iPhones (unless Apples updates it's messages app in iOS 11)will have the Google's version of iMessage messaging service, RCS, in the United States. Borgman I don't know how many bozo iphone friends I have who say "the picture you just send is hazy" or "why does Android not send HD pics or videos". Drives me crazy! Just want a simple way to send those things to my friends! Warren Skipper No matter if the rest of the world uses RCS, Apple will never adopt it simply because it involves connecting to Google. Add on top of the fact that Google will likely have access to all messages that come through and you have a perfect recipe for Apple to publicly stand against it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson Not sure what you mean by "Connecting to Google", if Apple were to ever adopt RCS they would just have to utilize the exact same API's that every other OEM (Windows Phones, Android, etc...) uses. The only thing Google is doing is promoting the standard and trying to push adoption. Warren Skipper From everything I've read, there are some parts of the universal profile that seem to be Google-specific. In this article by Mobilesyrup, the carrier network Rogers stated “It’s a Google managed service”: http://mobilesyrup.com/2017/05/11/rcs-messaging-sms-canada-explainer/ I could be wrong though.Even if so, Apple wouldn't adopt it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson What he was mentioning in that paragraph that you quoted was the Google Jibe platform which those carriers have agreed to utilize to have Google host the server infrastructure for them. Look at the previous paragraph... "One point Sarhangi is quick to reiterate multiple times throughout our interview is that RCS “is not a Google service.”" RCS is NOT a Google exclusive service. Any Carrier, or OS, or Hardware manufacturer can utilize RCS 100% without any involvement of Google whatsoever. Warren Skipper You're mistaken what I'm saying. I know this is not Google exclusive. I also understand that any carrier can implement it along with OEMs like Samsung who can host the servers in lieu of Google. However, it's highly likely that Google has some form of code within the universal profile itself, that they can track, that is beyond whoever implements RCS. Again I could be wrong but either way, RCS has to go through someone's servers and who's ever it is will have the ability to mine everything that goes through it. Nicholas Conrad But apple hates industry standard, it interferes with their platform lock-in. Andy J Yes - but when UP is available on Android, Windows and Linux and Apple is the only company not taking part - Apple users will feel frustrated by that. Andy J Google aren't the only company - there are about 8, and because they are all UP - they will all interoperate.... that is the whole point after all. Andy J RCS falls back to SMS... mrjayviper Did that mean SMS communications will be data mined by Google as well? I believe they can't do that right now? h4rr4r Why not? They can read anything the device sends. If you own the kernel you own it all. mrjayviper Google can't read my SMS right now success they are not part of the process Ryan yes, they can. as he said they can technically read anything that exits your phone, if they choose to do so. This is how the current sms backup function works. Also if you use android messages they are already in the process mrjayviper i don't backup my SMS h4rr4r Google made the software that displays the text. If you use an Android phone. eddiepearson Honestly, don't care about this unless this means TMO will implement this tomorrow. All of this is null if TMO continues to not give a crap. You can get those free poop goodies every Tuesday though. bekifft The Venn diagram of people on Sprint with friends in Canada (and vice versa) are going to be very excited about this! JD So what Google is saying is RCS will be an unreliable POS that will be in Beta forever. Santos Chavez No that is not at all what they're saying. JD It was implied, since Google is going to sit in the middle of this hub. thecoolkid So now Google will be reading our texts too...? kamiller42 Control the hub? Control the world! Nice one, stop shop for intelligence agencies. Will hub participants be given access to all traffic on the hub? I'm sure Google will. "Better to mine you with my pretty!" MeCampbell30 I'm sure the carriers have no intention of letting google profit at their expense. kamiller42 The answer? Enticement. Offer the carriers the access to the products of the data mining. "We all benefit." Andy J Google's Jibe aren't the only company offering hosted RCS to carriers, and carriers are still completely free to implement their own UP solution hosted entirely inside their own network. This is the bit I am unclear on, because at least 8 other hosted companies exist - it's not clear if you need a connection to each provider or if those providers will connect to each other and one connection to one hub will eventually reach the right provider :/ Abhishek Saral RCS is just for SMS or are there any other benefits? senoredusty Separate ideas. Your question doesn't really make sense. Think of RCS ad the evolution of SMS Abhishek Saral Try to understand the context. It's just for sending messages or something else. senoredusty Yes. It's like fancy SMS. Read receipts, higher quality media, typing indicators, etc. Abhishek Saral People in US should start using WhatsApp already. Instead of making things tough for everyone. senoredusty Everyone in the US uses SMS already. If, over the course of time, people are naturally transitioned from SMS to RCS, that's a lot smaller a barrier than trying to convince each and every person to install yet another app. Sprint is going in the right direction with this, having Android Messages installed by default on all new Android devices. Also IMO WhatsApp is ugly. I don't want to use it, so I'm not about to try to convince everyone else they should. I'd much rather see Textra gain RCS functionality. Duder12 Fixed for you. *iPhone users in US should stop using iMessage already. Instead of making things tough for everyone.* Jay Who care? Americans have locked themselves into a vicious cycle, where 'SMS FALLBACK' in 2017 is necessary and their own self created injury infliction about being the 'green text' to 'blue text' users. Be it whatsapp or telegram or wechat, the rest of the world seems a lot more sane and the messaging discussion has not been one, in a lot of places on earth for years now. Instead here we are in 2017, with americans ranting about SMS and 'the imessage for android'. Something most nations will not care about Santos Chavez I think a lot of has to do with the fact that many folks here aren't really technically knowledged. Most never use any other app other than what came with their phone. Hence why SMS is still a thing, they just use that app to communicate with everyone. By gradually moving things over to RCS, those same consumers would still benefit from advanced messaging even if they never change their app. Sprint is helping with that since they're installing Android Messages by default on all new phones, and they already support RCS. ThePublisher So Google will be able to read all texts... awesome... Erstam Why don't they have Google voice setup with this already? James Where does it say Jibe will provide the hub connection to carriers for free? davidtb I could see how Google (a non-carrier) would want a piece of every RCS message (via their servers) who's at the center of the hub? RCS is pretty, but not a necessity, needa I wonder if Google is going to let everyone in the hub get the data. Yuri Vidal Can someone please explain me why use RCS (Or even SMS) would be better than simply using internet IP messaging systems? (WhatsApp, Telegram, Hangout, and so many others...) Paul Hansen A universal platform for all mobile devices. Not just the ones with a particular app installed. Santos Chavez Because then you could message someone the same way as those apps, but it wouldn't even matter what app they're using. For example, SMS apps will adopt the standard, as well (Textra devs have already said they will support it) so an Android Messages user on Sprint would be able to RCS with a Textra user on Rogers while having the same exact features of WhatsApp, Facebook, etc (like read receipts, typing indicators, large video sending, high quality pictures, and so on). Believe it or not, not everyone uses those other apps, especially here in the US. And even if they had an account in one or more of the apps, they may not be active on it anymore, like it is the case with my friends. With RCS you'd still be able to reach them anyway and have all of the advanced features those apps provide, across carriers and across apps. 2 Men-E I just want this to come to Project Fi Santos Chavez Me too! Really hoping that because Google owns the infrastructure and that they've streamlined the requirements to bridge to other carriers, it'll come to Fi pretty soon. Should be lots easier for them than all of the other carriers anywhere, after all :P Sonic Sunglasses I'm sure AT$T is busy working out its strategic plan to be dead last in implementing this technology. KChristainsen So basically we're still far off from RCS becoming a reality, unreal Jeff Saul Everything goes through the Google. It has been decreed. Humans will bow down to the Google. The Google reigns supreme. Soraya Xel For Google's next trick: Steal everyone's SMS data too. xyz No big deal. In most countries, the telecom regulators will set a standard that all carriers will have to follow. In the US, it'll be a mess. Đức Thành This is always the case: Google wants to help make something better for everyone, they have an idea that can help people improve things for themselves, which then more often than not gets rejected because everyone is a selfish and foolish asshole whose only interest is their own short-term benefits. Much of humanity is like that. Sometimes I think I can begin to get why in sci-fi movies the supreme AI ruler just wants to get rid of all humanity: Humanity's stupidity is a threat to their very existence. Andy J We need to get Artem to go back for more information. Google's Jibe are not the only company providing hosted RCS solutions, there are about 8 of them. This explains how it works when all the companies are using Jibe for their solution, but how does it work when a) you are using a different hosting provider and b) how does User A on Jibe sending a message to User B on another provider or even more confusingly - a carrier implementing RCS entirely in their own network without relying on any external hosting using the UP ready openmind Core Network solution - how does the message get routed, how does the Jibe cloud know where to deliver the message to? dodo icon pack on picture?

[Update: Official] Google Keyboard is now Gboard with v6.0 update—includes integrated search, dedicated number row, multiple active languages, and more [APK Download] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2016/12/17 2:10am PDTDec 17, 2016 81 Plus 1 on G+ 242 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares406 Applications Google News Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion. Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. It's not only a name change, though. There are a few important new features, including a search shortcut and true multi-language support. The update is still rolling out, and Google has not yet posted an official changelog. Here's what we've spotted so far. G button (enabled in settings) offers quick access to search from the keyboard Pop-out toolbar (when G button not enabled) provides access to themes, settings, one-handed mode, and search Optional dedicated number row Up to three active languages with preference for one (previously had to switch) Gesture typing is now called Glide typing. Search for emoji Rearranged emoji panel with group selection at bottom Emoji have bright halo effect around them GIF button is always shown, but disabled in apps without support. We'll update if we spot anything else, but this should be most of it. Keep in mind, the G button is optional because you can still access integrated search from the toolbar pop-out. It's just one extra step. It's up to you if you prefer to just have the button. That's cool and all, but the dedicated number row will make a lot more people happy. You have to turn that on in settings as well. Those on the team who speak multiple languages seem quite excited about the multiple language support too. You can actually type in up to three of them without manually switching keyboard modes. This is similar to the way SwiftKey does it. The update is just starting to roll out, but we've got the new version on APK Mirror (Android 4.2 and higher). Note, it's in a different area of APK Mirror than the old Google Keyboard, but it is just an update. Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion.

Fan guy Rita will be happy for that number row :P Someone iOS got it first couple months ago if I remember correctly. Brad "Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. " AbbyZFresh iOS users barely even use Swiftkey. Let alone Gboard. K.P. Smith Good info. Ryan should include that in the very first sentence of this article that your commenting on ... Marko Šaric Great. Now I'm smearing egg on my phone screen cause I can't wait until I finish eating. Downloaded. Robert Trance You could have used voice control if ON?!! Marko Šaric It's not a big deal. It got wiped off. Robert Trance What phone if i might ask...? Marko Šaric Nexus 5x. jesuguru Knuckles (for screen)? Fork and knife (for eggs)? Marko Šaric Hand for dipping bread in egg yolk. Dominic81 "multiple active languages" FINALLY!!! WORPspeed THIS!!! SO much this! I was excited for gboard, but lack of this was holding me back, but reading that it is now included, I can say ADIOS SWIFTKEY! Or maybe it doesn't work as good :P Swiftkey isn't bad, just excited about gboard :D motoridersd Same! I love SwiftKey, but it can do some annoying things from time to time. I'm definitely going to be check out this new Gboard. WORPspeed And I already switched back to swiftkey. The delete swipe gesture on gboard is just horrible, it should just delete 1 word per swipe, not every either 1 letter or the whole sentence.....needs an undo button. The layout...well I'm just used to Swiftkey's layout and the way swiftkey is smart enough to isnert a space after a comma....small things that make gboard a horrible experience for me. I do keep it around incase I want to sent a gif/meme image, it's easier switching keyboards then apps :D motoridersd Yeah, the placement of the question and exclamation marks on Gboard is awful. Too many taps to get to them (they're probably hiding behind another key, but I didn't go hunting for them). Not getting a space after a comma, or getting a space after a word when putting in a question mark was annoying. The delete gesture is definitely not good on Gboard. Jordan Long press m or n is too many taps for question marks and exclamation points? Or press and slide on the period key? They're all very easy to get to. Also the slide-to-delete action is great. I don't know of any keyboard that does it in a significantly better way. motoridersd Turns out I had the symbol setting turned off, so I didn't see any of the characters on the letters or the period. The slide to delete on Swiftkey works very well because it works on the whole keyboard, not just on the backspace key. I've been spoiled by just swiping anywhere to delete a typo. You have to disable flow typing for this to work, but I don't miss that feature. Zorkos You don´t need an undo button. After you delete something the deleted text will appear as a suggestion Urs Müller It also doesn't seem to predict the next word. Instead it shows options for the currently swyped word... Also back to Swiftkey for now. Rapper_skull My dream came true. Rod Our* Rod What? Like in Swiftkey? rauldzmartin Exactly. Mario Porfírio Souza I hope that feature works well, because in swiftkey dont work well HARAMBE It doesn't even correct italian words with some french shit! GLORIOUS Vincent Bye bye SwiftKey samiazza Can somebody explain how does this work? Georgiy Alexandrov I guess it will predict words for both languages depend on what you type in, without need of switching languages manually. Apps By Usman basically what swype provided years ago :) (it's good to see google adapt it) bat0nas Exactly. Been using multiple language in Swype for years. HaltestelleLuitpolthafen I text in both German and English, but 75% of the time in English. I don't have to go into settings and manually switch it from English to Germany anymore, I can have it do it on the fly and set it to prefer English since that is what I predominantly speak. Felix /Offtopic When I interpret your username right you're from Mannheim? Why do you speak English predominantly? ;) mitchilin You don't have to go into settings. Just press the world icon on the keyboard and it changes language instantly. I've been doing this for years with German. snoop doge what do you exactly mean by it? Ashish Bogawat It is a good start, but Swiftkey has quite a headstart with support for many more languages. It (Swiftkey) even does English & Hindi, even though they use different scripts. I type in English and it suggests matching Hindi words along with the English suggestions. Ash Google has that as well, but that keyboard is Google Indic keyboard prediscover no asian language support though :( Ash Hindi, Tamil etc are Asian language. Fir Chinese there is seperate keyboard prediscover I thought Hindi had a separate keyboard too jenderalcilik I too excited for this. I installed right away after reading that sentences. I mean I always loved Swiftkey, but sometimes I hate it when it loads so slow when I switch from app to app. I hope this worked well. Eddy Nelson Lopez This is so épico ahora puedo change languages sin tener que touch the world icono 😂😂 Total Insecurity Hahaha^^ Robert Trance LOL, you so won this thread.... Avishek Jajajajaja Lord Argyris One upvote, duly earned. El_Big_CHRIS My main reason for sticking to SwiftKey, maybe I'll finally ditch it iiku it is also available for chrome spellchecking. Vratislav Jindra "multiple active languages" I HATE IT SO MUCH!!! I've never used it on other keyboards which had this feature. When I'm tapping, the keyboard usually guesses the language correctly. But when I start the text with swiping, it's more like 50:50 - sometimes it guesses the correct word, but very often it also offers me a word from a different language. I'd rather keep pressing the "switch language" button on my keyboard to switch languages manually instead of relying on a technology which fails half the time. bidou I don't like it either. It always writes the wrong word from the wrong language. You can disable it in the keyboard options and go back to the normal "press the switch language icon" type. Vratislav Jindra You're right, I must have missed that setting. Thank you very much! Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez It's happening!! Aleluya! I've been waiting eagerly for this feature since Google Keyboard supports Gif images. Sorry Swiftkey but now is time to move on. HopTzop Too bad it doesn't work well, at least here it's a pain in the arse. Also sometimes doesn't get the whole sliding and gives just a letter, sometimes it gives a totally different word that has nothing to do with what you slide, but happens to start with that letter. They just made me buy Swype which feels like it's reading my mind and runs buttery smooth. tattoos for men I totally agree with you. Bewear ARM64 only :c aSquard http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/gboard/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-release/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-armeabi-v7a-android-apk-download/ Bewear Thanks. Brian ARM64 though :( Phoenix FUUUUDGE Andy Roid Whaaaa Adrianus AJ Nadeak There's an ARM version available. Michael Carr Can't say I'm a fan of the name change, but the new features sound cool. Downloading! Phoenix OMG is this really happening ? is this really happening ? FINALLY Carson Saldanha Ohh yeah... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif Phoenix I spoke too soon, it's still not happening for ARM owners lol just ARM64 Carson Saldanha Hopefully APKMirror will have the arm version soon. Artem Russakovskii Up now. Volodesi A number row? Finally. I can stop using SwiftKey. k0n And symbols hinting! I can have it set up almost exactly like SwiftKey now, but with added benefits and no extra app required :) FrozenHotChocolate Trying this right away!. But will still need a lot of improvements on the predictions front to pull me away from Swiftkey though. Michael Schaap Neat. Looks like it finally has most of the features I'm using Swiftkey for. (Number 1: multiple languages simultaneously – I tend to type in meerdere talen tegelijk; number 2: number row.) I guess I'll have to try it out and see if it beats Swiftkey yet. (Its prediction is still scarily accurate, though.) Rod It's been said here that it now supports multiple languages simultaneously. Michael Schaap Indeed. That's what I'm saying. Rod It's like a dream came true, until I saw the arm64 requisite.. Comediante "Optional dedicated number row" - It was about time! Only thing I miss is the hability to theme choosing colors (primary/accent) from a material color pallete and not just choose from a limited theme gallery. Jaime Andres Salame Borja Does it have Gif search? AdamH Yup, only works in Hangouts tho.. Artem Russakovskii Not only. In Messenger too. Badouken And Allo :P Abhilash Bingi Yup, but the app has to support it. Only Messenger and Hangouts do as of now. Rod No love for 32 bit. :( Baalinooo Not available for Nexus 6 then? :( Ten Bears not yet anyway... Rod Nope. CD RW ARM apk now available ntomka You don't have to wait for long. I got it through Google play update to my Honor 6 Plus, which is a 32bit phone. 😃 Rapper_skull Then upload the APK to APKMirror. EDIT: Never mind, it has already been uploaded. Rod Excellent news. Thanks! Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9835dd11c8683e36c4fcf70d1cd5c1ccbb48c6158a3019cd0c72fdcb6fce9949.gif Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif mx3 But no emoji prediction :( Caleb Lee ☹️ someone755 This guy does not use Gboard. cowboysfanzz Use Textra with Gboard it's heaven mx3 This has nothing to do with emoji prediction. cowboysfanzz Yes. Textra has emoji prediction XerBlade But it's a single SMS app, not something that magically adds stuff to the keyboard, so it doesn't help you in literally every other app on your device. wade_county I must be blind, where in the settings is emoji prediction in Textra? Corey Kinard If only Textra would use, or allow as an option, stock Android's quick reply in the notifications (where it sticks) and also added the stock inline reply option in heads up messages. It feels so cluncky to have their huge "quick reply" screen pop up now. I guess they could slim the app a bit by dropping the GIFs too since it's in Gboard. Marcus Clendenin You can search in the emoji keyboard. It's not as nice as the emoji prediction in Swiftkey but it does help when trying to find an emoji Cakefish Emoji search doesn't work for me. Just says "data for emoji search is not available". Weird. Checked permissions. Checked internet connectivity. Marcus Clendenin I saw a reddit comment that said the initial download needs to happen on WiFi? So maybe try doing that. I haven't been on WiFi today so I can't confirm whether that works Cakefish You sir, are a gentlemen and a scholar! Thanks! Jacques Ligier Can anyone confirm whether it works? Robert Trance I can predict for you... Marko Šaric Poll: What was your first search ever with gboard for android? AfrodanJ Pictures of Santa PHLAK What about gif support? Kyle Gospodnetich It's been there for months. Aaron I see it but it's crossed out here. Guess it only works on apps that support it. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, the button is now permanent, just disabled in app that don't support it, which is different than the previously confusing contextual GIF button. JSo You can now do a search with the keyboard which will pull up gifs in the results like it does by hitting the "gif" button. I tried it in Inbox but it inserts the link and not the gif itself. Anthony Castanza Its actually happening!! But what are we going to complain about now?! Oh wait, Allo. Nevermind. Michael Kennedy Fuckin' Allo... :( rauldzmartin Is it not killed by Google yet? Cesar Something something no sms fallback... Rapper_skull Multi-language is not exactly what I wanted. I now see IT - EN - ES, meaning that I will receive suggestions for Italian, English and Spanish. But what I really wanted was scrolling the spacebar to switch language, so that I can type Greek letters while writing. Unfortunately writing math will still be slow. Martin Can't you just tap the "change language" key? One tap, and there you have your Greek keyboard. Rapper_skull Nope, I also have other keyboards, so a lot of taps are needed. Martin I'm not talking about the "Change keyboard" button. I'm talking about the "change language" key next to the space key. You can enable it in the settings ("Show language switch key"), and it lets you cycle through your language with single taps. Rapper_skull Like the default Android button, it still cycles between keyboards. Martin That's strange. I have four different keyboards installed, and the language switch button only cycles through the different languages in Gboard for me. YouNex Long press number row for (some) Greek letters ! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad08d55f06a775a882ce447cac20fc395dae92cb2d45714f508054225311896c.jpg Rapper_skull Doesn't work for me :( YouNex Android version/GBoard version ? Rapper_skull Android 6.0.1, GBoard 6.2.18.151907649 YouNex I updated to GBoard 6.2.22 and it's gone. I think you'll need to downgrade to GBoard 6.1.x Android 7.1.1 btw YouNex As you may have noticed, the screenshot above doesn't have rounded letter keys, which means version below 6.2 YouNex My GBoard version was 6.1.71 to be exact Tomáš Petrík Can you disable all of the top rows? No suggestions, no numbers, no G button, no themes shortcut... Just make it gone. I can do that in current version. If that option is gone, I will hesitate to update. I value screen estate. mattcoz Yes Tomáš Petrík Thanks! Igor Stanić How? mattcoz Oh, I see now that it still shows a bar with everything turned off in some apps. I tried it from the search bar and it wasn't there. Sorry about that. Tomáš Petrík Sadly, the answer is no. mattcoz Right, as I mentioned in my followup reply. Jaime Andres Salame Borja I wanted to search GIFs in Whatsapp? then i believe Whatsapp has to add the search engine... :( AbbyZFresh No gif support. Back to Swiftkey. Naxx ENVY It does support gifs... press the emoji button and its at the bottom,. the app has to support them too though senor_heisenberg Awesome. I'm so glad this was an update and not a separate app. Maxr1998 "Introducing Google Type, a smart keyboard with Google Assistant, tied to your phone number, and without SMS support." Vincent Don't give them ideas.. Clawz114 "The emoji panel was causing confusion with our users, so we have seperated this from the Gboard and Google Type to it's own dedicated emoji app, Gemoji." T4rd Hope they fix the the space bar cursor moving gesture, as it rarely works for my on my 6P. Sometimes if I try it for 20-30 secs it'll eventually remember I had that feature checked and start moving the cursor, so it's basically useless. Cory S Yeah, its a little stiff. I like the way it works on Chroma. Dehaha1 I agree, it's largely useless on my Nexus 5. It usually works on my second or third attempt, however at that point it would have been faster to just tap where I needed to go. On my iPad Mini 2 using GBoard it works much better, though sadly not as flexible as what is built into the default Apple keyboard. (Though I can't give up using GBoard, the gesture typing is too useful) mattcoz Are you holding and sliding or just doing a quick swipe? T4rd Tried it both ways several times. But I see now that if I do a quick swipe, it seems to work better, but still kinda inconsistent and awkward to use. Like your finger has to already be swiping before you touch the space bar, which doesn't feel right. So I think they need to tweak this gesture to allow you to do it while holding in on the space bar for a split second before swiping at least, esp since that doesn't have any other function associated with it (at least in my config). mattcoz No, you should NOT be doing a quick swipe. You hold it down and slide your finger, don't lift it until the cursor is where you want it. If that's not working, then there's something wrong. Martin I don't know if I'm just lucky, but I got it to work on the new Gboard on every single try so far. Previously it would always bring up the "Change Keyboard" menu instead, no matter how fast or slow I tried swiping. Simon I agree this function works much better with this new update. Berkay Did they add the two new keyboard themes that were on the pixel? Badouken Yes it has the blue color schemes for standard light and dark themes. Berkay I went ahead and got the APK because I was impatient, thank you anyway :) How do I use the GIF functionality? It doesn't seem to work anywhere. JSo Only works in apps that support it. Google Messenger, Hangouts and Allo. App developers apparently have to enable it themselves Badouken Mine didn't work at first but then randomly appeared after awhile. It appears when I clicked the smile icon at the bottom, it would then show a gif button next to it. Berkay Whenever I use the emoji search, it's so laggy... But google keyboard has been laggy for me since they introduced the update where they added all those new features like one handed mode. Tiuri Elvander I saw saw a video showing that the iOS version could send little screenshots of search results. I can't find a way to do that in this version of am I missing something?? Lazyboy0172 unfortunately doesn't look like we're missing anything. whenever I search for something it shows a "share" button but just inserts the text from the result as well as http link for the search. It's not the worst, but I'd much prefer to insert it as an image, especially in apps that support the official api for image insertion from keyboard. I mean it's already there with gif search, so why not make those shared search results as pretty in my text message as they are on the keyboard? Still very happy to be able to search from keyboard though, and be able to search emoji. Goodbye, Dango. Goodbye, Swiftkey. Please keep improving, GBoard. Paul_Werner I wasn't using Swiftkey but I was just like you regarding Dango. Glad to have it a part of the built in keyboard now saf1927 The multi language support works really well with two languages. Haven't added a third yet, but now Swift Key is really obsolete for me. Christopher Robert Does it allow for keyboard size scaling? How about better prediction? Themes? yep still not a good replacement for Swiftkeye. Tuck Choate Yes, yes, and yes. They're in the settings. Good thing Swiftkeye has good autocorrect. It'd be embarrassing to make a typo that contradicts your point online. Miku is Best Vocaloid "Multiple active languages". That look a long ass time to happen. br_hermon I want to like Gboard but it's lack of secondary key functions keeps me using SwiftKey. Abhilash Bingi What do you mean by "secondary key functions"? If you mean typing symbols by long pressing alphabets, you can do it in Google Keyboard. br_hermon Thanks the heads up! I never knew that. It's disabled by default. I had to go into settings to enable it. epsiblivion not a fan of all this rebranding to G products. must be new internal management on the apps. Ben G products... like what? Except this one? Perry Mason Gmail /s Todd I really hate that they did it to their email app. I don't think I'll ever get used to it. bikrame Hey guys, how do i add that numerical line above on keyboard. JSo Settings>Preferences>Toggle Number Row bikrame There is nothing like that JSo Then maybe it didn't update for you. bikrame I just downloaded. Vorastra https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a256e9e1393428c03b73ef88560b8959247cf4df2fb8b4664a215b5763527b9a.png bikrame https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cb2c9e011ee1cbea13883ec8e56c4afa707debc7c253dac399b7fa0841d64ae7.png Vorastra Super weird. You're missing the whole "Keys" section. bikrame May be its because i don't have stock Android ??!! Georgiy Alexandrov You downloaded it from Play Store? Then I suggest you check version number, it should be 6.0.65 bikrame ok now its going to sound super weird. I did download from play store and it says like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/599303b5bf88aff23f000101544e9f9f626e9d31d3a791cf557f08a8bef2ddb1.png Georgiy Alexandrov It's not really that weird, update probably not rolled out to you yet. You will get it a little bit later (or just download apk from link in article). And you should actually check app version through settings>apps>gboard (if you not seeing Gboard in apps try to look for Google Keyboard) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/25eff26cc1692310ac42f8878e975697259b70c46702b63ed7fd373a8d67597b.png Kieron Quinn It's on staged rollout and hasn't reached you yet, use the APK Vorastra I'm not using stock android. Using an LG G4. Georgiy Alexandrov Settings > preferences > number row Alex Guitar This is mucho bueno for my Spanglish! Frisi *muy :P Frisi Bye Swiftkey. It's me or Swiftkey caused more "typos" than any other keyboard? Of course, Swiftkey would correct them, but I type better using Google's Keyboard. Now with multi-lingo support I'm more than happy. motoridersd I've been using SwiftKey for a long, long time since I have always needed two languages. I have not been using Flow since I live by the swipe to delete gesture. I love the SwiftKey prediction of emoji, I use it ALL the time, and I am very used to the layout of the keyboard. Trying Gboard for the first time, it feels odd, but it's easy to type in. It doesn't seem to always introduce the period after hitting space bar twice. Swiping the backspace key to delete a word is cumbersome because the surface is very small, so I'm missing that already. There is no emoji prediction, but the search is nice. Unfortunately it doesn't know the latest emoji like bacon, avocado or facepalm, but once they are in the recent window, this can be less of an issue. The prediction does not work in the search box, which is a shame, because searching Google without it is a PITA. Hurricane Andrew The prediction also does not work in Chrome or the Facebook search field. Big oversight. motoridersd Yeah, I use that a lot with SwiftKey. A new Gboard update just came through, wonder if they're tweaking these things. Christian yup and for this thing i still use swiftkey, is really helpfull the prediction in chrome ;) Freek Smulders This is pretty big! #NotMyPresident Why would you want an advertising company logging all your keystrokes? PVL_93_RU I'd rather trust them than my own government to do the same #NotMyPresident LOL. Okay..... /rolleyes 7-down It's in the settings. You can disable sharing of what you type. #NotMyPresident And if you believe that Google respects that, I've got a bridge to sell you. 7-down Hopefully it's the Golden Gate Bridge. I really like the way it looks. http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/ec/ec23811e3ebf097d66addd31391d2b84d094eb85cc37a9b74dec3475a722ca0c.jpg XerBlade Gboard settings > Advanced > Disable "Share snippets" (if it really bothers you that much) P.S. It never actually logs all your keystrokes, even with that enabled. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I see how that could be a concern. They should've filtered the keyboard the way it is in iOS, since that would probably give a lot of people more peace of mind. For example, on iOS, you can't enter your password using Gboard for this exact reason. Whenever you have to enter a password or pin number, it automatically reverts back to the default keyboard (which doesn't store information) to prevent anything getting leaked. But, all in all, this version is pretty cool too. XerBlade ...Seriously, this isn't sending your passwords back to Google. Apple did things that way in iOS to prevent possible malicious third party keyboard replacements from taking advantage of that (which IS a concern in Android: seriously, you probably shouldn't go around installing random keyboards from people you've never heard of). This keyboard, being not-a-malicious-app and all, simply never includes anything marked as a password field in the "snippets" it sometimes [optionally] collects as statistical data for use in improving the app. Knowledgeborn Allah At least that's what they tell you... I'm not trying to sound like a conspiracy theorist or anything, but we don't really know what's happening behind the scenes. Google is an advertising company, and their job is to know as much about you as possible. Statistical data is one thing, but personal information is something different. Another thing that separates the Android version from the iOS version is that the Android version is tied to your Google account, while the one on iOS functions independently. That's how, on Android, they can share "learned words" across your Android devices. They can filter these through your devices because, since they're tied into your Google account, what you type (or at least some of it) goes through Google's servers. It's not anonymous data to just improve the app. It's data specifically about you, tied to your personal account. PVL_93_RU So when the G button is active - how do you switch languages? Do you just tap the same key? Is there a gesture like swipe the spacebar (swiftkey)? Frisi You don't have to now since it will automatically "change" as you type. PVL_93_RU I don't like that XerBlade The G button is unrelated. By default, it has multiple languages active simultaneously (so you just type and it intelligently figures out which language you're using as it goes). Or you can manually switch languages by long pressing spacebar (was already a thing in Google Keyboard). OR you can enable the dedicated language switch button in the settings (was also already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar (note the optional G button is on the left side of the suggestions pane, so again, completely unrelated). PVL_93_RU >OR you can enable the language switch button in the settings (was already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar Phew, thank god Kwetsima Maluleke Number row? Finally! Nuno G. Gboard?! What were these guys drinking?!? raazman The good stuff. tim242 Nothing good about this POS. raazman You're entitled to your own opinion. To me, the best keyboard out there just got better. tim242 Yeah, because a blank bar taking up screen real estate is so much better. I'm glad you like it. raazman What blank bar? tim242 The settings bar, above the keyboard. raazman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2569deb1397c93e3c918c8e97290dbd8c70fafb66fa9d5277b20236aa34124a6.png Huh? What exactly are you talking about? tim242 That bar where you have suggestions. I don't use suggestions. If you disable suggestions, the bar remains as a blank bar. They do this on about every other version. raazman Ah ok, makes sense. I use the suggestions so I never had the need to remove it. Aaron Sounds like a personal problem. tim242 You sound like a blocked problem : ) Aaron Doesn't matter. You can't stop anyone from replying. Wis Ciao Swiftkey, this is soooo good - everything I wanted. Thx, Google... David Prieto What's with the emoji search? Why doesn't it return any results? JSo Emoji search is working for me. ADofCLE The number row is probably the only new feature I am going to use lol mattcoz Dedicated number row? Dedicated number row?! DEDICATED NUMBER ROW!!! Andy Roid Yes, that's what it says in the article mattcoz It sure does! Adrianus AJ Nadeak #DEDICATEDNUMBERROW yka1988 OMG finally! I just switched back to SwiftKey after months and months of using the super snappy Google Keyboard. Those were exactly the things I was missing, and especially the language features made me switch back recently. well, byebye Swiftkey, welcome back Gboard :) El Jefe this is great so now I can do GIF kb in Hangouts but only lif not via SMS. In the Google Messenger app, I can do GIF kb with SMS... I'm running latest everything 7.1.1 ahhh Jordan L I'm not seeing the G button on my Pixel XL. anyone else? I enabled it in settings. rebooting now. I also don't see any text predictions. the whole top bar is missing. EDIT: reboot fixed. XerBlade Make sure you're in an app that supports text predictions. It won't show up if you are typing in the Google search bar, for example. Bewear Emoji search not working for me. It might be because my device is set in Spanish. Scros97 A mi sí que me funciona en castellano la búsqueda de emoji! Bewear Not for me :/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a56c197ba6b723f6ccc0ba473c4dc94277e9cac70a07f5146133052155fdc1f8.jpg Kieron Quinn I have the same issue, apparently you have to be on WiFi at least once for it to download. Shame I won't be until tomorrow. keithzg See this is when it pays to have two devices, so you set one to be a wifi hotspot, then trade off ;) Kieron Quinn My Nexus 5X IS a hotspot, because my flat wifi is broken Ashwin I've installed the app on wifi, have been on wifi the entire day and also tried the same with the new update and still the same error persists for me. What do I do? Cakefish Same but my language is English :( alessiolarva No way to search images directly from the keyboard? tim242 Great. From 41, to 72 MB running service, and laggy again uggggh Aaron Really? Not seeing any lag here. Maybe it's your phone? Would be the first time a Galaxy experienced lag... tim242 Yeah, because a Galaxy chooses which versions of Google Keyboard to lag on. *Eye roll JSo No lag here either. It's not the update. Rod Actually it's showing up as 100mb ish for me. Alex Feels like they finally fixed the Google keyboard lag. That is my only gripe with my Pixel XL ahtough that problem was also on the 6p). Cakefish "Data for emoji search is not available." What does that mean? Samson Don't know. It works for me. Cakefish What phone do you have and which Android version? I have Nougat 7.0. Samson Much appreciated update. I like it a lot! Rod This is the official Google keyboard. Samson It is now. And the problem still exists. So I had to go back to the older version of the official Google keyboard. Very disappointing. Dustin Mingo Swipe from backspace is gone :( Georgiy Alexandrov It still there, or did you mean something else? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/09a329c7a63ed9bb2bcdeec4f5376ebdb3d98d40b75e3f7e2788bf488a681485.png Dustin Mingo Setting's gone for me. I'll clear data and report back Georgiy Alexandrov That's good to hear JSo No it's not Rod It isn't. Steve Will they ever enable its auto-corrections/auto-suggestions when searching? Rocket Does anyone know what happened to picture background? JSo You mean in themes? It's still there Rocket On the old Google Keyboard you could select a picture as the theme, but it looks like its gone now. JSo It's still there for me. I don't know why it's not working for you Rocket Did you do it as an update or as a new installation?? JSo I installed the apk right over my existing app Rocket Im gonna reinstall Google Keyboard (and brave the clunky LG Keyboard) and then update to GBoard Rocket Got it working by selecting a theme and then updating. Now it's an option. Georgiy Alexandrov Working for me on 7.1 and 6.0 but not on 4.4. Well, that's weird Rocket I'm on 5.1 so maybe that has something to do with it? Corey Kinard You sure? I press the arrow on the top left of the Keyboard, press the pallet, and the first theme option for me in Gboard is the "My images" one Edit: way too late! Igor Stanić how to disable popup toolbar when g is not enabled???...it just takes up space...everything is fantastic except this freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still better Igor Stanić How to disable suggestion row ...i dont use it so it is blank...terrible Georgiy Alexandrov You can't, as far as i know tim242 Yep, they always fuck something up. I had to revert back. Igor Stanić Me too Archenuh How to you revert back this damn cancer of an app? Dave Okay, wow. This app somehow fucked up my Pixel XL. I've installed it and it always freezed and didn't let me close the keyboard anymore. So I force restarted where it got stuck. I've hold down the power button again to force restart and when it booted up I was set back to Android 7.1 (had 7.1.1) and I can't access recent apps, can get into the quick settings, have different system settings (for example it vibrates when pressing home although I had it disabled) and it doesn't get data connection. What is this? JSo I really don't think a little keyboard app could cause all that. The most that could probably happen is that the keyboard may keep force closing if you installed the wrong version but I don't think it would do all the things you said happened. Dave I don't know either. But that's how it went. Everything was working fine and after I've installed the keyboard and it kept freezing and therefore covering up half my display although I was on the homescreen I force restarted where it got stuck. One again force starting brought me to that situation I am in now. Zach Mauch LOVE LOVE LOVE the dedicated number row. I would also like the option to add a "tab" button to the keyboard. suavemezie No emoji predictions? JSo What are these emoji predictions everyone is bringing up? Georgiy Alexandrov A SwiftKey (or other keyboard) feature, something like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/045c7a98611e38f08413474280cb41eb8fd78121f38eae7386543f5cc4490eb2.png JSo Was this something that was shown by Google or that the GBoard on iOS has? Just seems everyone is bringing this up all of a sudden. Georgiy Alexandrov Idk, but I dont remember Gboard having this on iOS. I guess it just a popular feature that many custom keyboards have. DubeBoom While Gboard feels much faster and more fluid, there are some things I just like about Swiftkey like the easy access to ? and !. But I'll try using Gboard for a few days to see if I get used to it. JSo Turn on "Long Press For Symbols" for easy access to those. Ashish Bogawat I have that option, but with Swiftkey you don't even need to long-press. Just swipe left on the '.' key. Seems small, but is super efficient once you get used to it. mattcoz Another quick method is to swipe from the symbol key, see if that works for you. Adrianus AJ Nadeak It's not as easy on a wide phone like the Nexus 6. mattcoz True Rod Decrease the long press delay, set it to 120ms. It'll make your life easier. Arshdeep Singh Saini It doesn't install 😢 Nathan J Aww. Google Keyboard's growing up. It was always my favorite keyboard on Android, even though it lacked some features of other keyboards. It was accurate which is what I liked. "Gboard" is a downgrade. On iOS, the Gboard autocorrect is just off the wall. Microsoft's Flow Keyboard (did y'all get that yet?) is better for trace typing, but it will not learn new words. No curse words, no proper names... gotta tap that out. So I deal with Gboard since it will learn... but not from its mistakes. It might be a limitation of iOS, but Gboard on iOS is vastly inferior to Google Keyboard on Android. Coming from someone who has used both extensively. Craig Nelson I have both myself and you're right the auto correct on Gboard IOS is not as good as IOS native keyboard but I will say that the Gboard on IOS seems slightly better than the one on android when it comes to the fluidity of finding a search result and using it. Max Not a second-copy-of-the-same-app? S**t what's happened Google? mrjayviper finally catch up to iOS. Thanks google. I'll be enjoying this on my note4 as I've been doing on the Air2 and 6s+ itsatrap Its good but still no better than Swiftkey. Not even close. jl2222 ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You can perform google search in Swiftkey? Find a gif without leaving the keyboard? itsatrap Those things are extras, keyboards are for typing. Swiftkey is still far better at it. On top of that, there is this annoying bug: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 Rod I agree. Swiftkey still has the lead. Azzy Fuck, only 3 languages at a time! Luckily SwiftKey can accommodate 5, just the number I need! Rod You speak 5 languages? Not bad! steb0ne Finally NERV I am still waiting for it to include those Asian languages so I don't need to download a worse separated one. xunknownx finally! been waiting for the google keyboard to have a dedicated number row. Albin Does it record keystrokes? Rod Of course. Machine learning is a thing. Umer Farooq It now also supports Urdu swiping and suggestions. Vincent Goh Asian languages? I need English, German, and Chinese. I don't need multi languages to include Chinese, but I don't want to switch keyboard app whenever I need to type Chinese. pfmiller Might be more realistic for them to add better English and other Latin alphabet language support to the Pinyin keyboard. I can understand them not wanting to clutter up their main keyboard with various input methods. Ramiro Fernandez I noticed something, don't know if it's new to this version but pretty sure it is. The keyboard will sometimes now correct *back* one word if the next word you type changes what it would predict. So I typed "I'm feeling" but when I typed "I'm" it detected it as "on". Then after typing "feeling" it changed the "on" to "I'm". Gave me options for the two word suggestion too (see screenshot). Doesn't always happen, I guess it depends on how close I was with my gliding and how confident it was with the original prediction. I've never seen this before, but it's really clever. I wish it would take context into account better when suggesting words in general. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f788aeb53d108efe429fbde31f0cead3ef3ecba862432200ee25bd8e1eecf969.png Rod Yeah, I noticed it yersterday whilst replying to a Reddit comment. itsatrap Do you guys have this problem: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/websearch/sxhRXvLfILk WesleySmalls Have they learned nothing from the IE6 toolbars? benjammin03 I am waiting for the google keyboard to have the swipe left to delete the last word. After using it on Swiftkey, it's impossible to use a keyboard without it. Portgas D. Ace Gboard does have this option. benjammin03 I think I tried this before, but I couldn't get used to having to start at the delete key. I'm used to being able to swipe left from anywhere. I forgot about it though, so I'm going to give it another shot since this is the only reason I still use Swiftkey. Thanks! Portgas D. Ace I used Swiftkey in the past but never gestures. So I had no idea it works differently there. Rod In Gboard, you'll need to swipe from the backspace key. But, it's more effective, as you can delete a 10,000 word text all at once. Portgas D. Ace https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/751b4dcb558130893fe4db757a19aa363e250b3b3f2f347889f55783a469ef98.png Rod Swipe horizontally from the backspace key, and you can even delete the whole text at once. Faheem Ahmed not available in 4.2+ Promethean Add Swypes select all/copy/cut/paste gestures and I'm sold, I use them a lot more than I thought and missed them from other keyboards. Jack Sparrow I find it very buggy. It shows only one result. No horizontal scrolling like on iOS. And the funny thing is, if you search for "gboard", it returns the result for slash keyboard! Is it just me or is everyone facing the issue? Rod What do you mean, horizontal scrolling? Savage Alien "Emoji have bright halo effect around them" Yeah, whose bright idea was this? It doesn't look very pretty. QeeYou i know right 😂, looks very bad in bright themes'. neonix One more new feature I noticed: you can now edit the current theme. I believe previously, you couldn't make changes once the image was set. Dobriy Her Still not available in Turkish play store keithzg Oddly enough, the Play Store is still reporting this to me as Google Keyboard, but showing the version to be 6.mumble, while if I go into Settings -> Languages & Input -> Virtual Keyboards I see Gboard. Portgas D. Ace I get it listed as Gboard the Google keyboard in the updates list and as Google keyboard in the play store listing. dylan-m So, anyone else finding the emoji keyboard uniquely irritating now? They're wasting a ridiculous amount of vertical space, they have *two rows* of tabs, and the bottom row of tabs appears where the space bar is (while the emoji key is right beside the comma key). I frequently end up looking at the plain text smileys keyboard because I happen to miss the comma key while I'm typing. (They probably shifted the keys over by a few pixels again). That would have been fine with the old keyboard because the key to go back was in the exact same place. Now you have to pause and look for it because *the entire layout suddenly changes*. Also, they only have three tiny squashed little rows for the actual emoji, which is as many rows as they have for chrome. It's completely terrible. It would not be hard to flip that first row of tabs to the top, squeeze the search button beside them (because it doesn't need to be a text box and they can probably kill a category or two), and maintain a consistent layout for the bottom row of keys. Anyway, this is the second time in six months they have made significant changes to the keyboard layout, unexpectedly screwing with peoples' muscle memory. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by Google any more, but, it's pretty bad form. Ashwin "Data for emoji search is not available" error when tryed to search emoji...Anyone else with the same error?? Even updated to 6.0.68 (first update after Gboard 6.0.65)...Still no luck...Guys, someone please help!! please Does anyone know how the f I can disable the stupid toolbar? I HATE it, it just takes up space and I'll never use it. Any drastic measure to get rid of it works for me. Archenuh I really need this as well. What the fuck is wrong with them adding that fucking stupid toolbar above the keyboard and not letting us DISABLE it?! please how to disable toolbar LOL How does active languages work? I don't get it Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms... LOL So it only works with Latin alphabet? Rod No, those were examples. The app description on Play Store says it covers over 120 languages. LOL But I cant just write a sentence in English and then throw a word from a different language. To write anything in different language I MUST switch keyboard to that language in order to use that alphabet Rod I have English and Brazilian portuguese set, and I can start a sentence in portuguese, throw in some english words and finish in portuguese, and it will auto-correct all the words automatically. I don't need to tinker with anything at all. Just like in Swiftkey. LOL That's because Brazilian uses Latin alphabet. Its impossible to type a word in a different language if it's not Latin Rod Oh, I never tried another language that doesn't use latim alphabet. My bad. Scorpiax7 How does the "multiple active languages" thing works? i need an explanation, please -.- <3 Dmytro Gulivatyy If you have multiple similar languages installed you can type in both without switching and it will understand which one you meant. It should display the languages that are used on the spacebar key below. Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms. Dmytro Gulivatyy Does anyone know why we're getting it so late? I remember people protecting Google not releasing it on Android because we had G Now on tap but I'm confused now. Mako g now on tap is somewhat hidden in Pixels, so this is a good alternative Dmytro Gulivatyy I know and I agree, but why hold out for months before finally releasing it here kinda saying "Hey, you guys can have it too, don't worry we haven't forgotten." Just feels like it. Mako yeah, I really don't know why it took so long Dmytro Gulivatyy Less resources? Harder to code for? I mean it's their OS. Maybe they didn't care enough because it's easier to search for something with the search bar always accessible, GNow on tap here, and they weren't in such a hurry. But now they come out saying this is a better way. Sometimes i cant understand their behavior. pfmiller Android already has plenty of easy ways to access Google search, so it probably wasn't a big priority. Mwikarago Christian Why doesn't auto suggestion work in chrome search bar? Any idea? Dmytro Gulivatyy It's always been like that. I don't know for sure if i'm right but i think it's because they don't want to mess up your query because it's a browser address field. Same goes for the Google search bar. They think you will want full control over what you're typing because it can get technical, unlike the usual chats you have with people in chat apps. It sometimes offers predictions itself but not always. One of the reasons i'm still with SwiftKey. Mwikarago Christian That's a weird decision on their part. The only time I need autocorrection is in the address /search bar as I usually search using recurring words. That's also the reason I'll stick with SwiftKey Dmytro Gulivatyy Yes, it's been discussed times and times again and even listed as a bug https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 but i personally don't think it's one, they would've fixed it a long time ago. For what its worth i don't understand their reasoning either, you can still type and have it write what you meant and not autocorrect it but i also have other reasons to stick with SwiftKey(one being its better at autocorrecting something when GBoard thinks it was just gibberish and has no clue) but it's getting better and has its charm too. marclee Yes it has been always like this.. I kind of understand why Google wants autocorrect disabled in chrome address bar (not agree tho), I just can't understand it is disabled in Google search bar and YouTube..... Rod That's disabled in the app. Someone on Reddit revealed the code. Pedro Diego Fernández It seems I'm the only one having problems with the keyboard...sometimes I glide I can see it's writing the word I want but when I finish it just adds a letter... and the multiple active languages is too funky to use... had to switch back to aosp :( Navin Govindani Not a big fan of the initial release as it has many problems with Spanish, doesn't suggest anything with "ñ", hell it even tries to autocorrect anything I type with it, not to mention, the occasional lag, I understand it's an initial release but please get your shit together team! MikeOxlong The versions available on apkmirror are old (6.0.65). I currently have 6.0.69 on my 6p and pixel XL direct from the play store... Rod Contact Artem, maybe you can share your apk with them? SyCoREAPER Why does the Google Keyboard fdiffer from the AOSP one? Rod AOSP version is outdated and missing the newer features. It's a bare-bones version. SyCoREAPER Aosp in my opinion is functionally superior with the long press symbols for every key Rod That's also present in Gboard. SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it. pfmiller That's an option in Gboard SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it s427 I think I'll make the switch from Swype to Gboard for good now. The only thing still missing IMO are the gesture shortcuts (copy, cut, paste, select all, change capitalization), which are super useful in Swype. So, GOOGLE IF YOU'RE LISTENING YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO! dk mke That and the exclamation and question mark short cuts as well. By far the best features of any keyboard IMO. It's why I keep going back. Rod As a long-time Swiftkey user, I deeply miss the punctuation auto-spacing. drcaveman Anyone else having the GBoard just randomly stop accepting input? I fix it by hiding and clicking the text input box again. Seems to happen more frequently in messaging apps. freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still way better than this new Google keyboard. First of all, SwiftKey is better with word predictions. Secondly, SwiftKey has emoji predictions and Google keyboard does not. And lastly, the SwiftKey emoji list of emojis scrolls down📜 very smooth and fast. But instead in the Google Keyboard that same emoji list scrolls through multiple horizontal pages instead. It's very slow and takes forever if you are texting. Mace Moneta Still no control, alt or tab key (even just the option in advanced setting would be nice), which is annoying for those of us that ssh into systems. marrecar Ok I updated the app this morning and it completely broke it. No words show up on prediction bar, double space doesn't add a dot, can't delete by swiping to the left, can't move the cursor by swiping the spacebar. Plus the emoji menu looks awful. Does anyone have the same problem? I tried deleting data first, didn't work, then I replaced it with stock version, updated and still the same. obk88 very intrigued by gboard used it for 5 days went back to swiftkey...typing is just more effortless on swfitkey. Prediction is better on swiftkey, no suggestions in chrome or other apps is really annoying, gliding isnt as smooth and better emoji experience on swiftkey...google is going in the right direction but this app still needs work...for now im back on swfitkey but keeping an eye on gboard for sure Christian Wagner Jr Still too large of a keyboard. I have a Nexus 6P and with it on its smallest setting, the keyboard and the box above it take up just under half my screen! SE.Quence so what? just resize it in settings Christian Wagner Jr I did. Its set to the smallest setting. Went thru all the settings as well. If they only gave the option to make it smaller by one or 2 more sizes, I would dump swiftkey for this no problem. Not all of us have donut fingers and need keys THAT large SE.Quence Yep, I can agree that some of other keyboards can be smaller when set to smallest size. But setting GKB to lowest height is pretty decent IMO. Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Can u help me with this? Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature sachouba It only took Google 3 years to add some features available on Samsung's keyboard and SwiftKey. And Google fans sound astonished... patrick yes i had the numbers row on my S4 stock samsung keyboard. but as far as autocorrection, i always found Google keyboard to be more accurate. SE.Quence Testing new GBoard on my 2 Nexus devices. Both running 7.1.1. Dictionary sync doesnt work even when account is set and sync was forced manually. By some reason, GBoard is not presented in Google sync settings (Accounts - Google) but IDK whether it should be here. Who else is facing this? Đức Thành I've been using the APK since a few days ago and autocorrection is still as horrible as ever, especially for Vietnamese. There's no options to set the aggressiveness level of autocorrection, and it's a pain in the neck to hit backspace multiple times for every sentence I type just to go back and fix the incorrectly autocorrected words. Not to mention Gboard now tries to autocorrects whole compound words and phrases, and every time I want to say: "Yo Google keyboard, I appreciate the effort but honestly you are not doing that well since you don't know the language or how I type that well, and your ultra aggressiveness in helping me is creating more trouble than it solves, so could you stop?" In the end just now I had to turn off autocorrection altogether, and now I have to face the problem of not having autocorrection for either language. I wish there were some middle grounds, but Google is too stubbornly extreme in its ways sometimes. Sigh. dhamp2g Vietnamese? ?? Honestly dude, English only ..... LMAO it corrects English well 😂😂 Đức Thành I'm afraid I don't fully comprehend what you mean. Yes it autocorrects English very well, but it has also started supporting autocorrection for Vietnamese since Google Keyboard 5.0, and that's my native language so there's nothing wrong with using that, and since the app itself officially supports the language... Arrgh forget it, you won't get it anyway. dhamp2g I understand , I was just saying all us english speaking folk only car about english problems LMAO :) mizrulez I'm not sure if it's just me, but I can't turn off the keypress pop-up in the latest update. I tried deleting data, but the option is still not there. I find the popups extremely annoying. 😏 ggggg Something extraordinary happened. Google updated Google Keyboard instead of creating another keyboard App. mwolverine i wish it would show suggestions when searching in google apps. I usually end up going back to swype because of this. Usman Nagi Only reason I am not upgrading is that I miss the no key delay feature. Is there any way to enable in this current build? It slows my typing down and I only type better with popups. Itchy_Robot Why don't they just put Google Assistant into this keyboard? Renan At least that hideous G button is optional tigerberry Oh hey, finally there's gesture typing for Hungarian! It only took... well, how many years? Too many, considering that other keyboards, even OEM keyboards have been able to do it since ages. And lemme check... yep, still no gesture typing for Japanese in QUERTY mode. Come on Google, even Huawei's keyboard can do it! (I miss the Xperia keyboard. :( I wish it was available for non-Sony phones...) Gwaur I wish there was a way to completely hide the extra row where that G icon is. I found a setting for hiding the icon but the row stayed. It's a goddamn waste of space for someone who's not gonna use it. Fahad Ahmed Why there's no Chinese language included??? That's disappointing. Természetjáró Gayboard. Sorry, I'll show myself out... Patel Nisha I would be happy with a backspace key! Or better still, when using a stylus, thus knowing I went to each letter precisely when swaping, the damn thing would input my entry versus some substitute word! Marco Reali I love GBOARD but two things are very very frustrating: 1. There is no suggestion bar when typing in Chrome. 2. The language switch takes to long to recognise which language I'm typing. I wish they woul reinstate the button for those who want that. I switch language pretty often and I find it horrible to have to re-type words over and over before it's in the right language. WestIndiesKING anyone else getting a little bit of lag when you first start it up after a while of not pulling up the keyboard? I am getting 1-3 seconds of lag before it starts only if i havent used it in a while, after that it flies. Pixel XL 128gb Daddyo Gordon Am I the only one who feels the google keyboard has gotten bloated and too big? There should be an option to keep it at one language, as pioneered by monolingual on the mac (gets rid of a couple Gb of unused languages that waste storage).

Exclusive: Google is planning a 'Pixel 3' laptop running the 'Andromeda' OS for release in Q3 2017 David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/09/26 7:02am PDTSep 26, 2016 358 Plus 1 on G+ 1117 Share on Facebook 412 Share on Twitter Total Shares1887 Exclusives Google Leaks News Rumors Two independent and reliable sources have confirmed to us that Google is planning a new Pixel laptop to be released in Q3 2017. The project, known internally as 'Bison' and by the informal nickname 'Pixel 3,' will likely be the first brand-new device to showcase Google's combined Android / Chrome OS 'Andromeda' operating system in a laptop form factor. Bison, then, would be the culmination of years of work by Google's Pixel team and Google's Android and Chrome OS teams. We are extremely confident Google plans for the device to run Andromeda. We are also confident that Andromeda is a completely distinct effort from Google's current campaign to bring Android apps to Chromebooks, and that Bison would not be marketed as a Chromebook. Android apps on Chrome OS descended from the ARC project, while Andromeda is a much larger, more ambitious initiative that is being pursued via merging Chrome features into Android, not vice versa. As such, it would be more accurate to say Bison will run Android than Chrome OS, and could finally be Google's internal commitment to releasing Andromeda. (This lines up with the narrative The Wall Street Journal presented in its exclusive about the merge effort last year, in which laptops were specifically singled out as the merged OS's first big target.) But before we get into details, let's discuss our confidence in this rumor. Unfortunately, this one is tricky. We are unable to share any primary source materials, including renders of any hardware. We also believe Bison's specifications, while we will provide them, are very much subject to change. Given it's a year or more from its planned release, Bison could evolve substantially or even be cancelled - so we want to be absolutely clear when we say that specifications are not set in stone. Let alone Bison's release being a certainty, especially if Andromeda runs into delays or the OS project sees a change of direction. But we're going to share what we can today, because it's just too interesting not to. And despite all of our asterisking in regard to future uncertainty, we are exceptionally confident that the information and sources we're working from are legitimate and trustworthy. As such, we're not assigning a number to this one - it's just not a good fit for that system. So, let's dive in. Bison is planned as an ultra-thin laptop with a 12.3" display, but Google also wants it to support a "tablet" mode. It's unclear to us if this means Bison will be a Lenovo Yoga-style convertible device, or a detachable like Microsoft's Surface Book, but I'm personally leaning on the former given how thin it is. Powering it will be either an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor with 32 or 128GB of storage and 8 or 16GB of RAM. This seems to suggest there will be two models. It will also feature a fingerprint scanner, two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm jack (!), a host of sensors, stylus support (a Wacom pen will be sold separately), stereo speakers, quad microphones, and a battery that will last around 10 hours. The keyboard will be backlit, and the glass trackpad will use haptic and force detection similar to the MacBook. Google plans to fit all of this in a form factor under 10mm in thickness, notably thinner than the aforementioned Apple ultraportable. Given the MSRPs of past Pixel laptops, you might expect this is shaping up to be one costly little device, and while not cheap, Google's planned pricing is still competitive: Bison is pegged to start at $799. As I said, the Wacom stylus would be sold separately, and Google is aiming for a retail launch in Q3 2017. And by the time Bison launches, Google wants to be ready to showcase Andromeda running a variety of enterprise, developer, and stylus-driven apps on the device - a way to argue that Bison and Andromeda will create a laptop experience that is truly attempting to rival Apple and Microsoft. So, if you were wondering why there wasn't a fresh Chromebook Pixel for 2016 (and we have no reason to think one is coming on October 4th), this is probably the reason. Chromebook Pixels may well be dead as of next year - Andromeda is the way forward. What do Bison and Andromeda mean for Android, and for Android phones and tablets? Well, right now: probably not much. Google will announce its Pixel smartphones on October 4th, and they will be running Android 7.1. Google may well tease Andromeda at this event. But the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google Home, Google Wifi, Daydream View, and the new Chromecast Ultra will likely remain the focus on that day, even if an Andromeda demo manages to steal the show. Here in 2016, Google is attempting to paint a vision of a united hardware front inside the company - to legitimize the idea that Google can build consumer hardware products to compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung (at least hypothetically). Andromeda will still be off on the horizon, but there's no doubt it's a huge piece of Google's long-term strategy puzzle. But this same time next year? I think it's likely we'll see Google show us the first laptop with the power of Android and the best of Chrome OS, a truly watershed moment for Android and Google. Whether the resultant operating system, even if it is largely powered by Android underneath, will still be called Android isn't something I could hope to guess at. Maybe Google doesn't even know. But as to what it means for Chromebooks? I think the Journal had it dead on a year ago: Chrome OS and Chromebooks (perhaps with a new name) will continue, but Android with Chrome OS features baked-in, aka Andromeda, is the new hotness, and will mark a major shift in Google's OS strategy. All I can say is I really hope we get a taste of what that future looks like next week.

What i do understand that Google aims to give people with android phones the ability to Use Continuity the same way Apple does with their devices. The question is, can Google compete with true OS computer with their price tag? Aaron Given how rotten the Windows store is, I'd say it's chances are good. I have a Windows 10 convertible now and should have just saved my money. nirmitlamed I think that we should first look at the price tag. Right now Chrombook Pixel cost 1299$. With that kind of price tag most people would choose Macbook air which start at 899$ price tag and it has better OS and good support. You can even go with 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display at the same price tag (1299$). Now If we talk about PC laptops it has even more variety. For my opinion if the price tag remains high don't see how people will prefer Android+ChromeOS over true OS like Apple OS and Windows. Greyhame Their plans are to demo it with enterprise software. In other words, in their minds, it would be a "true OS". Aaron With a starting price at $799, I would give it a shot. What it can do as a productivity device is yet to be seen, of course, but even before being properly announced it's already better than Windows 10 as a 2 in 1. And iPad Pro is just iOS blown up to tablet size, which I only mention because there are no 2 in 1 MacBook options. Tl;dr If done right Andromeda could be big. It won't overthrow Windows or MacOS, but it could take a nice piece of the pie. deppman Just curious, how do you define a "true OS"? Is it one that allows complete control of your hardware? Too bad OSX, Windows, OS2, and virtually every OS ever released doesn't make the cut. Is installed user base important and number of applications? If they are, then Android far outpaces all other OS's on both fronts. Maybe its the ability to recompile the kernel and write optimized device drivers? Whoops, none of these commercial OS's allow that. Maybe its the fact that "real" OS's don't try to lock you into an ecosystem? Except, of course, Apple and MS are definitely guilty of that with iOS, OSX, Windows 10, and Windows phone. Maybe a "real OS" doesn't phone home and send keystrokes back to company servers? Oh whoops, there's Windows 10 again. According to these criteria the only "true OS's" available are various *nix distributions. So what precisely IS the criteria for a "real OS" that you are referring to? shadowx360 Not of that matters for the consumer and business that wants to get work done. I think he means a versatile OS that can run on at least laptops, desktops, and maybe servers with full featured third party software support. Basically macOS, not iOS. Something you can run a full version of Word and Photoshop on, something you can take to work and do everything you can do on a Windows or macOS machine. I can see Andromeda only really succeeding if it gets third party support or finds a way to run full featured Windows or Linux apps. Otherwise it's just the equivalent of a glorified iPad Pro. nirmitlamed You already knows what i mean you just stuck on maybe wrong choice of words. What i mean about "True OS" is the ability to do the most simple tasks and in the same time to have the ability to do a more complicity tasks for power users. I am sure you can figure out yourself what is the difference between Android+Chrome OS and Windows or Mac OS. deppman My point is there really isn't much of a difference between Android+ChromeOS vs. W10 or OSX. And what little difference exists is being systematically removed by Apple and MS respectively. They're all OSs locked into curated ecosystems. At the same time, Android and Chrome, both being OSS, have a vibrant community that allow Android to do many things that OSX and Windows can't, even without rooting or stepping outside of the Google store. My Pixel C, for example, is in many ways more capable than a MacBook Air. What you haven't figure that out for yourself yet is that your criteria for what constitutes a "real" OS are nebulous, quaint, and out of date. nirmitlamed First of all i would very love to hear about what you can do better with your Pixel C that you can't do on MacBook Air for example. About the criteria "real" OS, again don't be stuck on maybe wrong choice of words. I don't, so neither should you. For my opinion Chromebooks are for specific kind group of people and not for everyone. There are a lot of apps missing that were built over the years in Windows and MacOS from video player to editing to games and download managing and so on. Android OS is great but please don't compare its apps ecosystem to Windows and MacOS apps. Every company that has its app on different OS, build its android app to match the main idea how would one use its app on the way in the palm of their hand. There is a different between sitting on a chair in-front a computer than using your small mobile devices on the couch, bathroom and on the way. That is one of the reasons why you won't find all the same features in every OS. Surely what google is planing to its computer line is very interesting but could it really compete with Windows and Mac? i doubt that. Since you own a ChromBook computer i would love to hear your thoughts on that. Can ChromeOS do every task Windows and MacOS can? Mayur Gondhalekar I agree with you that Chrome OS is a limited OS with a specific usecase. I own a chromebook since 2 years and its my go to device for simple tasks like websurfing or streaming and even light stuff like creating word documents or excel etc. (Google docs works with conversion to MS word or excel in the end). Where it trumps Windows is its always on nature and simplicity. I never have to deal with slow moving OS or a update pop up every now and then. Especially on some new budget Win PCs you have only 32GB storage and that Win 10 update keeps killing these devices. Now if with a new OS designed for laptops, Google can create the experience of MAC then it can surely ba a hit. I dont ever see windows as competition when it comes to performance. But in terms of app availibilty, it would have to match Windows and Mac. But if it does then who knows...Honestly for stuff like playing videos or music etc most people are moving to streaming services where you do not really need native apps. What remains is work related apps and media editing apps. Skunky As you said, chromebooks are designed for certain people, or maybe even as a secondary "grab and go" computer for Mac or Windows users. the main people that will use chrome os are perhaps students (depending on what their needs are), older people who need something simplistic, people who just want to type documents, browse the web, play web based games (and future android games), facebook video chat (and use other messengers when android apps become available), photo editing (there are some pretty nice photo editors in the web store, and soon to be with android), for people who don't need all of the extras that Windows or Mac comes with. I don't know why some people have to be 1 sided, why can't people learn to evolve and find ways to use a new OS without bashing it- challenge yourself to do what you normally do on your Mac or Windows 'but on a different platform' in an alternative way. (i've learnt how to do some neat things on my chromebook and with computers in general that i wouldn't have learnt if i would have just stuck with Windows and hadn't challenged myself). VAVAMk_2 We can define what a real desktop OS isn't at least: iOS Keith Earns I second this. Criticizing google for not licensing windows or mac OS on their new laptop is ridiculous. They have an OS based off a linux kernel, linux I would classify as a "TRUE OS". Chromebook linux support has been decent, I have no reason to believe the new pixel would not support linux, and for that price it pouts some nice hardware. "Productivity" arguments are still being made? Docs/sheets/slides is really comparable to office, and if you're an editor you're probably using WP anyway so whats the problem? Glaiket Anne Clyde The burning question as to what constitutes a True OS is a subject fraught with perplexity and often extremely difficult to discern. At present my thoughts on this often controversial subject are mine and mine alone, however, for the sake of whatever i offer the following. Take any clean OS then inject with say that old favorite of theirs the sasser virus, disinfect to a certain degree, then lay back and listen to the sound it makes as it crashes through a neighbors sunroof from your penthouse geek caves. Smoke a fag, tweek ,twerk eat repeat. In no time at all you will be listening to the pitter patter of tiny zx81's romping all over your once blissfull lives. Dale Upton Wow, he meant like a laptop dude not a tablet, somthing robust enough to compete with mac os and windows, I can help you off that high horse is you like? Comment_Cop None of these things define an OS but yeah I get it, you want more control. So do I when it comes to Windows. Drew Ciccotelli I remember when people didn't pay less than 2000 for a new MacBook Pro. Drew Ciccotelli Why anyone has a Windows 10 machine now is beyond me. I'm on an XP at work and it's running the Chrome browser like a champ. Aaron I wanted a 2-in-1 so I would only have to carry one device when I travel, as opposed to a laptop and tablet, and I still needed Windows' software compatibility. Money not well spent. I would have been happier with two devices. I wanted to give 10 a chance, and 10 has been a headache. Drew Ciccotelli 10 is just them wanting to be Google but still having that Mircosoft pay to play bug up their ass. Drew Ciccotelli It's too ad heavy and Internet reliant. James Briano Oh, c'mon. We all know you're typing on one right now. Chris Why? What will this do that a surface can't? Run some android games? Nicholas Conrad Surface Pro 3 (i5) was such a disappointment it's what convinced me to try a Chromebook in the first place. Chris That's funny I went the opposite direction. I loved my chromebook but it hit a wall in usability so I switched to surface and it's been amazing. Charlie I almost can't think of any reason I'd prefer a Chromebook over a tablet with a very good add-on keyboard/sleeve/case/stand with a Bluetooth keyboard (and mouse). Except for price? Because there are some extremely cheap Chrome books out there. Drew Ciccotelli You mean a Pixel C then. Charlie For $499, it ain't bad. But I still feel like it won't be beating Android when it comes to apps and versatility. But I do like the design, yes. That hardware plus Android, I'd be willing to at least test that out for a couple of months. Definitely. Nicholas Conrad It was too big and heavy to use as a tablet for any length of time, and the type-cover kickstand combination made it precarious at best as a laptop substitute. The type-cover itself was a pretty terrible typing experience, and the offset trackpad, while probably comfortable for right-handers, was incredibly cramped and awkward to use as a left-hander. The SP4 type cover improved in those areas somewhat. Windows 10 has gotten a lot better over time, but at launch there were several driver issues with it that were super frustrating being MS hardware. Not least of which was it would often go completely dark when removed from the dock, requiring a hard reset to wake again. With no status LEDs, even performing a reset on it was oddly difficult and frustrating. The only thing that was genuinely awesome about it was the pen, but that only ever really worked in onenote. And all of that comming in at several hundred dollars more than an equivalently speced mac, which I used to mock for being so overpriced.... Yeah, I bought a $200 redurb Dell Chromebook, and have been much happier with a real keyboard and which I can actually use on my lap. I gave the surface back to work and just used the Chromebook instead. It works as well as, or better than Windows for 95% of everything I need to do. Occasionally I run into CrOS limitations, but I have an old Windows box I can boot up when needed. Drew Ciccotelli What did the Chromebook cost and how much was the Surface? Charlie How about just run Android in general. With the ease of use and versatility of all that Android has to offer: not only things like the Play Store support with all it's apps but maybe also more manufacturers willing to take the plunge and invest and make these type of devices? And how about price? Some people are also just done with Windows. And all it's iterations/versions. I'm one of them. I'll go with Android (Remix OS for instance) and Ubuntu any day over WIndows 10. But that's a matter of taste, even so, still means I'd prefer Andromeda over Windows 10. Chris You're sick of all the different versions and you're going to android...not the best choice. I don't see myself being able to use android for work in the foreseeable future. I used a chromebook for 75% of my master's degree until it just literally was not possible to use anymore and I got a cheap SP3 and man that thing is just amazing. Charlie But... Things might be looking a bit different in a year, when this comes out? Which is why they might be developing it? Plus, it depends on what your needs are. I have a work PC at work. Which will either be Windows or macOS. I know some companies that have been trying Ubuntu though. It depends on what type of job you have, if Windows is really necessary. But for personal use. I think I could get by fine on Android. Chris For sure android will do everything for personal use for me also. I dunno. We've been told so many times the updates would get better I've given up. Remember the update alliance? hahaha Charlie That's true. But Pixel does indicate Nexus, which means with this specific device... You might be alright. Plus Google could try and pull an Android Wear/Auto on us... Hardware (with minimum requirements) left up to device manufacturers, but software updates are handled by (mostly) Google. juanjeremy2012 why not just a plain laptop Deckard_Cain Just wish they would also include a dedicated GPU. :( AMD's open-source drivers for Linux are even in great shape. xsilas43 AMD does not develop for the mobile platform, so for the laptop maybe but not in the width they are going for. Dan Gul Zen platform might change that. We might see AMD in these in the second iteration of these machines. Who knows. Depends on how well AMD executes on Zen. Kian Ronald Grey LOL Thats a joke. Jay T Intel's iGPU's are now pretty fast and efficient. My current laptop has an i5-6200U with a HD520 GPU, and it can play fairly intense games at 1080p without breaking a sweat. Also, when not doing anything intense I get 6-10 hours of battery life. techfreak243 it's never outdated. PVL_93_RU It's too good to be outdated Evan Nope! Here you go: http://www.reactiongifs.us/shut-up-and-take-my-money/ Pedram Haghzaban So, is there any thing good for Pixel C? ConCal Finally something new and exciting from Google. Borgman https://media.giphy.com/media/RNSpxCwwbl5Vm/giphy.gif John http://i.imgur.com/AC6KSFn.gif Good_Ole_Pinocchio AP is crushing with the leaks... As usual... but I WANT IT!.... No I haven't read the Article yet, but I want it! aliablow It's been a while since Google managed to spark genuine interest and anticipation. But this... What a time to be alive, indeed! So much hype for the 4th! Ash At this rate, I'm convinced Google is going to stop sending you invites to press events if you keep leaking their major plans like this. Rita El Khoury That's one option. The other is that Google secretly hates to love AP or loves to hate it. John Doe It is not the AP, the problem is with Google. The WSJ already leaked this a while back so Google needs to control their employees. Bewear I know this might sound pointless, but I hope you can install the OS of your preference on it. John Doe Will Andromeda be the next version of Android? Meaning, will the Pixel phones and other devices will be upgraded to it and have all the devices under one OS or like Apple (macOS, OSx, etc.)? aliablow If Android becomes Andromeda, I can only imagine the level of fragmentation. Perhaps Google found a way to tackle that issue once and for all with seamless updates similar to Chromebooks. One can only hope. Just_Some_Nobody Google needs to drop the Java runtime and go with something else. This might be a good time to do it. They could keep the old java runtime as a backwards compat. layer, but kill it for all new development. Midas Gordon-Farleigh I'm just wondering when you guys are going to rename to Andromeda Police. Todd At least they won't need to change the AP logo. L3Chiffre Domain name "andromedapolice.com" was registered yesterday... devilfriend lol seriously though, I wonder how many XDA-Developers users know what an XDA is. PVL_93_RU Well it derived from PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) so I guess the XDA has a same meaning? JL Maybe Andromeda is Android 8. Leonard Wong Getting poor @ 2017 Rita El Khoury You're waiting until 2017 to get poor? I'm getting poorer way before. SimonSaid 8 days, to be precise. bdbplatano That seems like forever away, can't wait. 😬 SimonSaid Does AP have any idea whether this is solely a laptop OS or whether it is ultimately destined for phones and tablets too? David Ruddock It's hard to know without having a much more detailed understanding of Google's vision, and we just don't. If I were to speculate, I'd say that there'd be a single OS Google will push commercially (maybe still called Android), and that certain devices like laptops and large tablets would be able to use certain features that would particularly benefit their form factor (like Chrome OS's windowed operation). Even if it this stuff would be baked into every Android device, some of it would only be exposed for certain hardware / interfaces. This could also allow for Continuum style functionality a la Windows 10, where your phone could "project" a desktop operating environment. But again: that is complete speculation. I doubt even Google fully understands where they want to go with this yet. SimonSaid Thanks, David. I suppose what everyone wants to know is whether this will finally solve Android's 'Update Problem'. Hopefully we'll soon learn enough about Andromeda's architecture to answer this question. All aboard the hype train! Alex I personally hope the codename Andromeda lives on to production. Such a cool name. Roger Siegenthaler And that google doesn't know yet is scary, MS knew over 10 years ago when they started minwin and dropped development of CE that they wanted to get one OS/Kernel on all devices and it still took them so long and numerous restarts to get there. Now how many restarts and how long does it take a company without a plan now to achieve this. David Ruddock I'm not a developer or engineer (obviously), but I think the smartphones of today are a lot more like laptops than the smartphones (and proto-smartphones) of 10 years ago. Microsoft was trying to solve a much harder problem there - bringing an ancient OS never designed for mobile to mobile. Android already does x86 and ARM, and it uses the Linux kernel. I don't think there's much to stop Android from running on a laptop (hell, Android laptops, crappy ones, exist), so much as there hasn't been a good reason to run it on a laptop. I don't really think the projects are comparable - Google's is much more a question of "why" than "how." Roger Siegenthaler That's assuming Linux is really capable of what NT is now, which I have serious doubts about considering google's public dumping of linux for embedded/IoT tech and is trying to replace it with fuchsia on every platform. I have the feeling if the world's largest user of a kernel says (paraphrased) "this kernel does not scale well" you're going to believe them and not just say that linux can do so with no problems. It's definetely easier for google then for MS but not so much that the engineering part is "easy" Syukri Lajin that is why google work on more than 1 projects at the same time :P no actual direction, just see which work the best, kill the others, start new projects with slightly different objective, and repeat. Justin W So, Honeycomb vs. Gingerbread. Got it. On a serious note, I'd love some continuity features. Google seems to be going in the wrong direction with that when it comes to their messaging app (Allo), but I'm hoping they're truly working to better that and the overall continuity features in Android. Defenestratus RIP Android? demarcmj Probably just those RIP to those Android quasi-laptop, tablet-with-keyboard things that like 10 people ever bought anyway. Defenestratus Yeah I'm a kickstarter backer of the superbook which has real appeal for me. Not so sure anymore. philosopher_Mk More like RIP Chrome os, this is Android for laptops. Suicide_Note Maybe. Just maybe. bdbplatano I wonder how this all fits in (if at all) with fuchsia ConCal RIP Jide Carson Saldanha Lol yep 😂 Google coming directly at Remix OS. Tho Remix works on Windows/Mac PCs so... Stephen Sharp I mean, after all, Google Drive killed Box, Google+ killed Facebook, Google Docs killed Office Quite frankly, Google has a history of killing nothing except its own products XD Ace killed all but fb AJE Google Doc did not kill Office. Office is still the king especially in business. jesuguru He forgot the /s ConCal I mean those are a bit different. Jide isn't Microsoft or Facebook. Jide just got off the ground this year. No way can you say Jide is the Facebook or Microsoft of their space. Carson Saldanha Hell no Justin W Probably no. bugdroid Nope. Good_Ole_Pinocchio This shall now be called - "MAJOR BISON" http://www.sumthing.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SF13.png person Likely what the name is referring to in the first place :P Good_Ole_Pinocchio No no no... Don't take my credit away! I coined the term... Now i shall collect my 10 cents for every mention. PVL_93_RU It's Master, not Major Qbancelli I have a hard time getting excited about something that won't launch for at least a year. bort118 I don't!! AHHHH!! bdbplatano Especially when dealing with Google thartist Maybe not everything is about GETTING EXCITED. But yeah, it might be that far because Andromeda needs some time yet to reach 1.0 Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is going to be amazing!!!! Dmitriy Romanov These leaks are going really out of hand. There is no surprises anymore just because someone from google leaks all shit to AP. Nayners People want leaks, then don't want leaks. Your comment type gets old. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You do realize that AP is in the business of providing news/leaks? And news they have brought. Thanks, AP! aliablow Actually for me, these leaks actually pique interest cause a lot of the details are unknown. Think of these as a teaser or a trailer for a movie. Dmitriy Romanov Yeah. Nowadays movie trailers can tell everything about movie and even main plot. Thats what AP is doing with these exclusives Jarrett Lennon Kaufman How awful of them to dare release news that, if they didn't, someone else would. Awful of them to do their jobs. Dan It will then be discontinued in Q1 2018 when Google pivots to a new strategy of running [insert new software here] on [insert new device here]. Such is the experience of those who buy Google's consumer devices thinking, "No, really, this time Google is really committed to this product line!" Defenestratus Yes. So much this. PerhapsNever But, there are actually quite a few of their products that they are still supporting (and enhancing)... Chromecast, for instance. Nope.jpeg What did the Chromebook say to the Pixel 3? "Bison." Cod3rror I have to agree. One thing that Apple has that neither Google nor Microsoft (new MS) has is that Apple comes up with a long term plan and sticks to it and so far their long term visions setup by Steve Jobs have been on point. With Google everything is in beta. And with Microsoft, it's always "wait for the next version, that one will be great!". Sk0ly The one thing Apple has is users that will literally buy any piece of crap they roll into their apple store showcase. Cod3rror What a foolish thing to say. Whether you like to admit or stick your hand in the sand and deny, is that Apple makes very good products. iPhone is still the gold standard for quality. The same with Mac, the same with Macbook, iPad (Android tablets. Remember them?), watch (remember the beta version Android watches?). Sk0ly Apple makes good quality devices overall, I won't deny that but I wouldn't call them a "gold standard" at this point. They have had issues related to quality on the last three iPhones. Bendgate where your phone bends under normal use, antennagate where you are "holding it wrong". And yes, I think the use of gate in every issue is dumb. I actually disagree that the Apple watch is a superior product. The OS is really terribly thought out and yet it is the best selling. Why? Because it is Apple. Bottom line, Apple users will buy whatever Apple tells them to. That is a general statement but rings very true. The company was so arrogant that they thought they could sell a $15,000 Apple Watch. On the software front, it is a really bad situation. Apple Maps is absolute garbage (although it has improved) and Apple Music is still a way crappier service with Apps that aren't on par with Spotify or Google Music. The point I was making is that they force people to buy products, adaptors, accessories to stay within their ecosystem. They preach sustainability but use proprietary connectors and force people to buy overpriced adapters that add to e-waste globally. The Macbook is a nice piece of hardware but I'm sorry, OSX is not as good of an OS as Windows. It seems to have cornered a niche in design and editing but anyone who knows computers will tell you about its limitations. As far as tablets go you are correct. Android tablets have not delivered and the iPad ecosystem has flourished as a result. Bottom line, Apple is not perfect, far from it. Cod3rror Apple is not perfect, but it's the closest one to it out of three (Apple, Google, Microsoft). Apple sells expensive products, everybody knows that. You pay for tech + "luxury", they simply would not be able to sell cheap products, look at iPhone 5c. As for the ecosystem, you either go by Apple's ecosystem or you don't get an Apple product. If you use the product the way Apple intended it to be used, you'll really enjoy it and have a great time, that's what most people do and they are quite happy about it. I personally don't, so I don't use Apple products. But for an average person, Apple is the easiest, most seamless experience out there. Apple also provides the easiest backup/restore functionality, something that Google still does not properly do. Next, let's talk about support, if you buy an iPhone, you will get support for at least 4 years, this is something no Android or Microsoft phone can claim. Hell, Google does not even support Nexus properly, as I mentioned, everything is a beta with them. At any moment they might change their mind, or scrap it and do something else, there is no feeling of stability. As for services, Google has a huge lead on Apple on services, which are not Apple's strong point. But Google's own services work better and are better designed on Apple's products. I cannot comment about OSX itself, just the hardware, so I will take your word for it. Personally, I don't have much interest in it, and I too prefer Windows to OSX and even to Linux. However, most people that I know that tried OSX, switched. Finally, Apple innovates, even though many people don't like to admit it, they do push things forward. They pushed the retina screen, they pushed the fingerprint sensor, etc... Watch as future phones have pressure sensitivity and haptic feedback. Hrishikesh Bisen Well actually Android Watch OS is wrost in all Watch OS Sk0ly Let's try that again in English Charlie Well, Android is here for 8 years isn't it? And Nexus phones/Pixel products are also still being supported? No? AlRegals Google TV...... Sk0ly Bad example. Google TV was ahead of its time and the Cablecos were the ones who murdered that platform, not google. If we are doing a comparison, how about the Microsoft Courier or Windows Phone 7 or Apple with the Newton. PVL_93_RU Android TV is dead too though Sk0ly Hahaha you are joking right? You realize like 80% of television manufacturers this year are shipping TVs running Android TV right? On top of that, google is aggressively backing the Xiaomi mii box. I do wish for a pixel player one day though. Hrishikesh Bisen Where did you get this figures, Although I'm sure Samsung and LG doesn't support Android TV. Sk0ly Sony, Sharp, Philips, Vizio, RCA, Hisense, etc. I'll admit that stat was a bit overzealous when considering Samsung Smart TV and the recently purchased WebOS for LG. With that said, Sony, Philips, and Sharp sell a lot of TVs and Android tv is a way better experience. I love my Nexus player, albeit a bit buggy but would love to see a pixel branded Android tv box but I doubt that would happen. Sk0ly OK, maybe 80% was pushing it but the list of OEM's is very long. Sony, Sharp, Philips, Hisense, Vizio, TCL, RCA, Bang & Olafsen, Vestel, Arcelik Pretty much the only major manufacturers not on board are LG because they bought WebOS from HP and have invested in it, Samsung because they have years of investment into their platform, and Panasonic because they don't care about a decent smarttv platform. Of that list, the first three sell a lot of TV's (Sony/Sharp/Philips) and the smaller vendors are on the rise. https://www.statista.com/statistics/267095/global-market-share-of-lcd-tv-manufacturers/ Samsung & LG combined for about 30% of the market last year and are on the decline. Having used all three platforms, Android TV is by far the best experience. Android TV added a ton of OEM's this year and I expect that to continue as Samsung and LG will not be able to compete on developers. This is because A. There is already a large community of Android Developers so they don't need to learn to code for a new platform and B. It will be on more brands, reducing the need to create a variety of different apps for different platforms. Charlie So we agree that it can go either way? thartist You're quite right, but at least at this point it's not about branching into unnecessary experiments like ChromeOS, but converging OSs. And in the end it all aims to converge on Fuchsia, the one for all, like Microsoft did with Windows 8+. browngeek Port it to the Pixel C already! David Ruddock It's already been said to us that Google is using Pixel C as a test platform for Andromeda (as 9to5G said, they also used N9, but we think they've moved on), but before people go nuts: that doesn't necessarily mean anything in terms of Pixel C ever getting Andromeda officially. browngeek Juicy! Read on Android Authority that the N9 was being tested, but no mention of the Pixel C. Faheem Ahmed ONLY IF THEY MAKE ANDROID SO POWERFUL....THAT IT COULD RIVAL WINDOWS 10(AMAZING FEATURES AND SOOOO MUCH SETTINGS AND STUFF) THEN someone755 I think Microsoft crippled Windows 10 enough that you'd only need support for running Windows programs (Steam, Adobe CS, Office etc.) and enough drivers to support the majority of today's devices to take over people's computers with your own OS. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Crippled in what way, exactly? Windows 10's their best desktop OS yet. Andromeda will need to rival it for me to switch. someone755 For me, every way. There is nothing better in w10 than in w8.1. The Start menu is a mess, the updates are just horribly executed ("Hey, do you want this upda-- TOO LATE WE INSTALLED IT ALREADY AND REMOVED A PROGRAM YOU WERE USING"), the fact they're trying to force their mobile apps in a desktop environment by making a crippled Settings app etc. I miss Charms, the Start screen, and a less-shitty version of Windows Update, along with a better Control Panel. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Interesting. I've found it to be consistently better in nearly every way except for tablet experience, which I rarely use, and which has been improved dramatically anyway. You're literally the first person I've seen prefer 8.1. Normally everybody hates 8.x with a passion for irrational reasons. someone755 I really don't understand the hate. Compared to Windows 7, so little was changed, -- other than some minor design tweaks, the Start screen and Charms, very little was changed -- and it could easily be used as a desktop platform, without the silly apps and Store being shoved down your throat. And most of the Settings app's options were still available through the Control Panel and elsewhere. I don't get who dictates to these people what to like and what to religiously hate, but there has got to be a site or magazine that tells people what's popular right now. Because there is no reason why people would just unanimously agree that something sucks this much. Roger Siegenthaler Ignoring all the group policies and enterprise related stuff what you're suggesting is still a massive amount of work. Let alone the driver part is a massive issue. Lare2 All sound nice ..... But where's Allo .? someone755 Allo? You mean the already released and lame chatting app? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Allo? On the Play Store already? Lare2 I guess a "/s" was necessary .. LOL Suicide_Note https://media1.giphy.com/media/g1xNFWSvnnFJu/giphy.gif jesuguru ...for liposuction Suicide_Note Among other things. blindexecutioner What the pixel C should have been. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman And likely was supposed to be. Stevie_Wonder Teasing it the 4th, presenting it start of next year, telling us it will release soon at the end of next year, buying it in Q2 of 2018 and a year or 2 later the whole thing is abandoned. I really hope not, but one can not be a bit pessimistic with all the stuff Google is doing and not doing anymore. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman This is a touch different from some communications app. This sounds like the entire direction of the most successful software platform Google has, combined with the second most successful software platform Google has. Stevie_Wonder I totally agree. Wasn't referring to only the communication-app-maze Google is dropping it's users in. But with all the name changes (Nexus to Pixel, Chromecast to Cast) and the doubt around support (will the old Nexus get the new updates from 7.1 and the launcher the Pixels will get) and slow release of products around the world, Google isn't really strong in building a lifetime platform. Except, over time, with Android. Chrome OS still has to prove itself in my eyes and while I really hope this is going to work, I think they should've done this from the start.. and with announcing things way ahead of release, the hype train goes to another station. Yes, combining their most successful software platforms (do they have others?) sounds great, but they should've done it earlier and should already be able to bring it out, instead of a year later. Grimmjow Meh krazyfrog Hardware aside, what sort of third party app ecosystem are we talking about here? The laughable Android tablet apps? The utterly hilarious Chrome OS "apps"? Or something completely new? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman The former, but with a push to make them actually happen. philosopher_Mk Probably Android apps + desktop version of Chrome browser. PVL_93_RU That's Chrome OS TedPhillips and GoogleTV alexg Yeah what about the watches?? Justin W Well, considering Chromebooks run Android apps and they look just fine (you'll recall that Android 7.0 added easy resizability, I'm sure), I'd expect Android appsand Chrome (with all it's extensions and apps) in a desktop-browser version. Andrew Bone And it's all built on Fuchsia... Right? bdbplatano That's what I was wondering too. Surely they have to have some kind of interplay philosopher_Mk Nope,have you read the article ? Andrew Bone Yes, Android is built on top of the Linux platform (as is Chrome OS). I was just wondering if they might swap that out for Fuchsia. David Ruddock No. It's built on Android. Andrew Bone So Linux (as the underbelly of Android) could not be swapped out with Fuchsia? I just presumed that would be the only reason google would start at the bottom and work their way up. Carson Saldanha He didn't read ur article lol Captain_Invisible That's IoT... right? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I would personally wager that a break from the Android name might come with this. Because if this is going to be a desktop-class OS, then the entire control of updates and other factors needs to shift to Google for the first time for ALL devices. That requires a fundamental rethinking of how the OS works with OEMs and how it's presented to consumers from them, which to me would justify a new name so people can confidently recognize the difference. Captain_Invisible Andromeda would be such a cool name, but I doubt it's going to be anything but a code name. Jared I dunno, if you squint real hard you can combine Android and Chrome to make And-rome-da or Andr-ome-da. Basically Android+Chrome?... Da (Russian for yes). jesuguru Chrandroid? _jsw_ Bison Savings Account: Activated! (if it's a dud, I can always buy the 2018 Pixel XXL) Yura Kazimirov Can it run Overwatch is the real question! David Prieto "Via merging Chrome features into Android, not vice versa" So, what type of features are we talking about? David McClellan I'm assuming this is multiwindow support, not just split screen. An application "dock" as opposed to a launcher, and extension support I would assume. Also having access to ChromeOS/Desktop Chrome API's would be awesome for webapp integration. David Prieto What API again? philosopher_Mk Desktop ui,desktop browser, seamless updates , better right click support, multi window . David Prieto Yeah, those seem to make sense and are already on their way to being implemented, or don't look like they'd be a lot of work But then it wouldn't be "merging" Android and Chrome OS, as much as turning Android into a usable desktop system and ditching Chrome OS. Would it? philosopher_Mk Yes, I guess they are just making Android more usable desktop system and ditching Chrome os. It makes sense , Android is their most successful product since Google search. David Ruddock We'd like to know, too! But at this point, we don't. David Prieto It can be fun to speculate tho :-P Jason Allen They already did the boot feature. Maybe the other features are security features like the chrome OS reboot to reset everything. David Ruddock Sure - seamless updates is definitely the first big one. Itchy_Robot Let us know if you hear anything about better security updates. I really love how my 8 year old Asus windows 7 (updated to Win10 for free) still gets security updates. I hope Google is trying to eventually move to that model rather than the "2.5 years and your out" model they currently have. The way the OS is structured now relies on 3rd parties implementing the security updates rather than Google pushing it directly to the user. I hope one day Google can get their OS in shape to handle 'direct to the consumer' security updates. Captain_Invisible Updates. Zaptor99 Google is exhausting !!!! Carson Saldanha I have a feeling it'll be like the Surface Pro's. It'll run full Android in tablet mode and Chrome OS in laptop mode. b_boogey_xl Is this how they plan on taking control of Android? By making another OS but this time they have full control over it… 🤔 J3R3MY_H Not sure what Andromeda does for me that Android apps in ChromeOS doesn't do. Hopefully I'll understand better next week. a.d.AM And why do I want this? What will it do that Android or Chrome OS hasn't done? I've never once said "oh, I have to pull out my Chromebook to take care of this task." This will flop just like Allo. Stephen Sharp People have been pushing for Android as a desktop OS since before it was even really a tablet os pfmiller It's never made sense to me why people have wanted that though. Neither the OS nor the apps are well suited to desktop use. Stephen Sharp How so? I grant you the chicken & the egg problem of scalable Android apps, but I believe that's what Android apps are for on ChromeOS - a trojan horse, or a red carpet, getting developers to get their apps ready for this But, how is Android not suited for a desktop besides UI (which will be solved when Google actually ships Android for a particular formfactor and not before) pfmiller It's just designed for a touch screen which does not make for a good desktop experience. Sure, you can rework the whole interface of the OS and apps to make them work on a desktop, but why? There are already desktop OSs and applications that do everything you need. Stephen Sharp Why have the same ecosystem for your Laptop, Phone, Tablet, Car, TV (Console for me thanks to Shield), and Watch, pay-once-run-everywhere? No no you're right I don't know what I was thinking :P Stephen Sharp That's still just UI. Nothing inherently wrong with the OS for Desktop use. And if Jide (the behemoth that it is) can make Android work nice on a desktop, surely Google can. As for why, buy-once-run-everywhere apps. Also, Android is awesome because reasons thats why mattcoz It will hopefully deliver a full-fledged desktop OS, that's what Android and Chrome OS haven't done. a.d.AM But what will it do that OSs have not been able to do previously? Combining them givess me more apps I guess, but I've never felt any lack of apps. If you're telling me it'll run apps that Android or Chrome could never run, that would be something! Being able to use apps like Paper, Traktor, and other iOS only apps would be huge. But i have a feeling it'll be another google fail. Combine 2 OSs with no additional benefits. Typical modern innovation. mattcoz Apps (ugh, I still hate that word) are not the issue here. Android and Chrome OS have never been viable alternatives to Windows or OSX or any decent Linux distro. Will Andromeda? Time will tell. Wes C >But the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google Home, Google Wifi, Daydream View, and the new Chromecast Ultra will likely remain the focus on that day Have we forgotten about the smartwatches?? I really need to replace my OG G Watch... http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/07/11/exclusive-these-could-be-googles-upcoming-android-wear-smartwatches/ Chris Yessss I would love a nice replacement for my Gear Live thartist Smartwatches are a fad gone. br_hermon Flood of thoughts running through my head but 1st thoughts... "Android" as a beloved brand and I hope Google sticks with it to brand this going forward. Samsung must be prepping for full court press with Tizen right now and see the "writing on the wall" in terms of Google's current/past Android / OEM relationship structure. Cory Wilson I just hope as far as updates go, it's more chrome OS in those regards m0ritz They should just develop it for the Pixel C... This tablet was planned to run Chrome OS... And it's still the strongest tablet on the market. Stephen Sharp Maybe they will offer the option, who knows Captain_Invisible By then it will be about two years old, so I really doubt that. mattcoz They should just develop it for what would be 2 year old hardware? How does that make any sense? roberto.elena What a downer, I wanted to buy a chromebook (a decent one) later this year or early next year, as soon as the Android apps on Chrome OS became a stable option, but now... too many unknowns for the future of current chromebooks. Stephen Sharp Get a refurbed Chromebook Flip to hold you over roberto.elena Unfortunately the availability of Chromebooks is not so good in my country compared to the US. TigerMike901 Well, given the info, I guess I can't wait to see some kind of demo to see the real benefits of Andromeda. Right now I just can't imagine it could do more for me than ChromeOS with Android apps baked in. I mean honestly, I don't really see much of a difference in merging the two to form Andromeda. Stephen Sharp Well in a few years it will do one thing better than Android Apps on Chromebooks: it will still exist. If this is true, it makes more sense than Android Apps on Chromebooks, and Android on Chromebooks are either the trojan horses to get developers to finally make Android Apps that scale well for a laptop formfactor, or a swan song and a parting gift (or maybe both) Scott Miller Correction: Android apps on Chromebooks did not descend from the ARC project. They ditched that approach in favor of a full Android subsystem. This was actually a critical argument in court with Oracle recently. David Ruddock That's correct. The initial approach (ARC) wasn't utilized, but as you said, a new one then emerged. Sorry if the language there was inartful - I meant more that it descended theoretically, not technically. I was just trying to show that it had no relationship to the Andromeda project, not trying to imply that ARC itself powered Android apps on Chrome OS (this was also asked at I/O, where Google gave a similar answer about ARC being abandoned). Quentin SILVESTRE I think their comment is more about the general idea behind the two approaches. Sure the tech changed a lot, but it was still inspired by the desire to have android apps working on chrome os. Andromeda is a merger of two OSes and is a much bigger project. Meaning : Knowing andromeda was a long way off, they probably figured they should find a way to bring android apps to chrome os as we know it today. Plus it gives time and hardware for developpers to prepare for a version of android that would span acrosse multiple form factors. Rocco Augusto While Google did ditch ARC technology as an extension that could be loaded into Chrome, they still do refer to the Android subsystem/container as ARC in the Chrome OS code base. So technically, you're both right. :) JD I don't know. Based on how Google's past hardware undertakings have been I don't really want to pay premium dollars to be a beta tester. Announcements like this setup Surface level expectations. Looking at the Pixel C that was definitely not Surface level polished product. It was and still is a half finished work in progress, and with Google only promising 24 months of major releases I'm tired of paying to be a beta tester just to be abandoned with a half finished product. If they promised 3-4 years of support I might jump or if the technology allowed for a windows type experience where I could upgrade drivers(I know that's not how it works). At this point Google seems to be going in a paradigm shift, I'm going to sit back and wait till they settle in and head towards to polish phase (Which I don't think they'll ever head in). I'm just a bit tired of the throw everything at the wall and see what sticks approach, they need focus. Patrick Plante If they bake us a full compliant Android device that has a full Chome browser, I'm sold, that would the the exact thing I would want, best of both world. You could add real multi-window management and that would do the trick. Not talking about side by side here, while useful, I would like to get real window management. Stephen Sharp This + full access to Bash (maybe in a developer mode) and I wouldn't need anything else :P Patrick Plante Forgot that, you're right! Stephen Sharp I suppose the same people asking "why" now asked "why" in 2010* when Google first started beta testing Chromebooks, and this makes more sense than ChromeOS did back then. ChromeOS doesn't do anything that Android can't, merely things that Android currently doesn't do David Ruddock This is an excellent way to put it, and I've long thought something similar. Android has huge advantages over Chrome for hardware extensibility, content ecosystem, and developer support. One of those you could maybe, eventually replicate in Chrome OS. But two you could not. PVL_93_RU By content ecosystem - do you mean apps/programs? And is developer support an issue for ChromeOS when they're bringing over millions of Android apps and extensions aren't going away from Chrome? jesuguru Is running Android apps in a subsystem on ChromeOS the same as running natively on Android/Andromeda? PVL_93_RU good point, of course Native will be superior TedPhillips i would strongly disagree about 'hardware extensibility'. crOS's sane approach to hardware is exactly why there is no update lag, OEM churn, premature EOL of devices, or platform software fragmentation. android's approach to hardware is spaghetti meets wall, and first one to drop support after the sale - wins. Patrick Plante Someone knows if the october 4th event is livestreamed? If yes, someone has a link that will stream it and/or the exact time of the event, including UTC. Thanks. TigerMike901 Google usually live streams these things on Youtube....but the link probably won't be up until the 4th. sleepinlight So, there's really no news on what this means for phones? I'll be honest, this is cool and all, but this is probably the least interesting way that this news could have taken shape for me. I was really hoping this would be more about fixing problems with Android on phones (updates/fragmentation, poor way of handling background services, performance issues) than putting Android on a laptop. Duder12 Huh? They already are by ignoring the OEMs and doing their own thing. The pixel line will finally give them the control of the software/hardware they need. pfmiller The Nexus phones already gave them the control of the software they needed. He's talking about for devices that Google doesn't control. Stephen Sharp Why not both? They could be starting in a formfactor that OEMS haven't cared about, so "wrestling control" from them wouldn't be a problem. Google learns how best to do updates, then they come for the Android TVs, then the tablets, then smartwatches, then phones Antics Uh oh. Concern: will "Android" remain alive as available to anyone via AOSP but "Andromeda" is Google's proprietary fork (akin to the Nexus factory images) or new proprietary OS (as the article[s] suggest) and will only be available for Google's devices as to try to compete with Apple's other computing solutions? Meaning, "Andromeda" may never end up on other manufacturer's excellent hardware. Duder12 So the other manufacturers can ruin he operating system and the brand like they do now? No thank you! I dont need Andromeda Touchwiz Samsung laptops. Railwayman Other manufacturers can't 'ruin' anything if Google put certain rules in place. You should compare with Windows Phone 7 - it launched on devices from HTC, LG and Samsung - all of them running a similar OS with some small differences. You could also look at desktop Windows and Linux, which runs on several different computers despite being the same system (Ubuntu is always Ubuntu regardless of brand name of the computer). Andromeda will fail IF Google attempt to make it 'in-house' only but will be successful if they make it available for other OEMs - with strict requirements of allowed modifications (i.e. they can bundle with different apps and services but not touch the system itself). KChristainsen pass Adithya Pc Inb4 Andromeda Police comments Defenestratus I already checked the domain registrar and its been taken :P alexg None needs that grizzlyjon83 I just can't see ChromeOS sticking around for too long after Andromeda. It'll be the Windows RT of the Google world. Duder12 Yep I agree TigerMike901 Whether ChromeOS exists after Andromenda or not, Google has to support it for a few more years to come. ChromeOS saw a big adoption in the education space, and abandoning it would surely leave a sour taste for many after making the large investments. I think it will either be around or be supported for a while, and then Andromeda will fully take over. In Google's End of Life document on Chromebooks, many models are stated to be supported up to 2020, and some recent models through 2021. Stephen Sharp I don't see them abandoning it at all. Quite frankly ChromeOS already does all it needs to do for those who adopted it, and add Android apps to the mix and it does more than enough. It can live on on the backburner for a while merely getting Chrome browser and security updates, and hopefully, eventually, users of ChromeOS will see Andromeda doing everything they need and more, and switch over grizzlyjon83 That's a fair point about the education space. Regardless, it'll probably get phased out eventually, but it will make it more of a slow death. deppman ah, come on. ChromeOS isn't *that* bad :) PVL_93_RU I don't think they need to spend too much resources to support it though. They basically roll the updates out at the same time as Chrome for other platforms, since the software department is entirely on Google's part and the OEMs only provide the hardware (the Chromebooks), so the worst that can happen is it will slowly fade away as Andromeda takes over both mobile and desktop class of Google products Mix My dad told me his favorite animal before he walked out the door and something bad happened to him but I will never forget it, Bison...... I am hoping that the phone and 7" tablet are not $600+ CAD...fingers crossed PVL_93_RU inb4 no LTE capability David Ruddock That doesn't actually seem to be planned at the moment. But it could change. PVL_93_RU Well the Pixel C still doesn't have an LTE version either so... I'm not holding my breath :( Ace AP has pretty much stripped Google off from any surprises in Oct 4th, we know almost everything now...it'll now be like attending the event as deja vu Joris Griffioen Yeah, kinda sad really. Unless they come with some real surprises. Like non-fugly Pixel phones for instance... PVL_93_RU That's what always happens though. Still excited for the event, since we don't EXACTLY know how the whole Andromeda thing is gonna work or look etc Blac Chyna instagram Google is planning a new Pixel laptop to be released in Q3 2017. The project, known internally as 'Bison' and by the informal nickname 'Pixel 3,' will likely be the first brand-new device to showcase Google's combined Android / Chrome OS 'Andromeda' operating system in a laptop form factor. Bison, then, would be the culmination of years of work by Google's Pixel team and Google's Android and Chrome OS teams. wrkerr At first glance of the headline, I read a Pixel 3' laptop, and so I started imagining a laptop with a 36" screen. :) TJStrat Looks like Google is inspired by Microsoft. A PC OS which runs apps. This sounds like Windows 10 to me. Nick Interesting. Developer driven apps. Would be pretty cool to see a suite of android development apps on their new platform, but not sure the market needs to be skewed anymore like the messaging scene. Now if only I didn't have to have a mac to develop for iOS, sigh. Still is exciting though. jon I seen this coming years ago. i hope google releases the os in a iso format. but probably not Marko Šaric Cool, I guess. More expensive shit that I can't afford but would like to. Anyway, all I would be doing on that laptop would be refreshing Android police 8 times a day and watching YouTube. keithzg For that you could probably just hook a monitor and keyboard up to a Raspberry Pi ;) Madis After all this, why was the original article about Andromeda claimed to be wrong then? To discourage leaks? http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/10/29/wsj-google-reportedly-plans-to-merge-chrome-into-android-form-single-new-os-in-2017/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/11/02/google-refutes-rumors-of-chrome-os-merging-with-android-says-its-here-to-stay/ person Technically nothing has changed. They've said that Android and Chrome weren't merging but that they'd bring the best of each platform to the other. Design and apps are coming to ChromeOS though whatever will end up in Andromeda is yet to be known. Both still exist and there is no 'merger'. Madis Both still exist and there is no 'merger'. Well, yes, because it's still 2016. They could "bring the best" from/to each other, but if Andromeda is real, I bet at least one of those OSs (Chrome OS) will still be discontinued eventually, ending up with a merge. Maybe if phones get better, they'll discontinue Android too and use Andromeda with wired full computer capabilities (you know, Continuum). person Potential has no bearing on intent or feasibility. Regardless of whether a merger could happen at some point in the indefinite future, as it stands now that is not the case. ChromeOS and Android coexist; there is no merger. Jordan L take my money. bugdroid Ok. Lawrence Q3 2017 ZzzZzzZz Sarath Chandra Gullapalli Is the Andromeda name confirmed for commercial launch? Or will it be Android Desktop a la Android Wear? TigerMike901 Android Desktop running Andromeda? :) Jamie Moore Q3 of 2017? Glad I got my Pixel LS... keithzg And I'm still choked that Google refused to sell me one, although admittedly I rarely use a laptop. 1pixel What a time to be alive Deckard_Cain Why no dedicated GPU??? Stephen Sharp For Android games? They aren't there yet bmlsayshi As a person who loves Android and finds it vastly preferable to the alternatives... I have to ask why? Why kill Chrome OS like that? It's different enough and single purposed enough. I don't wan't Chrome on Android. I don't even care about Android on Chrome. I LOVE Chrome OS but I don't foresee using it on Android. Charlie You don't even know HOW the products/OSD is designed , will be rolled out and/or in what sense it will be replacing Chrome OS. It's still a year away. Just relax, and see where this take us. It might be a smoother transition than you think. keithzg /me switches .com to .ca, sees price go up to $1,257.28 with another $100 in shipping, weeps Amit_N At $799, I can buy a laptop with 256 SSD and i7, that can power any damn linux distro along with Windows. Am I the only one that is not sold with this devices? Jaime I'm in the market for a new laptop, care to give me an example of which laptop can I get with the internals you mentioned? Thanks! Amit_N I have older version of this laptop with i5, I absolutely love this laptop. Total value for money. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015P3SKHQ Jaime Awesome, thank you! keithzg I have a first-hand Pixel, and it's the construction that has me still holding onto it instead of buying a newer laptop. The screen ratio is actually pretty fantastic and you don't find it anywhere else, and as someone who's allergic to branding (well, as allergic as people are to wifi, which is to say that it's all in my head but I'm rabid about it) the unadorned metal lid is a godsend. I dual-boot mine with ChromeOS and Kubuntu; if Google had ever deigned to sell the second-gen Pixel here in Canada I would've bought that too. warcaster Hopefully they make some $200-$250 ARM variants as well, not 100% Intel as they've been pushing so far with Chromebooks. Even Andromeda notebooks with Zen APUs would be a breath of fresh air. keithzg Huh? There's plenty if ARM Chromebooks. Or do you mean Pixel devices? 'Cause the most recent of those, the Pixel C, was also ARM. MJ My questions are.... Will I be able to install this Andromeda OS on a laptop I already own? Would I be able to install a different OS on this upcoming "Bison" aka Pixel 3 device (easily)? I get the feeling this is just another step down the road to turn desktop PCs into locked down smartphones with a monitor and keyboard/mouse. meijin3 Any news on the Pixel C running Andromeda? PVL_93_RU It'd be very weird if it didn't considering on the base system level it can theoretically at least dualboot Sarath Chandra Gullapalli Could Google unveil "Universal Apps" at the Oct 4th event ?? PVL_93_RU universal apps? person Insinuating that they aren't already? deppman This was so obvious in 2012; Google should have had a Jide-remix-like skunkworks project on this *then*, not in 2015. It's like captain obvious finally walked up to Sergey and slapped him in the face. I'm happy with this direction, and really look forward to the OS. I just wish they'd gotten on it sooner. TedPhillips bleh, I need to go reread the andromeda article.... as someone who's into both ecosystems from a technical angle, putting cros bits into android, instead of android bits into cros still seems like the much worse option... doesn't mean it won't be successful, but i think the world would be a better place with the reverse. keithzg Yeah, ChromeOS's guts are a much saner, much more standard stack. Android suffers from a lot of NIH syndrome under the hood by comparison. I suppose with how Google has been trending towards being more proprietary and locked-down recently it makes sense they'd go that direction, but it's still disappointing. drksilenc I read that as a 3' pixel laptop at first... Brian These sound a lot like Reef and Kevin chromebooks? keithzg So I wonder if it'll be available in Canada like the Pixel C, or weirdly unavailable here like the Chromebook Pixels. Although about a year out is admittedly too soon to be worrying about availability, heh. Luxferro If it doesn't have replaceable storage (m.2 SSD), then I'll never be interested in google's premium laptops. It was the reason I did not buy the previous Pixel laptop. Stephen Sharp I'd like to sign up for the giveaway, please :P Adal With all these exclusive Google article in AP, i have a feeling Sundar Pichai is directly working with AP. is he your primary source of leaks? :) Peterson Silva No, they just have someone hidden under his desk. Shhh, don't tell him :D PVL_93_RU that's because the AP crew are actually Google employees, but shhh, nobody should know this juanjeremy2012 man i just hope it doenst lose the slickness of chromebooks. chromebooks do 90% of what you do better than windows and if they added an off line office suite that number would jump to 97%. juanjeremy2012 i dont want these expensive aluminum ultrathin things. i just want a decent plastic design like what is on hp stream or dell latitude that doesnt flex for about $500 JohnCalla $800 for a 12" Android laptop. Not seeing much of a market for this. Jonathan Ramos Wait why 2017? Seems like a great time to release. I doubt anyone is rushing out and getting Pixel tablets running Android this Christmas. LewisSD Just sayin, I totally wrote a thread about this merger of Android and Chrome 4 years ago on androidandme. I'm stoked to see Google make it happen! Chris Johnston so the question is... will this gain market share and actually be viable? or will this be steam OS part 2? I know, different applications and all, but they are both built off of linux. Chris Skipper 9 reasons why Andromeda HAS to be a Chrome OS mode inside Android: 1. Google has said Chrome OS is here to stay and not only said that Chrome OS would continue to exist, a spokesperosn also confirmed to The Verge that BOTH Android and Chrome OS will continue to exist, which means they will continue to be offered as separate products. 2. Hiroshi Lockehimer, SVP of Andorid, Chrome OS, and Google Play has told JR Raphel that he made no sense of the rumors that first came out 3. Even though Hiroshi Lockheimer said he couldn't make sense of the rumor, the original Wall Street Journal report even though mentioned that Android remained as the dominant system, they said that Google would continue to maintain Chrome OS but the focus would be using Chrome OS to expand Android onto PCs. 4. Eric Schmidt in TechCrunch has said that you don't get rid of one or the other, but that technlogy moves forward when one can be wrapped into the other and mentioned how the environments can come together, but mentioned that the OS system attributes should be separate. 5. To make the two operating systems into one operating system, you would need to save both the advantages of using Chrome OS and the advantages of using Android. You can decide to merge Android into Chrome OS but that would require virtualization or dual booting. Then if you decide to do Andromeda without continuing to offer Chrome OS, you lose the advantages of Chrome OS. 6. Google wouldn't be building Fuchsia if they knew they could just merge Android and Chrome OS which means there would be no intention on writing a new OS and like Hiroshi said, if they thought about both of these on day one the foundation would've been built to have the best of both but Android and Chrome OS 7. There will not a "desktop version of Android" because the material design showcase does not show a desktop version of Android. It shows Chrome OS. That freeform mode is hidden deliberately because it's only there to create APIs so that way Android apps on Chrome isn't like the beta where there are fixed sizes and you can't resize your Android apps. 8. An AndroidCentral journalist claims that the Pixel C was made to run Android but with a desktop version of Chrome with ARM APIs even though the Pixel C was planned with Project Athena, Frankenboard, and then they decided to just flash Android. 9. AndroidPolice says Andromeda is Android and that Chrome OS will still be something else and now you see BOTH TABLETS AND PCs being tested with this new OS while Chrome OS has never been on anything else but a PC. What Google would have to do to build Andromeda as a mode within Android: 1. Take the Chrome browser from the Chrome OS client and make it an app inside Android. 2. Create a Quick Setting inside Android that opens this app when pressed. 3. Now you have a Windows 8 esquesqe functionality for Android (except that one environment wouldn't be used as a launcher for the other). 4. The utility used to tap into the container for Chrome OS would be used so that way it would tap into the same libs used in the Android System so that way Android Apps can function in the Chrome browser inside the Android System. 5. The utility also packages Android APKs into Chrome Packaged Apps but instead the utility would be tweaked to use redirects in place where the Android APK files would go, like your APK, saves, and states, with the redirects pointing towards the system/app or system/priv-app folders inside the root. The browser would also use the utility to write and delete in that same folder. 6. Finally, when you go into the browser the browser will start a clean new instance and then read the Android apps currently open on recent apps and then do a new instruction that does a call to launch the corresponding CRXs on the browser and then execute the states that are persistently saved as you use Android apps. When you leave the Webtop Mode via an option in the Chrome OS status area, the browser will make the same call to the Android System by having your apps cleared and then opening up the same apps that were opened on the browser and then also executing the states that are being persistently saved as you use your Android apps on Chrome OS. The final result is to create a hybrid operating system where you can use Android as a tablet like you always have been doing but now you'll be able to connect a mouse to your tablet and then be able to switch your UI between Android System UI and Chrome Ash Window Manager with zero interruptions. You would also be able to use your phone as a desktop by connecting it to a display using this same mode. MuleForRent Prevent owners from upgrading the SSD and you'll still sell a lot. Let us add serious storage and Microsoft/Apple will be in for a terrible shock MuleForRent One of the great possible outcomes here is an office suite application 'reset' that strips the crazy complexity and bulk out of native apps. I'd switch from Windows just to get nicely designed, simpler versions of Outlook and Word. Google Docs is great for lots of stuff, but native apps still have their place, and Gmail in all forms is still unpleasant to look at and use. TONY ALDO Q3 2017? ugh talk about cock tease. captainhurt chrome os is NOT about PROVIDING features or apps, but rather about BEING, as an os is defined, a platform to deliver features and apps. Chrome is ALL ABOUT being a platform that is an inherently secure, inherently up-to-date, inherently backed-up, simple, low-cost, lightweight, very fast, cloud-based easy-to-use thin-client. TheSpaceUnicorn The only thing that would make me interested in an Andromeda laptop is full Adobe CC being on it. That's my one requirement for any laptop. Quentin Menini Will Andromeda be called "pixel OS" ? mudi1 its hard incredibly hard to play and win in Microsoft's field, many tried but all lost. if google planning to give a worthy alternative of MS windows then its nothing less then going against titans . i go point wise - 1. AAA gaming is the shied of windows OS and if google wants to succeed they must target AAA gamer requirements. 2. google must start making deals with game devs to code their games on Vulkan API coz 95% AAA games code on DirectX which is MS proprietary . if they code on vulkan then they can be easily playable on google notebook. 3. GPU licensing can play a major role for ex just give amd 20-30$/chip as license and get their big gpu tech like 1024 core Polaris gpu, then couple that with ARM cpu cores ... this will allow google to cut cost like magic bcoz 8 core A73 core cpu built on 10nm node will require just 16 mm2 of die space so cost of soc will be much lower then intel offering hence google will have a price advantage and i choosed AMD polaris coz all console games developed on amd GCN arch. 4. give more support to ARM arch as there is more competition like qualcomm, mediatek, Kirin, imagination and more competition means much faster pace of performance/dollar. 5. fully flagged performance notebook should start with price tag of 400 dollar so that wide adoption will face no trouble . 6. last but most imp - add dedicated external gpu feature on notebooks yes i said external gpu , same way as razor core link - http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-core thats much needed feature and if google does that then it will sell like hot cakes. just do this and whole gaming community will make a shift to gogole. Hadrian Węgrzynowski > Android apps on Chrome OS descended from the ARC project, while Andromeda is a much larger, more ambitious initiative that is being pursued via merging Chrome features into Android, not vice versa. First part of this sentence is wrong. ChromeOS had experimental ARC (App Runtime for Chrome), but it went nowhere near to support all of Android apps. They abandoned this approach and went with separate Android container beside ChromeOS. You even written about it [1], it is mentioned in Wikipedia [2]. [1] http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/09/22/chrome-android-apps-show-stable-chrome-os-first-time/ [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS#Android_applications - second paragraph person A descendant as in they are both part of the same initiative--bringing Android apps to ChromeOS. Andromeda is not. indiandragon Lol, 'merging Chrome features into Android' Isn't that why chrome is there in Playstore already ? If at all something, this should be Android x86 running chrome as front end. Assuming that this is capable of running Android apps natively by design, I'm not sure how google plans of keeping Chrome OS project alive. Pixel Spot If Google uses the "Pixel 3" name for the laptops, what will they do then for the "Pixel 3" phones? Drew Ciccotelli What do you suppose Fuchsia is gonna run on? Andy Chow Not sure I'm happy about this. ChromeOS has been the perfect OS on a laptop so far. Those that say "for the same price I can get a MacBook pro" just don't get it, and probably never will. I didn't get the Pixel C because it wasn't ChromeOS. dontpanicbobby For as minute there I thought they were selling a 3 foot laptop. I had to re-read the title. Akash1NY Well this never happened... :-/ jet sky i wont waste any money on this os on my pc and even it is free os because of google ads alway sucks Dustin Mingo Any thoughts on whether this could be related to the Samsung Chromebook plus that recently came out?

Exclusive: Google is building two Android Wear smartwatches with Google Assistant integration David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/07/06 11:11am PDTJul 6, 2016 377 Plus 1 on G+ 630 Share on Facebook 9 Share on Twitter Total Shares1016 Android Wear Exclusives Leaks News Rumors Speaking to Android Police, a reliable source has told us that Google is currently building two Android Wear devices - possibly Nexus-branded - for release some time after the latest Nexus phones are announced. One watch will be larger, sportier, and more fully-featured (LTE, GPS, heart rate), the other will be smaller and lack the aforementioned mobile data and GPS. Disclaimer: No matter the confidence level, there's always a chance product updates, features, and some or all details will be changed or cancelled altogether. As with all rumors, nothing is 100% until it's officially announced. We do not have possession of any APKs we can distribute or unreleased devices, so please don't ask for them. Confidence level We give this rumor a confidence level of 9 out of 10. We are extremely confident Google is in the process of prototyping these in-house Wear devices, and have confirmation of their existence from multiple sources. We are subtracting a point from our confidence because of the ongoing development occurring for these devices, and the possibility that they may change or that one or both may be cancelled (or delayed), as well as the fact that we are unable to share our primary source information for this post. There also remains some ambiguity about the codenames I will use for these watches, and whether or not these names are currently being used, so consider them nothing more than easy ways to refer back to either device at this point. The evidence As I said, we are unable to share any direct evidence of the existence of these devices at this time. However, because of the quality of our source, we feel confident in publishing information about these devices, including descriptions of their respective appearances. To ensure we are clear on one thing before we start: the hero image of this post is 100% a fabrication [hopefully obviously, because my talentless ass made it] and has no resemblance to either watch. So, let's get started. Both watches have full circular displays. We do not believe either will have "flat tires." Let's start with the larger watch, which we believe to be codenamed Angelfish. Angelfish bears some resemblance to the current Moto 360 and LG's Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, but is distinct from both. The design has visible lugs, with a smooth housing shape that curves where the watch band meets the body. It does not have the stark circular "puck" shape of Motorola's 360, nor the rather angular lugs or multi-piece design of the Urbane LTE. This gives the watch a subdued but sporty look. Angelfish has three buttons. Looking at the watch face, one large circular crown button is centered along the right side of the body, with two smaller and shorter circular buttons above and below it. It is unclear what these secondary buttons are for at this time, though you are free to imagine the possibilities. Angelfish is quite thick, at over 14mm in cross-section (around the same as the Urbane LTE), likely owing to a larger battery necessitated by its LTE-ready chipset. The watch's diameter is allegedly 43.5mm, making it substantially smaller than the "large" 46mm Moto 360, but still a bit bigger than the standard 42mm edition. We believe it will come in a matte dark gray finish that may be called "titanium," but it's unclear if other colors will be available. Angelfish will have GPS, LTE, and a heart-rate monitor, giving it the ability to be a true "standalone" Android Wear device. Remember, Google announced standalone Wear apps at I/O with with Wear 2.0. The second, smaller watch is codenamed Swordfish. Speaking generally, Swordfish is reminiscent in basic shape to the Pebble Time Round, of course lacking the Round's obviously massive screen bezel, and also using a different button arrangement. But the overall style of the body and especially the lug design are, in my opinion, quite similar. That said, because it doesn't have the internal screen bezel, the portion of the body surrounding the watch face is larger, and the shape is more gentle and rounded than the Pebble's. Swordfish has a single button centered on the right-hand side of the body, with a more delicate and Apple Watch-like design. The center of the button cap appears to be polished metal, with the bezel of the crown being ridged. Aside from appearing more "raised" out of the body because of the watch's circular shape, the button really is quite similar to the Apple Watch's crown. Swordfish is smaller and thinner than Angelfish, with a body diameter of 42mm and a thickness of just 10.6mm - 0.8mm thinner than the current Moto 360. Granted, it still doesn't have anything on the 7.5mm Pebble Time Round in this regard. Swordfish will allegedly be made available in three colors: silver, titanium, and rose gold. Swordfish lacks LTE or GPS, and it's unclear if it has a heart rate monitor (we are leaning "no"). It appears that, oddly, the larger Angelfish device will not support Google's interchangeable MODE watch bands, because the design of the lugs and band won't allow for it. Swordfish, on the other hand, will definitely be compatible with MODE bands. Both watches will offer Google Assistant integration with contextual alerts. Exactly what that integration entails, we aren't certain, but given Sundar Pichai's comments about Nexus devices receiving more exclusive software features, we're left wondering if these watches will get functionality other Android Wear devices won't. Google may also be working on a brand-new style of watch faces for these devices that will allow much quicker access to notifications, information, or media controls for apps or functions that you commonly use. This will likely be via the new app watchface integration announced as part of Wear 2.0. These quick-access functions would sit below the watch dial, presenting things like your current playback location in a song, the number of unread messages in Gmail, Hangouts unread counts, time in another time zone, the amount of time until your next calendar appointment, your number of steps, and more. Final words The inevitable question with these Google smartwatches is "why?" I'm afraid I don't have a concrete answer for you. But I can speculate. As Android Wear has evolved, manufacturer interest in it has not skyrocketed as Google likely hoped it would. At best, it appears to be holding steady. Once considered Wear's strongest partner, LG has announced no new mainstream Wear device since the old Urbane last spring (the LTE is unashamedly niche with limited availability, and was heavily delayed). The number of new Wear OEMs announced lately has been modest, aside from a few niche fashion products that are unlikely to have a major impact on Wear's distribution. By building its own smartwatches, Google can implement exactly the hardware and features it believes will best demonstrate Android Wear's capabilities. It can also, perhaps, offer a better sales and support experience than Wear's smaller partners. It's possible Google could even utilize economic leverage and sell these watches at a discount with the purchase of an accompanying Nexus phone or, in the case of the mobile data-enabled Angelfish, Project Fi cellular service. But this, again, is speculation - I'm simply trying to walk out some potential reasoning for the existence of these devices in the first place. Perhaps the most obvious and compelling, though? Google's competitors in the hardware space make their own smartwatches, too. Apple and Samsung both are pushing their own watch operating systems and accompanying ecosystems, and perhaps Google feels that Wear's OEM partners simply aren't going to put in the effort necessary to market the platform to consumers. As Samsung's Gear OS grows ever-more compatible with non-Samsung devices and services, too, the threat to Android Wear is all too real. While I doubt there's much of a chance the Apple Watch will be pairing to your Android phone any time soon, Google does let you use Wear with iOS, and Google-branded smartwatches would likely be the most visible such devices to Apple users. Whatever the reason, we feel confident Google is building these watches, though time of release, MSRP, and their current level of development remain unknown to us. It is our assumption that Google will attempt to push these watches alongside the upcoming Nexus phones, but we don't believe they'll be unveiled at the same time, but rather at a later date. Given Wear 2.0 is still in early previews, the watches not coming until after the phones would make sense. We'll let you know as we learn more.

We are subtracting a point from our confidence because of the ongoing development occurring for these devices, and the possibility that they may change or that one or both may be cancelled (or delayed), TypoCorrecto Please launch with the Nexus devices this year. Jumanji242 And please add NFC to Android Wear devices so I can use my watch to make payments. David Mendívil taking your phone out of your pocket is too hard? Heiro78 it's not too hard. it would just be more convinient/ provide a better case to get an android wear watch. kalehv Would it make a payment accidentally/maliciously? Cause on phone, you have to unlock it. maybe it can provide a button on watch-screen that you HAVE to tap to approve. But I want this too :D Heiro78 hmm good point. probably would have to long press the watch face to activate NFC for payment. or maybe one of those lugs would be dedicated to it as a button? kalehv Oh wait, I think android wear supports pattern lock Adil Tajgeer it does. apple (iirc) doesn't require a pin to pay on the apple watch. you authenticate the card when adding it, and as long as the watch stays on your wrist, it remains unlocked and ready for payment. if you take it off, then you need to enter a pin to access anything on the watch (or unlock it with your phone) kalehv so if someone touches a payment machine to your wrist (i know probably extreme case but just for a sake of discussion) apple watch just goes ahead and makes a payment? I have never used apple watch, so i am not much aware of how it works with Apple Pay. Adil Tajgeer I haven't used my Apple watch in a while but iirc you have to hold the crown or double click it first to bring it up Jumanji242 Exactly - contactless payments on smartwatches has been solved before on other platforms and I don't think Google or Apple are shy about ripping off ideas from competing platforms. I have no insight into the complexity of making NFC payments on Wear happen, but I'm nonetheless hopeful that it's on the Wear product roadmap somewhere. Midnitte Or could just add voice recognition 🤷 JG But if the watch has NFC, you wouldn't actually need to have a phone with you. Android Pay would run on the watch directly and could use it's LTE connection to transmit whatever data is required. I'm thinking, for example, a summer vacation at the beach. You wouldn't need to worry about not having pockets in your bathing suit to store your phone or wallet. Just strap the watch around your wrist and your good to go (especially if the watch is properly water resistant). When you stop off some where for lunch or to pick up a souvenir all you'd have to do is tap your wrist to the PoS & bam, you've paid, Heiro78 this needs to happen David Ruddock god I hope so, but we don't have anything indicating that at this point. Scott I'll just take any form of Android Pay in Canada please... OligarchyAmbulance Pixel, Pixel C, rumored in-house phone, these watches. It sounds like Google's making an effort to make themselves a hardware company. My dreams are coming true! TravisBoone Yeah I've been waiting... slowly they been pumping out pieces of hardware to test the waters. I said awhile ago they need to be more like Apple in the sense that they get their own in house phone production going. ToasTd I'm glad you said it or else it may never have happened. TravisBoone HAHAHA ToasTd I'm glad you said it or else it may never have happened. TravisBoone Yeah I've been waiting... slowly they been pumping out pieces of hardware to test the waters. I said awhile ago they need to be more like Apple in the sense that they get their own in house phone production going. RajivSK Don't get your hopes up too high.. I mean, too often they had some cool hardware and pulled it because they decided the world needs more messaging apps... Smanny I hope they make these watches Daydream VR controllers as well. Since all Android Wear watches come with accelerometers and gyroscopes. That would be totally cool. Валерий Бабанин Watches can't be VR controllers too Ricardo Why Not? Валерий Бабанин How?! Smanny What the hell do you think is in Google's Daydream VR controller? It has an accelerometer and a gyroscope as well as a touch pad. So clearly an Android Wear watch could also do the same thing. Валерий Бабанин Well, if you think that smartwatch can be used as VR controller(image above), let Google know that. I just can't even imagine that Randroid Then you, sir, have no imagination. A watch would work much better than that thing in my imagination. As already stated, watches already have all of the necessary sensors. The controller you pictured has 2 physical buttons, my watch has 1. It's not hard to add another button to future watches. (Most non-smart watches have at least 2 physical buttons.) And the watch is already on your wrist, so sensing hand motion would be natural. Sounds like a very logical solution to me. Валерий Бабанин Buttons and touches should be working with the same hand where watch is placed. However, you need 2 controllers. Who will buy 2 watches for using them instead of controllers? Randroid So 1 watch and 1 controller? I stick to my assertion that it is probably the best logical solution to a VR controller. Валерий Бабанин Controllers always go in pair. And what about "Buttons and touches should be working with the same hand where watch is placed."? Randroid I see that you have formed your opinion and nothing that anyone says or does could ever change your mind. (Short of maybe a Google engineer being on here saying "Hey, that's a good idea!") So enjoy your trolling :-) Валерий Бабанин Trolling? No. I will change my mind if someone will tell me how is this possible An-Nusantarani well, they can be VR hand-sensors at least. Your phone in the right hand, and the watch on the left. And do some VR sword-and-shield swashbuckling. Jordan Na So true C64 My dreams are about naked hot women, not about a big watch. KzX So do I. Ha Ha M.e.Puente Yeeeaaaah, I'm going to need you to go ahead and make a quality Nexus branded Android TV and VR unit while you're at it, Google.. thaaanks danieleran Remember when Google tried to do that before? Acquired Motorola, lost billions, abandoned ship. Acquired Nest, lots billions, accomplished nothing, in flames. Acquired robotics firms, lost money, gave up. Google isn't really good at hardware. Infiniti M56x Watches can't be VR controllers too! 7-down "Google is building" - Seriously, just give us a Pixel Phone! Heiro78 What's a pixel phone? the project ara thing? 7-down No, just an imaginary phone that Google fanboys like myself are waiting for... http://i.makeagif.com/media/2-04-2016/dzfGaP.gif Heiro78 oh, so a 5.5in screen, 5 aH, 3 GHz, 8 GB ram 128 GB storage, water proof!, shock proof, IR blasting, NFC having, modular, mega phone? Brad make it 6" and wireless charging. sam bowlby No, that's the Saygus V^3... coming soon! (pre-order now!) sam bowlby No, that's the Saygus V^3... coming soon! (pre-order now!) BetterWithRoot ...with front facing speakers Badouken Google has the chromebook pixel (a laptop built by Google) and the pixel c (a tablet built by Google). So people like myself are hoping they will expanding to making a "pixel phone" that is 100% made in house at Google no OEM's involved. yeah Ara is a thing but its not ment to be super premium like the pixel line is. syxbit Pixel Phone with a new Nvidia SoC. saf1927 NVIDIA in the mobile space is crap. blassster This is probably what the delayed HTC watch turned into, released alongside the HTC Nexus phones. Dom Apice Probably not but still a neat theory person Goodbye, Moto. It was nice while it lasted. someone755 What was it, 2 years? Oh well... Shellyman 16K My wrist is ready. Red5 LMAO perfect response to this article. Shellyman 16K I know right! :D Никита Кабаков stop typing Shellyman 16K No... senor_heisenberg ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) abc To wank off ? Corey Watford I think Nexus branding is Dead, based on the info yesterday on the Sailfish and Marlin phones and the "G" logo, I have a good feeling this may be the end of the Nexus branding and the beginning of the Google brand. David Ruddock Eh, it's possible. But for now we're still leaning "Nexus" on the phone branding. Sundar literally used the word Nexus several times when describing their future strategy at the recode conference, so unless he was deliberately trying to throw off rumors of a rebrand, we think Nexus is here for now. I'm not saying plans couldn't have changed, though. We just don't have information suggesting they have. Suicide_Note At some point in the next year or two, most likely. This may be the last batch of devices to bear the Nexus imprint. saf1927 It could be complementary. Samsung has the "Galaxy" brand, Apple has the "iPhone" brand. Google has the Nexus brand. They can't call the phone "Google", can they? Cory Wilson Bet the final models will have the nexus logo, first leaks never have the logos Scofabear NFC or GTFO. CMON GOOGLE!!! how are androidwear android pay payments not a thing!! D4niel Perhaps an existing patent prevents them? Scott Even if there was no patent, they would find a way to sue Google... You know the 'they' I'm talking about... Bill Mattheis Oh stop it. Apple is by far not the only one doing mobile payments. Scott I never said or implied that... Apple doesn't care if they do something first or not, they just want to take every advantage they can, including their patent trolling. Bill Mattheis That's why they are suing alllll the other guys. Scott They just sue everyone over everything, their anti-competitive nature is a major reason a left their ecosystem years ago. Progression and competition are good things... Bill Mattheis That's simply inaccurate. Scott Just saying something is inaccurate doesn't make it the truth. I stated an opinion, then two facts. Agree or don't, that's fine, it doesn't change the 'accuracy' of the comment. RN Who are they suing, then? Dear Fanboy, Android Wear devices don't have Android Pay, because it costs money to put the feature there. Scott lol Mayoo You mean like they are not the only one doing this? Yet they sued. http://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-slide-to-lock.jpg Christopher Bement Implying apple is the only major company to sue Google over patents. Adil Tajgeer it hasn't stopped samsung. samsung pay works on the gear 2 right? Bill Mattheis This is what I mean. Proof to the opposite. I don't mean to jump down Scott's throat over his comment but I'm exhausted with these generic "so-and-so will just do this!' comments. The 'Apple will never allow this' is just as annoying as 'oh...and have Google steal all my data??'. Scott I honestly didn't intend to start some kind of flaming debate, it was intended to be a joke, if not at least a little true. Bill Mattheis Me either. We disagree on the truth behind it but that's fair enough. Scott I don't know about you, but I am sick to death of the whole "You hate me, I hate you because we like different companies and what they do." thing. Sometimes I just want to say a joke, or state an opinion, with no intention of it being a big thing, so I'm sorry (Canadian detected) if I triggered you. Bill Mattheis No I'm right there with you. I think that's why I jumped on your comment. It came across to me wrong, but that's kind of the drawback of text. The whole Google vs Apple thing among fans is ridiculous, especially with the amount of things they are actually working together on. Everyone should be able to love whatever tech they like. Jumanji242 No, not in the US. It probably works in South Korea where Samsung has more of a presence, but in the US, Samsung Pay is not working on the Gear S2, unfortunately. Adil Tajgeer it hasn't stopped samsung. samsung pay works on the gear 2 right? Leeroy Jenkins The main issue with Android Wear is that one if its main features - Google Now still does Jack shit outside the US even so many years after the release. Nobody wants a 350$/€/£ Weather and notification device on their wrist. philosopher_Mk So now Google is a hardware company? Filipe Santos Hardware company for 2 years device updates (lol)..... My LG G Watch R is still happy... :) bjs @David Ruddock: I commend you for the disclaimer you put. To me, that's responsible reporting. SamMobile, on the other hand, boasts their "exclusive" reports which turn out to more gossip and rumors than anything. They never make a retraction or correction. Suicide_Note That's why AP is the best place for Android news. Mark555055 do it and give me android pay on wear Victor Souza As long as its got just pricing and market availability worldwide, I'm all IN David Hyman My first gen moto 360 has stopped working so the timing of this is perfect! James Briano My beautiful Baume & Mercier continues to function flawlessly. David Hyman Sadly they don't make a Android wear watch! My omega seamaster has been running strong for nearly 2 decades :D Brad Man, I'm ditching the moto 360 mostly because I want the mode bands, but don't want the crummier version of the nexus watch. Damn. cadtek91 "crummier" version? Well do some thinking: are you actually going to use LTE and GPS on the watch, do you ever go anywhere without your phone anyways? Brad Fair point... but I see myself bringing BT headphones instead of a phone some days. Why not? Eumelanin Knight Less than $250, AMOLED screen, heartrate monitor, NFC and I'm interested by default. I wonder if these could be the first to have those new Qualcomm chips. Greg Macek If they can keep it at $300 somehow for the higher end model with GPS/LTE, I'm definitely interested. With very little interest from manufacturers to include GPS for run/bike tracking and no word from Sony on a Smartwatch 4, I'm sticking with my SW3 for as long as possible. Jovie Brett Bardoles Still hoping for a new Nexus tablet this fall, please Google 🙏 David I love the fact Google might start manufacturing their own projects, lets them have more control over everything and it might limit fragmentation. I do wish project Soli would be ready around the time these release. rgao007 These are still a bit thick. Are Qualcomm's Wear chips not ready yet? backslashV you should create a channel called APleaks. TechGuy22 well looks like i'd just wait for google then i was just about to buy a hawaii or whatever watch Jpx Yes, let the Pixel family be a real thing. My Pixel C comes in tomorrow. I want a Pixel phone so bad, and a pixel watch would be awesome. And for no apparent reason I want a Chromebook Pixel. They are such good looking devices. And so far, I'm not in love with the new Nexus phones. But I wasn't in love with the Nexus 6P, but now I really love that phone Greg Macek I'm just imagining a Pixel phone with that same light bar as the C and Chromebook... Charles Man you guys are burning it up with the exclusive Nexus leaks lately, bravo! Badouken I've been waiting to jump into the android wear market for this exact reason! I will for sure get a android wear watch made by Google! Matt Glad I held myself back from purchasing anything Android Wear. Hopefully this changes things enough for me to get one! Denigrate You're wrong, David, you're very talented. Never give up. David Ruddock MOM I TOLD YOU TO WAIT IN THE CAR Lateef Alabi-Oki Android Police, spoiling Google launches since 2009. Guys, have mercy on Google, and leave them one surprise this year. doge you've been killing it with the leaks! youareme7 the lte thing just doesn't interest me in the slightest and all that added thickness is annoying to support it. Would be much nicer if the other version of the watch had GPS and heart rate, that would be the one Snowbooks1419 I wonder if these would be Nexus- or Pixel-branded (or something new?) If Google builds them themselves, then under the current naming scheme, I would imagine they would be Pixel-branded. However, I could also see Google starting to reserve the Nexus name for phones and small tablets, the Pixel name for large tablets and laptops, and perhaps a new name for smartwatches. Abraham I was considering updating my Moto 360 to v2 when it dropped in price, but now I might just wait and see how this plays out. Kinda wish the non-LTE was the same, just without the LTE. I carry my phone everywhere, so I have no need for a standalone watch. dcdttu Another way to keep people from being interested in Wear: release 2 watches that have features like Assistant that no previous watch will ever get. That will make the Huawei Watch on my wrist the last Wear device I use. humulos GOOD! I would love an Urbane LTE, but they are annoying to purchase and freaking expensive. Google produced a top-of-the-line tablet for 200 dollars, they can do the same for smartwatches! BBpost Where is the NFC???????? Gian Paolo Vecchi Google is going fishing? mattcoz Every Nexus device has had a fish codename. Darren Meier Never mind. Forgot Occam was also Mako. person Your description of swordfish sounds a lot like this https://www.android.com/static/2016/videos/wear/mode/scroll.mp4 https://www.android.com/wear/mode/ Chris Sanner annnnd there goes any desire I had to buy a moto 360 sport. Midnitte I just want to know why they're so against NFC and Android Pay integration. You'd think support for standalone apps would be a pretty nice support structure for it. JD Why? Because OEM's didn't make as much money as they thought they would and they have a hard enough time making money on phones... Why? Because OEMs are dicks when it comes to updating phones, and now smart watches. Why? Because Google doesn't even want to set an example and commit to a long life cycle. Why? Because Google doesn't want to alienate OEMs by making devices that are too awesome and too well supported. Why? Because FU that's why. mattcoz Over 14mm thick? Yikes. Hopefully the larger battery will let it last 2 days like my GWR, otherwise I'm not interested. Glich Great my moto360 battery life is slowly approaching the point where I will no longer be able to use with out a mid day re-charge. by oct i will most likly be ready for upgrade. Robin I will also most defiantly upgrade from my original Moto 360, but my battery is actually doing quite fine. Do you use ambient screen? Glich ya if my battery life gets an hour or 2 shorter it will be going off. surethom Swordfish needs to be 40mm diameter & NEEDS a heart rate monitor. Google fit app NEEDS a large update it needs to integrate Sleep data. Marty As long as they don't have flat tires, I'm in. Droon Two questions: 1.) How does LTE work on smartwatches? If I was going for a run, could I pop out the SIM card on my phone and put it into my smartwatch and have LTE? I think I know the answer, I just want to be sure. 2.) Has Sony ever officially confirmed a Sony Smartwatch 4? The Smartwatch 3 seems like the device I want, but I read rumors that there is a Smartwatch 4 in the works. I know you shouldn't keep waiting for new tech because new tech always keeps coming, but I am in no rush to get a smartwatch. Anthony Castanza If they fuck the Huawei Watch on this I'm going to be pissed. There is no reason it shouldn't get all the same features as the Swordfish device. It does bode well that the Android Wear 2.0 update is available for the Huatch though. itamargs The reason i don't buy smartwatch is POOR BATTERY. AT LEAST 3 days "always on" screen time is a Must. Worried about my phone battery is enogh. I dont need a ‪watch‬‏ to worry about to. "Garmin" makes good smartwathes with great battery. I hope that Google will figure it out to. battery that can handle bearly 2 days smartwathes is just a bad joke. Captain_Invisible "It appears that, oddly, the larger Angelfish device will not support Google's interchangeable MODE watch bands, because the design of the lugs and band won't allow for it." They're probably putting antennas and stuff in the band like others (Moto, LG?) have done, right? Cory Wilson Why? Well Motorola isn't exactly still supporting the original 360 are they? Everybody thought Google would be providing updates like chromebooks but the only difference is OEMs can't skin Android wear, they still are in charge of support and still are failing bad so it's s good call Валерий Бабанин Moto 360 has a TI OMAP proccesor Cory Wilson Well if the jackasses thought it was good enough for a smartwatch they should be providing updates for it! Валерий Бабанин Yes, they make this mistake a second time. First time it was Moto X 2013 Daniel Gherard Finally! Found my first Smartwatch. Any chance it will come with project Soli? Like the prototype shown in I/O. Blake I want a smart watch but my scrawny wrists look dumb with them. The smaller 360 isn't bad. If the Nexus one is that size or maybe thinner/smaller then I may finally get one. Google needs to stop being so terrified of the OEMs and do some of this stuff. Has Microsoft suffered from the surface line? VAVAMk_2 So glad we get Nexus watches but no update to the Google Voice app or service in years... Rahde Jones Didnt verge have a video about a google smartwatch https://youtu.be/jWNebDDmuXc JG Google needs to port WiFi Assistant (& the Project Fi app?) to Wear so Angelfish (at least when used with a Project Fi SIM) can bounce onto open WiFi networks just like our phones. The Google VPN would be nice to have as well, but I could live without if needed. While not mentioned in the article, I'm going to assume it has decent water resistance rating (IP68), and a decent sized battery (at least a full day with LTE active) maybe "borrowing" Casio's monocromatic mode they say will let the phone work for a month (even if the LTE radio knocks it down to just a week). NFC would be a nice addition (NFC would be much better N than Nougat, imho). Also needs to have a screen that can be read in sunlight. Icing on the cake would be to have the encryption system from Project Fi embedded in the watch. Its housed inside of a microSD card, so it shouldn't take up that many Zs. But throwing everything coming in or out of the phone through a strong encryption scheme would be incredibly useful to have. John Bakers All Apple Watch and iPhone lovers I highly recommend using this awesome Apple Watch app to easily monitor your iPhone battery charge from the wrist: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/watchmybattery/id1024068907 Carlos Pimentel check out our version review giving the credits to AndroidPolice at http://goo.gl/S8znkt Mark Weiner I wouldn't consider it unless I could answer my phone from the watch or make phone calls and speak directly into the watch. I think LG might have one on the market right now, but , it doesn't work with Project Fi, only Verizon and AT& T. If the only functions are reading text messages or emails and looking at the calendar etc., , then, that's a lot of money not much functionality. Maybe I'm wrong, please let me know. Andrew Please let one of these be waterproof and let Fit get upgraded to track pool laps. Swimmers are consistently second class citizens. 😞 Raiders12 Ermahgerd....could Google itself be the reason I finally get a wearable? They're the reason I got my first smartphone and have been a Nexus user ever since....Nexus watch plzzzz Sean Boon These round smart watches just look lame. The Sony ones were great. Chris I hope so. I'm ready to upgrade from my gear live but the current watches are not much of an upgrade at all... JG Any indication if either's storage will exceed the 4GB standard? We wouldn't need anything too excessive (like 256GBs)* but with Wear 2.0 allowing the watch to function on its own & have apps installed on it directly (rather than living on the phone)... 4GB might start to become rather cramped, especially with the OS probably taking a majority of the available space. *Though (as long as it wasn't too expensive) I wouldn't turn down that much storage... Especially if we could get a WiFi Direct app that'd allow the watch to replace the USB flash drives we use to use... With it attached to your wrist, you'd never forget & leave it plugged into the box in the computer lab... JG Another feature that could be nice to have -- an active FM radio. It'd work well as part of the health tracking suite as a lot of gyms use FM to broadcast TV audio. And would allow the user to "stream" content to their device without using their data or having to store MP3s locally. Plus FM could be useful for localized emergencies. Lower frequency bands means farther transmission ranges (so towers could be outside the affected area transmitting in). And unlike cell towers, there is no congestion issues regardless of how many may be listening to a certain frequency. Hadr The Anglefish with LTE, GPS, and heart rate monitor is apparently aimed at runners and athletes. The round screen is a disappointment in that respect. But far more important is the display technology. Is Anglefish using E-ink, Mirasol, transflective LCD or some other display technology that allows it to be easily read in bright sunlight? If not, then it is pointless to market it to runners and sportsmen for outdoor activities. I hope that David Ruddock and other writers will be more cognizant of this issue in the future when writing articles about smart watches for the athletic and outdoor market. mcored Will these be announced on 4th? Chewieez I'm also interested to hear if there is an update to this rumor, 2.5 months later. I've searched the web but this article seems to be the only source. Post Stupid Thank your information......freshers Eduardo Quintero I think Android Wear has potential, but they are going for the wrong markets. These devices should be into 3 main categories: fitness, fashion, and medical. As a person in the medical field, I don't have time to be looking at my phone whenever it vibrates. But my Moto 360 lets me know what my notifications are while I'm running back and forth. Fitness already has a nice niche filled by Garmin and Fitbit. But Android can squeeze its way in by making those kind of features a key focus instead of an afterthought. Fashion is a somewhat more difficult beast to conquer. I agree that ASUS, Moto, and even Huawei make beautiful watches. But for Wear to succeed in that high end market, it has to partner with companies like Fossil, Rolex, and other high end watch manufacturers. The price will be outrageously expensive and the value for money will be non existent. But just for the label alone, it will succeed. But Fossil has to make an effort to at least include the best screen possible and they'll be fine. Just my humble opinion. bazaarbargh Implying apple is the only major company to sue Google over patents واردات کالا واردات مواد اولیه واردات لوازم خانگی واردات اسباب بازی قیمت ترانزیستور قیمت خازن قیمت آی سی قیمت شمع تزئینی قیمت شمع فانتزی Follow Android Police 1.49M 474k 146k 120k Latest Deals 7 [Deal Alert] Refurbished Amazon Fire HD 6 8GB w/Special Offers just $30 at Woot today 2017/06/11 3:26pm PDTJun 11, 2017 15 [Update: Now $116] Deal Alert: Samsung's Galaxy S8 DeX dock is $134.55 ($15 off) at Amazon 2017/06/11 12:34pm PDTJun 11, 2017 14 [Deal Alert] US unlocked Samsung Galaxy S8 $599 and Galaxy S8+ $699 on eBay 2017/06/11 10:28am PDTJun 11, 2017 33 [Deal Alert] Three HP Chromebooks are heavily discounted at Woot, including the 8GB RAM 13-G1 for $499 ($300 off) 2017/06/10 9:44am PDTJun 10, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get an open-box Samsung Gear S3 frontier for just $249.99 ($100 off) on eBay 2017/06/10 8:23am PDTJun 10, 2017 Latest Poll Does your phone have a USB-C port, or microUSB?

Google will announce Pixel phones, 4K Chromecast, Google Home, Daydream VR viewer on October 4th David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/09/01 7:31pm PDTSep 1, 2016 462 Plus 1 on G+ 1212 Share on Facebook 379 Share on Twitter Total Shares2053 Chromecast Exclusives Leaks Pixel Pixel XL Rumors According to a reliable source, Google plans to hold a major event focusing on hardware October 4th. It will use the event to announce its new Pixel-branded smartphones Pixel and Pixel XL, a 4K Chromecast, fully detail Google Home, and reveal the company's in-house design for a Daydream VR viewer device (Google previously confirmed this was happening). Here is what we know. The 4K Chromecast will do 4K and be called either the Chromecast Plus or Chromecast Ultra (makes sense - ultra HD). We aren't sure which. The Daydream device may be called Daydream View. Google was allegedly planning to announce a 4K version of the Chromecast last year, but seems to have scuttled the launch for some reason. Other than that, we don't have anything new to report but that October 4th date. We don't know what time or where Google will hold the event, though San Francisco and New York have been their host cities of choice in the recent past. We also still don't know when the Pixel phones will go on sale or how much they'll cost. The same goes for any of the hardware to be announced at the event. What we can say is that the Pixel phones will be available on or some time after October 4th, obviously. So, mark your calendars, everyone: it's Nexus Pixel season. October 4th was previously proposed as a launch date for Google's new phones by Droid Life. It looks like they were right. As a disclaimer: dates are always subject to change. Things can happen, unforeseen circumstances can emerge, and venues aren't always available. While October 4th is very much what we believe is the plan for Google's announcement, we can't say it's a 100% certainty because it's probably not even a certainty for Google. Additionally, products are also subject to change or delay - so keep that in mind.

Andy J To be fair - they do it a lot - get us hyped up with stuff "Hey everyone look at this cool thing we have to show you - this is [email protected] and we have lots of partners and products will be in stores by Christmas" oooooo shiny! me want! (2011) ..... so.... I'm still waiting...... Blac Chyna instagram October 4th was previously proposed as a launch date for Google's new phones by Droid Life. It looks like they were right. Jesus second to comment on first comment keithzg I was really hyped about the OG Moto 360, but ended up getting a Pebble instead, and now I'm waiting on Android Wear devices to get comparable battery life before I can really bring myself to make a switch. I figure my wallet is safe for at least a couple years now. volkswagen golf 2017 7.1 preview mid September plz??? Tim Glaraton Soooooo 7.1 preview mid September plz??? vyktorjonas That probably means the first DP will launch on the same date as the announcement I believe, makes more sense, then ship the new phones by November with the final build Carlos A. Garcia Jr. Ssoooo how about the "Nexus" watches.. David Ruddock Yeah, we didn't hear anything about those. Carlos A. Garcia Jr. Maybe if I changed the question...Sooo how about those "Pixel" Watches. iluvthesoftsoft So they drop the Nexus label, partially because the non-geek crowd didn't understand what the Nexus line was about. So now they're going to use the Pixel name, an equally misunderstood and even more unknown name. Brilliant! David Ruddock My speculation is that it was a "one or the other" situation. Two brands really didn't make any sense, and made for even more confusion. Pixel is the rising star, and so the obvious choice, IMO. But I agree Pixel still has nothing inherently more appealing about it. It's just a name. owlkey Should have kept Pixel as either the experimental stage of Google branding their own hardware, or as a line of developer/enthusiast hardware, like an evolution of the Nexus program. It is just a name, and one that no regular people recognise. If it's going to be known as the "Google Pixel" phone, the Pixel part is just a distraction and gives no insight into the nature of the device. I wish Google would grow some balls, get some serious business and marketing people in and stop approaching their releases as offerings which might pick up steam organically. They're aiming way too low IMO and these phones are doomed to tiny market share. keithzg Well, we'll see if a marketing blitz accompanies this rebranding. Boolean Corporation Just wanted to chime in to make everyone remember that HTC started its days as an OEM manufacturer, making devices on request. And only THEN started creating their own branded devices. Google's decision of getting the Pixels in HTC's hands is not by chance, HTC knows how to make unbranded barebones that can accommodate others' brands. k0n More of an ODM, to be honest - these were most of the time their designs, just tailored and branded by the partner (carriers, mostly). Same way Huawei and ZTE got their footholds in Europe later on... Firelight Tru dat. Palm phones (Treos and Pre's) were manufactured for Palm by HTC many moons ago. They have been both OEM and ODM in their lifetime. Fatty Bunter I think the name "Pixel" aligns pretty well with Google as a brand. Everyone knows the word pixel, and everyone knows google is kinda geeky. It gives you a good idea of what Pixel devices will be. The Googley-flavored brand. Not some random non-sequitur "nexus" identifier. Jondan Rothfus I've been wondering about this for a while now, and this Pixel news just fuels it. What if the Nexus branding is for Google's spiffed-up OS experience. This would include the Nexus Launcher, but also any other OS/app skins they could then throw on top of ASOP. Essentially Pixel phones with the Nexus experience, similar to Galaxy phones shipped with TouchWiz, etc. Max It seems to me that they chose Pixel because the philosophy behind that name was already products fully Google branded without any partner OEM branding (just Google Pixel, period) and that seems to be the way they're going to market these new phones. Meanwhile Nexus was a shared branding partnership (Huawei Nexus, LG Nexus, etc.). Pedantic Fascist Grammar Nazi But why not just brand every new phone a Google Nexus from now on? I wonder if there is actually an argument that can be made in favor of Pixel that can't be made for Nexus, if it was just arbitrary, or simply because someone high up likes the letter P. Nilanjan Chatterjee I think Google wants to do with the Pixel phone what they did with the Moto X, i.e. bring features similar to "Active Display", "Always listening", "double-twist gesture actions", etc. to these phones before bringing them to "stock" Android for all devices. What Google is thinking is: other OEMs are adding so many cool features to the devices on top of stock Android, so we should also do some features that are unique to our own hardware so that the hardware can compete better with those feature-rich phones. But the fact is: I don't think anybody would mind if they did this with the Nexus brand itself. Greg Madhere Actually I think the Pixel brand makes total sense for Google, since a pixel is nothing more than a small piece of a bigger picture. Google seems to have a bigger picture with its products that most people can't really see until they take a step back. dabug91 But the very definition of the word Nexus makes it basically the best name ever for a smartphone. Nexus - "a connection or series of connections linking two or more things." In other words: A Nexus phone connects a person to another person or all the world's information! Much better naming than just putting a dumb lowercase i in front of a name. :/ Duder12 Its about marketing and branding. The nexus brand was misunderstood because it was under marketed and had a different oems name on them every year. Those days are over. Things will make a lot more sense. David Ruddock Eh, the Nexus Player didn't have any OEM branding, nor did the Nexus Q. It was definitely the rule to cobrand on Nexus, just not one that Google seemed super concerned about strictly adhering to. This is a good point, though. Duder12 The Q didnt matter but yeah your right on the player. Any news on a new Android TV streamer from Google? David Ruddock Like I said to another comment, Google has all but explicitly said they're not in the ATV box business. They don't want to be and think partners are doing a fine job as is. Other than cost, is there anything a Nexus/Pixel ATV would do better than Shield? I think the demand is mostly for a cheaper Android TV, not a Google Android TV. And the upcoming Xiaomi ATV will do 4K on the cheap... assuming it ever fucking comes out. Edit: another commenter = you, whoops. Duder12 I talked to Google about the Mi Box. They said end of September but also said they have absolutely nothing to do with it. Also like I said in the other post. What are devs supposed to test the newest OS on if there is no Nexus Android TV device? Spence1115 The Nexus Player still got Nougat, and other devices like the Shield are hardly running significantly different software, as Android TV can't be massively customised. Serge Cebrian they will get a Pixel player just for that niuguy I think the higher cost for the Shield is good for the brand. Google is too known for "cheap shit" and not enough for premium. The shield is a fantastic premium box that represents Android TV the way it should be. Worth every penny, imo. marcusmarcus2 "the Nexus Player didn't have any OEM branding" Are you talking about the Asus Nexus Player? http://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/article_images/2014/11/nexus-player-bottom-hero.jpg Duder12 Ah snap didnt remember that. David Ruddock Whoops, I totally forgot about this. marcusmarcus2 Understandable as it is on the bottom which is probably face down 99.99% of the time you own it. breadteam The same can be said about your mom. marcusmarcus2 http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7eq4t1nb31rziwwco1_1280.gif Mix It's a face down, class up, type of device. Andy J Probably best not to the Nexus Q as an example.... for anything really..... God that was a terrible year for exciting announcements which failed spectacularly to be realised.... Deeco I thought the leks suggested they are HTC made? MJ Why can't Google just remove the OEM name and market the Nexus name? Jon Brooks At least you knew who made the Nexus. For some people, knowing the manufacturer gives them insight as to the build quality and design approach. Hiding this info isn't better for the consumer. Nexus sounds cool, and the word means a meeting point. Pixel sounds gay, and it only means a single picture element. Maybe it sounds weak because Pixel is similar to Pixie. I can already hear my grandpa saying "I want one of those pixie phones". Binshad T P Haris Well said. They could have gone for Google phone if they needed a change. mark Given that the news itself is based on a leak, I'd love to know your source that this was done because the nexus name isn't well known? Otherwise you're arguing with a straw man. Mel Torme Just give me a 5" Nexus, er, Pixel phone already. Duder12 Fuck chromecast. Where is my follow up to the nexus player that you are calling the PIXEL PLAYER!!! David Ruddock Google has pretty much confirmed they see no need to make such a thing. They're happy to let partners build ATV devices. Duder12 Yes but what about developers? We need a device to test our apps on the newest operating system. Serge Cebrian you buy the cheapest one from a partnet Serge Cebrian or the most featured one Cole Mickens So why do you think you want the Pixel Player but not the Chromecast? Duder12 Choice. A pixel player would be both android tv and a chromecast like the nexus player. Casting gets old. Honestly I love android tv. The experience is just better than casting imo. They each have their own use cases. Cole Mickens Okay, but why? Why do you want a smart TV? The last thing I want in my home is another computer, another thing to update, another security vulnerability waiting for someone to hack whenever it stops getting updates. Like, is browsing Twitter on a 60" TV really something you want to do? Are people actually making games for Android TV? "casting gets old" sounds like "it's stable and works as expected". --- Obviously you can like and want whatever you want... I'm just curious where the strong desire for Android TV comes from! Duder12 What are you talking about? The Nexus Player gets the exact same monthly security updates the Nexus phones do and its currently on Android 7 Cole Mickens It was just an example. I'm not making some big claim that Android TV is insecure. But yes, eventually the Nexus Player will stop getting security backports as well. Anyway, I'm just asking a simple question-- What do you want that Android TV does that Chromecast doesn't? Again, I'm purely curious why you want ATV so badly, not trying to tell you you're wrong. Duder12 I love the interface and the features. Its just so nice to talk to a remote and tell my tv what to play. Its also nice to browse apps and catalogs on the tv screen together with people in the same room. I also hate relying on a phone every time i want to play something. Android TV is just faster and less clunky. The Android TV launcher, google cast and google services etc are all broken out from the operating system just like the android phones so not all updates are tied to the OS. There is a reason apple is pushing apple tv so heavily. A large part of our future will be apps on the tv. Perfect example: https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/30/the-new-papa-johns-app-for-apple-tv-makes-ordering-a-breeze/ Cole Mickens well, I was on board until the "order pizza with a remote on your tv" edit. I'd rather bludgeon myself to death with a rock to the face. :) But to each their own. :P (I use the Xbox One as my sole receiver input, with the Chromecast plugged into that. Easy casting [I am glued to my laptop] plus apps and games on the Xbox.) keithzg To pipe in here, I know personally I use it not just for things that could be Casted, but also for local media on my home network. I don't have any DVD or Blu-Ray players and so rip all the media I purchase in disc form, for example, and it's much easier and nicer to have Kodi installed on my Nexus Player than to have to fiddle with discs. It's also really nice to have physical remotes. I rather like the Android TV youtube client (better than the normal Android one in many respects), and I actually find the experience of navigating with a remote nicer than poking at my smartphone screen. And that goes to a broader point that then I can be browsing the possible content up on my projector screen rather than my smartphone screen, which is a much nicer experience if there's a bunch of friends over sitting on my couches. For many people, especially single users, there probably isn't enough of a benefit to justify a Nexus Player or equivalent device over just grabbing a Chromecast; hell, my mom still uses an original-generation Chromecast with no issues. But for me, the extra benefits add up, and I'm really glad to have an Android TV device. JLV90 Twitter god no I want to see my dirty snapchat account. /s Jeff Beck Let me mark that on my calendar. 'New Google product day, AKA, no productivity day' Darth Vader 'No school day' / 'sick leave day' for me lol. whispy_snippet Just by chance I have leave already planned!

Greyhame Wow, that's a pretty pathetic life cycle for a watch. Glich yep.. Not happy with decay rate on a basically non replaceable battery. Greyhame Agreed. Battery technology sucks. niuguy Sure, but with that logic lets compare smartphone life cycle vs a rotary phone life cycle. Greyhame While the extrapolation is applicable, it's not cogent. Apples and oranges. Pedantic Fascist Grammar Nazi For apples and oranges, both of them: Are round, and are about the same size Enjoy warm color schemes Are edible Grow on trees Have seeds Are both sweet and tart Can be juiced Have skins In many ways they're identical, and are perfect for comparison. ;-) Joking aside, the analogy between smart watches and traditional watches seems very much the same as that for smart phones vs rotary phones. The argument appears cogent. Which part of niuguy's argument was unclear or illogical? Greyhame Hah, nice. I'd argue because the original poster was stating his watch is almost at EOL. I still have my OG Droid in a drawer somewhere, and it still works. I could use it if I wanted to, but I chose to upgrade (far too frequently I might add). And the same could be said for all of my old smartphones; they're still usable and function as intended. So for a two to three year old watch - or any electronic gizmo - to be dying, that is a pathetic lifespan. Even more so when you consider it is a watch, and watches can operate throughout an a person's entire life. Many phones (rotary, cordless [hah, blast from the past], etc.) do not have such lifespans. So, regardless of how applicable it is, it's still apples and oranges. diggie Great. Love scrolling down to comment sections and seeing an unending circle jerk of comments. Borgman At this point I just want a new phone, get me away from my Moto X 2014. Triple Threat If u can't wait get a 6p Borgman I'm in no immediate hurry, impatient is all lol. The battery deterioration is becoming increasing noticeable on the Moto X Triple Threat Oh ok then, you good lol blackice85 I'm in the same boat with my Nexus 6. I'm otherwise happy with it and was prepared to wait a bit longer, but lately the battery is dying rather fast. TigerMike901 At least there's some kind of event this time around, instead of a silent drop to the Google Store with no fanfare! Andy J they write a blog post..... what more do you want ;) Colin Dinelli 6? Greyhame 42. Qbancelli What? No new Chromebook or Tablet? I'm disappointed. David Ruddock No news of a tablet and we've heard zip about Google doing any more in-house Chrome OS hardware. Carlos A. Garcia Jr. probably due to the fact they plan on merging the two OS's... eventually...there wouldn't be a need of two brands David Ruddock you might be onto something....! Andy J ....or maybe..... it has something to do with their shiny new "runs everywhere" OS...... Darth Vader Fuchsia baby <3 Andy J ....and I'm predicting that within 1 week of it being generally available to run on anything, Netflix will have written an app to run on it... because Netflix really like it when people can watch anywhere. Renaldi I. I'm guessing that's what we'll see in the future when Google fleshes out a replacement for Android. In the meantime however... Boolean Corporation Picture this: Google's Android customization gets called Pixel OS. Speculation intensifies! Badelhas Do you believe that strategy could somehow help the Android fragmentation problem? hoosiercub88 People have been saying this for like 2-3 years now? I'd think if that were true, we'd be seeing some evidence of it now. Carlos A. Garcia Jr. Sundar confirmed this years ago...plus its starting...play store implementation was a small sign hoosiercub88 He also said that the Pixel C would be the first device to demonstrate Android/Chrome unity. That obviously isn't true, and yes Android apps are now rolling out to modern Chromebooks, but given the nature of a Chromebook and that most nicer ones include touchscreens, Chrome's waning support for their Chrome Web Apps.. it seems more like Android is going to drink up Chrome and Android will still be Android, with some extra Chrome on top of it. Darth Vader Or Android could be replaced with Fuchsia.. hoosiercub88 Now that would be a shocker Darth Vader Not really. Hangouts is being replaced (for consumers) with Allo and Duo. Nexus is being replaced with Pixel. hoosiercub88 Hangouts isn't exactly a well known cornerstone, and as I've said, the Nexus name is only popular and common to us. Android is Android though. That's different. Darth Vader Yeah. A billion devices run on Android. Marcellus1 Evidence like, oh I don't know, android apps running on Chromebooks? hoosiercub88 That was simply due to the fact that they've stated they're abandoning Chrome Web Apps, and that's sort've what ChromeOS relies on.. which is ultimately it's weak point because Chrome Web Apps are mostly garbage. Like I said. Chrome will still be Chrome and Android will still be Android.. you're not going to download Google Android on your desktop to surf the web, or run out and buy the latest Google Pixel Chrome phone or tablet. Qbancelli Ok, now I'm about to flip some tables. Padster I was really hoping for a new tablet. My Nexus 7 2012 died and they just dropped support for the 2013 one. There's not really any good stock-ish tablet around now... Rik Wall I know my n7 2013 is starting to get breakdown. T.J. The Pixel C. Padster Sorry, a 7-8-inch tablet, that's under $500 Cory Wilson I hear ya, my 2013 model was starting to have hardware problems, ffc died and it's accelerometer seems to be in bad shape so i replaced it with a shield k1 and I'm not really impressed with it. Gaming is awesome on it but as a tablet it's pretty terrible. Heavy to hold, terrible buttons, random lag issues, and ridiculously bad battery life. Bought the thing because everyone swore by it but I liked my Nexus 7 better Padster The K1 was the only other option I was considering. Oh well :/ Tyler Humphreys Yeah, but it isn't awful and $200 for the K1 is still a pretty good deal. I am pretty disappointed since I paid $400 for the 32GB LTE model though, I expected more for that price. JG I got a 32GB LTE Nexus 9 last summer for $350-ish. It lags occasionally, but over all its not too bad of a tablet. If your American & you can, I would suggest an LTE tablet. T-Mobile gives all tablets (regardless if you have an account with them or not) 200MB of absolutely free data every month. Its not a lot, but its more than what anyone else offers and its totally free. All you need is to stick one of their SIMs into the tablet and I register your name and email I believe was all they asked for. The only downside is it doesn't qualify for T-Mobile Tuesday. I tried to snag the free Pokemon Go data (figured it'd make the tablet slightly more useful) but when I entered the tablets phone number their site wouldn't let me in. Lars Jeppesen Makes more sense if you're NOT american. Only americans pay extra for multiple devices and SIMs. JG I said "if American" because, AFAIK, only the US T-Mobile is offering the 200MB for free deal. As far as paying extra, at least in this case. The only extra I had to pay was the difference between the WiFi only and the WiFi+LTE version of the tablet (i.e., pay for the LTE radio). I got the SIM for free (well other than shipping, but if you have a local T-Mobile store you could get them in person). Each month, T-Mobile credits me with 200MB of free data. I have thought of switching the tablet over to my Project Fi plan. The only "extra" I would pay for then is the data I use on the tablet. But then I think the 200MB T-Mobile gives me for free would be $2 on Project Fi, so... Might as well use the free stuff first. Though, I may be interested in paying a little extra. When announcing the new T-Mobile One plan, Legere mentioned tablets getting access to unlimited data for $20. If I can occasionally upgrade my 200MB tablet to unlimited when needed (like when we go on vacation)... then I'll probably bite on that occasionally. AnthonyRyan89 I enter my N7 LTE number on my phone in the app and get the code from my tablet and it works that way. JG hmm... So you got Pokemon Go free data on your 200MB tablet plan? I was using the website to try to get it & when I entered the tablet's number I got a message I wasn't eligible. I wonder if i complained to T-Mobile they'd add my account... Not that it really matters much. I installed the app on launch day and haven't touched it since. Though I suppose if I am going to, I should act fast as my Ingress username has been reserved for me in Pokemon. **Speaking of, since they're the same company... Any chance Ingress data was zero-rated along with Pokemon? If so, I'll defiantly have to look into it more. AnthonyRyan89 Just login T-Mobile Tuesday app on your phone with your tablets number get the code from your tablet and there you go add the free data with Pokemon with your tablet. I do it all of the time. Pedantic Fascist Grammar Nazi I'm still waiting for the Nexus 8... Indianajonze haven't you heard? the tablet market is dead. see: digital picture frames and e-readers for reference Aaron I keep hearing that, but at least on these websites, the demand for an affordably priced update to the Nexus 7 seems pretty high. I'd be all over an 8 inch Pixel tablet in the $300 range (not made by HTC nor powered by an nVidia SoC). Morten Ulv I wouldn't use a small handful of comments on an Android website as good statistics for what demand is. Aaron What about my own wants? If I want one, then isn't it safe to assume that I am not alone? Morten Ulv You can assume it, but it's not a good tool for market analysis. :) Aaron Yeah it's like Sam Jackson said, when you make an assumption you make an ass out of u and mption. :) Mister Wirez I agree.. not as much HTC, but the nVidia SoC is trash. Gets hot n laggy. I hate it. Juanma Tastzian Just call it the "Chromecast Pixel" and call it a day. Andy J Google Cast is the product name, Chromecast is the brand. Renaldi I. Slight correction: Google Cast is the protocol, Chromecast is the Google product that is powered by it. Andy J Yup you are correct. I almost wrote "service" instead of Product which I guess would have been a bit less ambiguous. Andrew Hayes Seriously though, no one's calling for the Chromecast to be renamed the Pixel Stick? David Ruddock lol ericshmerick Pickle Steek whispy_snippet Actually, Pixelcast kinda makes sense. Not that it will happen. Tim R. Hah. Love it. Anyway, I'm guessing their products will be Google branded from here on out and anything with a screen will be under the Pixel sub-brand. Lon Grove Just give me h.265/hevc streaming support and they can call it whatever the f**k they want. I'll buy 3 on day one. Jay T VP9! Youtube with less bandwidth sounds good to me! Drew M I was surprised the last chromecast refresh didn't include vp9 and 265 codec support for 1080p because it reduces bandwidth for Google too. Hopefully they can match the same price point as the previous two. Killa All kids want Pixel Sticks!! JG Now I want a Pixie stick... thanks a lot :p Brad Just eat a sugar packet from mcdonalds Nate Tinner Would kinda work, too... playing off their whole Android candy scheme. Diaz1999 so it's kinda Apple Pencil? Abhishek Saral I don't think that a mobile device made by Google will be amazing. We have seen in past they are overpriced a bit. Nathan Smith It's made by HTC, not Google. But, yeah, don't expect them to be as cheap as last years'. Darth Vader $499 for Pixel $599 for Pixel XL. Aaron They better be awesome in the flesh, because the renders have not been attractive enough to justify them prices. jonathan3579 Ugh, seeing those prices makes me miss the 6P's launch pricing all the more. 😩 Nathan Smith $499 for the Pixel (Sailfish) sounds about right, but I don't expect there to be a $100 difference. The two phones have almost the exact same specs. I'm thinking more along the lines of a $50-$70 difference. Darth Vader The base models are 32 GB BTW. Abhishek Saral Yeah I don't expect them to be cheap but I would love if they have a nice design with some pure black colors. mikeytusa I was hoping to hear something about Project Ara but The Verge just reported it has been cancelled. Bummer. Will ⚽ That is the verge though.. mikeytusa It was actually Reuters that reported it and it's just being regurgitated by everyone else now. Will ⚽ and it's here on AP. damn Will ⚽ I want a Pixel Q. sbeaulieu That's a lot of "Pixel" on that new chromecast! :O Danske My body is ready. ArrTooDeeToo If this new Chromecast does away with the need for a wi-fi network (as in, the ability to connect directly to the chromecast) then I'm sold. Also, shame on Google for no new tablet. Andy J That would be a nightmare for developers though....... Nicholas Conrad WTF: 'If the new Chromecast can connect directly to a Chromecast'...??? ArrTooDeeToo Oops. Meant to say device. Chromecast Device, as opposed to Chromecast Router device. Nicholas Conrad Oh, you mean 'wifi direct'. Aja Hemphill I agree. This needs to happen, especially after they made the horrible decision to drop support for Miracast. How else am I supposed to watch stuff at hotels with their crappy internet...? Renaldi I. I need that itshappening.gif, STAT Andy J Google Assistant? No? I notice very careful wording about Google Home "fully detail" is very distinctly different to "launch" or "unveil" which suggests that they may demo it, but not launch it? JD October 4th?

JD you don't know what it's like - I'm the one out there every day putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order. You're out of order. The whole freakin' system is out of order.

Forget it, 7-Down, it's Chinatown David Foggia When we getting a new tablet Đức Thành Fall 2020 lomsha February 31st David Foggia O rly? Thx pal 👍🖖 Darth Vader Leaked prices are $499 and $599 for Pixel and Pixel XL, respectively. Keep in mind, like all leaks, this one could be wrong as well. Rik Wall Yeah if that's the prices, then they didn't learn from the last time they jacked up the prices. hoosiercub88 Prices won't be relevant, if they actually sell these devices at carrier stores. So that consumers can purchase them on their device payment plans. Aaron But carrier branded phones contradict the positives of buying Nexus. They don't get all the bells and whistles of a Galaxy, for example, but don't get loaded with tons of carrier bloat, either. And they also avoid the long update delays imposed by the carriers. tl;dr what's the motivation to buy Pixel when they're loaded with bloat, delayed from updating, and just as expensive as the competition? hoosiercub88 I get what you're saying, but Nexus phones don't sell like Galaxy phones because they're not the center of attention like Galaxy phones or iPhones. If they were it might be a different story. Having a Nexus is kind of like being part of an exclusive club that caters only to purists and enthusiasts. They're great phones, but without good advertising AND availability. If the average consumer can't walk into a store and buy the device, considerably less people are going to buy it. wade_county Problem is, that failed with the Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 6. Extremely hard to top iPhones and Galaxy for the normies. Aaron I've had 5 Nexus devices, including both N7's and three Nexus phones, so I get what you are saying. But Samsung spends more money on advertising than anybody, and average customers buy what they see. If the carriers even just interfere with timely updates of the Pixel phones (and you know they will), why would anyone buy them over the current Galaxy device? Just look at the HTC 10. It was a solid, beautiful device that nobody wanted or bought. Calvin Don´t allow the carriers to change the software and outside? I don´t understand why that is allowed in the US, it´s fucking stupid. Fuck you Verizon, fuck you Sprint, fuck you AT&T. (and maybe fuck T-Mobile too?) Scott Harris Pixel? It's been a nice run with Android. Maybe it's finally time to switch to iPhone when I move on from my Nexus 6P. mikeytusa Is there something that offends you with the word "pixel?" Abhishek Saral It might not have pure android as we know it on Nexus phones mikeytusa It's still coming from Google. I don't think Google is going to suddenly switch to Touchwiz. marcusmarcus2 I never understood the naming of that. Who in their right mind would want to touch wiz? tim242 You never know, with Google. They are schizo. Renaldi I. The Nexus phones never came with pure Android anyway hoosiercub88 They came with the Google ideal version of Android with their apps included, not AOSP base Android. So Stock, not pure, AOSP roms are all but useless without Google services. With the Nexus launcher being a thing, I think we're going to see Google shift away from being a solid platform to trying more experimental things, good or bad. I have been on the fence myself and I think I could live with an iPhone. I already have an iPad and I like it alright, there are things I'd do differently but hey I've used Android for so long that it's just frustrating at times. Abhishek Saral I think that almost all the features available on the Nexus phone's stock rom are available in a AOSP ROM. I think only difference between them are the google apps which comes pre-installed on Stock ROM. What I meant that all the software features that nexus phones phones have are there in the aosp code and they don't have any proprietary feature. But this time around Pixels phones might have like the Nexus Launcher maybe which can't simply be downloaded by every device except the pixel/nexus phones. We might just have to sideload it on other phones hoosiercub88 That is correct, no Play Store, no Google Services.. it's a very boring, and uninteresting OS to play with, with no Google integrations. You get very basic functionality. So when people say Stock Android, they tend to mean what comes on Nexus/Google branded devices, where Play Store access is available and the hardware can utilize Google's services. Not AOSP. Renaldi I. Serious question: are you going to abandon the entire Android ecosystem due to a name change? tim242 After reading everything he had to say, are you really asking that question??? marcusmarcus2 Seeing as Renaldi asked the question (11:03PM) before Scott posted "everything he had to say" (11:27PM), are you really asking that question??? Scott Harris Pixel is a small thing I dislike among a growing list of things I dislike about the direction Android and Google is going. whispy_snippet Why? Scott Harris Tired of slow OS updates on everything but Nexus phones (and I assume Pixel phones). With iOS, if the device is eligible, I can get it the same damn day it's released. Only way I get that on Android is if I have a Nexus and the stars align and I get the OTA that day. Either that or jumping through hoops and manually applying it, which is ridiculous. Luckily I was able to do the enroll in beta thing and get Nougat quickly, otherwise lord knows how long I'd have to be waiting to get Nougat. Tired of apps often taking forever to jump from iOS to Android if they ever make the jump. Tired of the Android version of some apps being trash relative to the iOS version. And this is the biggest one for me - Tired of being lucky to get two years of OS updates for my phone. Even Google is only going to do two years of updates of for Nexus phones, and I assume now Pixel phones as well. That really pissed me off when I read that. Google's devices should be the gold standard for what OS update support should be like on all Androids, yet Google simply settles for a mediocre standard. Yeah sure I can root it and install custom ROMs, but I don't want to deal with that mess anymore. On iPhone you generally get four years of updates. I may not get all the new features, when the phones is three of four years old, but at least I officially get something. iPhone 5 was released in 2012 and is supposed to be getting the next version of iOS that I think will be released this month. Tired of the relative lack of accessory support for Android devices unless I buy a Samsung or a select few other devices, and I refuse to ever buy Samsung again after an absolutely atrocious tablet experience with a Samsung. And even at that, Samsung and the select few other devices accessory support just can't compete for what is available for iPhones. Often I will see an iPhone case and will be like "Hmm, I wonder if I can find one like that for my phone?" and just about never can find an equivalent, for example. Tired of app manufacturers often failing to take advantage of new features in new versions of Android because the overwhelming majority of Android users won't have the new version of Android within six months of it's release. Tired of Google having absolutely no freaking clue whatsoever how to create a messaging app. Just about had it with Hangouts, then they had to say eff it and start all over and come out with messenger, Duo, and Allo, all of which are halfbaked on their own. Greyhame Complain a lot, you do. Leave Android, you should. whispy_snippet Plenty of understandable points even though I don't necessarily agree with all of them. But yes, you've definitely spelled out the worst parts of the Android experience. Although I don't think you should assume phones will receive delayed updates. I think they'll get them pronto. Just be wary (and I'm sure you are) that a switch to iOS will bring its own swathe of pros and cons. No side is perfect. Scott Harris Pixel phone OS updates won't be pronto if Google continues to insist on this staged role out nonsense for updates. Sure, it will be quicker than every other Android, but still not iPhone type quick. Lars Jeppesen Enjoy prison maverick7526 It's staged for a reason. Remember that iPhone update everyone applied and then it bricked their phone? Immediately?! The most you have to wait for an update with a nexus is 2 weeks or so. Not that big of deal. You complain about update speed and updates longevity, however an iPhone 4 or whatever may have this year's OS on it, but it's the equivalent of going out to a 2010 model year car and crossing out 2010 and writing 2016 in the owners manual. Nothing changed, everything is still the same. Scott Harris Sure the iPhone 4s, when it got iOS 9, didn't get everything. It didn't have the required hardware support for one thing. It received some bug and security fixes, which many Androids either never receive or don't receive at all after one year. It also received optimizations for speed (although in some usage it didn't help any) and Low Power mode. Alas, I won't be keeping a phone for four years anyways unless I have no other financial choice. But at least iPhone gives me an option to keep a phone for 4 years and receive some kind of official update, even if it is nothing but a security update. That sure as hell isn't happening on any Android these days. maverick7526 Even with support for 4 years, iPhone isn't as secure as Android is. Changing some numbers in your settings isn't going to fix that part of iOS. Most security is handled by the play store/play services, so as long as that phone can handle new versions of those apps, a lot of your security concerns are handled. whispy_snippet Plenty of understandable points there even if I don't necessarily agree with all of them. But yes, you've definitely spelled out the worst parts of the Android experience. Although I don't think you should assume the Pixel phone will endure delayed updates. I think they'll get them pronto. Just be aware (and I'm sure you are) that a switch to iOS will bring its own swathe of pros and cons. No platform is perfect. thequinox I agree with almost all your frustrations, but it's important to factor cost into this decision as well. While iPhones may have double the life in terms of updates, they are often double the cost. Couple that with the fact that newer versions of iOS are notorious for slowing down older phones and you'd be better off buying two cheaper phones over the course of four years than buying the iPhone. Just something to consider. Now, if Google does what some people are predicting and starts asking a premium price for their phones, that's where this falls apart. The Nexus line worked best with Google's corporate ADD using the low cost model of the N4/5/7 IMO. Scott Harris But they also have a longer lasting high resale value. tim242 You and me both : ( marcusmarcus2 IMO, this comment just screams "I need attention" Scott Harris IMO, this reply screams "I need attention." Naxx ENVY Ok, you'll be back Marooned Pirate What I find weird is that I have an ad on this article for the Chromebook Pixel even though it's out of stock. Not sure why Google would advertise a product that's out of stock seemingly forever. whispy_snippet Here we go! *air horn* Carlos A. Garcia Jr. the multi colored dots for boot up makes more sense now....they are pixels Sam Del Valle http://i.imgur.com/JXTSoPk.gif Renaldi I. I was wondering when you'd show up! *See earlier comment* Fakhruddin Darwis It took me awhile to realise that "10-4" means 4 October, not 10 April. senor_heisenberg Any word on Google designing their own chips like Apple and Samsung, going forward? Greyhame Google is a software company, what makes you think this is likely? senor_heisenberg They make laptops and tablets as well. They're not only a software company. Greyhame I suppose that's correct. But making those devices is a far cry from making a mobile phone, let alone silicon of their own. Cory Wilson Trying to figure out why there isn't a nexus player successor. They going to support the original forever? Gotta have a reference device, and most likely it'll be cut off next year jonathan3579 http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7blqjBiP21qldu2b.gif hoosiercub88 With leaks the way they are now a days, I'm not even excited to see the announcement. I'm sure it'll be great, unless they've managed to keep something seriously cool under wraps, it's gonna be meh for me personally. I'll continue to enjoy my 6P until it is no longer supported then decide what to do from there. I might go iPhone, I might go Galaxy, if LG doesn't drop another lamebomb like the G5, may even wander off that plank. Greyhame Google usually keep some gems hidden to drop right then and surprise us. Apple on the other hand.... hoosiercub88 Honestly, in recent years, neither company has been very good at keeping anything very well hidden. There are no longer surprises to get excited about anymore. I guess I'm getting to the point where I don't care lol Greyhame Google Home? You're too jaded, man. hoosiercub88 Jaded? Not at all, we've been teased with [email protected] products for years, with the acquisition of Nest and the OnHub routers.. I'm just not excited about it anymore. They'll release some stuff that I'm probably not going to buy. I'm sure it'll be neat, but I'm just not as excited about the annual Google cycle as I used to. *shrug* Ryan Cavitt 4K Chromecast? Fucking SWEET. The Drowning of the Lake I am disappointed that it is not being announced in September. Darth Vader I wake up to disappointment everyday knowing the phones haven't been announced. Marshall There is a small event on the 7th of september , by a small company....maybe this could explain that... emailrob Allo? Is it me you're looking for? Boolean Corporation I just installed an extension to reload all the tabs at once, in preparation for that day. mattcoz https://sosonwa.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/20130725-233451.jpg Aaron Rest in peace, Willy Wonka. Naga Sridhar What about the rumored Android watches AP had leaked before? vyktorjonas completely forgot about that and probably so did everyone else Diaz1999 lmao Ailín Ó’S 4 October is so far away. After my LG G3 went to heaven I was hoping for a new Nexus, er, Pixel device before the end of September. Ho hum. Jason Pagliaro I really hope that the NVIDIA Shield TV is capable of 4k Chromecast through an update. cadtek91 *Google Cast. Chromecast is the hardware. marcusmarcus2 To be fair, Chromecast became just hardware though a software update. The software side used to be called Chromsecast as well. Some people have trouble getting used to saying Google Cast. I blame habit. person The technology was always Google Cast (I see mention of it in the initial announcement). The extension and management app were just called Chromecast and were changed in an update. marcusmarcus2 "The extension and management app" The extension and management app are software and are the software I was refering to. Jason Pagliaro Fair enough. J.J. It appears with the few leaks I've seen the affordable Nexus is gone. "Pixel" equals expensive! Google phones may end up at the carriers again maybe unlocked and unadulterated but $600+ EowynCarter Well, the last nexus weren't cheap. Actually, the N4 and N5 where an exception, and everyone act as if it's the rule.. J.J. Not cheap but much more affordable than any of the other flagships. At $499 the 6p was still hundreds less than lg htc Samsung flagships and performed as well or better in some categories. EowynCarter I paid 610 euros for my N6. An awful lot of money for a phone. J.J. 4 of the last 5 nexus devices more were affordable than flagships of their time. I can't blame anyone for thinking that was a trend Leandro Brandão I wish this event was on september 7th so i have no more tech expectations until next year. Aaron What's the motivation to buy Pixel when they're loaded with bloat by the carriers, delayed from updating by the carriers, and just as expensive as the competition? Max What? tim242 Missed a lot, haven't you? person Missed what? tim242 All of the latest on the new Pixel phones. Google's new vision is skinned carrier phones. Naxx ENVY No it isnt lol . its just more google software . not skinned tim242 Regardless of which company adds the skin...a skin is a skin. Then they are going to carriers, so they will inevitably have the bloat. Have fun! saf1927 Don't buy from carriers then? George Carriers don't add skins on phones. blindexecutioner Nexus phones have always been "skinned". They are not stock Android. I don't think you can even buy a real "Stock" phone. They come with the google now launcher, not the AOSP launcher, they come with proprietary messenger app, gmail...etc just like a Samsung or anything else except Google does it. The pixels will be the same. PerhapsNever Provide a link to where you head that Google is doing "skinned carrier phones". Google itself doesn't seem to have a link to a source on that. Aaron Carriers love to add bloat to devices they sell, and carriers always interfere with updates on devices they sell. Samsung can't even prevent the carriers from interfering with their devices and they sell more phones than anyone. Max First of all Apple devices don't have bloatware, so there's definitely a way but most companies prefer to go the easy route. And lastly as long as Google sells unlocked vanilla Pixel phones the same way than Nexus then I don't care much about whatever carriers want to do with their subsidized/financed phones. That said, I see that you're simply assuming that's what will happen with Pixel phones then, you don't have any proof or even leak to support your assumption. Aaron We do know forbawhile fact that the last phone Google sold through the carriers, the Nexus 6, was hindered from updating by the carriers. Just look up Nexus 6 updates and AT&T. Even phones bought from Google and then brought to AT&T were affected. As for the rest, I am speculating, but given that Apple is the only company to stand up to the carriers in regards to updates and bloat, I don't think it's unfair to prejudge in this case. Hope I'm wrong. Doubt I will be. lomsha Pray tell where you got all that info. Aaron History.... blindexecutioner Oh god that would be so funny if they ended up treating them like regular carrier phones and Google simply updated AOSP every year without actually updating devices in the same way. Can you imagine the uproar? They do have bloat, which is really any app you don't want that is preloaded, but at least google runs Android and gives an easy way to disable or even remove it.. Suicide_Note https://i.imgur.com/aVOSkIC.gif marcusmarcus2 October 4th https://media.giphy.com/media/26ybwt4DLOD9d4G08/giphy.gif Stemhead Anything about the watches? Go Faster Why choose to call it the Pixel phone? Instead of camera pixels it sounds more like a phone that will have a photo of a Pixie on the back....LOL And they'll add the pixie dust for an additional $29.99 George Idk maybe because they have a pixel Chromebook and tablet? Go Faster Genius answer. Lets get Apple to rename their iPhone to the MacBook Pro phone? Alex De La Rosa they'll probably announce the new Pixel phones before Allo comes out keithzg They'll probably ship the new Pixel phones before Allo comes out. Theuntje No pixel android wear watch in all the pixel madness? JG I hope we get at least an official acknowledgement that they exist and that the project is still active... Though preferably, I would LOVE to be able to place an order for a Pixel XL and Pixel Watch LTE and Google Home bundle (and a data only SIM for my current 5X)... Ah, who am I kidding, might as well pick up the Chromecast Ultra to... Rovindra Singh What about ALLO? For Christ's sake are they seriously going to wait until October 4th now to release it? tim242 Calm down. They said later this summer. They have 3 more weeks of summer, before you get your pitchforks out. Besides, it will just be another half-assed messaging app from Google... saf1927 Yeah, we had enough of these failed IM services, like ChatOn. Cael I can't believe people are excited for something they will have to ask/beg other people to download just to use. Kenneth Porter I don't know if my dying Nexus 5 is going to make it until then. My Nexus 7 died last week. Move faster time!! Chips N Long as the Chromecast stays the same, consistent 35$ I'm a potential Day One buyer. AbbyZFresh 4K is expensive. It is not gonna be $35. Никита Кабаков you're not buying the display lomsha Come ooon another month. In that case i hope they are ready to order and ship right after the announcement. scorpeeon At this point I guess it's pretty safe to say that these new phones will be Daydream-ready, right? Никита Кабаков Every Nougat phone is scorpeeon Nope. Most of them aren't. surethom Wow nice hopefully the Google smartwatches aswell. Jeet Swami Please launch on the same day. It's my birthday I deserve a gift :D Mahesh Where are those NexPix watches?? Waiting for next Hardware October 2018?? MeCampbell30 Allo? Anyone there? LondonLeedsFan But we all want Allo, right?! Nuno G. I still don't get why Google doesn't announce this new phones (or whatever) more closely to the Apple announcement. And even after they announce it, they always take a lot of time to release them to the streets!!! It should be, announce one day, max 5 days and it would be out on the streets!!! niuguy That's a terrible idea. Apple would completely drown out Google in terms of coverage. Keep_on Sometimes I wonder if AP can take legal actions against other sites for outrightly jacking their work and pasting in their blogs without shame. Никита Кабаков that is stupid. Info is free Steven Santinelli Finally! I've been holding out getting a new Echo for the living room, since we moved (Echo in kitchen and Dot in bedroom).... I was HOPING it wasn't just something they were talking about (Like Allo) and actually releasing the product.... sabret00the Google are treating people like both consumers and products now? Why on Earth wasn't the the last Chromecast 4K? keithzg Because for $35 there's only so much a product can do? And because 4K over wireless is only starting to be viable? AI_human Nexus = well known, cool Pixel = what's that? rjyanj Nobody knows what a Nexus is. If you're reading AP, you obviously do, but for the 99% of the global population that doesn't give a shit about cell phones and tech, the Nexus doesn't exist. The iPhone and the Galaxy probably do. thequinox You're right, but changing the name won't magically fix it. Google would actually have to start caring. niuguy Yes, but with a new philosophy you need a new name. The relative few who know Nexus phones will pick it up soon anyways. It's not like grandma is going to wonder what happened to her Nexus phones. Nes ALL MIGHT CHROMECAST, PLUS ULTRA! Brad Hope they're actually available when they go on sale... that's my biggest issue haha danifeb So... Pixel phone won't be 4k... Borgman How soon does Google typically release phones after the event? Next day? Next week? Longer? keithzg They tend to go up for order pretty much immediately, is my recollection. Although how long 'til they then ship has varied dramatically. Ricky Haze That's a big 10-4 good buddy TechGuy22 4k CHROMECAST :( i bought a smart cast TV Mike Arnett Why not a Chromecast Pixel? Diaz1999 Pixel Cast. HSidhu any word on Allo? mcampbell Oh Google, you were so close to getting my money this year. Went with the OP3 instead, the spec sheet on the new Nexus/Pixel devices doesn't justify the price tags like that does. blindexecutioner How could they be better? mcampbell 6GB RAM, front facing speakers and a better looking phone for starters? The negligible amount of pros vs buying the OP3 don't make it worth $600 when there's clearly equal or better options for less money. Никита Кабаков > 2016 > chooses devices by specs > buys 1+3 HAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAhh mcampbell Google support, bigger battery and slightly better screen = worth $200 more? I think not. Danske You don't even know the official price or the official specs, but hey enjoy your one plus 3 because no nexus/pixel owner gives a shit. mcampbell How you feeling now bud? Just wondering Danske Feeling great, bud! Ordered 128GB for $1229 AUD! Can't wait to get the upgrade my 3 year old Nexus 5 deserves. Jibin Johns 'Nexus Launcher' on "Pixel phone"!!! seriously? Álvaro R. They can change the name on the App. is not Hard Evan Adams This is proof Google has marketing making decisions. The Nexus name didn't make it because it wasn't sold, so what does the marketing people do? Rebrand and rename. If they don't promote the new name no one will remember this either. If they really want to be smart they would call it pixel-16 and just say their naming will follow years. A pixel2 next year is a stupid name, why would Joe blow consumer get a pixel2 when iPhone hits ver 9 aRvInD So #nexusracemaster turns #pixelracemaster Mansgame I'm sad about the demise of the Nexus phones. I hope the Pixel phones won't cost more than the Nexus phones did. Casey I know the N6 and the N6P had many differences. Hopefully Google realizes the pricing on the N6 was far too high. The 6P was much better received. Over and out, 10-4 good buddy. Nathan Bryant Its more of a rebranding to take more control. I don't think its that dramatic. Bryan Pizzuti The best part of this is knowing that, with a 4k Chromecast in the works, 4k content should start showing up on Google Play. Casey I have $700 set aside to buy this phone. If that won't cover the cost I'll have to look at the 6P or a refurb S7 Edge for $480 at Best Buy. muledoggie You are forgetting the BEST feature: updates to the future versions and fixes of Android OS in the future, unlike 95% of the 'droid phones out there. AJ2 Pixel phones? Why not call them Google phones? That's what all my iPhone friends call my Nexus. Google /Android is just confusing the branding even more. Smh David Something for me to count down to. Consider my calendar marked! Another Scott Is there any hope that these Pixel phones will be Tango-enabled (<== that's a link)? I'm still running a Nexus 4 and hope to get something new this fall, but I would hate for Tango to take off 3 months after I upgrade. :-/ The idea of having a phone that can take 3D measurements/feed it into modeling software is very appealing. Here's hoping that Google actually lets Tango grow into something useful for most people... Cheers, Scott. _jsw_ I think word has it that the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro (also a link) is going to be the only Tango device for at least a while, and since it's not even out yet (in theory, "this summer", so in the next few weeks, maybe), I really doubt these Pixels will have it. As a Tango tablet user, this disappoints me as well. Serge Cebrian My Pixel 6P feels the need to be updated :P surethom Hopefully the 2 Android smartwatch will also be announced. _jsw_ After loving the hi-res screen of my N6P, I'm really going to be disappointed moving to a single Pixel phone. I guess it'll be more like an indicator light. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ What? No #pixelmasterrace comments? XD marcusmarcus2 http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/09/01/google-will-announce-pixel-phones-4k-chromecast-google-home-daydream-vr-viewer-on-october-4th/#comment-2872976778 ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ BAHAHAHA! Martin I'm more excited about that 4K Chromecast than the Pixel phones. Idk why but I have a bad feeling about those. WalkerPAranger 4K Chromecast would be cool. Although I don't do a lot of renting of movies through the Play Store (actually none at all) Let's hope Home is priced right. Would love to have the power of Google in an Amazon Echo. Jay Quir Finally a 4k chromecast, all my digital movies are on Play so this will be good. R.I.P Nexus brand looks like I wont be joining the Pixel crowd and going elsewhere for my android phones for the time being. I'll wait till next year and see what Google's next phone iteration will be. keithzg 10 - 4 = 6 Divide 6 by the number of phones being released . . . Half-Life 3 confirmed! Danske Honestly this needs more upvotes haha. C64 10-4 means the 10th of April over here 😂 (my freaking birthday) Johny Burns Expect another quiet exit in the next 1-2y. It seems those googlers never learned that they have no clue what a hardware is. scottalias Any new tablet rumors? Badelhas Does anybody know if the rumors indicate that the smaller version Pixel will have the following characteristics? - Metal Chassis - Dual front Speakers Cheers Danske Based on rumours: - Yes to the metal chassis. - No to the dual front speakers. Badelhas I will be keeping my HTC one m8 longer, then. I just had the micro usb replaced and the guy cleaned up the speaker grills. I now have the sound output just has it was when I bought it. And here I was thinking that the speakers were just "tired". This is by far the best smartphone I ever had. Fast, smooth and beautiful. Badelhas Thanks. That's a pity. Matthew Brown Whatever happened to that pair of smartwatches we were hearing about? We're those canceled? SimonSaid I really want to get excited about Google Home, but have yet to work out what I'll be able to do on it that I won't just be able to do on my phone. Is it really just for the edge use case of 'my phone isn't in my pocket and I want to do/know/note something right now'? Mike Etter Do we know if they will broadcast this event (presumably on YouTube)? SilentGuardian75 . where can we watch this live? Serge Cebrian where can we watch it live?

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 239 Plus 1 on G+ 1179 Share on Facebook 437 Share on Twitter Total Shares1418 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SafetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms that: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play Store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Blac Chyna instagram However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SafetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ C64 This is an English website, so you have to talk English. I'm Dutch, so i talk (or try to talk) English too. It hasn't to be perfect, but it would be bs if I talked Dutch over here. 'Want 90 procent van de mensen hier spreken geen Nederlands' Or do you like to use translate with everything freaking post Φώτης Chill. It was literally just two words. Not that big of a deal, don't you think? AnubArack Is it that hard to write 2 words in another language then? Kevin Strident Yo no se. You try it. Φώτης Of course not. Actually this is exactly what happened :p AnubArack You and @kevinstrident:disqus are sooooo funny.

Or I can go on living my life. I may choose the latter. C'est la vie, damn how easy (adult) was that ? d0x360 You can talk in whatever language you want. You won't get many people paying any attention to anything you say but who cares? Also...use Google to translate it. It's that button at the very bottom. Yes, exactly xyz Du-te dracului Rebel without a Clue Want 90 procent van de mensen hier spreekt ;) C64 Sorry i was stoned 🤣 Rebel without a Clue Hahaha ok dan mag het Keletor Thank you much! You are awesome, and I totally respect you for that statement and the use of the Commodore insignia. AntiCoyote Not really fair, every single Dutch person I know speaks English as well as an American :o) C64 I'm sorry that we Dutch learn English at school :p davidus The real reason behind this is that there arent many ppl to talk to in first place, if u only speak dutch. Trust me, i m from a neighbour country ;) Me Or some Bixby xyz I don't think Google can translate dipshit. Seems to be a rarely spoken language. pcriz Um okay, whatever that means. DavidEssex How about not being ignorant. xyz Ignorant? No one speaks every language in the world, dipshit. Өөрийгөө Зөндөө Go ArclightX flüggåәnkб€čhiœßølįên There!

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). Yan Minari You better tell us more about how you set up this. stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO David Gabel And you are a loud mouth keyboard warrior that loves to talk a big game, but in reality have little to no control over anything and use web forums to spout obscenities and violent threats to make yourself feel better. DJMix How is it only bobbuttons' comment that made sense? They all basically say the same thing. David Gabel Unlike the others, he said it intelligently rather than in a rude and attacking way. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Ravonus Damitri this guy is a nut ha... I agree with you 100% bro. Ravonus um yes you can fake it... Sure you can't block the traffic... but you sure can make it seem like the traffic is coming from your phone and not being used to tether.. Which is what these apps do.. SMH lol Latheryin If that is what you wish to believe. OK. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. My1 even if you dont have any right to access netflix, the whole point of netflix and others is making it easier to use those than to do piracy but when netflix goes around branding the rooted users as pirates and blocking them, they sure arent helping their purpose. especially if netflix is (I dont have it so I didnt try) runs on VGA and DVI Screens (no HDCP) where you can just capture the stuff. I mean it's say same withz Bluray Playback on PC, in addition to needing a Bluray Drive, you need an HDCP Compliant Graphics card, bus encryption, and HDCP compliant Monitor, and not to forget You Piece of PowerDVD which you have to upgrade (aka buy again) every few years because the older versions dont get Key Updates. and then we have stuff like unskippable trailers and all the other bluntly said Bullshit when dealing with that. of course Piracy is easier, just download the file and play it on any device you want, no internet and nothing required and no problems. My1 and even if one piece of software wont run in an Admin account, with LUA even on Admin they arent having and privileges unless you kick in the UAC, and to top it, even if the app wont be running if I force it as admin, and only runs with active LUA concept, I can still run anything else as admin and screw the other software running as normal user over (cheatengine is the perfect example for this) Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. My1 well but from another side, root can also be used to just patch any holes that were there. actually happened a few times before. My1 banking apps dont have a reason for a root check if they are done properly, i.e. TANs are generated with an air-gapped extra device. TANs on the phone are in general not safe and if the TAN is able to be generated offline, someone could use an exploit to root, steal the secret for TAN generation and boom, it's over. and dont even start thinking about sms-TAN, it's even worse. also when I just want to look into what my account is doing, I am not happy when I cant do so. My Bank (Hypovereinsbank) more or less recently blocked root and well I just RootCloaked that thing into oblivion and can do my stuff. but I'll probably change anyway since they sadly have no good way of TANs (just paper-based list-TANs, SMS and app) TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? My1 well at least a rooted phone is objectively better than a non rooted one, but relatively and subjectively speaking, if a non-rooted phone is good enough for someone then let it be so. EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Thomas Gladdines That's nonsense, the recovery works fine with or without a locked bootloader. Only fastboot won't work but that's only needed when you don't have a custom recovery to flash images. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player My1 actually it depends on how the build the DRM, if it's made to be only active when you are for example streaming netflix and does nothing for local content, which for sure can be legal (e.g. ripping DVDs in finland is no problem because CSS is not considered an "effective" protection method ever since 2007) although if the DRM would be everywhere it wouldnt be funny. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. My1 debugging is a joke right? If it's not WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I mean debugging is a core part of developing and any developer probably has it active m477 I've only seen it working like that once, so it might be an isolated case. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. Actually l like bezels Why? What do you get with root? BobButtons Primarily for system level ad-blocking. None of the non-root options can even compare. I refuse to allow ads when they have the ability to fill the entire screen and vibrate the phone. Even with being able to block ads, I still purchase the ad-free option of apps I support. Matthew Wilson Updates. Security updates. DJMix What do you mean what do we get from root? We get everything! Everything! Actually l like bezels Well not Netflix. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. My1 well yeah if you actually bypass the thing you are a pirate (not a thief because stealing != illegal copy) but branding people pirates and making the software refuse if something that MIGHT be used for piracy is on the device isnt not better. 天地人 Theft is when I take your bike and it's gone and you do not have a bike anymore. When I pirate, are you losing your software or your right to sell your software? Plus, if you actually developed software, I'd probably pay for it since you aren't some big corporation. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. 天地人 Of course it depends on what you're watching. The same ideology cannot be applied to everything. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. My1 well I would and I do give my money for legal media consumption when possible but when some things have region locks, meaning I cant import them or other stupid Ideas like Netflix not doing rooted devices, I certainly wouldnt like giving money for something I cant use. My1 not really. I have streamed and/or downloaded stuff in the past (coz not available here) just to buy their blurays years after when it finally came to germany Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. My1 but doesnt the actual unlock wipe everything? EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. Captain_Invisible But you don't even need to root to get blocked. Just using a custom ROM or having an unlocked bootloader triggers it.. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. My1 well knox flag is annoying but I honestly like my Galaxy Note 4 which is the last good Samsung in my opinion becase anything later either doesnt have microSD, doesnt have a swappable batter or doesnt have both (Galaxy S6 for example) but these are 2 very important things and I really like some parts of the samsung rom, although a lot of other parts (e.g. the launcher) are junk and get replaced instantly, also root makes the thing work as I want. and well many non samsung devices use the on-screen navigation bar, one thing I despise after having a horrible experience on my tablet. and (at least outside of samsung) the fiun goes on with removing the headphone jack which is something on my absolute instant KO list for phones. I dont see the point of a digital sound connection on a phone because sound itself is analog by definition and I think the DAC in a multi-hundred euro device is better than in some cheap headphones. and not to forget the features. samsung had many features WAY earlier than AOSP did, which certainly doesnt make it so much better at least from this viewpoint, although aosp is certainly getting better with every version. but even though I like my note 4 I must say that it is by no means perfect. everything is better and worse than others if you put the right requirements in. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. Richard Markert A 7" device is too small. My tablets start at 10" minimum , and go to 12" maximum. Content consumption is unpleasant on anything smaller, and I barely watch anything on a display smaller than one of my 24" computer displays. Yes, you're right almost all of them are software features, but they are locked out when you put a junkrom on there. And Samsung Pay? Well, call me when Android Pay is compatible with magstripe readers. My bank still doesn't support Android Pay that I know of, either. GearVR. How shall I put this? Computer VR is currently overpriced - unless you want to go ahead and buy me a $600 headset, a pair of controllers @ $130 each, AND you still need to buy me a $1400 PC to run VR titles at an acceptable framerate, because while my laptop can still run AAA titles at high framerates and 1080p, it can't do VR that good. My GearVR cost me $50, it's a convenience thing, every VR title is locked 60fps, the graphics are "good enough" and I can even take calls from VR with my Bluetooth headphones. I don't care about Google Voice. Or any sort of data-based calling. US data networks are still too unstable and limited. I am pretty much guaranteed to be able to make a call anywhere I can see at least the tiniest bit of 1x signal, but if the data network is gone, or you used all your gigabytes, you can't make calls anymore on your preferred number. A lot of these things you say you simply "don't need" them, and that's how I feel about root. And about pretty much everything you care about. I don't do ebooks, I don't do movies or tv, I barely play basic games. I do listen to a LOT of music though, and yes a lot of it was stolen from when I was younger and stupider and didn't understand that without compensation there will be no content. Oh, and BTW, Knox is a good thing. It's how I have system-wide ad blocking without rooting, and how I can have my Secure Folder. You seriously think Vertu phones are luxury? Classy even! Vertu are tacky, garish and gaudy. "Look at how much money I have." Nothing classy about that ugly diamond-crusted turd. Look, I really don't care what your choices are. I'm glad you have the choice to find a device that makes you happy. But you seriously need to stop acting like your choice is the only choice. It's not. And I hope to god it never will be, because at that point, Android will no longer be a platform that fits my needs and I might as well go to Apple. Because you see, what fits my needs, is a device that provides me with everything I have, out of the box, without having to modify it. Samsung does that. They give me everything I want, and nothing I don't. And when the Note 8 comes out, the S-Pen is going to blast it so far ahead that there simply won't be any other phone in the running, not even the S9. I would still have my Note 7 if they would let me. Railwayman Good that you have your Samsung. Also great that you have your 10-12 inch tablets. I assume you bring them everywhere? Very is easy more elegant than a Samsung. It doesn't mean they are the best but way better looking than a Galaxy 8, which I have been tried and I just don't see any reason to get it because of the way Samsung design things. You like to be locked down to a carrier. Google Voice work perfectly well here without any network problems. If the network coverage is so bad that modern services doesn't work I rather jump to a satellite provider if I really need the ability to call from the middle of nowhere. I wouldn't get VZW and eliminate my device choice site to them being very restrictive about what I am allowed to use. Having a carrier dependent phone number is very... 1996. I just don't accept such a limitation - especially not the thing called roaming. I just switch my SIM card to a local one and continue to receive calls as usual. The beauty of GV. If you think iOS is the way to go if Grace UX would disappear I think you should get the iPhone then. It seems like out of the box is the most important aspect. I just don't know any device that has an out of the box experience even close to my requirements. Samsung is certainly furthest way from them. I just dislike their devices because of their design, software, carrier affiliation and serious restrictions. They just feel like a budget device full of carrier advertisement and bloatware. Richard Markert I disagree with you in every possible way. Yes, I do take at least my Surface 3 almost everywhere. My Z10 LTE goes when I'll want to play games or watch Netflix on a tiny screen with crappy headphones. Vertu: You say elegant, I say gaudy, tacky, trashy and fucking ugly, like most things marketed to people with more money than God and less sense than a cricket. I don't know where you live, work, play or travel, but many times a year I'm driving in places, especially the highways, that will have no data coverage. It's that simple. All your google voice hijinks mean nothing when you have -100 dBm of 1x and the mobile data network is completely unavailable. I can still make and receive calls at that point, because Verizon, but you're shit out of luck because you only give people your GV (interface is barf, btw) number. Oh, and for the record, I just flashed the US Unlocked FW to my S8, so now I have no Verizon junkware or restrictions, like my S7e before it. And yes, at this point in my life, I'm sick and tired of having to do the software developers' job for them. When I was younger I found all that rom cooking, kernel coding, smali editing, adb pushing, su manipulating stuff fun and exciting, but now all I want is a phone with the features that I want that Just Works OOB. I also feel the way you do about stock android. It's design, included software, limitations and style are not appealing. And every phone is "a carrier advertisement", and has always been that way. Until the S8, every phone came with a carrier logo if you bought from a carrier. I get what you want from a phone, I really do. You want a basic device with no features that you can add onto to do what you want. But man, you gotta stop acting like you're the Westboro Baptist Church and Samsung is the homosexual community. Railwayman Samsung is not the homosexual community, right. They are the mainstream community where everyone eat at McDonald's.:) The homosexual community is more about being different rather than following the mainstream, i.e. the opposite of Samsung (it is hard to be more Average Joe adjusted than they are...). The day I really want coverage in "every possible place" is the day I get myself a satellite phone, especially if I am to drive in remote land where I can't rely on decent carrier coverage. Your attempts to put down Google Voice is amusing. Verizon are going to shut down their CDMA network and HTC U11 is already out, with support for their LTE but not the old fashioned thing also known as 1X.:) It is also amusing that you argue that hard against vanilla Android. Did you ever consider iOS or Windows Phone? If I would dislike vanilla that much, down to a dislike for Material Design I would switch platform immediately. If I don't like the system the way its creator intended it then perhaps it isn't for me and I switch. Relying on some third party OEM to "modify it to my liking" is a bit naive. A Samsung has something that is an "Android based OS" very much like Nokia X/XL had the Android based "Nokia Software Platform". I also notice your misconception about how other devices work. My device runs perfectly well. It just... works. It has a lot of features not present on a Samsung (yes, I have used the S 8/Plus), consume 0.1% per hour in standby, provide me 12-13 hours SOT and simply do more things than any "out-of-the-box Samsung" does and do them well. Samsung make pretty simple devices, with ill designed software full of bloatware and "added value" applications and services reducing performance and increase power consumption. I would say bling. Then we have other devices offering more useful features, higher performance, lower power consumption, more elegant design and so on. What they don't offer is the marketing known as Samsung. It's a good thing, actually - it leads to better value for money. BTW, Google Voice is simply a vastly superior service compared to VZW. You can start travel (out of the US) or trying to get your texts synced into your Google account with your carrier based service... Bragging about 1X is like bragging about EDGE coverage in... 2017. "My carrier is better than yours because I have 1X service on the soon-to-be-gone CDMA network on my Samsung and it makes it so much better than using modern IP based services! I am truly modern with my Samsung! My phone number is also controlled by my carrier and I must pay roaming when I travel, which is great - more money to Verizon! Much, much better than using GV on a data plan!" The day I need "coverage out in the nowhere land" I either get the satellite phone or some burner for that very purpose (it's a case of simply routing the GV calls to that thing). I know since before that modern communication services are a bit alien to proud owners of carrier branded Samsung devices. It is hard to think outside the box - much easier to just use Samsung with branding and everything.:) Good luck with your Samsung. Consider an iPhone next time. Apple has a new one coming and it can give you some taste of what being unlocked means (buy it from Apple Store). I think it can be enlightening, especially if you try the Genius Bar as well (i.e. better service than Samsung could ever offer through the carriers). Richard Markert I get it, you're a Google and Stock Android zealot. I read maybe 3 words of your damn novel. I do want you to answer this question without a dissertation And 500 page thesis: what are you going to do when you're in the middle of nowhere in a dead sport for data and your car breaks down? Railwayman The day I know that I will be in need for 1X coverage on Verizon I get a burner phone with such support before traveling. You make it sound like it is something really and truly unique with such coverage and that your Samsung is a marvel because it offer it. Verizon just introduced a flip phone with full support for their LTE network. So it doesn't take a Samsung to get there. The only requirement I have is tethering (if the purpose is to use the device of choice) - basic talk/text will do otherwise. So no, I just don't need a Samsung even in the "1X middle of the nowhere with a broken car" scenario. If it is very important with calling in dead spots - go and check Iridium, GlobalStar or Thuraya. I would go down that route in an instant if I really need coverage in "no mans land". So no, there are no single scenario where a Samsung is "needed" for whatever reason. Everything that brand can do can be done with other brands. Simple as that. Richard Markert Why do you always write a novel? We get it, you hate Samsung like Trump hates Mexicans. Shut up already. Railwayman I don't hate that brand is overrated and hyped. Mexicans are approximately 1286 times more sophisticated and polished than any Samsung. They don't even have Knox, which is a major benefit. Now go and enjoy 1X on your Galaxy. Don't forget the grave beer when VZW down, though. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? Mariano Moreira I am using Factory Images because I can choose to only use Bootslot B this way. Bootslot A on this current Pixel and the 3 before it has the non-working mic and no working headphone jack issue. I hear the issue is resolved on newer handsets, but have not RMA'd this device yet. I need the microphone and headphone jack, so letting the phone do an OTA and move me to Bootslot A is no-go. *I have N2G47O installed on both Bootslot A and Bootslot B, currently. Only Bootslot A has the audio issue even thought the exact same Factory Image is installed. saf1927 Oh, wasn't aware of that. Did it affect all the old devices? I got mine at launch but haven't experienced the issues you describe. Is there a way to reproduce them? I normally either take the OTA or flash the OTA images via fastboot. Mariano Moreira Allegedly only 1% of devices (I just have bad luck, I suppose.) https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsIW_gxTpXX3s/?hl=by I have posts around late November- early December on in that thread about mic/headphone jack issue My 1st device was fine until after the 2nd Update, but I had not diagnosed Bootslot A/B discrepancy. Wasn't until after 2nd Device (1st Replacement) that I have been able to always get Bootslot A to have faulty mic on my replacement devices. My Cousin and his girlfriend both have Pixel XLs. He had a dead Mic out of the box but currently neither his nor his Girlfriend's Pixel XL has mic issue. Even with forcing Bootslot A for a month of testing. I most likely have another faulty device, just this is my 4th Pixel from Google and everything is fine except Bootslot A. jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... My1 yeah, I do root for theming and stuff, but srsly they literally are throwing oil in the Piracy and DRM discussions with this. Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix. Lawstorant Magisk stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy Linus Monie If you are this afraid of someone potentially fiddling around with your code, the problem is not the 'fiddler', it is your code. Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... My1 I think their problem is rather that rooted users *might* be able to capture the decrypted stream using root or whatever and they are afraid of that. although on PC you have admin permissions and netflix has no problems iirc. Linus Monie Yeah, exactly, its not like people will prefer to pirate the stream on their phone (at least I wouldn't...), so that was my first thought of why they made this change. Now that I think about it though, its probably not so much of a Netflix decision as it is a licensing issue with one of their "film sources". (can't think of a better word for it rn..) Licensing issues are a bitch when you need to adapt to as many as Netflix has... My1 yeah true. pirating on phone makes (quoting austin from game theory) NO. GOD. DAMN. SENSE. I mean I dunno whether you can automate that so good and/or get it fast enough, especially with the relatively low storage, no LAN capability and so on. BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. My1 I have never tried but if netflix can run over a non-HDCP connection like DVI or VGA, there's literally no reason to use a phone for piracy. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. My1 or use DVI if possible, even better. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have? Mike Hunt One of these https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170514131212&SearchText=media+box+mini+m8s Brock Reed I'm not even getting the "not compatible" message, it's just not showing up at all. Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem? What makes smartphones so special? Doro Manekia ΝετΦλξ Ανάθεμα σου.Χα χα χα Το Μαααακα. Bewear I am not that upset because I rarely use Netflix on my mobile, I am upset because this kind of blocking will become a trend. BoFiS ugh, fuck you, Netflix, I pay for your serve, LET ME USE IT ON MY PHONE A.M There are some many ways around that LAME NETFLIX - Showbox Kodi Firestick with Kodi I can't see the point of Netflix when we have so MANY better apps out there that kill Netflix ErectBipedal That'll teach them filthy pirates for trying to pay us money!.... wait.... -Netflix probably Zxyon Rhysivz What could users with unlocked/rooted phones do with the Netflix app that other users can't? Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future. Znuff The download feature is not working for me anymore.

Doug Rogers I guess I'll have to unroot - whoops, Android 4.2 Awesome. Luxferro Don't forget to leave your 1 star review.

The only way I can watch overseas now is using Mediahint.com - nothing else works. Luxferro Just use usenet. They are forcing their legit customers to piracy... DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin. Znuff http://i.imgur.com/LG3dXc4.jpg http://i.imgur.com/eNeuPCD.jpg Can not use the latest version on my device, it sends me to download the 4.x version. When I try that, the latest 4.x version has Downloads disabled for me (it used to work on this device). US Patriot No worries. I can live without Netflix, but I will NOT live without full control of my devices and data. Ricardo A.

Nick Coad I can guarantee you that Netflix doesn't make these choices willingly. The production companies they purchase shows off are notoriously backward when it comes to technology and unfortunately Netflix relies on them to survive. Kevin Davis So I can't update my Netflix app on my unaltered Google Store Pixel XL. FUCK YOU NETFLIX, and goodbye, you SONS OF BITCHES.

Sledge If you have the app installed you can use the in app option to call netflix over wifi. Do this. Be heard. Don't let them continue to push back against the right to tinker. McHenryGames Main reason to root is XPosed. Screw Netflix and screw Google. Brian Both my phone and tablet are as they left they left the factory. Both are blocked form the new update, neither is rooted. Looked like they are trying to promote rival services as it is unacceptable to block legitimate users on a paying service. ED-Zが現れた! Well... Time to change my rate from 5 to 1... Thomas That's a surprising backward move from Netflix, a company that I admire and follow, not just as customer but as an engineer.

The attorney general, George Brandis, says existing laws do not go far enough in imposing obligations of cooperation on internet giants such as Facebook and Google, and on device makers such as Apple, to assist authorities who want to break the communications of terrorists using their systems. “In the first instance, the best way to approach this is to solicit the cooperation of companies like Apple and Facebook and Google and so on,” Brandis told Sky News on Sunday. 'Handing victory to terrorists': lawyers warn over denial of bail and parole Read more “And I think there’s been a change of the culture in the last year or more. There is a much greater conscious proactive willingness on the part of the companies to be cooperative. “But we need the legal sanction as well.” Last week Malcolm Turnbull announced a special meeting of state and territory leaders to “comprehensively review” Australia’s laws and practices that are directed at protecting citizens from violent extremism. He made the announcement just days after an attack in Melbourne’s suburb of Brighton in which a woman was taken hostage, and three police officers shot, before gunman Yacqub Khayre was killed. Khayre had previously been in prison for a violent offence but was out on parole. When he committed the attack, he said he was acting for Islamic State and al-Qaida. Turnbull said the law would now be strengthened to create a presumption against bail and parole for people who have demonstrated support for or have links to terrorist activity. He said the reform was “a vital element in keeping these people who are a threat to our safety and our safety of our families, off the streets”. On Sunday, Brandis said he was “astonished” that Khayre was paroled. “This man’s terrorism antecedents were a publicly known fact,” he said. “Although he had been acquitted for his involvement in a conspiracy to mount a terrorist attack on the Holsworthy army barracks in 2009, at his trial he had openly admitted to training with al-Shabaab in Africa for six weeks with the intention of returning to Australia to perpetrate terrorist violence. “That was a publicly known fact. So why that was not something that the parole board in Victoria was aware of, I don’t know.” Brandis said deradicalisation programs were successful “up to a point”, and online radicalisation was a “very difficult” problem. He said online radicalisation involved constant monitoring of the internet. Presumption will be against bail and parole for those with terrorist links, Coag agrees Read more “That particularly requires proactivity by [social media companies] to take down radical messaging,” he said. He said there will be a Five Eyes meeting in Ottawa, Canada, in a fortnight’s time, and Australia will discuss the need for internet and tech companies to better assist authorities break the online communications of terrorists. When asked if, under the changes he is proposing, intelligence agencies would be able to access the encrypted online communications they desire without needing a warrant, he said: “Well that’s a discussion that we need to have.” The Labor frontbencher Ed Husic said people had to think differently about a whole range of things that keep people safer. “It’s striking balance,” he told Sky News. “I think the public is willing, more open to the notion that if we have to sacrifice some of our liberties to protect ourselves, we are willing to do it.” But Greens MP Adam Bandt said he was unhappy that government was seeking to take away liberties, and give itself more power, with every threat of terror. “The idea that somehow, by treating everyone as a suspect and saying that no longer are you able to have secure communications with someone else, no longer can you talk confidentially, that everything is potentially going to be open to the government is, again, very, very worrying,” he told the ABC.

Only a handful of contributors see their photos hit the millions of views. Marketing & Regional Manager of Kary Movers has passed 4.250,000     Edmonton, Alberta City Centre Photo by James Cousineau of Kary Movers Ltd   Spread the Word Listed Under Tags: • Moving Companies Edmonton • Edmonton Business • Economic Growth Edmonton Industry: • Business Location: • Edmonton - Alberta - Canada Subject: • AwardsEDMONTON, Alberta - June 10, 2017 - PRLog -- More than a Marketing and Regional Manager for Western Canada based Kary Movers Ltd, James Cousineau also share his photos on Google Maps. He loves taking photos or wildlife through to everyday businesses and many things in between. It seems that the users of Google Maps also like his hobby. His photos have assisted over 4.25 million users view locations which they were seeking throughout Alberta and British Columbia so far this year. He has even received a congratualatory email from Google on the impressive numbers that few achieve on Google Maps. The reason why so many individuals do not achieve these numbers is that they simply don't care about contributing as much. You do not receive any money for contributing photos and no fame in silently contributing photos. There are some people who do this for a living on behalf of businesses but they have to find businesses willing to pay for the services. James has contributed over 6,500 photos to google maps of businesses and attractions / locations in BC and Alberta. Each photo personally taken by James and submitted. He states, "it [photography] is just something I enjoy doing and have since I was 12. Back then I actually learned to process my own film and prints. Almost every photo is done and added without the business knowing who took the photo or that it is added to Google Maps, helping to bring them more customers and assisting the customers in finding them. Photos are usually the exterior of the business which helps Google users identify the business as they approach. His reviews are also used to assist people looking for a certain kind of business (ie restauraunt, hotel, retail etc) to get an honest review that was not staged or paid for. As a small business person working throughout Western Canada, it affords me the opportunity to share locations with others. I love our country and like to share it with the world, from businesses to sights and even wildlife. I also believe in the raw images. No photo shop or altering of my photos in any way." Although James does not take bookings for photos, if you are looking to move to a new residence or business location, he is happy to hear from you at the offices of Kary Movers in Edmonton. He is also always happy to answer questions from other business owners and management on how best to showcase their business on Google Maps for free. "When our business community works together and grows the local economy, everyone in our community benefits", James adds.

(Gary Reyes/ Bay Area News Group) By Seung Lee | slee@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: June 10, 2017 at 6:30 am | UPDATED: June 11, 2017 at 6:33 am Once again, Apple has shown up fashionably late to the party. This time it’s the party for smart home speakers. But can Apple use the same recipe it has used before to reshape and conquer a market when its key competitors are giants like Google and Amazon? “Apple is behind but the company rarely is first yet still won in music players, smartphones, and tablets,” wrote UBS analyst Steve Milunovich in a note to investors after the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference. “Apple appears to be playing defense but needed to enter this category with a twist.” Related Articles Can’t get into WWDC? AltConf provides free alternative for developers Apple’s new WWDC reveals pivot toward artificial intelligence Apple spaceship campus moves closer to completion as residents brace for more traffic With iPhone sales sagging and fans clamoring for the company’s legendary innovation, the company last week introduced HomePod, its first new product in two years. HomePod is a high-end smart home speaker that capitalizes on Apple’s success with digital music by offering acoustics that are superior to its competitors, the Amazon Echo and Google Home. It takes voice commands from Siri and can also control HomeKit-enabled accessories like smart lights, locks and thermostats. But at $349, nearly twice the price of the Echo and three times more expensive than Google’s device, HomePod will come out of the gate in December facing a price disadvantage in a fast-growing market.  Amazon Echo and Google Home already make up nearly 94 percent of the market, which has more than 35 million U.S. users, according to a May 2017 report from eMarketer. “My instinct is that HomePod is not going to reach anywhere near iPod penetration levels,” said Ken Cassar, principal analyst at Slice Intelligence. “There are too many people ambivalent about needing great sound quality and too many inexpensive options.” But the world’s most valuable publicly traded company has used the come-from-behind playbook before. The iPod and the iPhone both entered their respective markets years behind competitors. But their ease of use, elegant design and superior technology helped corner their markets. In 2006, five years after the iPod was introduced into a crowded digital media player arena, it accounted for about 75 percent of the U.S. market. With the iPhone, Apple crushed already established competitors like BlackBerry to assert itself as the most popular smartphone in the world within its first three years. Apple is still riding the coattails of the iPhone’s success a decade after its initial reveal — it is the company’s single-largest revenue generator.  But iPhone sales are sagging, adding to the pressure for a hot, new product. The Apple Watch, introduced two years ago, made up 50 percent of all wearables sales in 2016, according to the research firm Canalys. But the overall market has failed to gain traction. Analysts believe Siri, powered by artificial intelligence, is one major hurdle HomePod will have to overcome to be a success. Despite beating Amazon and Google in introducing a voice assistant in 2011, Apple has lagged behind the two competitors in improving the accuracy and breadth of questions Siri can answer. “For now, Amazon is ahead of the curve and more advanced with Alexa,” said Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester Research. To avoid pitting Siri and HomePod against the smarter Alexa and Echo,  Apple introduced the HomePod as a music-first, smart speaker-second device, analysts say. Instead of immediately taking on Amazon or Google, Apple pivoted the HomePod so it’s more comparable to high-end speakers from Sonos. “That’s a shrewd move on Apple’s part,” said CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber. “There’s a high chance they will fall short on smartness compared to Google Assistant and Alexa. But compared to Sonos, they are very likely to win the fight.” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with MIT Technology Review last week that he believes his company’s AI efforts are toe-to-toe with Amazon and Google. He said the perceived lag exists because Apple does not talk about its products until they are ready to ship. “We are not going to go through things we’re going to do in 2019, ’20, ’21,” said Cook in the interview. “It’s not because we don’t know that. It’s because we don’t want to talk about that.” The HomePod won’t be Apple’s first attempt at cornering the home as part of its ecosystem. The Apple TV and Mac Mini targeted the living room in the mid-2000s, but both fell woefully short of the high expectations the Cupertino tech giant always faces. Blaber believes Apple needs a foot in the connected home market — even if HomePod is not the next iPhone. “This is an important investment from Apple,” said Blaber. “They didn’t succeed with Apple TV. Now they need another pillar inside the home.”   Tags:  Amazon Apple Google iPhone Tim Cook Seung Lee Seung covers Apple and personal technology for the Bay Area News Group.

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > T-Mobile offers to pay for Verizon switchers’ phones, two-lines-for-one deal also coming T-Mobile offers to pay for Verizon switchers’ phones, two-lines-for-one deal also coming May 24, 2017 Alex Wagner 109 Comments Yesterday T-Mobile CEO John Legere teased that T-Mo had multiple announcements coming up, and today a couple of them have been made. Starting May 31st, T-Mobile will kick off its #GetOutoftheRed promotion to help Verizon customers switch to T-Mo. Verizon customers in good standing with their carrier can get their iPhone or Google Pixel paid off by T-Mobile when they switch to T-Mobile and sign up for T-Mobile One, and they can keep their existing device. The phones that qualify for this promotion include the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Google Pixel XL. T-Mobile says that these devices were selected because “phones need certain software to be globally compatible, and some phones don’t yet have that software.” Magenta does say that it’s working with unspecified device makers to make more phones compatible with this promotion. Additionally, Verizon customers switching to T-Mobile must add T-Mo’s Premium Device Protection Plus insurance plan to their device to qualify. This insurance plan costs $15 per month and includes protection against loss, theft, and accidental damage, McAfee ID Protection, McAfee Content Protection, and other features. T-Mobile says that it’ll pay Verizon customers that take advantage of this promotion with a digital prepaid MasterCard card that typically arrives within 15 days. While this #GetOutoftheRed promotion is focused on Verizon customers (because VZW phones are unlocked), T-Mobile is doing something for AT&T and Sprint subscribers, too. Starting on May 31st, AT&T and Sprint customers can switch to T-Mobile and get their existing device paid off when they buy a new phone from T-Mobile on EIP. And unlike Carrier Freedom, those customers won’t be forced to trade in their existing device. Finally, T-Mobile says that starting tomorrow, May 25th, T-Mobile One customers with at least two voice lines can get two additional lines of service for the price of one. The cost of the second line will be offset by a bill credit. Our friends over at Wirefly have a great tool to compare T-Mobile plans against each other and against other plans on the market.

(J²) Right… I’d found that the system doesn’t consistently apply these. TylerCameron Yeah their billng process it’s horrible Steve_NYC So true. I actually considered moving to the T-Mobile One Plan even though it would have cost me more money, just to get away from the insanity of their bill credit process. I finally got things straightened out, but I am sure it will be a problem in the future. It’s gotten to the point that I think it’s deliberate. Mike I had a free line from November that I had to call in every month. to get credit. They finally fixed it to be automatic this month. best part I got extra bill credits for months since last November and my bill is now negative so I didn’t have to make a payment this month. Al William So in order to get the free line, you need to have at least a total of 4 voice lines? Corey Jalette You need to have 2 voice lines to get this promo, which you get 2 lines for the price of 1. So in total you end up woth 4 lines, 1st 2 have to be voice, the 2 you’re adding could be whatever you want. So if you’re on the 2/100 plan right now if you add 2 tablets it would be 120 a month (20 per tablet but 1 is free) or if you add 2 voice lines it would be 140 (40 for adding a 3rd line then 4th is free) Al William Thanks for the clarification! So minimum 2 voice lines and the other 2 could be voice or data. I just wish they get rid of these bill credits. Sometimes it’s such a nightmare. Corey Jalette It can be yes but that’s how pretty much everything is done. Just like they had a free line deal in march it’s listed on my account as a free line on us but I still get the charge on my bill, but it’s auto credited. The only time it wasn’t was the first month because I added it before the end of the billing cycle. Cost $49 but they also credited my account manually that one time. Haven’t had an issue since. AWasserberg7 This article mentions Magenta. What *is* Magenta? Is that some cute term of affection for T-Mobile? kev2684 Are you serious? It’s their brand color. VZW = Red AT&T = Blue T-Mobile = Magenta Sprint = Yellow Nobody Special Cricket (umm, green) lol Genecio MetroPCS= Purple Black&Orange= Boost The Waz Just confirmed by T-Force that if you have a 2 for 100 plus a “this ones on us promo” giving you total 3 lines, you will lose your free line if you take advantage of the promotion of 2 for 1 tomorrow. They stated that they have to move you to a different Tmobile One plan….makes no sense since there is only 1 plan…… Corey Jalette This is ONLY if you’re adding a voice line people. If you’re adding tablet/smartwatch/mobile Internet plans that doesn’t affect your phone plan promo of 2/100. Corey Jalette Add 2 tablets with unlimited data on your plan for $20/month. They frequently have a free tablet promo with qualifying data plan. Snatch those up and you’re golden. The Waz Yes this will affect both. IF you have the 2 for 100 and the “this one is on us” free line….you will lose both promotions…confirmed with t force and John directly. Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. Yea this is very strange Corey Jalette Not the case, I was able to add 1 more tablet line to my plan for half off yesterday. 2/100 all in promo with 1 free tablet line from March. Now 1 more tablet at half off. 4/$110 not including any kickbacks which both phone lines usually stay under 2gb so 4/$90 now. Had to pay the sim/activation charge of $25 +tax, and my first month will cost about $40 for adding midway through billing cycle. Then $10 or less(if kickback is on). Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. So yea im wondering is anyone can find a loophole or something Andrew Singleton the reason is that you’re on a 2-line promotional plan paying $20 less than everyone else, and you’ve added a line. since you’re unable to add another line on that plan, you are forced to switch to a 3+ line plan, and that will cause activation-related discounts to drop. Corey below is correct, because internet lines (tablet, watch, syncup drive) are their own rate plan and don’t affect your voice configuration. Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. J Gerard Yeah! Let’s switch to T-MOBILE because we want to not be able to make phone calls half the time, and not have a signal to look something up when we actually need it. Oh yeah, and to not be able to upload pictures of something fun that we’re doing until we’re at home connected to WiFi later that night or the next day. Before any of you “magenta” fans TRIES to defend them… I’ve been a Verizon customer for about 12 years except for 6 months last year, when I switched because of crappy TMobile’s cheap prices and convincing (misleading) advertising. It was HORRIBLE. I used to get pissed and call them to ask why I could never get a signal. After 6 months, I finally admitted to myself that it was a ridiculous mistake and switched back to The Red! NEVER any issues with Verizon’s service. Never. “Magenta” is only good at talking a big game. If anyone’s thinking about switching to T-Mobile, DON’T DO IT. They are the worst. Go to any other carrier. Doesn’t have to be Verizon. kev2684 It’s all about location, location, location. Just because your area is bad, doesn’t mean everybody will have the same problem as you. J Gerard … EXCEPT that I live in a city. Oh, and Verizon’s coverage is flawless here. I happen to also know (through friends) that AT&T and Sprint are good here, too. Oh, but it’s all about location, location, location. Weak argument. T-Mobile just sucks! There’s a reason it’s so CHEAP! Austin8480 … OK JGerard. Next time, PLEASE use all capital letters to truly get YOUR point across. What I find PATHETIC is that you are a die hard Verizon turd in a TMobile blog. Oh wait, I meant Verizon TURD. Forgot to emphasize that. NOBODY in this room gives a flying —- about your opinion because you slummed it for 6 months and went to Magenta and it was as big of a mistake as…well, I will let you figure it out. J Gerard You were so busy typing a 3rd grade level post that you forgot to make a point. Here’s one for you: T-Mobile is inferior to almost all other carriers. Austin8480 If T-Mobile is so inferior, why are you even giving this blog the time of day. Are you upset that no kids want to hop in your van and eat your chocolate, so you are going to take out your frustrations on the inferior wireless network? thepanttherlady *Tip* Starbursts don’t melt :D theseanteam The hate is strong in this one. Those six months must have really scarred you or something. When you say almost all other carriers, which ones are you referring to? There are only four major carriers after all. And actually, that argument about location is a pretty strong one. T-Mobile’s network is the fastest in many locations, but can be really poor (or even non-existent) in others. The same can be said about everyone–including Verizon. Every carrier has their strong and weak areas. For someone to deny such would have to either be 1) ignorant 2) biased beyond belief or 3) troll. yankeesusa Yea, it still amazes me that people complain about coverage and then lump everyone else in america as having the same coverage, like we all live in the same area. Oh well. People never learn. I’m just happy tmobile works for me and that my data speeds are the highest iv’e ever had. At my house i’m getting close to 100megs almost every time. But hey i guess that’s not good enough for some. thepanttherlady I moved to Crestline a couple of weeks ago. No service. :'( kev2684 I had to google where that is lol :D Yeah it’s rural Ohio but I suppose Band 12 is coming? I’ve seen sightings on Band 12 in Jacksonville, FL lately as well as other parts of the country it’s currently not available. They’re probably working on it at the moment. thepanttherlady Sorry, I should have been more specific. It’s Crestline, CA. I made the same mistake when I called a county office but only Googled Crestline. Guy was really confused as they don’t have my address there. Took me a minute to figure out he was in Ohio. LOL kev2684 You’re literally live in a mountain! Views must be spectacular! thepanttherlady Some of them really are. :) Zacamandapio Verizon here we gooooooo. By the way, we went to Lake Gregory. :) thepanttherlady I’m literally 7 minutes from there. Went there 2 weekends ago to check it out. Water level is a little on the low side. Met a couple that same night that said they’d drained it for some reason and cited “water politics” because I guess the locals aren’t happy about it. Drove up from the Hesperia side this past Saturday and got to see Lake Silverwood. Will have to check it out this summer. Nice drive but hated seeing so many dead trees. :( ETA: I had to get Frontier (Verizon) internet so I could actually use my cell phone. What really sucks is: 1. I literally just got a hotspot through T-Mobile a month ago when they were offering another free line. It’s unusable. 2. I now HAVE to buy phones that have WiFi calling. Blah! thepanttherlady From the day we moved in 5/7: http://imgur.com/UQHsBZF http://imgur.com/t9Z64Q3 http://imgur.com/tm7ReiU And the lake :) http://imgur.com/1YUxwV9 http://imgur.com/tnGMcoq http://imgur.com/zhY16YK http://imgur.com/eaXr58H http://imgur.com/JO9BHJW Sharti24 Who will you be switching to? thepanttherlady I’m not switching. Yet anyway. I lose service 1/2 way up (or down) the mountain so I’ll probably have to get a very cheap pre-paid service/phone for emergencies in case I break down. Not all turnouts have a call box. I still work in Orange County and T-Mobile works fine most places I go. If it starts to be a problem then I’ll have to consider my options. Sharti24 Have tmobile send you a range extender. Not the one you plug into the internet but the one that has two boxes that boosts signal Berzerker Yeah, if you live in Bumblefuck, Montana, don’t switch. Greg Piller Shoot, I just signed up in Montana for TMO. Guess I’m “bumblefucked” lol. I have traveled to every state and been in EVERY U.S. major city multiple times living in every timezone and 11 states. My goodness you have a warped idea of “crap state”. Montana is paradise partner. You have to be from either NYC or California with that f’ed up mentality. He is right & not just in “crap” places but a lot of places like Chicago, IL where I was born and raised. Verizon & AT&T ARE better, Considerably better now in most places but TMO is gaining on them quickly & may reach parity in a few years. When THAT happens if TMO is still competitive, one would have to be a lunatic to stay with AT&T or Verizon. Berzerker …lol. I never said Montana was a “crap state.” It’s the easiest thing to think of when you think of wilderness where you won’t have service for miles. I could have picked a bunch of states, but Montana has, IIRC, the smallest habitation of humans to state ratio, behind Alaska of course. Easy target. Greg Piller To me 4 lines for $120 with TMO is enough of a savings to ditch AT&T. Verizon & AT&T and some of their customers can be arrogant & I think John Legere is one helluva CEO. I can pick up a burner sim with AT&T’s Cricket when I travel a bit and use it until TMO improves in Montana & then it’s sianara to ATT. Happy to be back with TMO. I was formerly a customer since the Voicestream days but when I moved west couldn’t keep them. Their coverage improvement in Montana & the nation as a whole with him at the helm has been nothing short of INCREDIBLE. I hope if the Sprint deal happens Legere is retained as CEO. mreveryphone Hummm… I travel the country for my job and I rarely have issues with T-Mobile… Is it perfect?? No… But no carrier is.. Verizon worked out for you, that’s great. T-Mobile works for millions, that’s also great. But this butt hurt rant is ridiculous and pure comedy! J Gerard “butt hurt rant” is kind of a dumb way to describe what I’m saying. But, I’ll consider the source, eh? Do you know ANYONE who thinks that T is better than V? Nope. So, the difference between us is that I choose to have a better service and I’m willing to pay a little more for it. You are cheap, and you’re willing to have an inferior service because it’s cheaper. That’s it. You know Verizon is better than T-Mobile Francisco Peña Anyone switching carriers should NEVER just switch without taking advantage of the initial return period. I was with VZW for yrs myself. Loved it, with my UDP that was grandfathered. Even went through one wave of price hikes to stay. Then the wife wanted a non-feature phone, and the price hike for her would have boosted out then $108 monthly payment, to $160 once we got a basic data plan, her line access fee (joke) and a new phone. So I looked into TMo. I purposely bought a phone the yr before that worked with Tmo and VZW (moto X DE) and signed up for one line of TMo, switched my Moto to Tmo and reactivated an older LTE phone I had back on VZW. Then I went around for a week doing speed tests everywhere I went. Stuck in traffic? speed test. Both side by side on the seat. Mall? yup, side by side in my hands. Work? yup. Home? yup. I hated VZW at work because my Moto could never get a signal inside the building, which caused my battery to die quickly each day. TMo? got a strong signal. Home, both were weak, but about the same. Driveway? same. So after 10 days, I went in to TMo and switched. Got 2 new phones (had a deal on G4s then) and was spending $140 for 2 lines/10GB each (was the $100/2L/10GB deal) with those phones. Has it been perfect? no. Has it been enough to switch back? no. After some finagling, got a $70 plan with 6GB each for 2 lines. Then have gotten a free line on top of that.. so now I pay $130 for 3 lines, with 6GB each (two don’t come close, mine has Stash so I’m good) and 2 new G6 phones. So for the price, its awesome. Can I deal with some poor service on the outskirts of town? sure. Oh, that Moto X? got it on the 3rd line… theseanteam I don’t think anyone has ever claimed that T-Mobile has better coverage than Verizon, but the point is it has the same quality of coverage in many places. Where I live, T-Mobile has equal coverage and faster speeds. It might not be like that for you, as everyone’s experience will vary. I’m sure if others suffered with bad service, they would switch carriers as well. But your superiority complex is just silly. mreveryphone I know plenty of people that think T-Mobile is better than VW… And I know people that think the opposite, it depends where you live. The service was inferior for you but not for me by any means… I appreciate the cheap name calling, I’ll be cheap all day if it means saving money but getting better service FOR ME… I’ve had service in buildings where others on VW had 0, I’ve smoked people on VW in data speeds tests so I’ll be cheap all day long!! Lol Vazaha There’s an unwritten agreement when you join T-Mobile that you will refrain from living in or going to crappy places. If you live in a decent place T-Mobile is fine. If T-Mobile sucks in your area, you know why :). Vazaha But seriously, I’m always envious of ATT and V when I go to crap places. tranceformer978 Why are you going to crap places? Melissa Cardenas Well what the hell are you doing on this website then? This is a T-Mobile forum obviously most people on here have T-Mobile and they Happy with it so they ain’t gonna listen to you . T-Mobile did not work in my old house so i had Verizon. Now in my new house Verizon don’t work at all and i had to get T-Mobile again because T-Mobile works here fine , So no carrier is perfect. It all depends on location!! J Gerard I get tech news alerts on my phone and things like this come up sometimes and I click on them. I believe that’s allowed! Apparently, what’s not allowed here is proper grammar and punctuation. I almost had to have your post translated in order to read it, but I figured it out eventually. Where did you go to school? Melissa Cardenas What ever im in a hurry and didn’t have time to spell check .But seriously don’t change the subject i don’t get why people like you come talk trash on a T-Mobile forum. ?? Makes no sense haha . And what ever im PRETTY sure you understood fine what i wrote in my first comment. Bull that you almost had to get it translated. Omar Boyer Melisa hes just being an idiot haha i understood perfectly well your first post. And i see they gave u some thumbs up on that first post so others also understood you no need to translate it . Ignore this lowlife with nothing to do. If he wants to stop making an Azz out of himself he should just block the notifications he gets from here. Melissa Cardenas i have better things to worry about ;) omar. And like you said he should just turn off notifications from here then. Eric Harlow Don’t give J Gerard the satisfaction in getting a reaction out of you and allow him to control the situation don’t dumb down to his level Eric Harlow Get off Melissa Cardenas butt about grammar here. This is a forum! Not a college message board or an college English Composition course. T-mobile has improved drastically within the last 3 years. T-mobile works for me out here in San Diego and in my future home in Missoula, Montana. I have mental disabilities that I got serving in The US Navy for twenty years and I dislike your comments towards Melissa Cardenas. This is a T-mobile fan website to discuss peacefully about T-mobile, so get your BIG RED DUMB AND DUMBER ASS OUT OF HERE. Andrew Addison You just made my night with that bomb diggity comment towards that boozo the snow clown filled with stuffy nose, trying to come off as English weirdo professor correcting people on their grammar fool there Bro. Is this guy here serious right now? He had no reason to talk down to someone like that and also talk down on the finest company/carrier, advising everyone to stay away from the best carrier/company which that one being T-Mobile-MetroPCS. We will forever be way Better in USA than any other carrier would have been. Eric Harlow OOH REALLY!!! HOW AWESOME!! Glad I made your night! RLB63 I actually feel sorry for you. How miserable your life must be for you to spend so much time on a site of a company you seem to hate so much. Cellphone companies aren’t making political statements. Seem way to smart for that. Don’t attack social issues. Attacking T-Mobile worth while to you and to spend so much time. You must not have anything better to do with your life. Eric Harlow I think you were supposed to reply back to J Gerard not me. I have been a T-mobile customer for over ten years and I am happy to be a T-mobile customer. Haze1nut English is a 3rd language for me, behind French and Portuguese. Correct my grammar for me, will you. It obviously makes you feel superior. Ascertion You think everyone that switches to T-Mobile can’t “Make calls half of the time”? You’re out of your mind! Tony Chen agreed, t mobile has gained millions of customers each quarter. if the drop calls were so bad why would t mobile gain 100% of new customers agaIN? another blockbuster quarter by t mobile. moonoverparma Funny, I’ve never had a problem. Nobody Special Several years ago i had a verizon phone (when the iphone’s came out they were the only one that were selling them with unlimited data at that time) and i had T-Mobile flip phone that i was using to make international calls. I have to admit, Verizon was more reliable than T-Mobile during my cell phone usage. I chose T-mobile over Verizon because of many reasons…. but it was never due to their coverage, because their coverage was horrible… but since then their coverage has improved. But i switched primarily due to the inexpensive international calls. That was a deal breaker for me, i was content with the terrible coverage with anticipation that they would improve their service. and with Verizon i was paying around $89 dollars for unlimited data and text and 450 minutes of voice calls. my tmobile line (from what i can remember) was around $78 dollars for unlimited talk and text and data. But fastforward to today, I have 5 Unlimited Everything (data/text/voice) lines with unlimited international calling (mobile+landlines) and international text for a low cost of $110 plus taxes and fees. Believe me i checked, Verizon or AT&T have nothing in comparison to what i have with T-Mobile. And i am not bashing you or Verizon at all, Verizon does have a more reliable coverage area but in the end i sided with T-Mobile over Verizon. If Verizon ever came up with incredible deals like T-Mobile has been doing almost every month i wouldnt turn down a great opportunity. RECAP: Verizon “Better Coverage” T-Mobile “Better Prices” It all boils down to what are you comfortable with. Im comfortable with crappy coverage. And My T-Mobile calls do drop often, but what i do is (i press redial) GOTCHA :) Gust OK so here’s the deal. In the morning when you wake up if you have T-Mobile you have to get up take a shower have breakfast shave go outside of your house in other to make a phone call. If you have AT&T or Verizon in the morning when you wake up you can reach for your cell phone and make a phone call. It is that simple. But you know what I have T-Mobile because over one year it saves me about $200 as compared to AT&T or Verizon. So I put up with the crap! Timothy Poplaski T-Mobile supports WiFi calling. You don’t have home WiFi? DM725 How do you not have wifi calling enabled? Maybe you need to buy a phone from the last 2 years… (My Motorola Nexus 6 Supported Wifi Calling….) RLB63 They have equipment they they will ship out for free with a deposit that will boost their signal on your house if you don’t have Wi-Fi calling. My phone automatically switches on Wi-Fi when I get home. Not for signal or to save data. It’s because with all the talk that cell signals MIGHT cause cancer why risk it? It is able to enable Wi-Fi, and it disables it when I leave the house. So that might be an option if you have Wi-Fi…. Phone Guy All lies. So funny, yet sad. yankeesusa LOL, not everyone lives where you live and have bad coverage with tmobile. 4 years ago i would have never used tmobile, now i no longer have sprint and got rid of my verizon line because tmobile is great for me where i live and work. I just recently drove across florida,georgia,nc and tennesse and had no issues. I was able to test it side by side with an att phone and the whole time both phones had coverage except up in the smokies near newfound gap where no one has signal. Don’t lump everyone in the same pile just because it doesn’t work for you. DM725 LoL, where the hell do you live? eanfoso The only one after verizon is at&t because we know that sprint and us cellular sucks more than t mobile Andrew Singleton T-Mobile has the lowest churn rate (people trying it and leaving) of all carriers. Could you please explain why? J Gerard Ha! Oh, I promise you I don’t feel like an idiot surrounded by people who work themselves up into a breathless rant trying to defend a crappy service. gmo8492 Crappy for who exactly, churn has gone down to record lows and T-Mobile has over 73 million subs, so if it doesn’t work out you can switch. Brad C It’s not for everyone, but has worked damn well for me for 12yrs.. I *actually* tried Verizon a few months ago, and came back after two weeks after awful LTE performance JG You’re cracking me up reading your comments! I have TMo and put up with their spotty coverage because I’m paying less per month staying with them. I can admit that. There is alot I enjoy about TMo, but dropped calls and dead zones IS a reality. I have a band 12 phone in metro PHX. Not sure why others feel the need to berail someone who doesn’t agree with them just for argument’s sake. Timothy Poplaski Because you aren’t saying, “Bad coverage in PHX”, you’re saying “Bad coverage”. I can drive for at least an hour in any direction and have solid coverage. It all depends on where you live, and you’re phone. Even phones with band 12 won’t all have the same results because some phones get better reception than others. So, I won’t even argue about coverage in PHX. Never been there, likely never will, so it just doesn’t matter to me. My excellent coverage probably doesn’t matter to you. It’s all about where you use your phone. navi harriram Dude you could of tested the network out on a $10 weekly plan or $3 daily. You don’t buy cell phone service every day so do the work. The sales rep just wants a commission check so they’ll say anything to get you to switch. That’s why I don’t work for wireless companies anymore. Too much bull to deal with yankeesusa Not everyone is defending a company that may or may not work depending on where you live. But many people actually do research and pick a company that specifically works for your needs depending on your area. I had verizon and sprint before tmobile and i have never ever gotten the speeds i get now not to mention i have great coverage ‘WHERE I LIVE”, YOU SEE, that’s the important thing, i researched and made sure it worked for me. I don’t just blindly select a company just because their commercial says so. Screamin That’s strange because T-Mobile has been #1 in customer service AND satisfaction for well over 2 years now… and yes, that includes coverage. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I am thinking about switching to Verizon due to poor coverage. In San Diego area I get one to bars. I moved from Minnesota and T-mobile coverage in MN is excellent there with all bars. In San Diego it’s very poor in some areas. When iPhone 8 is release I am switching to Verizon. I love T-mobile plans but coverage in my area is poor. Sharti24 Agreed. On base (32nd street) forget about tmobile coverage. sprint excels on 32nd. go over to corando island its even worse! just throw your phone over board. no tmobile coverage on the air base at all. im using an iphone 6s Band 12 which is deployed in SD yankeesusa I agree, if in your area tmobile is not good and is affecting productivity or just not letting you use your phone to its fullest your’e better off changing. I have great coverage where I live and work and when i travel over 99% of the time i have no issues. But i got my wife on cricket which is att so for the times where tmobile may not get signal i have the att towers just in case. I’m on an old grandfathered single line plan that allows work discount so i’m keeping as long as i can. Screamin Sometimes it’s not always the cell coverage causing the issue, but the phone itself, especially if it’s an older device that supports fewer cell bands. With T-Mobile’s latest acquirement of spectrum you can expect a huge improvement in cell signal, both in range and structure penetration, within the year. Of course you can switch if you want, but they’re only going to get better. They’ve more than doubled the coverage in the past 2 years and have just as much coverage as Verizon with a network that’s actually futureproof unlike the other guys. DM725 Agreed, I know people that don’t realize they are using a phone without band 12, that doesn’t have wifi calling or Volte support, and has an extremely weak antenna. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My phone is iPhone 7 and not an old device: Andrew Singleton if you hold an iphone 7 next to a galaxy s8, the s8 will have more bars every time. that’s due to a more powerful signal on galaxies and the fact that bars don’t mean anything with low-frequency spectrum. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My roommate is on T-mobile and his current phone is galaxy s8. We experience the same issue. RLB63 Have you talked to T-Mobile C.S.? If they get people complaining about certain areas they tend to look into those areas. Is it outside or inside or both where you have problems? Inside out could be the building. They can seems you a device to boost the signal for your phone. Patel Nisha You couldn’t pay me to use a iPhone . And why would I switch Verizon to T-unmobile. So I can have a sub par data connection with hardly any coverage…. Andrew Why are you on TmoNews, then? Andrew Addison Lol I was just thinking the exact same thing. Lol DM725 I’m sorry you live in a place that T-Mobile doesn’t prioritize. Here in NY, we have no such issues. Andrew Singleton the offer is also good for pixels, and you don’t know anything about the network. in 1 year, verizon will wish it had t-mobile’s network. browne81 I cavy take this anymore. There is always someone in these forums going miss information. I have to speak up. As awhole some networks are better than others. I’m not going to get into my opinion on which is better nation wide. What I will say is this. The best carrier is the one that works where you frequent the most. No matter what carrier a person loves there is another person out there that thinks it terrible. So all these people saying bad things about T-Mobile should get the facts straight. Lastly I due example I don’t like sprint but I know there are people that have a great time with them. You don’t see me on a sprint site saying how bad they are. Is my spelling perfect no. Is my grammar perfect no. It’s this a college paper? No. So I really don’t care. AJ2 still waiting for them to do a $50 deal for single customers. browne81 They have a prepaid plan for 45 Sharti24 4 for $100 sounds better Line 1 $50 Line 2 $75 Line 3 $90 Line 4 $100 Andrew Singleton T-Mobile is responsible for the entire industry’s growth for much of the last few years, and it wasn’t because they’re a bargain carrier. You won’t see T-Mobile competing on price for much longer. John De Leon I have Verizon and would switch IF T-Mo had better in-building coverage. Several of my fellow employee friends have T-Mo and they have horrible coverage in our work locations. They have to step outside to recieve/make calls. Chris Siegell I don’t see the Galaxy S8+ mentioned? You would think that this phone would be “globally compatible” for the switch? Ming Chang Chuang did they say how long to keep the T-Mo’s Premium Device Protection Plus insurance plan? Can i remove this coverage after 2 months?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Better Buy: Twitter, Inc. vs Google Both are giants in the growing digital advertising market. Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Jun 10, 2017 at 3:00PM Online advertising is expected to surpass television advertising this year if it hasn't already. The growth in digital ad spend over the last decade is nothing short of astounding, with growth accelerating as smartphones became ubiquitous starting at the beginning of the decade. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), with its mobile-first product, appears well positioned to capitalize on the trend of growing mobile internet use. But its user and active advertiser growth stalled over the last few years, and it's just starting to reaccelerate now. Meanwhile, Google, a stalwart of the old web 1.0, is managing to dominate the growth in digital advertising. Despite its massive size, the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary is still managing to grow steadily year after year. As an investor, which stock is a better buy? Shares of Twitter are depressed but could be poised for a comeback. Comparatively, Alphabet shares are trading near an all-time high. Image source: Twitter, Copyright Troy Holden (@troy) for Twitter, Inc. Twitter's future is uncertain Twitter is in the midst of a change of focus from real-time information sharing to live video. COO Anthony Noto says he wants Twitter to show live video 24/7 from news, to sports, to entertainment. Last quarter, Twitter delivered over 800 hours of live video, attracting 45 million unique viewers. It broadcast those statistics on the first page of its quarterly letter to shareholders. Twitter's push for more video content coincides with its decision to de-emphasize its non-video advertising products. As a result, Twitter has experienced a decline in ad revenue in each of the last two quarters. Overall, revenue declined 8% last quarter, and management's outlook for the second quarter indicates another decline. Premium live video is a much riskier business than Twitter had been focused on. User-generated content is free, whereas Twitter has to pay for its live video content. The payoff could come from an increase in digital video advertising, which typically carries a premium price over the static display and direct-response advertisements that make up much of Twitter's revenue. If Twitter's bet pays off, it could result in a return to revenue growth, breaking through the ceiling it hit last year even as user growth and engagement remain relatively low. Image source: Google. Now you can Google from anywhere Have you ever been in the middle of a conversation with friends and a question comes up that no one knows the answer to? Of course you have, and inevitably, someone whips out their phone and "Googles" the answer. That tick of human nature has been a huge boon to Google over the last decade. Google has so many more opportunities to show users advertisements now thanks to mobile. Last year, paid ad clicks on Google's owned properties increased 40% on top of a 33% gain in 2015. Most of that increase in clicks stems from more mobile users, and mobile advertisements generally don't produce the same level of return as their desktop counterparts. Nonetheless, the trend has enabled Google to steadily increase revenue year after year. Revenue increased about 20% last year, and it nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016. The price isn't always right Twitter isn't profitable yet, so it's best to compare Alphabet and Twitter's stock prices based on sales or cash flow. To that end, Twitter trades at a modest discount to Alphabet shares. Even on a forward-looking basis, Twitter shares trade for just 5.2 times analysts' revenue estimates for 2017, while Alphabet (Class A shares) trades for 6.2 times. That's noteworthy considering the expected decline in revenue at Twitter. But if you invest in Twitter, you're buying a struggling company and hoping for a turnaround. That's something Twitter's management hasn't yet shown the ability to do despite more than two years of trying. While its focus on live video is interesting, it faces a lot of competition in the space from companies with deep pockets -- one of which is Google. Google has proven capable of navigating the growth of mobile, even thriving as more and more competitors enter the market. It's hard to see its advantages in search and video eroding anytime soon, if ever, which ought to generate continued steady revenue growth for years to come. Another factor worth mentioning is the 1% of Alphabet that's tied up in "other bets," which have a small chance of turning into big businesses. In that way, investors can get some modest exposure to high-risk, high-reward businesses. Alphabet shares are worth paying a slight premium over Twitter shares for most investors.

Related Machine learning: A chance for engineering students to look beyond software services Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You The theatrical release of James Cameron’s sci-fi film Terminator 2, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cyborg with a computer brain, had a crucial scene deleted. The scene, part of the extended release of the movie, shows young John Connor and his mother opening up the head of the cyborg to switch its computer brain from “read only to “learning” mode. The cyborg (Schwarzenegger) then picks up human values and mannerisms as the movie progresses. For movie buffs, the deleted scene is worth seeing for special effects and also to catch a glimpse of Linda Hamilton (playing John’s mother Sarah Connor) with her twin sister Leslie playing her image in a mirror. In the theatrical release, where the scene is omitted, the cyborg just tells John that its brain is a “neural-net processor, a learning computer”, without mentioning any on/off options. That was back in 1991. Today, in 2017, a learning computer is much more of a reality. While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) concepts have been around since the 1940s and 1950s (See ABC of AI, ML and Deep Learning), the availability of huge amounts of data is making the difference now. A “learning computer” does not need to travel back in time — like in the movie — and many are solving real problems in India. For example, in healthcare, ML is helping oncologists sift through huge amounts of cancer cases and suggesting preferred treatment; in education it is predicting who might drop out of school; and in fashion it is forecasting colours that can dominate the next season. Retail, transportation and financial services have adopted ML in different forms. The “learning switch” is turned on in India. “Every large organisation was sitting on data. The cloud is bringing computing power to it and ML is creating actionable intelligence,” says Anil Bhansali, MD, Microsoft India (R&D) Pvt Ltd. Machine vs machine A war of machines scenario seems appropriate to discuss it. Consider this example. In October 2016, K Sandeep Nayak booked three flight tickets for his wife and children to fly to Mangaluru from Mumbai during the Christmas holidays two months later, hoping to get a low fare. He spent Rs 7,500 per ticket. Later, when he decided to join his family for the trip, just a day before the journey on December 25, he could book himself into the same flight at Rs 4,000 only. “I wish I could find out if airfare could fall,” says Nayak, an executive director with Centrum Broking. Actually, there is a way. Today, most airlines follow a sinusoidal graph (S curve) for pricing tickets, often dictated by an algorithm to maximise revenues — pushing up prices following buying behaviour.gregator app Ixigo. It can predict whether the price of an air ticket on a particular date is likely to fall. When a customer enters the date of journey, the app predicts, with more than 80 per cent accuracy, how much the airfare may drop for the sector on that date — and how the prices could vary over that period. (Ixigo also has a railway app that predicts if a rail ticket on a wait list may get confirmed.) “We have a huge data set created by 4 million active users, 50 million sessions per month,” Aloke Bajpai, Ixigo Ixigo’s global peer Kayak is one of the pioneers in fare prediction. If airfare prediction seems like a machine-vs-machine scenario, there are more such examples: programmatic advertising algorithms that compete for advertising spots, or algorithmic trading applications that compete to get the best trades in the securities market. Here is something a little more interesting. Arya.ai is a Mumbaibased startup, founded by Vinay Kumar and Deekshith Marla, both IIT-Bombay grads. In 2016, Arya.ai was selected by French innovation agency Paris&Co, from 21 global companies, for an international innovation award. Kumar still looks like a college student and moves around Mumbai on his motorbike. One of the current projects that Arya.ai is working on involves creating an ML application for selling securities without letting prices crash. The client, with a mandate to sell a large block of stock or bonds in the market, wants Arya.ai to create an algorithm for selling so that it does not lead to prices of the security dropping. “At the same time, there are ML algorithms as well as human intelligence trying to buy the security at the lowest price possible,” says Kumar. Algorithmic trading has been around for a while and brokers with proprietary trading arms often use it to gain a few seconds’ advantage. Now research is focused on whether an ML layer can be built on top of the algo. Can the machines be allowed to alter the trading algorithm on their own and what will this mean for the securities markets? Last month, JP Morgan released a report in New York, “Big Data and AI Strategies”, with the subhead, “Machine Learning and Alternative Data Approach to Investing” Written by Marko Kolanovic and Rajesh T Krishnamachari, the report suggests that analysts and market operators need to master ML techniques as usual indicators like company quarterly reports and GDP growth data will soon be predicted early by ML programs. It says that just as machines with ML are able to replace humans for short-term trading decisions, they can also do better than humans in the medium term. “Machines have the ability to quickly analyse news feeds and tweets, process earnings statements, scrape websites and trade on these instantaneously.” Back in India, here is another scenario. Vertoz is a Mumbai-based programmatic advertising company that works with clients (advertisers) and online media in placing digital advertising, targeting the advertisements and bidding for the best spots. “We need to find which inventory is good for us,” says founder Ashish Shah, referring to spots on popular media websites. “If we had to do it manually it would be like finding needles in a haystack.” Vertoz’s programs compete with the likes of Google, bidding for top slots in global digital media. Man Fridays While the buzz on big data analytics came first, the focus on ML has been facilitated by larger players like Google, Intel, Microsoft and Amazon making off-the-shelf modules available in India. But, then, some platforms have been around for decades. Says Shah: “Most of our work is based on Java and Python that are 1980s technologies. We have built our layers on top of that.” Ixigo’s chief technology officer Rajnish Kumar mentions Google’s TensorFlow and Amazon’s AWS Machine Learning as examples of off-the-shelf modules. Microsoft offers its Azure platform for others to create their own ML offerings. A Google spokesperson told ET Magazine that in future it expects to offer non-experts the ability to create and deploy ML modules: “At Google, we have applied deep learning models to many applications — from image recognition to speech recognition to machine translation. In our approach a controller neural net can propose a ‘child’ model architecture, which can then be trained and evaluated for quality on a particular task. This is machine to machine learning.” “Going forward, we will work on careful analysis and testing of these machine-generated architectures to refine our understanding. If we succeed, we think this can inspire new types of neural nets and make it possible for non-experts to create neural nets tailored to their particular needs, allowing machine learning to have a greater impact on everyone,” adds the Google spokesperson. Google offers some simple applications of ML. CESC Ltd, Kolkata-based flagship of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group, is using a Google API (application programming interface) which records the reading of the electrical metre when the numbers are read out loud. “Instead of keying the reading in or taking a photo of it, the staff can speak into their phone app chaar-shunyo-teen-paanch (4, 0, 3, 5),” says Debashis Roy, vice-president (information technology ), CESC Ltd. Roy says that when the project started, the app showed only 40% accuracy, but it is learning to recognise more and more Bengali dialects as well as Hindi and English. No matter what the dialect of the staff, the reading can be recorded. “We will launch it fully when we get to 95% accuracy,” says Roy. Another Google partner is Pune-based Searce, a 12-year-old operation led by founder Hardik Parekh, who finds it convenient to work with Google’s APIs as he feels the company almost embodies the “open source” or “democratic” spirit. Parekh’s ML offering HappierHR tries to automate much of the routine HR operations — right from initial interviews of job applicants and induction of new employees to creation of their email ids and leave approvals. “Supervisors also get suggestions to give leave to subordinates on, say, their wedding anniversaries, if there aren’t any important meetings scheduled for that day,”says Parekh. While Google, Amazon and Microsoft offer platforms for others to use, IBM has its own ML suite called Watson, a complete offering at the premium end of the market for end-users. One of the earliest projects IBM took up in India was with Manipal Hospitals in oncology. “Manipal was an early adopter: it was globally the second or the third hospital to adopt it,” says Prashant Pradhan, chief developer advocate for IBM in India and South Asia. This is how it works. For a medical board on breast cancer, the Watson program is made a member along with other doctors. Given a specific case, Watson gives its opinion and preferred treatment after going through millions of cases that are loaded on to it. “Entire cancer research can run to 50 million pages, and 40,000 papers are added every year. It is impossible for a doctor to go through all of that. The ratio of cases to oncologists is 16,000:1,” adds Pradhan, stressing why ML is a great application to use in cancer treatment. Microsoft, too, has used its ML offerings in India’s healthcare. In Hyderabad, it has helped LV Prasad Eye Institute treat avoidable blindness. A second project it has worked on is helping children who wear glasses. The work started in India has gone global, and LV Prasad Eye Institute is now part of the Microsoft Intelligent Network for Eyecare, which includes five other eyecare facilities from across the world. Microsoft has also studied 50,000 students in Class X in Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh to predict which ones may drop out. It allows the schools to send them for counselling. Machine radiologists and bankers There is enough indication that ML bots or apps can often deliver better results than humans. Last month, IT services giant Wipro said it got productivity of 12,000 people out of 1,800 bots (software programs that perform automated tasks). Automated bots are not quite ML, but are an indicator of what may come. Rizwan Koita, serial entrepreneur and founder CEO of Citius Tech, a healthcare-focused tech company, recalls a conversation with his niece two months ago. “She had qualified to pursue a course in radiology or anaesthesiology and was seeking my advice. I had to tell her that in a few years a radiologist may not have a job,” says Koita. He argues that a radiologist’s job is to interpret images. Therefore millions of existing images (X-rays, sonograms, scans) and their interpretations can be fed into an ML algorithm; it may be a matter of time before a machine gives better interpretations than a human radiologist. From healthcare to fashion. Mumbai-based designer couple Shane and Falguni Peacock have been using IBM’s Watson for a couple of months now. The system helps the duo go through designs and silhouettes that have been shown at fashion events across the world over the last decade. They are using Watson for a project that uses international designs in Bollywood. Watson predicts colours that may be in vogue six months from now and warns if certain silhouettes have been overused in the last couple of years. “Watson is able to tell us what colour may be in six months from now,” says Shane Peacock Says Shane: “Suppose we want to work on a Mughal theme, we can feed images of Mughal-era paintings, architectures and colours into the system, which is able to turn out its unique prints. It also reproduces Mughal prints created by other human designers, just for comparison.” The designer couple have one more exciting project for which they are using Watson. A dress that changes hues according to the time of the day or the mood of the person wearing it. “We can use two colours, say black and white. The dress can become fully white or fully black or a combination of black and white. An app on the wearer’s phone can control it. The change can happen on the go, while the dress is worn. You can get into a car in white and come out in black.” In financial services, Kumar of Arya.ai points out that the loan approval process is an area where he sees a lot of human effort being bested by machines. In fact, Arya has implemented a program where an ML app sifts through loan applications. ICICI Lombard and Birla Sun Life Insurance too have created bots as the first interface with customers Not to be left behind, the Indian IT biggies, TCS, Infosys and Wipro, have their own ML and AI offerings (See Machine Learning in India). Google announced in March that it will mentor half a dozen AI startups. A report by Tracxn, a venture capital research platform, noted that there are at least 300 startups in India using ML and AI technologies. An opportunity also presents a threat. Before ML can replace humans in core functions, it will need humans to create applications. Says Bhansali of Microsoft: “These are still early days: technologies are on trial and talent is scarce.” Ixigo CEO Aloke Bajpai echoes him when he says there are no trained engineers in AI and ML in India, and his team is entirely trained in-house. “There is definitely a shortage of talent for AI technologies. Only 4 per cent of AI professionals in India have worked on core AI technologies such as deep learning and neural networks,” says Akhilesh Tuteja, partner at KPMG. Bridging the gap will be key in turning a potential weakness into a strength.

Samsung Internet Beta now live on the Play Store [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/06 8:17am PDTMar 6, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 54 Share on Facebook 54 Share on Twitter Total Shares121 Applications Downloads News Samsung Samsung has a tendency to make its own Android applications with little-to-no advantages over the Google equivalents. However, the Samsung Internet browser has a few features that Chrome for Android doesn't. Now the company has made a beta version of the browser downloadable from the Google Play Store. The beta version already has several major features not in the stable release - including an indicator for Progressive Web Apps, a QR code reader (why is this still not in the stock Camera app, Google?), and Physical Web support. Samsung has also added compatibility with the Payment Request API, which will allow you to pay for items online with Samsung Pay (much like Chrome allows with Android Pay).    The beta version can also display 360-degree video without a Gear VR headset, move video playback to a pop-up player (much like Picture-in-picture mode from iOS), and automatically compare prices to Amazon when shopping online (this can be turned off). Finally, the underlying web engine has been updated to Chromium 51. The app seems to be region-locked at the moment, considering no one on the AP team can download it, but you can get it from APKMirror. Strangely, the app description says that Samsung Internet Beta officially supports "Samsung Galaxy and Google Nexus phones with Android 5.0 and above," and it certainly works on my Pixel without any modifications.

Mustafa Selçuk Öztürk On my regular S7 Samsung Browser is way more efficient. Also it has adblock, which is nice for regular browsing. Necdet Ali Özdür Combined with the Adblock support, Samsung Browser kicks Chrome's butt with both its speed and battery consumption. Not sure if that's the case with this beta though. Martin Funny, lately Samsung is the only OEM that actually does something interesting... Exited to give it a try. Still not available for download in Bulgaria. :) ProductFRED It's actually one of the better browsers, especially with Content Blocking natively supported. But even aside from that, it's a great experience. WordSpaghetti Yup, and not to shit on Chrome, but the Samsung Browser just runs better on my S7 Edge. It also kicks Chrome's ass in misc benchmarks. Also, the fact that it supports adblockers and some other extentions is a huge plus. Pitahson Yah man. Been using it for a week. Man performs much better than chrome on my axon 7. Phone doest heat up when browsing, no sluggish scrolling. Great experience. I'm actually going to stick with it. Leeroy Jenkins Dear god, with adblock its sooo fast I love it, might have to give up on chrome for this. enoch861 This is all I use. Gave up on Chrome a long time ago. Chrome is a dog on all platforms. Martins Nkem does it still open new tabs in the foreground instead of the background? Aaron You can choose to open tabs in the background when long pressing a link Martins Nkem Thanks I've been waiting for this for a long time 😂 Jerko Čilaš Stock Nougat browser on S7 already supports DuckDuckGo (not beta). Corbin Davenport Thanks for clarifying that, I've updated the post. Diogo Neves It also has the QR reader option (just need to enable it in the settings) ustill812 It's the only browser I on my s7e C64 After using chrome for years I switched to the Samsung Browser since Nougat on my s7 Edge Necdet Ali Özdür I loved that it has a permanent scroll bar on the side. Super useful for long web pages. dxdydz I'm honestly getting more and more interested in the Samsung ecosystem. I just don't like the idea of getting OS updates a year later than the Nexus/Pixel line. Eric Braun Sideloaded on both a galaxy tab a 8.0 and a nextbit robin and running flawless on both. Might be the first time I've considered a browser other than chrome. billy routh Works on my LG V10, Pixel and HTC 10. Which is awesome I've always liked Samsung Galaxy Browser more than Chrome kgptzac Unfortunately none of my devices are compatible... being a beta and only available on Samsung and Nexus devices are a bit non productive way of conducting a public testing. jonzey231 For the record, it isn't allowing me to install via the Play Store on my 6P either. I just used the APKMirror link. Bewear I would dare to say it works better than Chrome in my non-Samsung device. Atoqir Samsung their apps have come a long way. This browser is very good and has more features than chrome with reader mode, adblock, video pop out and more cpu an battery efficient. I also use and love the latest versions of their music app where I use playlists and like songs on my lockscreen. And their S-planner app with monthly widget is also very good. Now if only OS updates went as fast as app updates... I also saw that webstats sites start explicitly listing Samsung Browser. Eddy Nelson Lopez Can't agree more their music is also excellent i use it every day with my Note5, i love it. C64 Samsung music player sucks. Why you ask? If you close the app it only recognize the song where you left and not the position in the song. For someone who listens mostly to live sets, this is very irritating. Atoqir Haven't noticed. But I don't listen to live set. But I never close the music player either. And when you kill all apps when you are playing music, the music keeps on playing. Unlike Spotify. Joshua This is the first Samsung app I've used. I'm a Nexus/Pixel user. This browser is actually really, really nice. I'm running it on my Pixel XL and so far I'm really enjoying it. I'm kind of hoping that Samsung releases other apps to the play store, because I'd be curious to try out other ones. Atoqir Music, Calculator, voice recorder, S-Health and Email are also on apkmirror and store I don't know if they work on non-Samsung devices though. Eddy Nelson Lopez They actually have all their apps in the play store but you cannot see them if you don't have a Galaxy except for S-Health, smart switch and now this browser. But i really hope they keep making them compatible with more phones like this browser. jonzey231 Just installed on my 6P and it's running actually pretty smooth. Every 4-6 months I'll download Opera, Dolphin, Firefox, etc and try to make a switch but nothing comes close to Chrome in just overall usability IMHO. BUT this Samsung browser is really smooth and seems pretty nice. Also, the QR reader is a nice touch. Corbin Davenport I know how you feel, I've probably tried Firefox 10 times at this point, but the weird scrolling and noticeable slowdowns compared to Chrome keep me away. Mike in KC I do the same thing with browsers and keyboards. Keep coming back to Chrome & G Board though... Eumelanin Knight Had me DuckDuckGo support Rod Browser with adblocker hosted on Play store? Don't think this is gonna last long. Drunk Squirrel Stable version has adblock too, and been on play store for ages now. tim242 It has been there over a year already. Those ad blocker plugins are there for the grabbing. Eddy Nelson Lopez There should not be any problems because the add blockers do not come included in the app, you can download them as a separate add-on from the play store. Richard Markert Yes! I can finally stop using the inferior mobile Chrome on my Zenpad! Kahil Nettleton Why didn't they just make it a beta program the right way rather than as a separate app? Kevin Davis Well, I'm in the US, and it says "not available in my country". Martins Nkem just download it from apkmirror (link in this article) Kevin Davis Yes, I know, I just thought I'd check it out through the play store, since it was listed. Thanks, though, and have a good one. Martins Nkem ok. and you too Adi Bayu The only thing that keeps me for using chrome is its synchronization feature with my desktop and other devices. Martins Nkem i was about to say this.. Has anyone managed to figure out how to sync bookmarks from the older stable Samsung browser to this beta kenspiracy I switched to the Samsung browser last week on my S7e. I... actually like it a lot. The only thing I miss about Chrome is the ability to use Lastpass. Otherwise, I'm kinda okay with being done with Chrome on mobile. X-47B use fingerprint integration with the browser, more secure. Taco Monster >Chromium 51. Wow, only 30 weeks behind! Atoqir Never had any rendering issues. New chrome rendering engine versions usually add support for experimental stuff that partially only becomes "mainstream" after a year or so. Taco Monster I'd be more concerned about security patches than rendering issues. Being 5 releases behind Chromium stable is no joke. Atoqir Well most Android phones are 15 releases behind with security patches. That's no joke either :p Taco Monster I agree completely. X-47B Other than being just a number, are there any issues? For all it matters, we think this runs smoother than chrome. kreemer Thanks! Good for people to know that it will NOT replace the Samsung Internet default - it installs alongside leaving both available to you. RAMowner Good to know. Thnx Justin Ever since Samsung Internet has allowed for ad blocking I've dropped Chrome and Chrome Beta and only used the Samsung browser. It's nice, fast (especially with adblocking, pages fully load in 3-5 seconds on average) and scrolling is much smoother than when I last used Chrome. It's a solid browser. The Samsung Pay integration is going to be a much added bonus to rack up points online via Samsung pay! matteventu Available on the Play Store UK for Pixel XL. Honestly, this is FAR better than Chrome. NMatt Not like it matters, but I did a bunch of benchmark tests- Peacekeeper- Samy-867/Chrome-657 HTML5Test- Samy-485/Chrome-521 SunSpider- Samy-858.3ms/Chrome-1138.2ms Mozilla Kraken- Samy-3926.7ms/Chrome-7122.0ms Scored better on 3 of the 4 benchmarks tests. Impheatus What are you guys talking about the QR reader? You can just open your camera, focus on a QR code, press and hold home button, let Google scan the image and it will recognize the code. That's it. Atoqir Never knew know you could do this actually. And I'm a developer :p Samsung Browser had a button "QR Scanner". Seems more obvious to use. Impheatus Does this browser sync its opened tabs with desktop Chrome and viceversa? Eddy Nelson Lopez Also it has fingerprint support, so you can login to websites with your fingers if your phone has a fingerprint scanner, Nice move Samsung I've been using this browser for a long time with my Note5 but missed it every time I moved to my S3 running Lineage OS now I can finally use it! 👌 leo Which adblock extension did you guys use? There are few of them Eddy Nelson Lopez Personally I've been using this one in my Note5 and it works flawlessly https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.crystalapp.crystal Saad Naeem I can confirm that it's working on my nougat running Honor 8 (apk). DW Duck I was able to download it on my S7 from the play store, I'll try it on my S7 edge and see if it's available for it as well NightFelix dam... cant install on my S7edge... oh well. APK sideloading now.. Marty Wow...could it be? There's now a web browser for Android that's really good. I'm accustomed to using Safari on my iPad to browse the web and find it extremely convenient and useful. Nothing I've encountered on Android has ever come close to the convenience of Safari except Opera. But since Opera sold out to the commies, it's a no go now. Chrome sucks bad for user convenience...especially handling bookmarks. Firefox sucks also. And nothing else in the Play Store is worth a damn. They all are either very buggy, unreliable or unsafe. It looks like Samsung is saving the day with this web browser. It provides almost as much convenience as Safari and is fast and reliable. The only thing I see that it desperately needs is a sync function to sync bookmarks and settings between devices. I's kind of a pain to have to manually save all my bookmarks on each of the devices I own. But even with that missing Samsung Internet Beta is the best there is. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named Where I could get a content blocker for ads? Please reply with links only.

Countless companies and startups have tried, and many have failed, to perfect the inbox experience and make peace with email and its soul-crushing inevitability in our modern digital lives. The goal is to make email feel manageable or, at the very least, to give you a pretty piece of mobile or desktop software you enjoy using. We may never achieve a sense of perfection when it comes to email, but many services come close. On desktop, there’s lots of great options, from the esteemed Airmail on Mac, which costs $9.99, to the Google Inbox-like Spark. For the longest time, I had settled for the free app WMail, which takes the standard web Gmail experience and wrapped it up as a pleasant-looking piece of standalone Mac software. Wavebox has Slack, Trello, and Google Apps built in Similar to how Slack, Spotify, and many other companies develop desktop apps, WMail is built using GitHub’s Electron framework and powered using Chromium, the open source foundation behind Google Chrome. Effectively, these tools allow developers to take web apps and transform them into standalone desktop ones that function in identical ways, but with a few added bits of visual flair and functionality. In March, the team behind WMail rebranded its app as Wavebox, a new fully-featured email and productivity app that goes well beyond the original idea of an email client. In fact, after using Wavebox for no more than 10 minutes after I first downloaded it earlier this week, I was confident in saying its the most powerful email app for Mac I’ve ever used. It’s available now for free (there are Windows and Linux versions as well), but the company behind it sells a $19.95 annual pro subscription for access to things like unlimited accounts and third-party app integrations. Photo: Wavebox Wavebox functions very much like its WMail predecessor — it too is built on Chromium and Electron. It lets you add a Gmail account, and then replicates all the very same settings you have on the web versions, including keyboard shortcuts, labels, and so on. It even lets you designate an account as an Inbox one, so you can use Google’s sleek design on, say, your personal email account while keeping the standard web Gmail look for your work one. Where Wavebox goes above and beyond, however, is its integrations. Where WMail supported only Gmail accounts, Wavebox supports all Google Apps services, productivity service Trello, team comms app Slack, Microsoft Outlook accounts, and Office 365 apps. It even has an option to load any website whatsoever as its own tab within the app. After some minor customization, I set up Wavebox with my work email, calendar, and Google Drive; my personal email, calendar, and Google Photos; my company Trello account; my company Slack channel; and a dedicated tab for The Verge’s homepage. I can even edit Google Doc files right within the app window. Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge I will concede that Wavebox feels almost tailor-made for my personal work and life setup. We here at The Verge use Trello for tracking projects, communicate over Slack, and use Google Cloud / G Suite for all of our email and web app needs. Though there is support for Windows apps now, I can see why some people’s workflows might not mesh well with what Wavebox has to offer. And to be fair, this isn’t a minimalist and uncluttered email app — far from it. If you want something a bit more minimal, Airmail is probably your best bet, but I’d also highly recommend the web app Mailplane, especially if you want the same web Gmail experience replicated as a lightweight Mac app. But if you’re looking for a robust, multi-purpose email app that can handle a dizzying number of different services, there’s nothing better out there than Wavebox.

(AFP) Google and Apple are not synonymous with failure but in the risky business of innovation, anything is possible. At Sweden's newly opened Museum of Failure, Google Glass and Apple Newton are two such devices that were either ahead of their time or the results of some bad ideas. Founded by clinical psychologist Samuel West, the museum that opened on June 7 to the public has over 70 failed products and services from around the world. "We know that 80 to 90 per cent of innovation projects, they fail and you never read about them, you don't see them, people don't talk about them. And if there's anything we can do from these failures, it's learn from them," West told CBS News. The list has Nokia "N-gage" device, Orbitoclast Lobotomy (medical instrument), Harley-Davidson Perfume, Kodak Digital Camera, Sony Betamax and Lego Fiber Optics, among others, the information available on the Museum of Failure website stated. Developed and marketed by Apple Inc starting 1987, Newton was one of the first personal digital assistants to feature handwriting recognition. Apple shipped the first devices in 1993. Initially considered as innovative, Apple founder Steve Jobs directed the company to stop the production of Apple Newton devices in 1998. According to reports, Newton devices ran on a proprietary operating system called Newton OS. The high price and early problems with its handwriting recognition feature limited its sales. Google Glass, an eye-wearable device, created a storm when the company handed over a prototype to a few "Glass Explorers" in 2013 for $1,500. The optical head-mounted display became available to public in May 2014 but was discontinued in 2015 owing to privacy and safety concerns. The device, however, is now gaining momentum in the medical industry. Nokia made "N-Gage" mobile device and handheld game system that ran on Series 60 platform on Symbian OS. The device, released in October 2003, was discontinued two years later. "N-Gage" suffered from a poor gaming library. The Museum of Failure is open to the public in downtown Helsingborg.

Google wants to make it easy for carriers to have interoperable RCS messaging Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/07 2:18pm PDTJun 7, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 179 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares272 Carriers Google News Last week Sprint and Rogers announced that users sending messages between the two carriers will be able to make use of RCS. RCS, of course, is the new standard to replace SMS that Google committed to back in 2015. So far each carrier seems to have its own idea for how RCS should work. But Google's recent work in cross-carrier communication is a big step towards ubiquity, and thanks to the tech behind this latest interconnect other carriers can more easily get in on the RCS action. We are deploying a "hub" model, so that carriers can interconnect to the hub once to get access to all other carriers connected to the hub. — Nick Fox (@RealNickFox) June 5, 2017 Google's Nick Fox followed up his announcement on the 1st with an answer to a question posed by our own Artem about how Google's RCS interconnect works. Instead of requiring that carriers individually connect their networks in some capacity to one another to exchange RCS messages, the RCS standards used by Google and the GSMA make use of a hub-style interconnect. The Jibe hub will interconnect with any Universal Profile compliant network, including in-network IMS, other hosted providers and other hubs — Nick Fox (@RealNickFox) June 10, 2017 Google's hub-based implementation of RCS in the recent cross-carrier announcement isn't a new technology, but it is cool. Back in 2013, the GSM Association published a white paper that detailed how RCS could work — and it's very much worth a read if you are even mildly interested in the future of carrier messaging, RCS, or even just networking. The white paper showed a few different methods for RCS implementation, such as using a direct NNI (Network-Network Interface) decentralized network for each carrier interconnection. Unfortunately, that particular solution results in a quickly rising number of interconnects as the number of carriers increases (n(n - 1) / 2), which means for each additional carrier in the network a larger investment needs to be made by those in it. The white paper also talked about a hub model for RCS, which has clear advantages for carriers. Rather than be burdened with developing their own connections to other carriers, each needs only connect to the one central hub presumably provided by Google. But, this centralized system will likely suffer from the same sort of weaknesses that all centralized systems do. For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. A central network is also more susceptible to censorship, attacks, or interference. However, it also provides some advantages, such as decreasing the investment of time and resources for carriers joining the standard. The hub system proposed in the white paper (based on Openmind Networks implementation for SMS/MMS) does have drawbacks, but fewer connections might end up meaning faster deployment. And since Google has already done the work bringing the hub network up for Sprint and Rogers, each additional carrier should only responsible for its connection to that hub, as opposed to managing every link to every other RCS carrier themselves. 4 node interconnect vs 36 Perhaps the recent news might help other carriers be persuaded to adopt Google's version of RCS, if for no other reason than cost-cutting. Why manage a ton of different networks for RCS when they can let Google cough up the cash for infrastructure? After all, if there's one thing carriers love, it's money.

Jayson Stephenson Trust me, it wasn't anywhere that great to begin with. I really learned a lot with this doc and the amazing features/flexibility that G-Drive has. Snowsky Mountain Does this mean I can use third-party apps like the SMS Backup & Restore app to backup and restore RCS messages? Jayson Stephenson Yes, but even better. RCS Messages are by default synced to your carriers cloud infrastructure. So if you were to change phones/tablets your messages will be in sync with whatever device you use. Snowsky Mountain Where would I go to turn off/on that syncing of messages? Would it be from a messaging app, like the Android Messages app? Or would it be through my carrier? Also, I wonder what (if any) effect that would have on T-Mobile's DIGITS service, which appears to do something similar for SMS/MMS messages... Jayson Stephenson I'm not 100% yet. But I believe your answer might be on what Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en Andy J As the idea is that you could send and receive SMS, MMS and RCS messages (the spec calls xMS and RCS) from any other device connected to your account - like a tablet or any web browser anywhere - then I would image you would need to turn this off via your carrier not via an app. Snowsky Mountain That makes sense. Thanks! :) MJ I have no interest in my carrier storing my messages. No thanks... I hope this can be turned off. Jayson Stephenson I'm sure a lot of people will agree with you. As I mentioned to Snowsky, I believe the option for that will be on whatever Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en Latheryin There goes your privacy. Dmitri Smirnov There was never any to begin with in the SMS world. Latheryin That completely is a matter of the country to live in. Dmitri Smirnov SS7 vulnerabilities prove, that lack of privacy transcends borders :) Also, there is nothing preventing your carrier to store the SMS "for technical reasons" regardless of a country. At any rate, while RCS might be a weird attempt to catch up with the messenger market, it is definitely not worse than the SMS. Latheryin Acutally there is. At least in the states. There are laws that prevent them from being more then a pass through. As for the messaging market. That also depends on the country you live in. Data messengers are bigger in developing countries then they are say in the states. A perfect example is that 3% of the US population even use a messaging app as their primary. SMS or just flat out calling is the preffered. David Ruddock Cool doc, but Verizon and AT&T are both signatories on the RCS Universal Profile. That doesn't compel them to do anything, but it seems unlikely they'd sign if they didn't intend to be compatible with the universal profile at some point, which is what Google Jibe is based on. Jayson Stephenson It doesn't say anywhere they they ever will implement it. In fact I expect they won't for a long time. All it mentions is their RCS is a proprietary format meaning it will work on only their internal networks. Also check out my comment on AT&T. newtonfb ATT showed a demo of it at MWC(I see that you made that comment on the doc, you should include the twitter picture also). I dont see why ATT and Tmobile will not have the UP out by the end of the year. Verizon is a different story as they have not showed or said anything about it. Jayson Stephenson The doc is open source. ;) Latheryin Yes attached showed it but it plans on placing it on top of their SMS setup not as a replacement. wicketr I think what he's saying is that "yes, it's proprietary now, but they planning on having UP with an unconfirmed launch date". The same is true for most of these. T-Mobile's is currently proprietary, but has been rumored to be UP completed by the end of the year. But it's undetermined if it's going to use Google's hub, or implement the RCS UP using Samsung's infratructure across the boards. Jayson Stephenson Yes, sorry for the confusion. I will see if I can design it any better. But so far the only carrier which we know guaranteed is in the process of installing the UP is T-Mobile. Which is mentioned in the doc. Tom Erlandsen Calling it now, I bet Allo gets RCS support fairly soon after this release Joshua Why? Android Messages - which has RCS - is made by Google. They could have implemented RCS into Allo this whole time. Tom Erlandsen Because Google wants Allo to succeed, and the absolute best way they can do that is by having some kind of carrier messaging fallback. They're not going to do SMS fallback, the Allo lead has come out and said that before. But they've never said they won't do RCS fallback. And the fact that Android Messages has RCS support means absolutely nothing. Google is infamous for its A/B tests, so it's hardly a stretch to imagine them having two apps with RCS support. If Allo with RCS fallback proves very popular and successful, I could imagine them discontinuing Android Messages and making Allo with RCS the default messaging app on Android, requiring OEMs to bundle it with their devices. But I only think they'll do that if Allo proves to be a success, as otherwise they'll face massive OEM backlash Joshua They wont discontinue Android Messages because here in Canada where RCS has been out for months, carriers have said in 2018 Android Messages is shipping with all of their devices. Tom Erlandsen Like I said, I don't think they'd discontinue Android Messages unless Allo was poised to take its place (i.e. had a decent userbase). And that would take a while to happen, even with RCS support. So yeah Android Messages will probably stay for a while, until Google has something it feels would make a better replacement, and I think that's what they'll try and build Allo into Chris I wish American carriers weren't such jackasses. Jayson Stephenson You have a very similar theory as I do. I think the point of the renaming of Google Messages to "Android Messages" is to give all AOSP devices a baseline messenger app that is not branded with the Google name, and supports whatever standard your carrier utilizes. (SMS/MMS/RCS) Obviously Allo will not be getting full-SMS support at all for obvious reasons....(https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/53uvvu/why_sms_fallback_isnt_the_holy_grail_you_all/) But it might be possible for it to get RCS support and still allowing it to view, send, and receive SMS messages. As SMS messages are connected to your carriers data infrastructure instead of tied to your phone storage. (If you have an RCS compatible carrier) You can have Allo to communicate to any non-Allo contacts while still utilizing its rich features with Allo-Allo communication. Although I'm not sure if such an app/feature is even possible. If it were, we could see a messenger revolution! Andy J If Allo gets upgraded with RCS - it MUST have SMS too, the UP spec is very very clear on this point, because RCS does SMS fallback by default. This thing a lot of people forget about Android Messages is that part of Google's commitment to RCS was that they would design an open source RCS client that can be used as is or used as starting point for carriers and OEMs. Android Messages is (as far as we know) that open source client. It's nowhere near feature complete - because the UP spec includes pretty much everything that Allo already has - location sharing, sending files, stickers, voice calls and video calls. The Android Messages app has a long way to go to meet all the features of the first release of UP. Jayson Stephenson The RCS spec does mention is must have RCS fallback, that is correct. But it does not specifically mention that it must be a client-side fallback. If it were carrer-side then we could see IMs like Allo have just strictly RCS support with native SMS fallback if needed. I could be wrong about that though, I haven't skimmed through the spec in a while. Andy J It does actually - it's both. The carrier fallback is automatic and awesome because it's fallback on the REMOTE carrier not yours. So if you send a message to a user and for some reason it cannot be delivered (they have no data for example), the remote users carrier will automatically convert the message to SMS and deliver it. The spec is very specific that any app that supports RCS MUST also support SMS. Client fallback to SMS is referred to as CFS and network fallback to SMS is referred to as NFS. Page 216 of the spec states: Android 7.0+ "Any RCS client (embedded or downloadable application) shall only activate its own RCS stack when it is set as the Default SMS app. " and page 219 covers Android <7.0 "If the RCS client loses its’ Default SMS app status it shall de-register" and the entire spec constantly covers SMS fallback for everything - everything from sending messages, sending location, sending files can be achieved over SMS when RCS is not available across the entire route - the recipient receives an SMS with a web link. It's an interesting read - it hasn't changed a whole lot from the 2 pre Universal Profile specs. Jayson Stephenson Very interesting! I've always wondered how that worked. I'll have to take a look at the document again. Thanks! Abraham No this is how I see it. Android Messages is a very generic simple SMS/RCS platform. No real branding, no real benefit for Google. This makes carriers happy as they are not shoving Google on everyones faces by default. Allo, if it gets RCS support. Will be the Google branded, with Google assistant and many more things. But this will be for the user to decide if they want to use. Not set as default to keep the user and carriers happy. What do you guys think? Joshua More likely. Allo will never replace Android Messages. Android Messages is a very lightweight, clean, and basic app. Allo is full of many (some might call pointless) features most don't want or need. Allo is slow to open compared to Android Messages, which could get annoying if you just want to send a quick SMS/RCS message. McStagger are you keeping that spreadsheet updated? Jayson Stephenson Most certainly! .w oh, and google will be in the center of our communication even more! and if someone opts to use basic sms, which doesn't use internet and such one will end up being processed but damn google... how "noble" of them, and they will probably do this also for "free" (i.e. "only" our data will be collected)... 😆😄 Better Google than Amazon, Facebook, or Apple. That's for sure. .w I'm not so sure about that, given google cluster-freck attitude towards messaging apps... None of the above looks great tbh... Nana Adu-Krow Not sure what is so hard to understand about their messaging apps. Each one serves a different purpose. And if you feel like there's apps that lack certain functionality (like web app support or something) you have the option to use something 3rd party. .w ROTFL, I didn't say that it's hard to understand but the purpose of messaging app is, well... messaging. In case of google you have abundance of messaging apps and if they have distinctive functionality it's even worse - there should be single app that handles all the basics and does it well. That's not the case in google messaging ecosystem. Why would I put my feet in that mess? Just to find out that in a couple of months google would introduce yet another messaging app? or in case of operators - say that they were mistaken if not 100% chooses their solution. Bottomline - trusting google services, especially those not well established (like mail, calendar, docs or android ecosystem) is veeeery risky... Cakefish When will RCS come to the UK? NathanDrago My knowledge is that SMS have basically disappeared. I only receive SMS from my bank and my carrier. Everybody is using WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it. What's the purpose of this effort for RCS? Is RCS more capable than WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it? David Ruddock SMS is still widely used in the USA. NathanDrago But don't you suspect that by the time this standard even starts to spread, USA will already have caught up with the rest of the world (that is, abandoning non-data messages)? It seems to me a lot of wasted resources. raddacle Considering how comfortable people are with services like iMessage which discriminates against other OS's, I don't see SMS going anywhere for the US. SMS is as standard as possible for the US right now. The only way to change the standard is by forcing it, hence RCS. Santos Chavez iMessage says nope, sorry. iPhones are actually a lot more popular here in the USA than the rest of the world. Hence people never switch to other apps.Hence those iPhone users messaging an Android user and oops, it's an SMS now because, yeah, Android doesn't have iMessage. The Android user also wouldn't change apps either if their current SMS app allows them to chat with all of their iPhone using friends. Like me, for instance, I'm the only one in my group of 5 friends that uses an Android phone. Hence, my default SMS app, Android Messages,is all I need to talk with them. They don't switch apps because amongst themselves they use iMessage which is enough as they get advanced messaging features. See what I mean? RCS would at the very least make Android---> Android users have those same advanced messaging features they'd get with other apps. Pushing RCS as the standard works for us here because we've never switched out of using SMS apps. .w This highly depends on the country... Peter Obligatory XKCD https://m.xkcd.com/927/ Dat Nguyen Here in Belgium, SMS is still used (well less than before) because when it comes to mobile subscriptions, Belgium is one of the countries that has expensive prices. For example, for 15€ a month, the carrier I use gives you 2,5 hours of calling, unlimited texting and 1,5 Gb of data so it's not like I can enable the data 24/7 And none of the carriers in Belgium doesn't seem to be aware of RCS AbdulB1 keep it on 3g. You will survive within limits Ryne Hager RCS is supposed to be an open replacement for SMS/MMS. But it is really just another competing standard. At least when compared to things like WhatsApp it isn't a private system. Any carrier that wants to can jump on and start using RCS for messaging, while WhatsApp is not so open and requires that you use their app the way they want you to. So TL:DR RCS is just supposed to replace old standards. bekifft Obligatory XKCD: https://xkcd.com/927/ Latheryin Data only messaging services are not really used a lot in the states and many other places. Data rates are just too high where SMS is unlimited free. Kyle Salewski Really hoping that since Google is behind this, and with the recent revamp of Google Voice, that RCS would soon come to GV. Anyone have any insight on the complexity behind that? Or would it be really difficult since Google Voice isn't a traditional "carrier" but more of a middle man. David Ruddock It would make sense as a reason for them bringing it back from the brink of death, if nothing else. bekifft But Google Voice / Hangouts are the core of the Frankenstein monster that is Google Fi. They seem to be trying to kill both brands, so it makes more sense to do this as part of Google Fi. But maybe GV / GFi is just more A / B testing. Willie Chalmers III More like A/B/C/D/E testing for a messaging strategy. Santos Chavez I think Nick Fox also mentioned on Twitter that they're working on bringing RCS to Project Fi. Project Fi uses Google Voice as the back end for most of its functions so perhaps adding RCS to Voice is pretty much necessary for it to come to Fi-- maybe they'll "talk" to the same server, as such. Project Fi numbers are Google Voice numbers after all, technically. Snowsky Mountain Is an Internet connection required to send and receive RCS messages? Jay Yes. h4rr4r So then why bother with it over XMPP? Snowsky Mountain So what would happen if I had a cellular connection but no Internet (no Wi-Fi or data)? Would it fall back to SMS/MMS? Jay Yep, you got it! John Doe VoLTE? Phone service requires Internet now so why not messages? Evan Anderson For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. This is an extremely unlikely situation. Any large network system, such as this one, will have plenty of redundancy and excess capacity to avoid ever overloading the system. Star network topology is standard these days, so this architecture makes perfect sense. Any other topology is highly inefficient. Snowsky Mountain I wonder what would happen if that were to occur, though. Maybe it would fall back to SMS/MMS? Ryne Hager It's definitely unlikely, I'm more concerned about denial of service implications from a centralized system. Decentralized might be more expensive for the carriers, but it would be more robust. Houston Texas Robust how? Borgman Say Android Messages gets RCS on all carriers and stuff. What then will be the incentive to use Allo or other IM? Sruly J Well Allo has bots... Marcellus1 It'll be the particular feature set of each offering. I could use Allo because I like the bot and you could use WhatsApp because you like the stickers, for example, but it wouldn't matter that we aren't using the same app--which would be awesome and would drive competition better. Borgman But Allo won't get RCS, correct? Won't that remain an IM (unfortunately?). Or by some miracle (thanks to RCS) I'd be able to use Allo and message someone on imessage? Or are IM a whole nother story for a later date? (I just wish I could use X app and send messages, full resolution photos, HD video, read receipt, typing notify, to someone on Y app). Marcellus1 I don't know specifically what apps will get RCS and what ones won't. Hopefully all messaging apps will support it at some point. I suspect if there are any holdouts, iMessage would be the main one just because Apple likes to be intentionally incompatible. The goal of RCS, though, is to have exactly what you said is your wish. Borgman Man I sure hope that happens!!! Latheryin Will never take off as the standard. Not for a least 10 years. Joshua Canada already has had RCS for many months. We only have a few carriers, so it can easily be standard in Canada. Latheryin Everywhere has it. It is just a matter of who will be using it and what version they will use. It will end up like Android pay.. It to mention that is a but too much privacy that many people just will not freely Give up. Mainly not with the anti Google movement going on right now. Marty For some reason the headline of this article made me remember what I used to think about Google several years ago. I was of the opinion that the mentality at Google was of forging a future of making everything free...at least free in the phone and service market to start. Back then my impression of Google was that it was lead by activistic, hippy-culture young people who wanted everything in life to be free. I felt Google would try to lead society to forge such a mindset that "profit" was evil and that humanity being free from wants and needs was the future they wanted. Viktor Ivanov Good thing they aren't, I'd be really worried if they were. Marty Maybe they were to a certain extent but couldn't manage to bring their ideals to fruition. The people running the show right now seem to be money-driven. Syukri Lajin Google trying to make the carriers move to a more centralized system. Good thing they showed good example by not making another messaging app just for RCS. :D freshprince_87 I hope the other 3 US carriers (T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T) adopts Google's RCS messaging network so that RCS finally replaces SMS/MMS forever . SMS/MMS needs to freaking die already! When that happens, there won't be a need for iMessage and it's blue bubbles anymore 😒. Because every phone except for iPhones (unless Apples updates it's messages app in iOS 11)will have the Google's version of iMessage messaging service, RCS, in the United States. Borgman I don't know how many bozo iphone friends I have who say "the picture you just send is hazy" or "why does Android not send HD pics or videos". Drives me crazy! Just want a simple way to send those things to my friends! Warren Skipper No matter if the rest of the world uses RCS, Apple will never adopt it simply because it involves connecting to Google. Add on top of the fact that Google will likely have access to all messages that come through and you have a perfect recipe for Apple to publicly stand against it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson Not sure what you mean by "Connecting to Google", if Apple were to ever adopt RCS they would just have to utilize the exact same API's that every other OEM (Windows Phones, Android, etc...) uses. The only thing Google is doing is promoting the standard and trying to push adoption. Warren Skipper From everything I've read, there are some parts of the universal profile that seem to be Google-specific. In this article by Mobilesyrup, the carrier network Rogers stated “It’s a Google managed service”: http://mobilesyrup.com/2017/05/11/rcs-messaging-sms-canada-explainer/ I could be wrong though.Even if so, Apple wouldn't adopt it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson What he was mentioning in that paragraph that you quoted was the Google Jibe platform which those carriers have agreed to utilize to have Google host the server infrastructure for them. Look at the previous paragraph... "One point Sarhangi is quick to reiterate multiple times throughout our interview is that RCS “is not a Google service.”" RCS is NOT a Google exclusive service. Any Carrier, or OS, or Hardware manufacturer can utilize RCS 100% without any involvement of Google whatsoever. Warren Skipper You're mistaken what I'm saying. I know this is not Google exclusive. I also understand that any carrier can implement it along with OEMs like Samsung who can host the servers in lieu of Google. However, it's highly likely that Google has some form of code within the universal profile itself, that they can track, that is beyond whoever implements RCS. Again I could be wrong but either way, RCS has to go through someone's servers and who's ever it is will have the ability to mine everything that goes through it. Nicholas Conrad But apple hates industry standard, it interferes with their platform lock-in. Andy J Yes - but when UP is available on Android, Windows and Linux and Apple is the only company not taking part - Apple users will feel frustrated by that. Andy J Google aren't the only company - there are about 8, and because they are all UP - they will all interoperate.... that is the whole point after all. Andy J RCS falls back to SMS... mrjayviper Did that mean SMS communications will be data mined by Google as well? I believe they can't do that right now? h4rr4r Why not? They can read anything the device sends. If you own the kernel you own it all. mrjayviper Google can't read my SMS right now success they are not part of the process Ryan yes, they can. as he said they can technically read anything that exits your phone, if they choose to do so. This is how the current sms backup function works. Also if you use android messages they are already in the process mrjayviper i don't backup my SMS h4rr4r Google made the software that displays the text. If you use an Android phone. eddiepearson Honestly, don't care about this unless this means TMO will implement this tomorrow. All of this is null if TMO continues to not give a crap. You can get those free poop goodies every Tuesday though. bekifft The Venn diagram of people on Sprint with friends in Canada (and vice versa) are going to be very excited about this! JD So what Google is saying is RCS will be an unreliable POS that will be in Beta forever. Santos Chavez No that is not at all what they're saying. JD It was implied, since Google is going to sit in the middle of this hub. thecoolkid So now Google will be reading our texts too...? kamiller42 Control the hub? Control the world! Nice one, stop shop for intelligence agencies. Will hub participants be given access to all traffic on the hub? I'm sure Google will. "Better to mine you with my pretty!" MeCampbell30 I'm sure the carriers have no intention of letting google profit at their expense. kamiller42 The answer? Enticement. Offer the carriers the access to the products of the data mining. "We all benefit." Andy J Google's Jibe aren't the only company offering hosted RCS to carriers, and carriers are still completely free to implement their own UP solution hosted entirely inside their own network. This is the bit I am unclear on, because at least 8 other hosted companies exist - it's not clear if you need a connection to each provider or if those providers will connect to each other and one connection to one hub will eventually reach the right provider :/ Abhishek Saral RCS is just for SMS or are there any other benefits? senoredusty Separate ideas. Your question doesn't really make sense. Think of RCS ad the evolution of SMS Abhishek Saral Try to understand the context. It's just for sending messages or something else. senoredusty Yes. It's like fancy SMS. Read receipts, higher quality media, typing indicators, etc. Abhishek Saral People in US should start using WhatsApp already. Instead of making things tough for everyone. senoredusty Everyone in the US uses SMS already. If, over the course of time, people are naturally transitioned from SMS to RCS, that's a lot smaller a barrier than trying to convince each and every person to install yet another app. Sprint is going in the right direction with this, having Android Messages installed by default on all new Android devices. Also IMO WhatsApp is ugly. I don't want to use it, so I'm not about to try to convince everyone else they should. I'd much rather see Textra gain RCS functionality. Duder12 Fixed for you. *iPhone users in US should stop using iMessage already. Instead of making things tough for everyone.* Jay Who care? Americans have locked themselves into a vicious cycle, where 'SMS FALLBACK' in 2017 is necessary and their own self created injury infliction about being the 'green text' to 'blue text' users. Be it whatsapp or telegram or wechat, the rest of the world seems a lot more sane and the messaging discussion has not been one, in a lot of places on earth for years now. Instead here we are in 2017, with americans ranting about SMS and 'the imessage for android'. Something most nations will not care about Santos Chavez I think a lot of has to do with the fact that many folks here aren't really technically knowledged. Most never use any other app other than what came with their phone. Hence why SMS is still a thing, they just use that app to communicate with everyone. By gradually moving things over to RCS, those same consumers would still benefit from advanced messaging even if they never change their app. Sprint is helping with that since they're installing Android Messages by default on all new phones, and they already support RCS. ThePublisher So Google will be able to read all texts... awesome... Erstam Why don't they have Google voice setup with this already? James Where does it say Jibe will provide the hub connection to carriers for free? davidtb I could see how Google (a non-carrier) would want a piece of every RCS message (via their servers) who's at the center of the hub? RCS is pretty, but not a necessity, needa I wonder if Google is going to let everyone in the hub get the data. Yuri Vidal Can someone please explain me why use RCS (Or even SMS) would be better than simply using internet IP messaging systems? (WhatsApp, Telegram, Hangout, and so many others...) Paul Hansen A universal platform for all mobile devices. Not just the ones with a particular app installed. Santos Chavez Because then you could message someone the same way as those apps, but it wouldn't even matter what app they're using. For example, SMS apps will adopt the standard, as well (Textra devs have already said they will support it) so an Android Messages user on Sprint would be able to RCS with a Textra user on Rogers while having the same exact features of WhatsApp, Facebook, etc (like read receipts, typing indicators, large video sending, high quality pictures, and so on). Believe it or not, not everyone uses those other apps, especially here in the US. And even if they had an account in one or more of the apps, they may not be active on it anymore, like it is the case with my friends. With RCS you'd still be able to reach them anyway and have all of the advanced features those apps provide, across carriers and across apps. 2 Men-E I just want this to come to Project Fi Santos Chavez Me too! Really hoping that because Google owns the infrastructure and that they've streamlined the requirements to bridge to other carriers, it'll come to Fi pretty soon. Should be lots easier for them than all of the other carriers anywhere, after all :P Sonic Sunglasses I'm sure AT$T is busy working out its strategic plan to be dead last in implementing this technology. KChristainsen So basically we're still far off from RCS becoming a reality, unreal Jeff Saul Everything goes through the Google. It has been decreed. Humans will bow down to the Google. The Google reigns supreme. Soraya Xel For Google's next trick: Steal everyone's SMS data too. xyz No big deal. In most countries, the telecom regulators will set a standard that all carriers will have to follow. In the US, it'll be a mess. Đức Thành This is always the case: Google wants to help make something better for everyone, they have an idea that can help people improve things for themselves, which then more often than not gets rejected because everyone is a selfish and foolish asshole whose only interest is their own short-term benefits. Much of humanity is like that. Sometimes I think I can begin to get why in sci-fi movies the supreme AI ruler just wants to get rid of all humanity: Humanity's stupidity is a threat to their very existence. Andy J We need to get Artem to go back for more information. Google's Jibe are not the only company providing hosted RCS solutions, there are about 8 of them. This explains how it works when all the companies are using Jibe for their solution, but how does it work when a) you are using a different hosting provider and b) how does User A on Jibe sending a message to User B on another provider or even more confusingly - a carrier implementing RCS entirely in their own network without relying on any external hosting using the UP ready openmind Core Network solution - how does the message get routed, how does the Jibe cloud know where to deliver the message to? dodo icon pack on picture?

Hot Topics: Ironman Boulder Dead & Company Chautauqua concert noise Stashlogix under fire Yellow Deli faces eviction News tips Print   Email   Font Resize What's With All These Voice Speakers? By Dave Taylor For the Camera Posted:   06/10/2017 09:21:46 AM MDT Dave Taylor For the Camera Q: I saw that Apple just released a new voice-activated music speaker to compete with the Amazon Echo product. What's the deal with these speakers and should I get one? A: If you're like me, you've spent years fiddling with a tuning dial, selecting a favorite CD or two from your collection or, more recently, tapping on a device to figure out what playlist or streaming channel you want to hear. Speaker selection has always been about sound quality, convenience and price, but they've always been at the "end of a wire,"sitting there without any functionality beyond playing the music pushed to them. Imagine instead that as you walk into a room you could say "Hello room! Please play some Mozart!" or "shuffle Beats Antique" or even "play mellow jazz." That's exactly what all these voice-activated audio devices can do, and there are more of them than you think. The segment leader is the Amazon Echo with its three options of the tiny Dot, the wireless Tap and the flagship Echo itself, just a bit bigger than an Arizona Tea can. Google has a product of its own called Google Home and its great benefit is that it understands Chromecast so it can interact with my TV and stereo system wirelessly. In fact "Hey Google, play music videos on Vizio tv" works just fine, even turning on my Chromecast-enabled television in the process. Advertisement Apple introduced a new unit last week that competes in the same space, though the company is quick to highlight that they see it more as competition with higher end audio systems like the Sonos multi-room music system. Built around Siri, the HomePod is a fat, squat speaker (unlike its slimmer competitors) and is reputed to have considerably better sound. Which is important, because it comes with a premium price tag too: About $400 compared to $50-$150 for the Amazon product line and $100 for the Google Home device. At the end of the day, however, it's all about the music and the additional features. Each connects to various smart home devices, though, predictably, your smart thermostat, garage door opener and lights are generally compatible with one, not all. None of the devices support a separate subwoofer but they all have quite acceptable sound reproduction, and if you're a fan of Pandora, Spotify or similar streaming services, they're ready to go and fantastically easy to work with. With your own music it's a bit more tricky, and that might be where Apple will have the edge with many people already converting their CDs into iTunes tracks. It's a brave new world and these devices are really great if you're used to tuning and tapping to get your favorite music. It's a revolutionary way to enjoy much more music, whatever your genre preferences, and that's a win in my book. ------ Dave Taylor has been involved with the online world since before the creation of the Internet and runs the popularAsk Dave Taylor — http://www.askdavetaylor.com/ — tech review and how-to site.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MEDIA Guest One year in: How publishers are finding wins with Facebook Instant Articles Erin Hintz, Urban Airship@ehintz June 10, 2017 8:02 AM Above: An image of a Facebook Instant Article from The Washington Post. Image Credit: Facebook In her 2017 Internet Trends report, Mary Meeker reported that time spent using the Internet on mobile rose again in 2016 to 3.1 hours per day, up from 2.8 hours per day in 2015. Internet usage on PCs, in contrast, was flat at 2.2 hours per day. Meanwhile, Facebook and Google continue to be the top referrers to publishers, and increasingly consumers’ feeds are the main place media is discovered. With products like Facebook Instant Articles and Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages, both made generally available last year, the feed is becoming the place where media is actually consumed. For publishers, getting your mobile strategy right has never been more important — particularly on Facebook, which now has nearly 2 billion users. Facebook, however, is eager to keep users within its walled garden and has devoted armies of engineers to build the most compelling feed in technology. That feed needs content, and publishers have looked to leverage Facebook’s massive scale to boost readership, subscriptions, and traffic back to their sites. Both Facebook’s Instant Articles and Google’s AMP offer ways for publishers to form one-on-one relationships with consumers. For publishers wracked by layoffs and falling revenues, this means broad exposure and easier ways to form a direct connection to readers. The approach hasn’t worked for all publishers — a number have dropped out of Facebook’s program following disappointments. But other publishers have found some promising tactics for expanding their readership using Instant Articles: 1. Teasing content. German news tabloid Bild has used IA as a means to tease free content and boost subscriptions. In January, the publisher began using IA ad spots to promote Bild Plus, a premium version of the title that costs $10.58 a month. Bild started out putting just 20 percent of its free content on IA but now puts all of it there as a funnel for Bild Plus subscriptions. Similarly, advertisers can use Canvas – sort of an IA for advertisers – to tease content that users will have to go off Facebook to see. They can link to mobile wallet passes or deep-link to app or web content, driving consumers into owned mobile channels. Bild isn’t the only publisher to take this approach. Slate has realized Facebook traffic is fickle and has sought to use it as a marketing vehicle for its site. At the same time, the brand has expanded its offering of podcasts, which tends to make readers more loyal and more likely to subscribe to Slate Plus, a similar service to Bild Plus, which costs $5 a month. 2. Reducing friction to access content. Another lesson from Bild is to use as few steps as possible if you’re trying to get a signup. Bild cut the process from nine steps to three. Similarly, The Huffington Post increased email newsletter subscriptions using Facebook’s “call-to-action” feature, which makes it easy for consumers to subscribe with the click of a button — they don’t even have to enter their email addresses since it autopopulates in Facebook. In just three months, IA accounted for 29 percent of HuffPost Morning Email signups. 3. Providing utility. How do you keep readers thumbing through one window after another on Canvas until they are ready to jump off the feed and visit your website? When Business Insider launched Insider, its lifestyle spinoff, the publisher quickly realized that while Facebook gets attention, what really gets readers to stay on the site is a service component. For instance, instead of running a story about a great dish at a restaurant, Insider now features videos on how to make a similar dish at home. The site also houses more long-tail content like Insider Cheese, which features articles about cheese and attracts readers on Facebook. 4. Using calls to action. Beginning in early April of this year, Facebook let publishers put calls to action in Instant Articles. Now publishers can include prompts to join email newsletters, like their Page. One pilot user, Slate, reported that an email signup CTA unit accounted for 41 percent of its total email list growth over the past two months. Other enhancements are on the horizon. Facebook says it is currently testing a free trial CTA unit and a mobile app install CTA unit with a small group of publishers. Publishers can also take advantage of user-level app and website data to target ads to Facebook users that look like their most loyal readers. 5. Experimenting with Messenger bots. Influenced by China’s e-commerce platform WeChat, Facebook is eager to get advertisers to use Messenger. Customers can order a bouquet from 1-800-Flowers or a pie from Pizza Hut directly from Messenger. For publishers, there are few opportunities here so far because Facebook has been stingy with approvals, but The Wall Street Journal, CNN, and weather app Poncho all use Messenger bots to connect with their readers. The WSJ, for instance, uses Messenger to offer a Morning Briefing for readers with the top headlines of the day. Pragmatic publishers know that Facebook isn’t the ideal place to form a one-to-one connection with consumers. However, they can’t ignore Facebook either. The social network keeps evolving to enable stronger brand-consumer interactions. Erin Hintz is CMO at Urban Airship.

If this turns out to be accurate, the Pixel XL 2 will be a powerful flagship all around.  ( GFXBench ) The much rumored Google Pixel XL 2 has just surfaced on GFXBench, revealing its core specifications to confirm it will be a powerful flagship. Google started releasing two flagship smartphones at once in recent years and in 2016 it moved from the Nexus branding to the Pixel one, launching the Pixel and Pixel XL. The company is expected to stick to the Pixel branding from now on and the purported Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 are already making waves ahead of their expected debut later this year. Rumors also hinted at a Pixel 2 XXL, which would be the largest of the bunch. A slew of leaks and reports hint at powerful specifications for the upcoming flagships and a new GFXBench listing now reveals what the larger flagship will bring to the table. Google Pixel XL 2 Specs On GFXBench German publication WinFuture spotted the Pixel XL 2 on the GFXBench database, listed with a number of core specifications. According to the benchmark listing, the Pixel XL 2 will sport a 5.6-inch display with an odd resolution of 2,560 x 1,312 pixels, which could translate to an 18:9 aspect ratio like the LG G6. If it's tall and slim, it could resemble the Samsung Galaxy S8, which has an 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The listing further reveals that the Google Pixel XL 2 will pack the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor under the hood, gunning at 2.4 GHz and paired with 4 GB of RAM and Adreno 540 graphics. The smartphone will apparently come with 128 GB of native storage space. Other specs include a 12-megapixel main camera and a 7-megapixel selfie cam, both with 4K video recording capabilities. Benchmarks Accuracy It is worth pointing out here that benchmarks can offer valuable hints about what's in the mix, but they may not always turn out to be spot on. In some cases, benchmarks list the specifications of the prototypes they're testing, which may or may not coincide with the final product. For instance, although the benchmark listing for the Pixel XL 2 mentions the Snapdragon 835 processor, it wouldn't be too surprising to see the smartphone boast the upcoming Snapdragon 836 chipset. The processor has already been rumored to fire up the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 expected later this year, and possibly the upcoming LG V30. On the other hand, it's also possible that the Snapdragon 836 will be exclusive to the Galaxy Note 8 for a while, which would leave the Pixel XL 2 with the Snapdragon 835. The Google Pixel 2 family of smartphones will serve as launch vehicles for the new Android 8.0 O (likely Oreo), so Google will likely go all in with the hardware specs as well. The Pixel XL 2 should go head to head with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, the iPhone 8 Plus, and other powerful flagships of comparable size. With no official news available at this point, however, it's highly recommended to take all rumors and leaks, including this benchmark listing, with a hefty grain of salt. As always, we'll make sure to keep you in the loop as soon as more information becomes available. TAG Google, Pixel XL 2, Android Smartphones, GFXBench © 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Founded by clinical psychologist Samuel West, the museum that opened on June 7 to the public has over 70 failed products and services from around the world. "We know that 80 to 90 percent of innovation projects, they fail and you never read about them, you don't see them, people don't talk about them. And if there's anything we can do from these failures, it's learn from them," West told CBS News. The list has Nokia "N-gage" device, Orbitoclast Lobotomy (medical instrument), Harley-Davidson Perfume, Kodak Digital Camera, Sony Betamax and Lego Fiber Optics, among others, the information available on the Museum of Failure website stated. Also read: Nokia Active Wireless, Wired Earphones Revealed Before Smartphone Launch in India Developed and marketed by Apple Inc starting 1987, Newton was one of the first personal digital assistants to feature handwriting recognition. Apple shipped the first devices in 1993. Initially considered as innovative, Apple founder Steve Jobs directed the company to stop the production of Apple Newton devices in 1998. According to reports, Newton devices ran on a proprietary operating system called Newton OS. The high price and early problems with its handwriting recognition feature limited its sales. Google Glass, an eye-wearable device, created a storm when the company handed over a prototype to a few "Glass Explorers" in 2013 for $1,500. The optical head-mounted display became available to public in May 2014 but was discontinued in 2015 owing to privacy and safety concerns. The device, however, is now gaining momentum in the medical industry. Nokia made "N-Gage" mobile device and handheld game system that ran on Series 60 platform on Symbian OS. The device, released in October 2003, was discontinued two years later. "N-Gage" suffered from a poor gaming library. The Museum of Failure is open to the public in downtown Helsingborg.

Startups were nominated by partners from the Google for Entrepreneurs’s North American Tech Hub Network and hand-picked by Google based on traction leading their industry and demonstrating significant product adoption. Industries represented included: artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, B2B, and health and wellness. The startups pitched to a group of investors including Steve Case of Revolution, Bedy Yang of 500 Startups and Di-Ann Eisnor of Waze and a few hundred people. Meet the 13 startups Carbon Robotics (San Francisco, California) Highly intelligent and easily programmable robotic arm that automates manufacturing tasks. CareAcademy (Boston, Massachusetts)  Online education platform that teaches caregivers to provide safe, high quality care to older adults. GreenLight Medical (Nashville, Tennessee)  Cloud software that accelerates and optimizes decision–making for medical technology procurement. IdealSpot (Austin, Texas)  Mapping tool that matches brick-and-mortar businesses to their ideal locations by mapping local demand for their product or service. Keatext (Montreal, Québec)  AI technology that boosts customer satisfaction using insights from customers’ online comments. Peanut Butter (Chicago, Illinois)  Platform to administer student loan assistance programs so employers can attract, retain, and engage college-educated talent without increasing HR staff or investing in additional systems. (Note: 2016 Startup of the Year finalist). Read more about how Peanut Butter attracts talent through loan assistance Pig.gi (Mexico City, Mexico)  An app that delivers free internet access in emerging markets by providing users with data credits when they interact with sponsored brand content on a phone lock screen. Pilotly (Oakland, California)  Platform that enables content creators to quickly gather feedback from target audiences, generating insights to help inform creative, marketing, and distribution strategy. PRSONAS (Durham, North Carolina)  Holograms that scale the 1:1 human user experience and analyze customer engagements. Stackfolio (Atlanta, Georgia)  Online marketplace for loan trading, powered by a data research platform to help institutions make sophisticated trading decisions. Step One Foods (Minneapolis, Minnesota) Physician-formulated foods for healthier eating, packaged into easy, single-serve “doses.” TritonWear (Waterloo, Ontario) Advanced wearable sports technology that provides accurate real-time data in training and prescriptive feedback over time to improve athlete performance. Waymark (Detroit, Michigan)  An art and technology company that offers smart marketing tools for businesses to build high-quality marketing and digital ads in under 10 seconds. The People’s Choice Award The crowd was able to participate in the excitement and were able to choose their favorite. In the end, the audience gave the People’s Choice Award to Waymark from Detroit. Waymark’s platform can create a new video advertisement for your company in just ten seconds by leveraging your existing social accounts photos. Each video is unique in that the application uses machine learning to prevent duplicated content. I was very impressed with the quality of the video ad produced and feel like it could really help a lot of small business owners who aren’t as tech savvy when it comes to creating a commercial quality video. Steve Case lobbed a question about the defensibility of the application as companies like Facebook might be able to launch similar features, but the team did not feel it was an immediate concern. Animoto could be another possible competitor to this product as they too have a platform for creating unique videos on the fly as well, but don’t that the creative ad component for small businesses. Steve Case at Google Demo Day 2017, San Francisco The Judge’s Favorite The judges favorite was Stackfolio from Tech Square Labs in Atlanta. During their presentation, Stackfolio shared some extremely impressive traction in the banking industry in a very short period of time, and the judges noticed. Steve Case had this to say: “[Stackfolio] is a compelling idea, with a lot of traction, and it’s a reminder that there are great things happening, particular in the fintech sector in Atlanta.” The excitement didn’t end there. Allen Nance of Tech Square Labs committed $150,000 to the judges favorite and Steve Case took an interest in the company saying he would take on 20 percent of whatever Stackfolio plans to raise in their current fundraising round. Case also gave all 13 startup companies something to strive for as he offered them all a $100,000 investment in their round if they were to raise at least $1 million dollars within 100 days. Not bad.

On Thursday the Japanese group said it would buy U.S. robot-maker Boston Dynamics for an undisclosed amount from Google’s parent company. That’s not surprising, given SoftBank’s boss Masayoshi Son’s focus on smart robotics as one of three key future trends, alongside artificial intelligence and the internet of things. He may have got a decent deal, too, given Alphabet’s difficulties with Boston. The seller, then known as Google, bought Boston Dynamics in 2013, as part of an unfocused acquisition spree in robotics. The unit, originally a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pioneered robots that could run like animals. No price was disclosed then either, although one analyst last year estimated the takeover probably cost about $60 million. Terrifying appearance By early 2016, however, Bloomberg reported that Alphabet was looking to offload the business, concerned both about the length of investment required, and about potential public reactions to the terrifying appearance of Boston Dynamics herd of quadrupeds and bipeds. Given how long this asset has been on the block, it would not be surprising if SoftBank secured a good price. The exact sum may never be clear, but if the business ends up in SoftBank’s Vision Fund, that would suggest SoftBank has paid more than $100 million. That is the threshold above which the $100 billion technology investment fund gets first refusal on any deal. The fund, however, is not obliged to buy. SoftBank’s cutesy android, Pepper, is an unlikely stable mate for Boston’s creations the latest of which was described by the Guardian as like Terminator riding on a hoverboard, and by the company’s own founder, Marc Raibert, as nightmare-inducing. But both attest to Mr. Son’s conviction about robots, which he predicts will outnumber humans within three decades. It is striking too, that in this niche at least, Mr. Son is ready to take a braver view than his counterparts in California. (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

But once you get inside, then you’re on your own. And if it’s a huge station, then good luck. But it looks like the navigation app is testing out including subway station layouts as well, as a redditor has posted an image which shows the New York Pennsylvania Station layout. It’s not an official announcement yet so this is probably something that Google Maps is still testing out so don’t go looking for subway station layouts just yet. But some users have also reported that they have been seeing these additions to their own Google Maps, from the Washington D.C subway to Japan, specifically Tokyo Central, Yokohama, and Osaka. And if you’ve been to Japan, you know just how much you will need a subway layout. Hopefully, when they do finally roll it out, it would be as detailed and as helpful as the actual places you see in Google Maps. Maneuvering your way in and out of a subway station sounds simple enough but not if it’s like a maze inside and if you’re not familiar and/or in a hurry. Google is probably seeing how people react to it before officially making an announcement. Again, don’t look for it in your Google Maps just yet. But if you’re one of the few that have it, probably as part of a “soak test” from Google, what do you think?

Bloomberg photo by David Paul Morris   Elizabeth Dwoskin The Washington Post     SAN JOSE, Calif. -- In 2011, Apple became the first company to place artificial intelligence in the pockets of millions of consumers when the firm's co-founder Steve Jobs launched the voice assistant Siri on the iPhone. Eight years later, the technology giant is struggling to find its voice in AI. Analysts say the question of whether Apple can succeed in building great artificial intelligence products is as fundamental to the company's next decade as the iPhone was to its previous one. But the tech giant faces a formidable dilemma because the nature of artificial intelligence pushes Apple far out of its comfort zone in sleekly-designed hardware and services. AI programming demands a level of data collection and mining that is at odds with Apple's rigorous approach to privacy, as well as its positioning as a company that doesn't profile consumers. Moreover, Apple's long-standing penchant for secrecy has made the company less desirable in the eyes of potential star recruits, who hail from the country's top computer science departments and are attracted to companies that publish research. "Artificial intelligence is not in Apple's DNA," said venture capitalist and Apple analyst Steve Munster. "They understand that in the future, every company is going to become an AI company, and they are in a particularly tough spot." At Apple's annual developer's conference on Monday -- the same event where Jobs introduced Siri -- the company's efforts to become an AI powerhouse were on display as executives launched a new stand-alone smart speaker and touted features meant to boost Siri's chops and to power AI applications on Apple products. "Machine learning" -- an AI buzzword that describes a form of ultrafast, complex computer data analysis and statistical modeling -- was repeated throughout the 2.5 hour presentation, delivered to an audience of roughly 6,000 developers here. Siri will now use machine learning to predict the times of a morning commute -- or scan the travel news as you are reading it on the company's Safari browser and then suggest related activities, such as booking a reservation. She will use machine learning to talk with you and help you sort through music through a new $349 home automation device, HomePod. She will automatically organize your photos into albums, like "2nd Anniversary," without you giving her any context about the pictures. There was even a new software tool kit, CoreML, that will allow for faster processing of large amounts of data collected during machine learning applications. (It's six times faster than Google's rival AI processor, an executive quipped). But Monday's announcements come as other technology companies have released similar innovations and have already spent billions on the burgeoning AI arms race. Many are placing their bets on artificial intelligence, ranging from software that one day may be smart enough to chat back and forth like a human, or computer vision that identifies real-world objects so well it can power the first fully-functioning self-driving car. That has put Apple in the disadvantaged position of trying to lead in an area where it has fallen behind -- and where the effort cuts against the core aspects of the company's secretive culture. "This is a substantial shift for Apple," said Daniel Gross, a former executive who focused on artificial intelligence. "The internal focus is on building great products, not publishing papers." Ten years after launching the iPhone, Apple is on the hunt for another blockbuster product that can take its place. Sales of the iPhone propelled Apple to become the most valuable company in the world and still account for more than half of the company's revenues, which were $215.6 billion in 2016. But last year, purchases of the company's iconic smartphone dropped for the first time, suggesting that the market for high-end smartphones is finally saturated. "The difference between last year's iPhone and this year's iPhone is going to be much smaller than the difference between the first and second iterations of the iPhone. ... So that s-curve is starting to flatten out," said Benedict Evans, a mobile expert and partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, using an industry term for exponential increases in innovation. "Then you have the next transformative technology, that isn't here yet." Apple did not respond to repeated requests for interviews and comment. Apple's launch of HomePod, which will go for sale for $349 later this year, comes several years after Amazon and Google released their own automation devices, the Echo and the Google Home, which send consumers' spoken queries back to their servers in California for analysis. Google, Tesla, Uber, and others have been testing self-driving vehicles on public roadways for several years; Apple received its first permit to begin testing just two months ago. Before Monday's updates, the Siri assistant was still mostly a glorified web search that could tell the occasional pre-programmed joke. Now Apple is racing to catch up. Last October, the company hired Russ Salakhutdinov, a Carnegie Mellon professor whose expertise is in an area of artificial intelligence known as "deep" or "unsupervised" learning, a complex branch of machine learning in which computers are trained to replicate the way the brain's neurons fire when they recognize objects or speech. Salakhutdinov is a protégé of Geoffrey Hinton, perhaps the world's top researcher in this area. Like Salakhutdinov, who divides his time between Carnegie Mellon and Apple, Hinton divides his time between Google and the University of Toronto. Building ties to academic superstars not only helps to improve products, but becomes a key recruiting tool, said Richard Zemel, director of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a professor specializing in machine learning at the University of Toronto. "You used to not see people with Apple name badges at conferences, and now you do," Zemel said. In December, Apple presented and published its first academic paper in artificial intelligence at an industry conference. Another paper has been accepted to a prestigious computer vision conference and will be published in July, Salakhutdinov said in an interview. Salakhutdinov said he was not authorized to discuss his work at Apple in any detail. Zemel, who told Bloomberg two years ago that Apple was "off the scale" in terms of secrecy, and that such secrecy was keeping them out of loop on major developments in the field, now said that the Cupertino giant was "making some changes." "But it's going to take some work," he added. Researchers at elite universities said in interviews that Apple was still not the top choice for their computer science graduates -- Google, Facebook, and Amazon were by far the top picks -- but that the company was moving up in the rankings. Apple's forays into AI have also been slower than its peers because it's been reluctant to embrace the data-mining practices of rivals Google and Facebook, experts said. The company has spent considerable resources building additional layers of privacy when it did so. Unlike Google and Facebook, which are primarily advertising companies that collect massive amounts of intimate data to profile their users, Apple believes in limiting the amount of user data it collects. At a previous developer's conference, executives bragged that the company did not build user profiles. Tim Cook has positioned the company as the anti-Google. But that stance against data collection becomes a problem if you are building artificial intelligence, researchers say. A home device must collect and analyze people's speech in order to improve the way the device can speak to humans, for example. For Siri to be smart, she needs to collect and interpret data from other applications, such as your calendar, your restaurant reservations, and, now, your browsing. Last year, as Apple began to embrace artificial intelligence on the iPhone, the company undertook a large privacy protection project. The project took an academic concept called differential privacy and applied it to AI applications on the iPhone. Differential privacy works by inserting noise -- or bad information -- into good data in order to confuse outsiders who might try to hone in on an individual's records. For example, in order for Apple software to group the photos of your dog into a single album, it needs to collect many photos of your dogs. Apple collects those images, but not before encrypting the data in them and then scrambling that data with other data, so that if anyone tried to recover the original data set they wouldn't know what was tied to a single user, the company claims. This technique is considered a stronger privacy protection than other methods, such as using mathematical formulas to render user profiles anonymous. Apple's focus on privacy may have slowed the company down in terms of building some products, Gross said, but the trade-off would be consumer trust. "Apple is dousing itself with an extra piece of really hard science, and doing so to try and preserve your privacy," he said. "I think Google and Facebook will have to answer to world where a similar product that is offered is more privacy-preserving." Munster pointed out that no tech company has a huge lead on artificial intelligence yet. "The bad news is that Apple is behind," he said. "The good news is that if we look at how AI is going to impact the world, it's still early days -- there is plenty of time to catch up."

Google family groups make it easy to share photos, calendars, Keep, YouTube TV, and more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 12:06pm PDTMay 23, 2017 90 Plus 1 on G+ 96 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares236 Google News Google has added a number of family-oriented features in recent years, and now it's bringing it all together under "family groups." This feature plugs into family sharing for YouTube TV, Google Play Family Library, and adds easy family sharing to a few other Google services. Setting up a family group is easy, but there are a few restrictions. To set up a family group, just head to the Google family page. You might already have a family set up if you've used YouTube TV of Google Play Family Library. If not, you can create and manage one from there. Google Keep and Photos are included by default, but nothing is shared automatically. These services simply get a handy link to share notes or photos with all members of the family group. Some setup is required for Google Play Family Library, Play Music family plans, YouTube TV, Google Calendar, and Family Link. The page has links to all those. Families can have as many as six members (including you), and you can only be in one Google family group at a time. Make sure you know what you're getting into before joining someone's family group—you can only change your family group membership once every 12 months. Note, family features for Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Photos are only available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.

It'll probably get support in half a year or so (speculating) if at all. Justin Osborne Doubtful. They haven't added Play Family Sharing... so I can't share movies/music/apps/etc with my wife. Justin Osborne For shame, Google, for shame. Super annoying. ktrain I am struggling to understand why Google should feel any need to make this available to G Suite customers. This is a consumer feature. I get that some families with tech saavy folks use G Suite to: Manage people shouldn't have been on Google in the first place because of To spy on your kids emails Because you want to help out someone who is seriously tech challenge. This is probably .001% of all the paid G Suite licenses. Google's G Suite PMs have way hotter topics for enterprise clients, IE whitelisting/blacklisting OAuth apps, expanding DLP functionality in Mail/Drive and launching Google Chat. Justin Osborne Because I've had Google Apps for over 10 years. When I joined if I had known what I know now, sure, I'd have used another Google account. You can just go back now, after you have 10+ years of data on your account! Anthrox G Suite has a different set of requirements for business software that is built for uptime over features. im hoping over time they will allow for domain on families. maybe also move free g suite accounts over to families accounts will see where they go with this there is still a lot of integration going on DarenTx Yes. This. Let me migrate my G Suite accounts to Family Groups without losing my stuff or changing my login. BinaryTB Google Play Music family plan Google Play Family Library Google Fi Giving Google $$ for G Suite, but not allowed to give them more for the above. Thanks Google. Stephen Cornwell It's for families. G-Suite is for businesses. DarenTx But when I signed up for G Suite it wasn't just for businesses. Now that the marketing of these accounts has changed give me a way to migrate to Google Family Groups. Chris It was originally marketed as being great for families. So My entire family is on G Suites. But we can't share apps through the family sharing, we can't share a Google Play Music family plan, we can't share Google TV accounts as advertised. The Music and TV are both something that I'm more than happy to pay for, but can't so I use competing services now. That alone is $50/month from me that Google isn't getting. Not to mention, the Google Home that I bought was sent back because it doesn't support my account. And at this point, I can't migrate my family back to standard Google accounts because all of our purchases are tied to these G Suite accounts. Google needs to get their shit together on this issue. billracine That seems to be the standard for everything worth google. mondeca Is the Calendar feature new? I clicked on the link, and it just took me to the usual Calendar view. I didn't see anything about Family groups. Something to roll out soon? James Doyle It said it added a new Calendar to your view called "Family". It did for me when I signed up. Everyone in the family group can see (and presumably edit) the Family calendar. mondeca That makes sense, but I don't have a Family calendar. Jonathan Berry Same for me. I already have a family group from Google Play Music, so I wonder if the creation of the Family calendar is not getting triggered for existing accounts. Mimi Same problem here. Hoping the family calendar for existing customers gets rolled out soon, or that we at least get the option of having one added. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Same here. I have a family group for they play store, but I don't see an option for the family calendar. Must not have rolled out to all yet. SVem26 Fantastic.. A few things to make this better MANAGEMENT -- Centralized app/Page to manage everything Family related ( The family Link app that was recently released is a good place or in the Google settings app) DRIVE -- Family settings for Drive storage.. e.g. Sharing the upgraded storage quota with the family group MUSIC -- Ability to share uploaded music with the whole family in Play Music MAPS -- Option of Location sharing for entire family (opt-in) FIND MY DEVICE -- Option to track locations of all devices of all members (opt-in) Other possible enhancements -- Group communication through Allo,Duo as a readily available option, Shared Wallet balance,etc Anthon Williamson If it would let me have access to their Chrome Remote Desktop. Opt-in of course. Then it would be the only tool I need for personal remote access. Everything else we be business use. SVem26 Ah yes.. Great idea..

So having this will help Paul_Werner Also, the Shared Family Payment Method should allow you to require purchase approvals for people above 18 too. Just because I want to add in a family member doesn't mean I want to allow them to make all the purchases they want using my card.

I'm not seeing it on my account. Navarr Barnier > You can only set up a family group with a personal Google Account, not a G Suite account makapav This is just another skunk-work half-brained idea to come out of someone's free time that will wither away without real-world use-cases just like the other Google Family Plan/Program that was launched a couple of months ago. Of course, this will not tie into the Google WiFi family settings controls and descriptions, or managing other Google accounts or God-forbid the grocery list that Google Home creates in the Google Express app. This whole thing was created to meet some random guy's dilemma. All this while, Google Photos does not recognize the groups you have already created in your Contacts app when choosing a target to share pictures. Anthrox give it some time today is the first lunch of software outside of play and play music. software is complex you have many different teams with different goals the family support might be coming after other feature they need to do first makapav Humbug excuses.

The company is rumored to launch the third Pixel device this year, details about which were mostly sketchy till now, although by most accounts, it was being called a larger device, somewhat even larger than the Pixel XL, with many reports calling it the Pixel XL 2. But, new details emerged about the Pixel XL 2 in a GFXBench listing Friday. Despite the name, which is similar to the 2016 Pixel XL device, chances are that this is still third Pixel device, since the size of the display is peculiar – the listing states that the Google Pixel XL 2 will have a 5.6-inch display, which is mid-way between the 5-inch expected flagship size and 6-inch XL variant size. Read: Google Pixel 2: Launch Of 3 Devices In 2017 Confirmed By Android Open Source Project The Google Pixel phone is displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, Oct. 4, 2016. Photo: Reuters/Beck Diefenbach The possible scenarios are: Google has shrunk the Google XL display size to 5.6-inch, so the company is launching Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 smartphones. There is indeed a third variant, which the company is calling the Pixel XL 2. Whatever be the case, the device would pose as a major rival to the soon-to-be-released Apple’s iPhone 8 and the recently released Samsung Galaxy S8, which brings us to the display resolution — since the Samsung Galaxy S8 is has a high-resolution edge-to-edge display and the iPhone 8 is rumored to have one, the expectation is that Google too, endows its flagship with a similar one. According to the listing, the Google Pixel XL 2 has a 2560 x 1312p display, which, when you calculate the aspect ratio, comes to 18:9. This strengthens the likelihood that the device could have a display with either very thin edges like the LG G6 or an edge-to-edge one, like the S8. The former seems more probable since LG is rumored to be supplying the curved panels for the Google Pixel 2017 smartphones. The listing also mentions a Qualcomm octa-core CPU with ARM v8 processor architecture. The device was earlier expected to have a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, but according to what the listing indicates, it might have an octa-core Snapdragon 836, which is even faster and more efficient than the 835 and is rumored to be featured on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.Furthermore, the listing states that the device will have 4GB RAM and 128GB onboard memory, which will make it a pretty powerful device. Read: Pixel 2 News: Google May Invest $880 Million In LG Display To Secure OLED Panels For 2017 Flagship One more feature that has been revealed is the device’s 12-megapixe camera, capable of shooting high-resolution UHD 4K videos. The Google Pixel’s has been called the best smartphone camera of 2016 by camera benchmarking site DxOmark, and the listing has revealed that Google is aiming to build on the 2016 Pixel series’ success by endowing its 2017 flagships with an even more powerful camera. Finally, one of the most awaited features of Google Pixel 1 is Android O, the next iteration of Android, which is expected to launch alongside it.

By Mike Elgan Contributing Columnist, Computerworld | Jun 10, 2017 3:49 AM PT Credit: Thinkstock More like this Why your next business phone will be an Amazon Echo Samsung unveils Bixby voice assistant for upcoming Galaxy S8 Why Google A.I. is the last user interface Video XYZ da Vinci Jr. 2.0 Mix 3D printer timelapse Everybody talks about (and often to) the Big Four virtual assistants — Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant. But many other companies are working on virtual assistants, too. Huawei is working on a virtual assistant for the Chinese market. Samsung offers Bixby on its Galaxy S8 or S8+ smartphones. Voice recognition giant Nuance offers an enterprise ready virtual assistant called Nina, which specializes in knowing the limits of A.I. and kicking queries over to a team of human assistants when necessary. Nuance this month announced a Nina "skill" on Amazon's Alexa platform. European telecom Orange offers a virtual assistant called Djingo. A french startup is building an x.ai-like meeting scheduling virtual assistant called Julie Desk. And noHold makes a highly customizable virtual assistant called Albert. There are dozens of others. The problem with choice in voice-based virtual assistants is that you have to choose one and stick with it. And you shouldn't have to. The memorize-the-magic-words option "You should be able to tell Alexa, 'Ask Siri'," Amazon senior vice president of devices, David Limp, said at a conference this week. Limp's sketchy vision for how virtual assistants should work together is wrong in three ways. First, he imagines the user telling one all-purpose virtual assistant to "ask" another specific all-purpose virtual assistant. In this imagining, Apple would create a Siri "skill" and become an adjunct to the Alexa platform, something that's inconceivable. Apple maintains Siri to provide an interface feature to Apple hardware like iPhones, iPads, Apple TV and Macs -- not to provide benefits to Amazon Echo users. Siri will never be an Alexa "skill." Second, this is how "skills" work on Alexa, and it's fatally flawed. In order to use "skills," the user has to specify the service, then say the magic words that enable that "skill" to produce the desired result. Alexa has thousands of skills. But Amazon is relying on users to somehow find skills and memorize their commands. This is why most "skills" are barely used at all. Third, the only successful models for the future of virtual assistants that work together is either branding awareness (an assistant functions as part of a wider range of features or another product) or direct subscription payments. Current all-purpose assistants are monetized through hardware sales and advertising revenue. The idea that virtual assistants of the future will work like Alexa's "skills" is very unlikely. Limp's scenario is one of several suggesting that virtual assistants need to work together. The open-source option Playground Global founder and CEO Andy Rubin founded both Danger and Android, and ran Android for Google for years. Now he's got a billion-dollar startup called Essential that recently announced a line of smartphones and other devices. One of those devices is a virtual assistant appliance called Essential Home, which Rubin says should run Siri, Alexa, Google's Assistant or any virtual assistant customers want to use. The virtual assistant appliance is for consumers, but the concept could be applied to businesses as well. The model is: We build the virtual assistant appliance hardware, but you (the customer) figure out which virtual assistant to put on it. Based on what Rubin has said, he has no solution to the problem of getting virtual assistants to work with each other, only to get existing virtual assistants to work with his own Home device. He's offering choice, but the actual decision is left to the user. The bring-your-own-assistant option Dennis Mortensen is the CEO and founder of x.ai, which makes a virtual assistant that schedules meetings via email. Mortensen envisions the coming age of BYOA — Bring Your Own Assistant. In his model, the value of each employee or executive in the future will be not only based on their skills, experience and knowledge, but also on the quality of the virtual assistants they use and their skill in using them. In other words, virtual assistants used in business will not be developed or mandated by the company, but chosen by the employee and carried from one job to the next. This vision is almost certainly accurate, although I would also imagine that companies will deploy and even build their own assistants to add to those chosen and used by employees. Mortensen also doesn't address the core problem: How do you choose which assistant to use, or decide which module, plug-in or "skill" is best? The choose-it-for-me option It's clear that the major tech companies -- Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Samsung and others -- are working on general purpose virtual assistant services and that their strategy is to open their platforms to third-party add-ons. It's equally clear that if each add-on has to be discovered and conjured up individually, this entire approach is dead in the water. Even smartphone apps, which hold the advantage of reminding the user with an icon and providing visual interface reminders, are far too difficult to discover and remember to use. The virtual assistant equivalent of apps -- plug-ins or add-ons that are invisible and require memorization (command-line interfaces) -- simply won't be used. And as a result, the incentive to even create them in the first place won't exist. The obvious solution is for the general-purpose virtual assistant to select the app for the user. Right now, virtual assistants make decisions about which source of information to use. For example, when you ask for the weather, it won't check your calendar. It will recognize the category of query and reach out to whatever weather service the assistant is hard-wired to use. Virtual assistants should work initially like apps, then later not at all like apps. At first individual users should find, and in some cases pay for or subscribe to, specific virtual assistant services such as a meeting scheduler or a flight-booking add-ons. Once installed, however, the user of those services should be the virtual assistant, not the human. It should be possible, in fact, to install or subscribe to several flight-booking add-ons. Later, when you want to fly somewhere, you should tell your assistant, "book me a flight to Chicago next Wednesday," and the assistant itself should query all the add-ons to arrive at the best price or best combination of cost, travel time, flight schedule, airline carrier and other factors. Although this general approach is obvious, it's not obvious that current virtual assistant artificial intelligence is up to the job yet. We may have to wait a few years. But when it does arrive, we'll find ourselves in Mortensen's BYOA world, where employees will choose the vertical assistants or assistant plug-ins. Employees will choose them, but the assistants will use them. Related: Computer Hardware Artificial Intelligence Emerging Technology Mike Elgan writes about technology and tech culture.

SoftBank buys Alphabet's robot maker | Bangkok Post: business News Business Video Photos Opinion Lifestyle Auto Jobs Property Travel Learning Tech More BUSINESS Log in Sign up Web search MENU Search Switch Archive E-PAPER SIGN IN About E-Paper Subscribe Free Trial Report problem Contact us Business homepage Business news Telecom Finance Tourism & transport Find company & suppliers Exchange rates More World Gold prices IT Auto Property Business > World SoftBank buys Alphabet's robot maker Also agrees to acquire Japanese bipedal robotics company Schaft as part of the deal 10 Jun 2017 at 11:35 2,980 viewed0 comments NEWSPAPER SECTION: BUSINESS | WRITER: BLOOMBERG NEWS Boston Dynamics' Spot robot mingles with the crowd at the TED Conference in Vancouver, Canada on April 25, 2017. - + SoftBank Group Corp is taking over Google parent Alphabet Inc's robot dreams, buying Boston Dynamics to pursue a future when more machines intermingle with humans. As part of the transaction with Alphabet, SoftBank also agreed to buy Japanese bipedal robotics company Schaft. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Boston Dynamics, bought by Google in 2013 as part of a robotics acquisitions spree, made its name with a series of two- and four-legged machines that are able to stay upright even when pushed or traversing rocky terrain. Videos of the robots, known for their animal-like movements, are popular on YouTube. While SoftBank has already made investments in robotics, those efforts have yet to deliver hit products or pay off. That may change with this new deal. "Boston Dynamics is seen as the best in the world," said Tomotaka Takahashi, a University of Tokyo associate professor and the founder of Robo Garage Co. "While there might be some concerns whether it might be difficult to work with the 'geniuses' at Boston Dynamics, he said "it will be interesting to see what they come up with when they're free to conduct research." It wasn't clear whether Boston Dynamics would remain within SoftBank, a Tokyo-based telecommunications and tech investment company, or become part of the Vision Fund, the $93 billion technology investment fund started by SoftBank founder, Masayoshi Son. The Vision Fund already has the right to acquire 25% of SoftBank's holdings in ARM Holdings Plc, OneWeb, US-based online lender Social Finance Inc and US chipmaker Nvidia Corp. This would be Son's second venture into robotics. In 2012, SoftBank acquired French company Aldebaran Robotics SA and two years later unveiled Pepper, a $1,600 humanoid promoted as the world's first robot endowed with emotions. Son envisioned building an ecosystem of apps that would let Pepper man storefronts as well as entertain people at home. But culture clashes between the Japan parent and French engineers as well as challenges of creating artificial intelligence capable of understanding natural language has left Pepper underwhelming and with lacklustre adoption limited to Japan. "SoftBank may not have struggled as much if they bought a better robotics company instead of Aldebaran,'' Takahashi said. The shares of SoftBank rose 7.4% in Tokyo, buoyed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's 13% jump in the US that boosted the value of SoftBank's stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant to $105.6 billion. "Typically, when Son makes a big acquisition, the markets are worried," said Tomoaki Kawasaki, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities Co. "If this deal goes through the Vision Fund, no one will fret about the impact on SoftBank's balance sheet." Alphabet decided to put the company up for sale earlier this year because it didn't anticipate a marketable product in the next few years, people familiar with the company's plans have said. Boston Dynamics was among the largest in a slew of robotics companies that Google bought in a short period. Before the acquisition, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company developed large, heavy robots mostly for potential military purposes, through research contracts with US government agencies. The acquisitions, orchestrated by former Android chief Andy Rubin, formed a hodge-podge unit inside the company, called Replicant internally. But the teams never cohered around a singular strategy, and Rubin left Google in 2014. "One of the challenges they've had is that the robotics don't scale as well for mass production," said Gene Munster, an analyst at Loup Ventures. "That's why they never fit with Google's model."

Showcasing material collected from 183 renowned cultural institutions across 42 countries including India, the digital project showcases 30,000 photographs, videos and other documents on what people wear, the craft of textiles, key fashion movements and the icons of haute couture. Kolkata’s Indian Museum, the country’s oldest museum with its rare collection of saris, shawls, skirts and kurtas from (1701 to 1991) has featured prominently in the exhibition under the section ‘textile traditions of India’. Tribal designs   Textiles having different motifs and designs from northeastern India (1850-1980), mainly collected during anthropological fieldwork, are on display as important cultural artefacts. A 19th century warrior cloth worn by the Nagas — a black and red wrap with a white band in the middle having painted human figures — signifies the number of heads taken by the person. Other unique cultural objects in the digital collection are the Pani Gamcha, a black cotton cloth with white stripes, used by the Meitei women in Manipur and the Kakat-Bandha, a narrow piece of yellow cotton cloth with embroidery work, used by the Bodo people. The tradition of Baluchari sari weaving is as old as modern Bengal itself, said Jayanta Sengupta, director of Indian Museum, Kolkata. The digital collection shows Baluchari saris dating back to 19th century, with some of the pieces from the Tagore family. With its origins in Murshidabad, the weaving tradition started from a village called Baluchar, which was submerged during a flood. Google’s project also details the time-consuming craft of Patola saris, traditionally woven by the Salvi community of Gujarat and the richly decorative brocades, typically woven on a drawloom. The brocade weavers from Banaras have historically had a rich repertoire, producing not only saris but also skirts, patkas, turbans and ornate costumes and furnishings since the 17th century for the Mughal court. Inside story Amit Sood, Director of Google Arts & Culture, described the mega virtual exhibition as a “world fashion exhibit” and urged people to browse and listen to stories about what they wore.   “You might be surprised to find out that your sari, jeans or the black dress in your wardrobe has a centuries-old story. What you wear is true culture and, more often than not, a piece of art,” he said. Global platform Google Art and Culture, an online platform launched by Google in 2011, lets users explore artworks, artefacts and more from over 1,000 museums, archives and organisation across the world. It now includes fashion. “What is interesting is that the exhibition at a very large scale captures style and fashion all over the world and Indian Museum is happy to be part of the worldwide collaboration,” Mr Sengupta said. The collections of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalay, Mumbai, are also on display. A rare books section on Indian textiles and clothing from the 19th and early 20th century and a section on attire of the 19th and early 20th Century Bombay Presidency from Dr Bhau Daji Lad Mumbai City Museum, Mumbai, may also interest the connoisseur of fashion.

Chrome Beta 60 adds new search widget, limits the Vibration API to combat malware ads, and more [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 8:10pm PDTJun 8, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 129 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares241 Applications Google News Update 1: 2017/06/10 10:37am PDT The new context menu and file picker are actually present in Chrome 59, albeit with more bugs. I'll leave them in this post because we haven't covered them before, but keep Article Contents 1 New search widget 2 No more vibrating ads 3 New context menu 4 New file picker 5 Other features 6 APK Download Chrome 59 was just released, which means Chrome 60 has graduated to beta status. This version includes a few interface changes, like a new context menu and file picker, as well as a new search widget. The Vibration API also has some new limitations to combat malware ads. Let's take a look. Update 1: 2017/06/10 10:37am PDT The new context menu and file picker are actually present in Chrome 59, albeit with more bugs. I'll leave them in this post because we haven't covered them before, but keep in mind they aren't new. End of Update New search widget We previously covered Chrome's new search widget, which was developed as a result of an anti-trust lawsuit Russia. Russian search company Yandex claimed that Google violated local competition rules, and the settlement required Google to develop a search widget that could change between search engines. At some point, this will replace the normal Google search widget for Android phones sold in Russia. It uses whatever search engine you have set in Chrome, and starting with version 57, Chrome supports almost any search engine you could want to use. It doesn't appear to have changed since we covered it in Chrome Dev 60. No more vibrating ads You've probably seen those fake full-screen malware ads before - the ones that vibrate your phone. This is possible thanks to the Vibration API introduced a few years ago. I'm sure someone thought that web games would be pretty cool with if they could vibrate your phone, but I've only ever seen it used by malicious advertisements. Starting with Chrome 60, pages will no longer be able to vibrate your device unless you tap on the page first. I still think the Vibration API should be removed entirely, or at least have to ask the user permission first (like camera access), but this is a step in the right direction. In a similar move, the beforeunload JavasScript function will only work if you have tapped on the page. This is also commonly used by malicious advertisements, to show an alert as you try to close the window/tab. New context menu If you're not aware, the 'context menu' is the name of the menu that appears when you long-press a link or image in Chrome for Android. Chrome 60 includes a fancy new context menu, but for now, it's disabled by default. You can turn it on by switching the #enable-custom-context-menu flag to 'Enabled.' So what's so great about this new menu? Not only does it have helpful icons next to each menu item, it has a tabbed interface if you select an image contained in a link. Take a look at the below screenshots:     From left to right: link and linked image in Chrome 59, link and linked image in Chrome 60 There aren't any new menu items, everything just looks cleaner. I like it. New file picker The context menu isn't the only interface element to get a facelift in Chrome 60. There's also a new photo/file picker, which appears when you try to upload a file to a webpage. Just like the context menu, this is hidden behind the #enable-new-photo-picker flag, and must be turned on manually (for now).   Left: File picker on Chrome 59; Right: File picker on Chrome 60 You can tell this is a bit unfinished - I imagine recent photos are supposed to appear on the new popup. Still, it's already an improvement from Chrome 59's picker. Other features As with every Chrome release, Chrome 60 includes several smaller changes that may go unnoticed by most users and/or developers. Here are a few of them: Google previously added support for the paymentRequest API to Chrome, which allowed sites to checkout using Android Pay on Android (I still haven't seen a real site that does this). This will be extended to other payment apps starting with Chrome 60, but apps have to add support for the API. Several non-standard animation functions, like WEBKIT_KEYFRAMES_RULE and WebKitTransitionEvent, have been removed. The WebUSB API is now enabled by default. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Peter You can enable the VibrationAPI changes in Chrome 59 via a flag which is handy. chrome://flags/#vibrate-requires-user-gesture Also same for the new file picker, although it seems quite broken. Launch the file picker, close it, then try to launch it again and it often doesn't work. YMMV. Sruly J I don't really deal with vibrating ads anymore (very rarely), but I'm more thrilled with this change than how Artem feels when he can go a week without experiencing #artemsluck. Jay It's amazing that those spammy malware sites have managed to avoid destruction for so long. I can't wait for the day.. Syukri Lajin I have never seen any website that uses the vibration API except for malwares. Until now, I thought they were using some kind of hack to get the phone vibrating. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I've only seen it used by ads. Oktawiusz Wieczorek I think sites like Facebook use the API for the notifications. So it is not entirely useless. Syukri Lajin Correct me if i'm wrong, but notification uses the notification api, everything related to vibrations is controlled by the OS, the browser simply trigger a notification, it doesn't need the vibration api. Oktawiusz Wieczorek Ok i'm probably wrong. Someone said that under the Chrome Adblocker Article but it seems he was wrong. So yeah the API is currently only for bs. Corbin Davenport You're correct, the notification and vibration APIs are separate. ethd The Jackbox Party Pack series of games uses it for haptic feedback for the buttons. While not required, it is a nice touch.

FeelThePoveR That was literally the only thing that I loved about the broken vibration motor in my phone. Richard Riker don't forget the dino game you get when no internet available (or through chrome://dino). It vibrates on game over :-P Gotmilo greatly needed .. especially since androidpolice blocked adblockers for their websites and i'm still getting popup ads with vibrations.... Jay Even if you've got acceptable ads enabled? needa I don't, and I never do. With or without adblocker. This site is pretty clean. You must have something else going on. On a side note. I started using Fair Adblocker last night. It gives you the standard google adverts, which you can tell it how many you want to see, and gets rid of the rest. You can even selectively get rid of things if you want. I also don't get the popup asking me to give them two cents a view. My1 now they just need to get rid of tracking. why not let the user add keywords or something for ads, so the user doesnt have to get tracked and for god's sake doesnt get haunted with ads for stuff you once bought for your mother needa This blocker has a toggle to block tracking adverts. My1 but since google ads tracks as well iirc wouldnt that immediately ax those ads right into oblivion as well? NeverrKnowsBest It's an issue with Disqus's ads on this site, I've experienced it too. I had them unblocked until it started happening to me. needa It's on your end. You probably have an extension that is telling it to do so. Or something along those lines. I use both Win and Android versions of Chrome to comment on Disqus quite a bit. NeverrKnowsBest No... It's not. Corbin has confirmed on another post that Disqus does this, and others have confirmed it too. I have tried it from my work PC that has no add ons, same issue. needa K. I have to wonder why I don't get them on my tech, or others, and you get them all the time... everywhere you go. Must be because I voted for Trump. NeverrKnowsBest I'm confused now, because you were in the other post, and you outright said you block the ads. So which is it? And I didn't say it happened to me all the time, but it happened in multiple places, at least a handful of times, and that's all I needed to justify my block at the time. needa • 7 days ago "I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another." http://disq.us/p/1j6tc9x needa • 7 days ago I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. http://disq.us/p/1j6sv03 needa I turn my blocker off every few weeks , for a few days, on the blog sites I frequent. I also don't have an ad blocker on mobile chrome. Pretty sure I touched base on this already in this very conversation. Dracono Not exactly, uBlock Origin on desktop and Brave Browser on mobile work just fine. Mahdi Use Adaway or if you don't want to root you can use DNS66 Nate Is the app shortcut for "New incognito tab" missing for anyone else? It's been gone for a while for me. boop ;) I've always had it. Using Chrome Stable and Canary Damodara Kovie [dkovie] Nice spoiler tag 😉 Nate I'm on the Beta.

Using Nova Launcher if that matters PI "Vibration API" No more Porn sites with Free Vibrator :D ChikuChakk They will still exploit it LoveHater Unless u touch that site , vibrator lol LoveHater Ok , I got it.It was there API, but it's now more restrictive . Carson Saldanha Why is there always two camera icons in the file picker menu? Willie Chalmers III Someone probably added a duplicate intent when implementing it. Carson Saldanha Yes, but it's been there for ages. It's present even on N. abqnm That search bar doesn't so much as search using the search engine in Chrome as it does just open a quick overlay of the Chrome omnibox on the screen. And it's incredibly awesome. It makes it one tap to open chrome, focus on the omnibox and launch the keyboard. And it's quite fast. bass-ackwards Word to the wise, use Samsung browser, it blows chrome out the water. And I used to use nothing but chrome after experimenting with all the others. Samsung browser is by far the best Lars Jeppesen No PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The Vibration API This was idiotic to ever have been added. Madis The goal was okay, but the execution... I think it would've made sense to combine it with notifications API, so users can optionally enable vibration for site's notifications. Teja I want to login to sites using my fingerprint on Chrome. This works on Samsung browser in Sasmung devices. AndrewNeo I imagine this will be coming in O with the Autofill API. Teja Hope so. NeverrKnowsBest It's hacky, but Lastpass will let you do this now if you don't feel like waiting. Gautham Suki chrome://flags/#enable-custom-context-menu Young Tech Does anybody know how to get desktop-like tabs on Chrome Canary Android ??? Richard Riker you mean that tab bar? It's only on tablets, smartphones have too little space. So no, you can't. Or at least you would need to somehow let the app think it's running on a tablet Эрнесто Че Гевара Can you give a link to wallpaper from the picture which shows new search widget? Corbin Davenport It's from the HTC U11's wallpapers: http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/16/htc-u11s-included-wallpapers/ Colin Richardson Used to make HTML5 games at my last place of work. They used the vibration API. but you had to touch the screen to start the game up anyway, so shouldn't be too bad of a change. DragoCubed I don't like the context menu but the limits to the vibration API are brilliant! Willie Chalmers III Why don't you like the context menu? For me, the icons make the list more scannable so I don't have to really read the items. DragoCubed It is good. It just looks weird. All changes take time to get used to. Ernie Not sure if this is a bug with the browser or Android O Beta. But when I go to apkmirror it glitches out. Richard Riker it has to be with the browser. I can't think about anything else then a webview error and Chrome should use its own. Try with the stable version and see if it happens there too Ernie The normal normal build works fine. Just the beta glitches. Richard Riker then you have your answer. The chance that it's an error in O is now pretty small. Sebastiaan Bakker Would you mind sharing the exact Chrome version that has this glitch, and the device? I'm not seeing any glitching on DP3 and Chrome 58.0.3029.121. I'd like to see if it's a Chrome bug or an APKMirror bug so I can fix it. Thanks! Peter Miller Chrome's dinosaur endless runner mini-game that appears when you're offline uses vibration when you lose. I don't think that they should remove it entirely, you guys at AP are always too quick wanting to rip website features out of Chrome 😅. I don't even think they should introduce a permission for this, because most users, including myself, are very cautios with granting permissions and would rather deny it if it's not totally necessary, which vibration really wouldn't be in most cases. What I would suggest is that Chrome may ask for permission if a site immediately wants to vibrate when being loaded or wants to vibrate for more than 1 sec in the first 10 seconds or so after the site has been loaded. Also the tabbed context menu is really smart, but hope they also add that you can view the full URL like you currently can or otherwise it would also be much of a step back in my opinion. Richard Riker it seems to be not completely removed. At least in dev 61 it's in flags set as "Requiring user gesture for the vibration API" or at least can be set as that. I don't know what they've done in beta but it seems they are not planning to completely remove it anisite When they should repair the most annoying bug ever ? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a20fe45e613b007d4106ff7c7abc97f7aeae7cddceb31f069f994f9b27a1c0d4.png Richard Riker I think the one where the text selection handles are not showing or only very far off is more annoying. I think it's not in stable, but in dev for very very long time. On beta i don't know. Rod Good news is, they supposedly fixed this in v60. I'm downloading it right now to test. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641 Sava D. in this new context thing the actual URL is truncated with no way to see it all as it was before. way to go to redistribute moar malware, yeah.

(Reuters/Yannis Behrakis) Share Written by Ana Campoy June 10, 2017 The continuing gush of refugees from troubled areas around the world has been catching governments around the world by surprise. In 2014, US immigration authorities were overcome by a wave of Central Americans immigrants, many of them women and children fleeing violence and poverty at home. Farther south, in Mexico, the city of Tijuana was taken aback by the arrival last year of thousands of US-bound Haitians, some of whom had to temporarily sleep in the streets. And in Europe, officials were unprepared to handle the biggest refugee crisis in recent memory, the exodus of hundreds of thousands of citizens from Syria and other conflict-torn countries in 2015 and 2016. Had these governments been monitoring Google searches, they might have been better prepared for what was coming—at the very least in the case of Europe. A study released by the Pew Research Center this week found that the search terms used by Middle Easterners en route to Europe were pretty close predictors of their movements. While traveling, many immigrants carry mobile phones and use them along the way to navigate their way. Because more than a third of the refugees were from Arabic-speaking countries, the researchers were able to isolate Google searches by language—and follow their digital trail. The Pew analysis starts off in Turkey, a springboard for the refugees’ journey. Using Google Trends, a free tool that tracks searches by volume, language, and location, they looked at how often Arabic speakers in Turkey used the search term “Greece.” Those searches started to climb steeply at the beginning of the summer of 2015. A couple of months later, tens of thousands of immigrants were landing on Greek shores. The searches even conveyed how and at what time of the day the travelers planned to leave. The term “smuggler” was often paired with “Greece,” and the searches peaked in the middle of the night, when migrants often started their trips. The “Greece” searches also mirrored the immigrant caravan as it moved farther west, and predicted many of the ups and downs of asylum applications in European countries, as the chart below shows. The Google data followed the refugees to their final destination. Asylum applications in Germany closely tracked Arabic-language searches for “Germany.” Search volumes and applications ultimately diverged, as the immigrants settled in Germany but continued to Google the name of the country, according to the researchers. This gap is just one example of the limits of using Google Trends as a government tool to prepare for immigrant surges. Another challenge is that Google Trends does not disclose the most popular search terms by language, so authorities wanting to use it to track immigrants would already need to have a good understanding of their trajectory in order to pick the most telling search terms. That’s going to make it trickier to track people trying to sneak into countries rather than refugees arriving at foreign borders by the thousands, as in the Pew example. Because the Middle Eastern refugees spoke a different language than the locations along the route, it was also easier to separate their searches from those of non-refugees. Distinguishing Spanish-language searches made by Central Americans in Mexico, for example, would be much harder. Still, the findings suggest it might be useful for governments to start looking at Google search trends in addition to the other methods they use to map immigration flows. US Border Patrol already looks for physical footprints in the sand along the US-Mexico border to determine how many immigrants cross it. Digital footprints may provide even more clues.

At Sweden's newly opened Museum of Failure, Google Glass and Apple Newton are two such devices that were either ahead of their time or the results of some bad ideas. Founded by clinical psychologist Samuel West, the museum that opened on June 7 to the public has over 70 failed products and services from around the world. "We know that 80 to 90 percent of innovation projects, they fail and you never read about them, you don't see them, people don't talk about them. And if there's anything we can do from these failures, it's learn from them," West told CBS News. The list has Nokia "N-gage" device, Orbitoclast Lobotomy (medical instrument), Harley-Davidson Perfume, Kodak Digital Camera, Sony Betamax and Lego Fiber Optics, among others, the information available on the Museum of Failure website stated. Developed and marketed by Apple Inc starting 1987, Newton was one of the first personal digital assistants to feature handwriting recognition. Apple shipped the first devices in 1993. Initially considered as innovative, Apple founder Steve Jobs directed the company to stop the production of Apple Newton devices in 1998. According to reports, Newton devices ran on a proprietary operating system called Newton OS. The high price and early problems with its handwriting recognition feature limited its sales. Google Glass, an eye-wearable device, created a storm when the company handed over a prototype to a few "Glass Explorers" in 2013 for $1,500. The optical head-mounted display became available to public in May 2014 but was discontinued in 2015 owing to privacy and safety concerns. The device, however, is now gaining momentum in the medical industry. Nokia made "N-Gage" mobile device and handheld game system that ran on Series 60 platform on Symbian OS. The device, released in October 2003, was discontinued two years later. "N-Gage" suffered from a poor gaming library. The Museum of Failure is open to the public in downtown Helsingborg. --IANS sku/na/bg SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Digital India 'Digital India' or the doomsday device!

Google wants to make it easy for carriers to have interoperable RCS messaging Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/07 2:18pm PDTJun 7, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 179 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares272 Carriers Google News Last week Sprint and Rogers announced that users sending messages between the two carriers will be able to make use of RCS. RCS, of course, is the new standard to replace SMS that Google committed to back in 2015. So far each carrier seems to have its own idea for how RCS should work. But Google's recent work in cross-carrier communication is a big step towards ubiquity, and thanks to the tech behind this latest interconnect other carriers can more easily get in on the RCS action. We are deploying a "hub" model, so that carriers can interconnect to the hub once to get access to all other carriers connected to the hub. — Nick Fox (@RealNickFox) June 5, 2017 Google's Nick Fox followed up his announcement on the 1st with an answer to a question posed by our own Artem about how Google's RCS interconnect works. Instead of requiring that carriers individually connect their networks in some capacity to one another to exchange RCS messages, the RCS standards used by Google and the GSMA make use of a hub-style interconnect. The Jibe hub will interconnect with any Universal Profile compliant network, including in-network IMS, other hosted providers and other hubs — Nick Fox (@RealNickFox) June 10, 2017 Google's hub-based implementation of RCS in the recent cross-carrier announcement isn't a new technology, but it is cool. Back in 2013, the GSM Association published a white paper that detailed how RCS could work — and it's very much worth a read if you are even mildly interested in the future of carrier messaging, RCS, or even just networking. The white paper showed a few different methods for RCS implementation, such as using a direct NNI (Network-Network Interface) decentralized network for each carrier interconnection. Unfortunately, that particular solution results in a quickly rising number of interconnects as the number of carriers increases (n(n - 1) / 2), which means for each additional carrier in the network a larger investment needs to be made by those in it. The white paper also talked about a hub model for RCS, which has clear advantages for carriers. Rather than be burdened with developing their own connections to other carriers, each needs only connect to the one central hub presumably provided by Google. But, this centralized system will likely suffer from the same sort of weaknesses that all centralized systems do. For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. A central network is also more susceptible to censorship, attacks, or interference. However, it also provides some advantages, such as decreasing the investment of time and resources for carriers joining the standard. The hub system proposed in the white paper (based on Openmind Networks implementation for SMS/MMS) does have drawbacks, but fewer connections might end up meaning faster deployment. And since Google has already done the work bringing the hub network up for Sprint and Rogers, each additional carrier should only responsible for its connection to that hub, as opposed to managing every link to every other RCS carrier themselves. 4 node interconnect vs 36 Perhaps the recent news might help other carriers be persuaded to adopt Google's version of RCS, if for no other reason than cost-cutting. Why manage a ton of different networks for RCS when they can let Google cough up the cash for infrastructure? After all, if there's one thing carriers love, it's money.

Release 2 of the RCS universal profile which is to contain the needed information for third-party apps (Like Textra) to utilize RCS features will be released very soon. http://i.imgur.com/HLbSwcy.jpg https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit Ryne Hager The beauty of that document makes me feel bad about my Google Docs skills. Jayson Stephenson Trust me, it wasn't anywhere that great to begin with. I really learned a lot with this doc and the amazing features/flexibility that G-Drive has. Snowsky Mountain Does this mean I can use third-party apps like the SMS Backup & Restore app to backup and restore RCS messages? Jayson Stephenson Yes, but even better. RCS Messages are by default synced to your carriers cloud infrastructure. So if you were to change phones/tablets your messages will be in sync with whatever device you use. Snowsky Mountain Where would I go to turn off/on that syncing of messages? Would it be from a messaging app, like the Android Messages app? Or would it be through my carrier? Also, I wonder what (if any) effect that would have on T-Mobile's DIGITS service, which appears to do something similar for SMS/MMS messages... Jayson Stephenson I'm not 100% yet. But I believe your answer might be on what Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en Andy J As the idea is that you could send and receive SMS, MMS and RCS messages (the spec calls xMS and RCS) from any other device connected to your account - like a tablet or any web browser anywhere - then I would image you would need to turn this off via your carrier not via an app. Snowsky Mountain That makes sense. Thanks! :) MJ I have no interest in my carrier storing my messages. No thanks... I hope this can be turned off. Jayson Stephenson I'm sure a lot of people will agree with you. As I mentioned to Snowsky, I believe the option for that will be on whatever Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en Latheryin There goes your privacy. Dmitri Smirnov There was never any to begin with in the SMS world. Latheryin That completely is a matter of the country to live in. Dmitri Smirnov SS7 vulnerabilities prove, that lack of privacy transcends borders :) Also, there is nothing preventing your carrier to store the SMS "for technical reasons" regardless of a country. At any rate, while RCS might be a weird attempt to catch up with the messenger market, it is definitely not worse than the SMS. Latheryin Acutally there is. At least in the states. There are laws that prevent them from being more then a pass through. As for the messaging market. That also depends on the country you live in. Data messengers are bigger in developing countries then they are say in the states. A perfect example is that 3% of the US population even use a messaging app as their primary. SMS or just flat out calling is the preffered. David Ruddock Cool doc, but Verizon and AT&T are both signatories on the RCS Universal Profile. That doesn't compel them to do anything, but it seems unlikely they'd sign if they didn't intend to be compatible with the universal profile at some point, which is what Google Jibe is based on. Jayson Stephenson It doesn't say anywhere they they ever will implement it. In fact I expect they won't for a long time. All it mentions is their RCS is a proprietary format meaning it will work on only their internal networks. Also check out my comment on AT&T. newtonfb ATT showed a demo of it at MWC(I see that you made that comment on the doc, you should include the twitter picture also). I dont see why ATT and Tmobile will not have the UP out by the end of the year. Verizon is a different story as they have not showed or said anything about it. Jayson Stephenson The doc is open source. ;) Latheryin Yes attached showed it but it plans on placing it on top of their SMS setup not as a replacement. wicketr I think what he's saying is that "yes, it's proprietary now, but they planning on having UP with an unconfirmed launch date". The same is true for most of these. T-Mobile's is currently proprietary, but has been rumored to be UP completed by the end of the year. But it's undetermined if it's going to use Google's hub, or implement the RCS UP using Samsung's infratructure across the boards. Jayson Stephenson Yes, sorry for the confusion. I will see if I can design it any better. But so far the only carrier which we know guaranteed is in the process of installing the UP is T-Mobile. Which is mentioned in the doc. Tom Erlandsen Calling it now, I bet Allo gets RCS support fairly soon after this release Joshua Why? Android Messages - which has RCS - is made by Google. They could have implemented RCS into Allo this whole time. Tom Erlandsen Because Google wants Allo to succeed, and the absolute best way they can do that is by having some kind of carrier messaging fallback. They're not going to do SMS fallback, the Allo lead has come out and said that before. But they've never said they won't do RCS fallback. And the fact that Android Messages has RCS support means absolutely nothing. Google is infamous for its A/B tests, so it's hardly a stretch to imagine them having two apps with RCS support. If Allo with RCS fallback proves very popular and successful, I could imagine them discontinuing Android Messages and making Allo with RCS the default messaging app on Android, requiring OEMs to bundle it with their devices. But I only think they'll do that if Allo proves to be a success, as otherwise they'll face massive OEM backlash Joshua They wont discontinue Android Messages because here in Canada where RCS has been out for months, carriers have said in 2018 Android Messages is shipping with all of their devices. Tom Erlandsen Like I said, I don't think they'd discontinue Android Messages unless Allo was poised to take its place (i.e. had a decent userbase). And that would take a while to happen, even with RCS support. So yeah Android Messages will probably stay for a while, until Google has something it feels would make a better replacement, and I think that's what they'll try and build Allo into Chris I wish American carriers weren't such jackasses. Jayson Stephenson You have a very similar theory as I do. I think the point of the renaming of Google Messages to "Android Messages" is to give all AOSP devices a baseline messenger app that is not branded with the Google name, and supports whatever standard your carrier utilizes. (SMS/MMS/RCS) Obviously Allo will not be getting full-SMS support at all for obvious reasons....(https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/53uvvu/why_sms_fallback_isnt_the_holy_grail_you_all/) But it might be possible for it to get RCS support and still allowing it to view, send, and receive SMS messages. As SMS messages are connected to your carriers data infrastructure instead of tied to your phone storage. (If you have an RCS compatible carrier) You can have Allo to communicate to any non-Allo contacts while still utilizing its rich features with Allo-Allo communication. Although I'm not sure if such an app/feature is even possible. If it were, we could see a messenger revolution! Andy J If Allo gets upgraded with RCS - it MUST have SMS too, the UP spec is very very clear on this point, because RCS does SMS fallback by default. This thing a lot of people forget about Android Messages is that part of Google's commitment to RCS was that they would design an open source RCS client that can be used as is or used as starting point for carriers and OEMs. Android Messages is (as far as we know) that open source client. It's nowhere near feature complete - because the UP spec includes pretty much everything that Allo already has - location sharing, sending files, stickers, voice calls and video calls. The Android Messages app has a long way to go to meet all the features of the first release of UP. Jayson Stephenson The RCS spec does mention is must have RCS fallback, that is correct. But it does not specifically mention that it must be a client-side fallback. If it were carrer-side then we could see IMs like Allo have just strictly RCS support with native SMS fallback if needed. I could be wrong about that though, I haven't skimmed through the spec in a while. Andy J It does actually - it's both. The carrier fallback is automatic and awesome because it's fallback on the REMOTE carrier not yours. So if you send a message to a user and for some reason it cannot be delivered (they have no data for example), the remote users carrier will automatically convert the message to SMS and deliver it. The spec is very specific that any app that supports RCS MUST also support SMS. Client fallback to SMS is referred to as CFS and network fallback to SMS is referred to as NFS. Page 216 of the spec states: Android 7.0+ "Any RCS client (embedded or downloadable application) shall only activate its own RCS stack when it is set as the Default SMS app. " and page 219 covers Android <7.0 "If the RCS client loses its’ Default SMS app status it shall de-register" and the entire spec constantly covers SMS fallback for everything - everything from sending messages, sending location, sending files can be achieved over SMS when RCS is not available across the entire route - the recipient receives an SMS with a web link. It's an interesting read - it hasn't changed a whole lot from the 2 pre Universal Profile specs. Jayson Stephenson Very interesting! I've always wondered how that worked. I'll have to take a look at the document again. Thanks! Abraham No this is how I see it. Android Messages is a very generic simple SMS/RCS platform. No real branding, no real benefit for Google. This makes carriers happy as they are not shoving Google on everyones faces by default. Allo, if it gets RCS support. Will be the Google branded, with Google assistant and many more things. But this will be for the user to decide if they want to use. Not set as default to keep the user and carriers happy. What do you guys think? Joshua More likely. Allo will never replace Android Messages. Android Messages is a very lightweight, clean, and basic app. Allo is full of many (some might call pointless) features most don't want or need. Allo is slow to open compared to Android Messages, which could get annoying if you just want to send a quick SMS/RCS message. McStagger are you keeping that spreadsheet updated? Jayson Stephenson Most certainly! .w oh, and google will be in the center of our communication even more! and if someone opts to use basic sms, which doesn't use internet and such one will end up being processed but damn google... how "noble" of them, and they will probably do this also for "free" (i.e. "only" our data will be collected)... 😆😄 Better Google than Amazon, Facebook, or Apple. That's for sure. .w I'm not so sure about that, given google cluster-freck attitude towards messaging apps... None of the above looks great tbh... Nana Adu-Krow Not sure what is so hard to understand about their messaging apps. Each one serves a different purpose. And if you feel like there's apps that lack certain functionality (like web app support or something) you have the option to use something 3rd party. .w ROTFL, I didn't say that it's hard to understand but the purpose of messaging app is, well... messaging. In case of google you have abundance of messaging apps and if they have distinctive functionality it's even worse - there should be single app that handles all the basics and does it well. That's not the case in google messaging ecosystem. Why would I put my feet in that mess? Just to find out that in a couple of months google would introduce yet another messaging app? or in case of operators - say that they were mistaken if not 100% chooses their solution. Bottomline - trusting google services, especially those not well established (like mail, calendar, docs or android ecosystem) is veeeery risky... Cakefish When will RCS come to the UK? NathanDrago My knowledge is that SMS have basically disappeared. I only receive SMS from my bank and my carrier. Everybody is using WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it. What's the purpose of this effort for RCS? Is RCS more capable than WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it? David Ruddock SMS is still widely used in the USA. NathanDrago But don't you suspect that by the time this standard even starts to spread, USA will already have caught up with the rest of the world (that is, abandoning non-data messages)? It seems to me a lot of wasted resources. raddacle Considering how comfortable people are with services like iMessage which discriminates against other OS's, I don't see SMS going anywhere for the US. SMS is as standard as possible for the US right now. The only way to change the standard is by forcing it, hence RCS. Santos Chavez iMessage says nope, sorry. iPhones are actually a lot more popular here in the USA than the rest of the world. Hence people never switch to other apps.Hence those iPhone users messaging an Android user and oops, it's an SMS now because, yeah, Android doesn't have iMessage. The Android user also wouldn't change apps either if their current SMS app allows them to chat with all of their iPhone using friends. Like me, for instance, I'm the only one in my group of 5 friends that uses an Android phone. Hence, my default SMS app, Android Messages,is all I need to talk with them. They don't switch apps because amongst themselves they use iMessage which is enough as they get advanced messaging features. See what I mean? RCS would at the very least make Android---> Android users have those same advanced messaging features they'd get with other apps. Pushing RCS as the standard works for us here because we've never switched out of using SMS apps. .w This highly depends on the country... Peter Obligatory XKCD https://m.xkcd.com/927/ Dat Nguyen Here in Belgium, SMS is still used (well less than before) because when it comes to mobile subscriptions, Belgium is one of the countries that has expensive prices. For example, for 15€ a month, the carrier I use gives you 2,5 hours of calling, unlimited texting and 1,5 Gb of data so it's not like I can enable the data 24/7 And none of the carriers in Belgium doesn't seem to be aware of RCS AbdulB1 keep it on 3g. You will survive within limits Ryne Hager RCS is supposed to be an open replacement for SMS/MMS. But it is really just another competing standard. At least when compared to things like WhatsApp it isn't a private system. Any carrier that wants to can jump on and start using RCS for messaging, while WhatsApp is not so open and requires that you use their app the way they want you to. So TL:DR RCS is just supposed to replace old standards. bekifft Obligatory XKCD: https://xkcd.com/927/ Latheryin Data only messaging services are not really used a lot in the states and many other places. Data rates are just too high where SMS is unlimited free. Kyle Salewski Really hoping that since Google is behind this, and with the recent revamp of Google Voice, that RCS would soon come to GV. Anyone have any insight on the complexity behind that? Or would it be really difficult since Google Voice isn't a traditional "carrier" but more of a middle man. David Ruddock It would make sense as a reason for them bringing it back from the brink of death, if nothing else. bekifft But Google Voice / Hangouts are the core of the Frankenstein monster that is Google Fi. They seem to be trying to kill both brands, so it makes more sense to do this as part of Google Fi. But maybe GV / GFi is just more A / B testing. Willie Chalmers III More like A/B/C/D/E testing for a messaging strategy. Santos Chavez I think Nick Fox also mentioned on Twitter that they're working on bringing RCS to Project Fi. Project Fi uses Google Voice as the back end for most of its functions so perhaps adding RCS to Voice is pretty much necessary for it to come to Fi-- maybe they'll "talk" to the same server, as such. Project Fi numbers are Google Voice numbers after all, technically. Snowsky Mountain Is an Internet connection required to send and receive RCS messages? Jay Yes. h4rr4r So then why bother with it over XMPP? Snowsky Mountain So what would happen if I had a cellular connection but no Internet (no Wi-Fi or data)? Would it fall back to SMS/MMS? Jay Yep, you got it! John Doe VoLTE? Phone service requires Internet now so why not messages? Evan Anderson For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. This is an extremely unlikely situation. Any large network system, such as this one, will have plenty of redundancy and excess capacity to avoid ever overloading the system. Star network topology is standard these days, so this architecture makes perfect sense. Any other topology is highly inefficient. Snowsky Mountain I wonder what would happen if that were to occur, though. Maybe it would fall back to SMS/MMS? Ryne Hager It's definitely unlikely, I'm more concerned about denial of service implications from a centralized system. Decentralized might be more expensive for the carriers, but it would be more robust. Houston Texas Robust how? Borgman Say Android Messages gets RCS on all carriers and stuff. What then will be the incentive to use Allo or other IM? Sruly J Well Allo has bots... Marcellus1 It'll be the particular feature set of each offering. I could use Allo because I like the bot and you could use WhatsApp because you like the stickers, for example, but it wouldn't matter that we aren't using the same app--which would be awesome and would drive competition better. Borgman But Allo won't get RCS, correct? Won't that remain an IM (unfortunately?). Or by some miracle (thanks to RCS) I'd be able to use Allo and message someone on imessage? Or are IM a whole nother story for a later date? (I just wish I could use X app and send messages, full resolution photos, HD video, read receipt, typing notify, to someone on Y app). Marcellus1 I don't know specifically what apps will get RCS and what ones won't. Hopefully all messaging apps will support it at some point. I suspect if there are any holdouts, iMessage would be the main one just because Apple likes to be intentionally incompatible. The goal of RCS, though, is to have exactly what you said is your wish. Borgman Man I sure hope that happens!!! Latheryin Will never take off as the standard. Not for a least 10 years. Joshua Canada already has had RCS for many months. We only have a few carriers, so it can easily be standard in Canada. Latheryin Everywhere has it. It is just a matter of who will be using it and what version they will use. It will end up like Android pay.. It to mention that is a but too much privacy that many people just will not freely Give up. Mainly not with the anti Google movement going on right now. Marty For some reason the headline of this article made me remember what I used to think about Google several years ago. I was of the opinion that the mentality at Google was of forging a future of making everything free...at least free in the phone and service market to start. Back then my impression of Google was that it was lead by activistic, hippy-culture young people who wanted everything in life to be free. I felt Google would try to lead society to forge such a mindset that "profit" was evil and that humanity being free from wants and needs was the future they wanted. Viktor Ivanov Good thing they aren't, I'd be really worried if they were. Marty Maybe they were to a certain extent but couldn't manage to bring their ideals to fruition. The people running the show right now seem to be money-driven. Syukri Lajin Google trying to make the carriers move to a more centralized system. Good thing they showed good example by not making another messaging app just for RCS. :D freshprince_87 I hope the other 3 US carriers (T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T) adopts Google's RCS messaging network so that RCS finally replaces SMS/MMS forever . SMS/MMS needs to freaking die already! When that happens, there won't be a need for iMessage and it's blue bubbles anymore 😒. Because every phone except for iPhones (unless Apples updates it's messages app in iOS 11)will have the Google's version of iMessage messaging service, RCS, in the United States. Borgman I don't know how many bozo iphone friends I have who say "the picture you just send is hazy" or "why does Android not send HD pics or videos". Drives me crazy! Just want a simple way to send those things to my friends! Warren Skipper No matter if the rest of the world uses RCS, Apple will never adopt it simply because it involves connecting to Google. Add on top of the fact that Google will likely have access to all messages that come through and you have a perfect recipe for Apple to publicly stand against it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson Not sure what you mean by "Connecting to Google", if Apple were to ever adopt RCS they would just have to utilize the exact same API's that every other OEM (Windows Phones, Android, etc...) uses. The only thing Google is doing is promoting the standard and trying to push adoption. Warren Skipper From everything I've read, there are some parts of the universal profile that seem to be Google-specific. In this article by Mobilesyrup, the carrier network Rogers stated “It’s a Google managed service”: http://mobilesyrup.com/2017/05/11/rcs-messaging-sms-canada-explainer/ I could be wrong though.Even if so, Apple wouldn't adopt it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson What he was mentioning in that paragraph that you quoted was the Google Jibe platform which those carriers have agreed to utilize to have Google host the server infrastructure for them. Look at the previous paragraph... "One point Sarhangi is quick to reiterate multiple times throughout our interview is that RCS “is not a Google service.”" RCS is NOT a Google exclusive service. Any Carrier, or OS, or Hardware manufacturer can utilize RCS 100% without any involvement of Google whatsoever. Warren Skipper You're mistaken what I'm saying. I know this is not Google exclusive. I also understand that any carrier can implement it along with OEMs like Samsung who can host the servers in lieu of Google. However, it's highly likely that Google has some form of code within the universal profile itself, that they can track, that is beyond whoever implements RCS. Again I could be wrong but either way, RCS has to go through someone's servers and who's ever it is will have the ability to mine everything that goes through it. Nicholas Conrad But apple hates industry standard, it interferes with their platform lock-in. Andy J Yes - but when UP is available on Android, Windows and Linux and Apple is the only company not taking part - Apple users will feel frustrated by that. Andy J Google aren't the only company - there are about 8, and because they are all UP - they will all interoperate.... that is the whole point after all. Andy J RCS falls back to SMS... mrjayviper Did that mean SMS communications will be data mined by Google as well? I believe they can't do that right now? h4rr4r Why not? They can read anything the device sends. If you own the kernel you own it all. mrjayviper Google can't read my SMS right now success they are not part of the process Ryan yes, they can. as he said they can technically read anything that exits your phone, if they choose to do so. This is how the current sms backup function works. Also if you use android messages they are already in the process mrjayviper i don't backup my SMS h4rr4r Google made the software that displays the text. If you use an Android phone. eddiepearson Honestly, don't care about this unless this means TMO will implement this tomorrow. All of this is null if TMO continues to not give a crap. You can get those free poop goodies every Tuesday though. bekifft The Venn diagram of people on Sprint with friends in Canada (and vice versa) are going to be very excited about this! JD So what Google is saying is RCS will be an unreliable POS that will be in Beta forever. Santos Chavez No that is not at all what they're saying. JD It was implied, since Google is going to sit in the middle of this hub. thecoolkid So now Google will be reading our texts too...? kamiller42 Control the hub? Control the world! Nice one, stop shop for intelligence agencies. Will hub participants be given access to all traffic on the hub? I'm sure Google will. "Better to mine you with my pretty!" MeCampbell30 I'm sure the carriers have no intention of letting google profit at their expense. kamiller42 The answer? Enticement. Offer the carriers the access to the products of the data mining. "We all benefit." Andy J Google's Jibe aren't the only company offering hosted RCS to carriers, and carriers are still completely free to implement their own UP solution hosted entirely inside their own network. This is the bit I am unclear on, because at least 8 other hosted companies exist - it's not clear if you need a connection to each provider or if those providers will connect to each other and one connection to one hub will eventually reach the right provider :/ Abhishek Saral RCS is just for SMS or are there any other benefits? senoredusty Separate ideas. Your question doesn't really make sense. Think of RCS ad the evolution of SMS Abhishek Saral Try to understand the context. It's just for sending messages or something else. senoredusty Yes. It's like fancy SMS. Read receipts, higher quality media, typing indicators, etc. Abhishek Saral People in US should start using WhatsApp already. Instead of making things tough for everyone. senoredusty Everyone in the US uses SMS already. If, over the course of time, people are naturally transitioned from SMS to RCS, that's a lot smaller a barrier than trying to convince each and every person to install yet another app. Sprint is going in the right direction with this, having Android Messages installed by default on all new Android devices. Also IMO WhatsApp is ugly. I don't want to use it, so I'm not about to try to convince everyone else they should. I'd much rather see Textra gain RCS functionality. Duder12 Fixed for you. *iPhone users in US should stop using iMessage already. Instead of making things tough for everyone.* Jay Who care? Americans have locked themselves into a vicious cycle, where 'SMS FALLBACK' in 2017 is necessary and their own self created injury infliction about being the 'green text' to 'blue text' users. Be it whatsapp or telegram or wechat, the rest of the world seems a lot more sane and the messaging discussion has not been one, in a lot of places on earth for years now. Instead here we are in 2017, with americans ranting about SMS and 'the imessage for android'. Something most nations will not care about Santos Chavez I think a lot of has to do with the fact that many folks here aren't really technically knowledged. Most never use any other app other than what came with their phone. Hence why SMS is still a thing, they just use that app to communicate with everyone. By gradually moving things over to RCS, those same consumers would still benefit from advanced messaging even if they never change their app. Sprint is helping with that since they're installing Android Messages by default on all new phones, and they already support RCS. ThePublisher So Google will be able to read all texts... awesome... Erstam Why don't they have Google voice setup with this already? James Where does it say Jibe will provide the hub connection to carriers for free? davidtb I could see how Google (a non-carrier) would want a piece of every RCS message (via their servers) who's at the center of the hub? RCS is pretty, but not a necessity, needa I wonder if Google is going to let everyone in the hub get the data. Yuri Vidal Can someone please explain me why use RCS (Or even SMS) would be better than simply using internet IP messaging systems? (WhatsApp, Telegram, Hangout, and so many others...) Paul Hansen A universal platform for all mobile devices. Not just the ones with a particular app installed. Santos Chavez Because then you could message someone the same way as those apps, but it wouldn't even matter what app they're using. For example, SMS apps will adopt the standard, as well (Textra devs have already said they will support it) so an Android Messages user on Sprint would be able to RCS with a Textra user on Rogers while having the same exact features of WhatsApp, Facebook, etc (like read receipts, typing indicators, large video sending, high quality pictures, and so on). Believe it or not, not everyone uses those other apps, especially here in the US. And even if they had an account in one or more of the apps, they may not be active on it anymore, like it is the case with my friends. With RCS you'd still be able to reach them anyway and have all of the advanced features those apps provide, across carriers and across apps. 2 Men-E I just want this to come to Project Fi Santos Chavez Me too! Really hoping that because Google owns the infrastructure and that they've streamlined the requirements to bridge to other carriers, it'll come to Fi pretty soon. Should be lots easier for them than all of the other carriers anywhere, after all :P Sonic Sunglasses I'm sure AT$T is busy working out its strategic plan to be dead last in implementing this technology. KChristainsen So basically we're still far off from RCS becoming a reality, unreal Jeff Saul Everything goes through the Google. It has been decreed. Humans will bow down to the Google. The Google reigns supreme. Soraya Xel For Google's next trick: Steal everyone's SMS data too. xyz No big deal. In most countries, the telecom regulators will set a standard that all carriers will have to follow. In the US, it'll be a mess. Đức Thành This is always the case: Google wants to help make something better for everyone, they have an idea that can help people improve things for themselves, which then more often than not gets rejected because everyone is a selfish and foolish asshole whose only interest is their own short-term benefits. Much of humanity is like that. Sometimes I think I can begin to get why in sci-fi movies the supreme AI ruler just wants to get rid of all humanity: Humanity's stupidity is a threat to their very existence.

This explains how it works when all the companies are using Jibe for their solution, but how does it work when a) you are using a different hosting provider and b) how does User A on Jibe sending a message to User B on another provider or even more confusingly - a carrier implementing RCS entirely in their own network without relying on any external hosting using the UP ready openmind Core Network solution - how does the message get routed, how does the Jibe cloud know where to deliver the message to? dodo icon pack on picture?

Name: Subject: Message: First Android malware with code injection has arrived Newsby Kris Carlon2 days ago 28 1702 85 Android malware has entered a new era: code injection. According to a report in The Register, the Dvmap trojan, which hid inside several games in Google Play for months and was installed over 50,000 times, “installs its malicious modules while also injecting hostile code into the system runtime libraries”. See also: 15 best antivirus Android apps and anti-malware Android apps January 7, 2017 After seeking root access and dropping its payload, the sophisticated malware then patches root to cover its tracks. Interestingly, Dvmap also works on the 64-bit version of Android, can disable Google’s Verify Apps security feature and used a truly novel approach to avoid detection by Google. The trojan’s creators would upload a “clean” app to Google Play and then intermittently update it with the malware components for a short period of time before replacing it with the clean version once again. The modules were constantly sending reports back to the malware’s authors, leading Kaspersky Labs, who discovered the trojan, to believe it was still in an early testing phase. The trojan's creators uploaded a “clean” app to Google Play and intermittently updated it with the malware components. The goal of Dvmap seems to have been to enable the installation of apps with root level permissions from third party stores. Kaspersky also notes Dvmap could serve ads and execute downloaded files delivered from a remote server. While Kaspersky noted the server connection, no files were sent during its testing, again implying Dvmap was not fully operational. “The introduction of code injection capability is a dangerous new development in mobile malware,” Kaspersky told The Register. “Since the approach can be used to execute malicious modules even with root access deleted, any security solutions and banking apps with root-detection features that are installed after infection won’t spot the presence of the malware.” Kaspersky Labs first encountered the trojan back in April and reported it to Google, who promptly removed it from the Play Store. While all of the apps including Dvmap were not named, Kaspersky recommends a data backup and factory reset for anyone concerned that they may have been infected. So if you downloaded a game in the last few months that has now been pulled from Google Play, you might want to follow their advice just in case.

Miller Washington - For the second year in a row, shareholders of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, voted down a proposal asking the tech giant to publish a report on possible pay disparities between its male and female employees. The vote comes at a time when the company is grappling with a federal lawsuit tied to this very issue and as the tech industry faces heightened scrutiny over gender pay, a lack of diversity, and dysfunctional work environments. Tell a friend File image Under the proposal, the company would measure and disclose how much its female employees make as a percentage of their male counterparts. The plan, put forward by Arjuna Capital, an investment firm, and other co-filers also called for the company to design a policy to tackle any gender pay disparity. Read also: What's the cause of the gender wage gap?  "Gender pay disparity is not only one of the biggest social justice issues of our time, it poses a risk to companies' performance, brand, and investor returns," said Natasha Lamb, Arjuna's director of shareholder engagement, at the shareholder meeting. "This issue is particularly salient to the technology industry, which struggles to attract, retain, and move women into positions of leadership," she said. The board of directors told shareholders that approving the proposal would not be in the best interest of the company or its investors, according to Alphabet's 2017 statement to stockholders. Management pointed to Google's existing diversity reports and internal evaluations as sufficient measures to ensure pay equity among its staff. "Our board of directors does not believe that the proposal would enhance Alphabet's existing commitment to fostering a fair and inclusive culture," read the statement. Like many of its peers in the tech industry, Google produces an annual report outlining the gender and ethnic makeup of its employees. A vast majority of Alphabet's employees work for Google. But the report doesn't outline gender pay disparities. Sixty-nine percent of the company's global employees are male and 31 percent are female, according to Google' 2016 diversity report, which captured data from the year prior. But it's unclear how much women employees are paid relative to men. Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft have each reported on their gender pay disparity, with each company claiming a discrepancy near zero. Lamb described Alphabet as a laggard, compared to its peers, when it comes to transparency over gender pay. Alphabet declined to comment. Arjuna Capital's push for Alphabet to release its gender pay information is part of a broader campaign to address enduring gender discrimination in the American workplace. Within Silicon Valley, which generally views itself as a meritocracy, calls for improving diversity have only grown louder as yearly employment reports continue to show leadership teams being dominated by men. The calls also come as accounts of workplace harassment continue to surface. In February, former Uber employee Susan Fowler published a blog post alleging episodes of sexual harassment that she said took place while she worked as an engineer at the company. Since her writing, Uber initiated several internal investigations to examine what Fowler and others described as a toxic work culture. But Uber's sexual harassment controversy is viewed by some not as an outlier, but just the latest, prominent example of women facing discrimination at work in Silicon Valley. The Mountain View, California, company is currently facing a lawsuit from the Labour Department related to unfair gender pay. The Labour Department filed the lawsuit against Google in January after the company refused to turn over compensation data as part of a "routine compliance evaluation," according to a Labour Department statement released in the same month. Labour Department lawyers have accused Alphabet of underpaying women, finding evidence of "extreme" gender pay discrimination. Google has denied those accusations. In a hearing last month, Alphabet said that it couldn't turn over internal wage data that the department requested because that would cost too much - $100 000 and require hundreds of hours of work, according to the Guardian. Alphabet is the third major tech company since 2016 to fall under Labour Department scrutiny. Palantir was accused of discriminating against Asian job applicants, and Oracle was sued for engaging in pay discrimination against women employees, as well as Asian and black workers, according to the Guardian. At the -shareholder meeting, Lamb also presented a shareholder proposal for Google to analyze its role in the spread of misleading and fabricated news stories, so-called fake news. With management's blessing, that proposal failed. Another plan presented by NorthStars Asset Management would have given stockholders equal voting power.That was defeated as well.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Essential PH-1: Everything you need to know Essential PH-1: Everything you need to know First video shot with PH-1 smartphone's 360-degree Essential Camera is here By Andy Boxall — Updated June 9, 2017 1:11 pm Subscribe Share The 50 best NES games of all time These are the 10 greatest Porsches ever made Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you An Android phone from the co-creator of Android itself promises to stand out from the crowd. Update: Added first video shot with the Essential Camera. Andy Rubin co-created Android, the smartphone operating system that powers 2 billion devices around the world. Now, after leaving Google, he’s launched a new project: The Essential PH-1. It’s an Android smartphone, unsurprisingly, but one with an edge-to-edge screen, innovative accessories, and high-end materials that set it apart from the crowd. Here’s everything you need to know about the Essential PH-1. Essential accessories The dongle joins a Moto Mod-style range of modular accessories for the Essential Phone, which attach using a combination of magnetic pins and a 60GHz wireless USB adapter on the device’s back. Two modules have been announced so far: A 360-degree camera, and a dock that charges the phone when it’s not in use. Essential Camera The Essential Camera, which Essential claims is the “world’s smallest” 360-degree camera, attaches to magnets at the top of the phone’s body, allowing it to poke its “head” over the top of the phone. It weighs just 35 grams, and has two 12-megapixel lenses that can shoot 4K resolution, 30fps video, as well as four microphones that capture sound in 3D. Support for live-streaming will be included, too. We also now have a look at what the footage from that camera looks like, which you can see in the video below. The video itself basically shows a courtside view of game 2 of the NBA finals. Essential Home Essential will release a smart speaker with an intelligent assistant — Essential Home — alongside the PH-1. It’s similar to Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, the main difference being a circular screen that shows exactly what tasks the Essential Home is performing. Essential Home’s round “auto-display” can be activated with a tap, a glance, or a question. Just like Amazon’s Echo speakers, Microsoft’s Cortana Assistant, and Google Home, it lets you control music, set timers, and more. And when it ships later this year, it will work with smart home platforms like SmartThings, HomeKit, and Nest. Essential Home runs a new operating system called Ambient OS, which Essential describes as a “proactive life manager.” It will notify you when you need to leave early to make an important meeting, or if you appear to have forgotten about an upcoming appointment. And it will secure your data by storing it locally, on your in-home network, rather than on a remote server like Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa. The Essential Phone Design The Xiaomi Mi Mix arguably got the edge-to-edge screen trend rolling, but the Essential PH-1 may have one of the most impressive implementations yet. The 5.71-inch, QHD (2,560 x 1,312 pixels) screen — which Essential calls the Full Display — extends from the bottom of the phone’s thin bezel to the top. And unusually, the screen curves around the phone’s selfie camera, obscuring part of the Android status bar. The PH-1 is compact and light, clocking in at a weight of less than 185 grams and a thickness of 7.8mm. It’s durable, too, thanks to a combination of titanium, ceramic material, and Gorilla Glass 5. But those design choices necessitated compromise — just like the iPhone 7 and HTC U11, the PH-1 doesn’t sport a 3.5mm headphone socket. Specs Under the PH-1’s hood lies a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, an Adreno 540 GPU, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of internal storage. The two camera lenses on the phone’s rear, a 13-megapixel dual RGB color lens with hybrid autofocus (combining contrast, phase detect, and IR laser assist) and a second f/1.85 monochrome lens, can shoot videos at 4K 30fps (or 1080p 60fps/720p 120fps) and capture 200 percent more light than the average sensor. And the 8-megapixel, f/2.2 selfie camera can record video at 4K resolution. The PH-1’s other highlights include four microphones in a three-dimensional arrangement that filters out background noise, a 3,040mAh battery with rapid charging technology, a barometer, a USB Type-C port, and a rear fingerprint sensor that Essential claims is the “fastest available technology.” The PH-1 is compatible with every major carrier in the U.S., thanks to an abundance of radios and wireless chips. At a minimum, it’ll be able to place calls, send texts, and use wireless data on Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T, U.S. Cellular, and others. Release and price The Essential PH-1 and its accessories will be sold in the United States initially. The release date hasn’t been officially announced, but we do know the phone — which comes in black, grey, white, and “ocean” — will cost $700, and that you’ll have to reserve one through Essential’s own website. The 360-degree camera will cost $200 separately, but only $50 when purchased with the phone. All four major U.S. carriers will support the Essentials Phone when it launches later this year. But not all of them will sell it directly, and some aren’t willing to commit to a baseline level of service. Verizon said that it “can’t promise the same experience and quality of service as devices that have been tested and approved for use” on the carrier’s network. T-Mobile implied that some network-dependent features wouldn’t be available. “We’re excited for Andy Rubin and his team (the device looks amazing), and welcome customers purchasing Essential to bring it to the fastest and most advanced 4G LTE network in the country through our BYOD program,” a spokesperson said. “We’ll have more to share closer to general availability in terms of what advanced network features might be available in Essential.” Sprint said that it would support the Essential PH-1, but didn’t elaborate. “Essential’s debut smartphone will operate on our network. More specific information will be provided at a later date,” a spokesperson said. Brick-and-mortar availability and ship dates haven’t been announced yet, but we’ll keep you posted.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google’s reCAPTCHA is coming to Android… Google’s reCAPTCHA is coming to Android smartphones and tablets By Kyle Wiggers — June 9, 2017 1:28 pm Subscribe Share Here are the top 25 games that made the SNES, well, super Think inside the box with these tricked-out shipping container homes Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Next time you sign up for something using an Android app, you might encounter Google's bot-detecting reCAPTCHA API. If you’ve signed up for any new web services in the past few years, you’ve probably encountered a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) or two. A CAPTCHA is a form that forces you to transcribe a blurry series of letters and digits. They’re challenge-response questions designed to prevent bots from hammering websites with nonsense data, and one of the most widely adopted — Google’s reCAPTCHA — displays as many as 100 million tests every day. And now, they’re coming to your smartphone. On Thursday, Google announced the reCAPTCHA Android API, a CAPTCHA test adapted to smartphones. When it ships in the coming weeks as part of Google Play Services, the framework that updates and authenticates Google services, it will let app developers invoke the reCAPTCHA system in app sign-up forms, login pages, and more. “With this API, reCAPTCHA can better tell human and bots apart to provide a streamlined user experience on mobile,” Google product manager Wie Liu wrote in a blog post. “It will use our newest […] reCAPTCHA technology, which runs risk analysis behind the scene and has enabled millions of human users to pass through with zero clicks everyday. Now mobile users can enjoy their apps without being interrupted, while still staying away from spam and abuse.” The reCAPTCHA Android API builds on Google’s other recent improvements. In March, the search giant introduced “invisible reCAPTCHAs,” or CAPTCHAs that automatically disappear when a human user is detected. Form fillers that trip Google’s Advanced Risk Analysis algorithms will still have to solve the CAPTCHA test, but most users won’t see it at all. That’s apparently thanks to “advanced analysis techniques” that consider a user’s “entire engagement” with CAPTCHA and “evaluate a broad range of cues.” It’s more than a one-time deal — Google says it “actively consider[s] a user’s engagement with the CAPTCHA — before, during, and after — to determine whether that user is a human.” Google acquired reCAPTCHA from a team at Carnegie Mellon University’s main Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania campus, and made it free to use. That helped it grow into one of the largest CAPTCHA providers in the world — and the anti-spam test of choice for Facebook, TicketMaster, Twitter, 4chan, CNN.com, StumbleUpon, Craigslist, and tens of thousands of others. In 2014, Google began to replace the reCAPTCHA system with a simpler alternative called No CAPTCHA ReCAPTCHA: A checkbox saying “I’m not a robot.” Using a system of clues such as cookies (small pieces of data sent from a website and stored on a user’s computer by the user’s web browser) and mouse movements, the improved reCAPTCHA was able to distinguish non-human users from bots almost instantaneously. The reCAPTCHA Android API for Android is included with Google SafetyNet, which provides services like device attestation and safe browsing. It complements efforts like Google Play Protect, which monitors Android devices for potentially harmful applications, device encryption, and regular security updates.

This version includes a few interface changes, like a new context menu and file picker, as well as a new search widget. The Vibration API also has some new limitations to combat malware ads. Let's take a look. Update 1: 2017/06/10 10:37am PDT The new context menu and file picker are actually present in Chrome 59, albeit with more bugs. I'll leave them in this post because we haven't covered them before, but keep in mind they aren't new. End of Update New search widget We previously covered Chrome's new search widget, which was developed as a result of an anti-trust lawsuit Russia. Russian search company Yandex claimed that Google violated local competition rules, and the settlement required Google to develop a search widget that could change between search engines. At some point, this will replace the normal Google search widget for Android phones sold in Russia. It uses whatever search engine you have set in Chrome, and starting with version 57, Chrome supports almost any search engine you could want to use. It doesn't appear to have changed since we covered it in Chrome Dev 60. No more vibrating ads You've probably seen those fake full-screen malware ads before - the ones that vibrate your phone. This is possible thanks to the Vibration API introduced a few years ago. I'm sure someone thought that web games would be pretty cool with if they could vibrate your phone, but I've only ever seen it used by malicious advertisements. Starting with Chrome 60, pages will no longer be able to vibrate your device unless you tap on the page first. I still think the Vibration API should be removed entirely, or at least have to ask the user permission first (like camera access), but this is a step in the right direction. In a similar move, the beforeunload JavasScript function will only work if you have tapped on the page. This is also commonly used by malicious advertisements, to show an alert as you try to close the window/tab. New context menu If you're not aware, the 'context menu' is the name of the menu that appears when you long-press a link or image in Chrome for Android. Chrome 60 includes a fancy new context menu, but for now, it's disabled by default. You can turn it on by switching the #enable-custom-context-menu flag to 'Enabled.' So what's so great about this new menu? Not only does it have helpful icons next to each menu item, it has a tabbed interface if you select an image contained in a link. Take a look at the below screenshots:     From left to right: link and linked image in Chrome 59, link and linked image in Chrome 60 There aren't any new menu items, everything just looks cleaner. I like it. New file picker The context menu isn't the only interface element to get a facelift in Chrome 60. There's also a new photo/file picker, which appears when you try to upload a file to a webpage. Just like the context menu, this is hidden behind the #enable-new-photo-picker flag, and must be turned on manually (for now).   Left: File picker on Chrome 59; Right: File picker on Chrome 60 You can tell this is a bit unfinished - I imagine recent photos are supposed to appear on the new popup. Still, it's already an improvement from Chrome 59's picker. Other features As with every Chrome release, Chrome 60 includes several smaller changes that may go unnoticed by most users and/or developers. Here are a few of them: Google previously added support for the paymentRequest API to Chrome, which allowed sites to checkout using Android Pay on Android (I still haven't seen a real site that does this). This will be extended to other payment apps starting with Chrome 60, but apps have to add support for the API. Several non-standard animation functions, like WEBKIT_KEYFRAMES_RULE and WebKitTransitionEvent, have been removed. The WebUSB API is now enabled by default. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Thanks, Google Chrome team. Peter You can enable the VibrationAPI changes in Chrome 59 via a flag which is handy. chrome://flags/#vibrate-requires-user-gesture Also same for the new file picker, although it seems quite broken. Launch the file picker, close it, then try to launch it again and it often doesn't work. YMMV. Sruly J I don't really deal with vibrating ads anymore (very rarely), but I'm more thrilled with this change than how Artem feels when he can go a week without experiencing #artemsluck. Jay It's amazing that those spammy malware sites have managed to avoid destruction for so long. I can't wait for the day.. Syukri Lajin I have never seen any website that uses the vibration API except for malwares. Until now, I thought they were using some kind of hack to get the phone vibrating. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I've only seen it used by ads. Oktawiusz Wieczorek I think sites like Facebook use the API for the notifications. So it is not entirely useless. Syukri Lajin Correct me if i'm wrong, but notification uses the notification api, everything related to vibrations is controlled by the OS, the browser simply trigger a notification, it doesn't need the vibration api. Oktawiusz Wieczorek Ok i'm probably wrong. Someone said that under the Chrome Adblocker Article but it seems he was wrong. So yeah the API is currently only for bs. Corbin Davenport You're correct, the notification and vibration APIs are separate. ethd The Jackbox Party Pack series of games uses it for haptic feedback for the buttons. While not required, it is a nice touch.

FeelThePoveR That was literally the only thing that I loved about the broken vibration motor in my phone. Richard Riker don't forget the dino game you get when no internet available (or through chrome://dino). It vibrates on game over :-P Gotmilo greatly needed .. especially since androidpolice blocked adblockers for their websites and i'm still getting popup ads with vibrations.... Jay Even if you've got acceptable ads enabled? needa I don't, and I never do. With or without adblocker. This site is pretty clean. You must have something else going on. On a side note. I started using Fair Adblocker last night. It gives you the standard google adverts, which you can tell it how many you want to see, and gets rid of the rest. You can even selectively get rid of things if you want. I also don't get the popup asking me to give them two cents a view. My1 now they just need to get rid of tracking. why not let the user add keywords or something for ads, so the user doesnt have to get tracked and for god's sake doesnt get haunted with ads for stuff you once bought for your mother needa This blocker has a toggle to block tracking adverts. My1 but since google ads tracks as well iirc wouldnt that immediately ax those ads right into oblivion as well? NeverrKnowsBest It's an issue with Disqus's ads on this site, I've experienced it too. I had them unblocked until it started happening to me. needa It's on your end. You probably have an extension that is telling it to do so. Or something along those lines. I use both Win and Android versions of Chrome to comment on Disqus quite a bit. NeverrKnowsBest No... It's not. Corbin has confirmed on another post that Disqus does this, and others have confirmed it too. I have tried it from my work PC that has no add ons, same issue. needa K. I have to wonder why I don't get them on my tech, or others, and you get them all the time... everywhere you go. Must be because I voted for Trump. NeverrKnowsBest I'm confused now, because you were in the other post, and you outright said you block the ads. So which is it? And I didn't say it happened to me all the time, but it happened in multiple places, at least a handful of times, and that's all I needed to justify my block at the time. needa • 7 days ago "I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another." http://disq.us/p/1j6tc9x needa • 7 days ago I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. http://disq.us/p/1j6sv03 needa I turn my blocker off every few weeks , for a few days, on the blog sites I frequent. I also don't have an ad blocker on mobile chrome. Pretty sure I touched base on this already in this very conversation. Dracono Not exactly, uBlock Origin on desktop and Brave Browser on mobile work just fine. Mahdi Use Adaway or if you don't want to root you can use DNS66 Nate Is the app shortcut for "New incognito tab" missing for anyone else? It's been gone for a while for me. boop ;) I've always had it. Using Chrome Stable and Canary Damodara Kovie [dkovie] Nice spoiler tag 😉 Nate I'm on the Beta. I just installed Stable and it's still not there. Using Nova Launcher if that matters PI "Vibration API" No more Porn sites with Free Vibrator :D ChikuChakk They will still exploit it LoveHater Unless u touch that site , vibrator lol LoveHater Ok , I got it.It was there API, but it's now more restrictive . Carson Saldanha Why is there always two camera icons in the file picker menu? Willie Chalmers III Someone probably added a duplicate intent when implementing it. Carson Saldanha Yes, but it's been there for ages. It's present even on N. abqnm That search bar doesn't so much as search using the search engine in Chrome as it does just open a quick overlay of the Chrome omnibox on the screen. And it's incredibly awesome. It makes it one tap to open chrome, focus on the omnibox and launch the keyboard. And it's quite fast. bass-ackwards Word to the wise, use Samsung browser, it blows chrome out the water. And I used to use nothing but chrome after experimenting with all the others. Samsung browser is by far the best Lars Jeppesen No PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The Vibration API This was idiotic to ever have been added. Madis The goal was okay, but the execution... I think it would've made sense to combine it with notifications API, so users can optionally enable vibration for site's notifications. Teja I want to login to sites using my fingerprint on Chrome. This works on Samsung browser in Sasmung devices. AndrewNeo I imagine this will be coming in O with the Autofill API. Teja Hope so. NeverrKnowsBest It's hacky, but Lastpass will let you do this now if you don't feel like waiting. Gautham Suki chrome://flags/#enable-custom-context-menu Young Tech Does anybody know how to get desktop-like tabs on Chrome Canary Android ??? Richard Riker you mean that tab bar? It's only on tablets, smartphones have too little space. So no, you can't. Or at least you would need to somehow let the app think it's running on a tablet Эрнесто Че Гевара Can you give a link to wallpaper from the picture which shows new search widget? Corbin Davenport It's from the HTC U11's wallpapers: http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/16/htc-u11s-included-wallpapers/ Colin Richardson Used to make HTML5 games at my last place of work. They used the vibration API. but you had to touch the screen to start the game up anyway, so shouldn't be too bad of a change. DragoCubed I don't like the context menu but the limits to the vibration API are brilliant! Willie Chalmers III Why don't you like the context menu? For me, the icons make the list more scannable so I don't have to really read the items. DragoCubed It is good. It just looks weird. All changes take time to get used to. Ernie Not sure if this is a bug with the browser or Android O Beta. But when I go to apkmirror it glitches out. Richard Riker it has to be with the browser. I can't think about anything else then a webview error and Chrome should use its own. Try with the stable version and see if it happens there too Ernie The normal normal build works fine. Just the beta glitches. Richard Riker then you have your answer. The chance that it's an error in O is now pretty small. Sebastiaan Bakker Would you mind sharing the exact Chrome version that has this glitch, and the device? I'm not seeing any glitching on DP3 and Chrome 58.0.3029.121. I'd like to see if it's a Chrome bug or an APKMirror bug so I can fix it. Thanks! Peter Miller Chrome's dinosaur endless runner mini-game that appears when you're offline uses vibration when you lose. I don't think that they should remove it entirely, you guys at AP are always too quick wanting to rip website features out of Chrome 😅. I don't even think they should introduce a permission for this, because most users, including myself, are very cautios with granting permissions and would rather deny it if it's not totally necessary, which vibration really wouldn't be in most cases. What I would suggest is that Chrome may ask for permission if a site immediately wants to vibrate when being loaded or wants to vibrate for more than 1 sec in the first 10 seconds or so after the site has been loaded. Also the tabbed context menu is really smart, but hope they also add that you can view the full URL like you currently can or otherwise it would also be much of a step back in my opinion. Richard Riker it seems to be not completely removed. At least in dev 61 it's in flags set as "Requiring user gesture for the vibration API" or at least can be set as that. I don't know what they've done in beta but it seems they are not planning to completely remove it anisite When they should repair the most annoying bug ever ? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a20fe45e613b007d4106ff7c7abc97f7aeae7cddceb31f069f994f9b27a1c0d4.png Richard Riker I think the one where the text selection handles are not showing or only very far off is more annoying. I think it's not in stable, but in dev for very very long time. On beta i don't know. Rod Good news is, they supposedly fixed this in v60. I'm downloading it right now to test. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641 Sava D. in this new context thing the actual URL is truncated with no way to see it all as it was before. way to go to redistribute moar malware, yeah.

We like this definition. The world of fashion is brought to your fingertips in a new virtual exhibition by Google in collaboration with the National Women’s History Museum and world renowned cultural institutions (PRWEB) June 10, 2017 3000 years of the world’s fashion is brought together in the largest virtual exhibition of style. The “We wear culture” (http://g.co/wewearculture) project by Google Arts & Culture is a collaboration with the National Women’s History Museum and over 180 renowned cultural institutions from New York, London, Paris, Tokyo, São Paulo and around the world. Using state-of-the-art technology, the project allows you to explore everything from the ancient Silk Road, through the courtly fashions of Versailles, to British punk and the stories behind the clothes you wear today. Iconic pieces that changed the way generations dressed, such as Marilyn Monroe’s high heels or the Black Dress by Chanel are brought to life in virtual reality. Fashioning Yourself: A History of Home Sewing (http://bit.ly/2r3TpqA) by the National Women’s History Museum is now available online as part of the global exhibition opening today. The exhibitions feature the icons, the movements, the game changers and the trendsetters including Alexander McQueen, Marilyn Monroe, Cristóbal Balenciaga, Coco Chanel, Audrey Hepburn, Christian Dior, Helmut Newton, Irving Penn, Yves Saint Laurent, Manolo Blahnik, Gianni Versace, Oscar de la Renta, Pierre Balmain, Vivienne Westwood, Miyake Issey and many more. Fashion experts, curators and designers as well as universities, museums and NGOs from around the world collaborated on the exhibition to show that fashion is a part of our culture, a form of art and a result of true craftsmanship with a multifaceted impact. Google’s state-of-the-art technology, including virtual reality, 360° videos, Street View and ultra-high resolution “gigapixel” images were used to preserve the collections and make them available for everyone. Finally, online visitors can discover eleven interactive stories about American women and fashion, their participation in politics, and their contributions to American culture. Highlights available online from the National Women’s History Museum include: McCall’s Paper Pattern (1952) took inspiration from Hollywood celebrities 1940’s paper doll set reflects the mid-century vision of idealized womanhood, achieved with an extensive wardrobe Singer Sewing Machines were marketed to 1950s teenage girls encouraging them to affordably upgrade their wardrobes and social lives years “Lydia” paper doll (1977) not only recognized women’s workforce fashion but also illustrated African American women’s entrance into professional careers National Women’s History Museum Director of Program Elizabeth Maurer said: “Our exhibit illustrates how the technologies that created new markets for fashion enabled clever, creative women to design and construct fashionable wardrobe items at home. Making fashionable clothing at home allowed women to express their fashion ideas, and home sewing enabled women to suit themselves.” The project brings together the National Women’s History Museum’s collection with over 180 emblematic institutions. The stories of four iconic pieces that shaped fashion history are brought to life in virtual reality films that one can watch on YouTube or with a virtual reality viewer. Chanel’s Black Dress from Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris, France (1925) that radically changed the dress code of wearing black, making it a statement piece in every woman's wardrobe. Marilyn Monroe’s stilettos by Museo Salvatore Ferragamo from Florence, Italy (1959-60), the sparkling red high heels that became an expression of empowerment, success and sexiness for women. Comme des Garçons Kimono-inspired sweater and skirt from Kyoto Costume Institute, Kyoto, Japan (1983), that manifests how Rei Kawakubo brought traditional and contemporary Japanese Kimono aesthetics and craftsmanship onto the global fashion stage in radical designs. Vivienne Westwood Corset, from Victoria and Albert Museum, London, UK (1990), which celebrates the designer's unique take on one of the most controversial garments in history, and brings the worlds of fashion and art together. Amit Sood, director of Google Arts & Culture said: “We invite everyone to browse the exhibition on their phones or laptops and learn about the stories behind what you wear. You might be surprised to find out that your jeans or the black dress in your wardrobe have a centuries-old story. What you wear is true culture and more often than not a piece of art.” The We wear culture exhibition is available online and through the Google Arts & Culture app on iOS and Android for everyone. Notes to editors: “We wear culture” in numbers: More than 180 leading cultural and fashion institutions from 42 countries. Over 400 online exhibitions and stories sharing a total of 30.000 photos, videos and other documents. 4 virtual reality experiences of iconic fashion pieces. Over 700 ultra high-resolution, so called gigapixel images. Over 40 venues offer backstage access on Google Street View. Further highlights from the We wear culture project: Step inside the world’s largest costume collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Conservation Laboratory thanks to a 360° film and see how the experts work to conserve the 35,000 artefacts the museum holds. Make a virtual visit to fashion’s many homes like the Condé Nast's Dream Pad (Condé Nast Archive), the Palace of Versailles and the African Heritage House. Look around in the MoMu Fashion Museum Antwerp a place where the game changers of fashion await you, or walk through the Palazzo Pitti with Karl Lagerfeld’s ‘Vision of Fashion’ photography exhibit on display. Ultra-high resolution images – taken by the Google Art Camera – allow you to marvel at the masterful stitches of a Dragon Robe worn by Qing Dynasty emperor from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and to get close to the Elsa Schiaparelli evening coat and its artfully attached rose details that exemplify the love affair between Fashion and Surrealist art. Fashion as a form of art and culture: Explore the relationship between fashion and culture by browsing through the ferocious fashion of the British punk movement (British Film Institute), the evolution of street style in Japan (ACROSS) and history of denim (The Museum at FIT). Discover the wardrobe of painter Frida Kahlo (Museo Frida Kahlo) or how brazilian actress and bombshell Carmen Miranda popularized the plateau shoe (Museu Carmen Miranda) in the 1930s. The craftsmanship behind fashion: Learn about fashion’s unbreakable ties with craftsmanship. Watch how a shoe (Museo della Calzatura di Villa Foscarini) or a traditional Kimono (The Kyoto Museum of Traditional Crafts, FUREAIKAN) is made. Explore the skillfulness of 18th Century Belgian lacemaking (MoMu Fashion Museum Antwerp) and the iconic Delphos Dress (Palazzo Fortuny), dyeing techniques in India (Avani Society) or Nigeria (The Centenary Project) or all about the machines that revolutionized textile making (TextilTechnikum) over the centuries. Impact of fashion: Understand the diverse impact of fashion how it empowers local communities in India (Worldview Impact Foundation), has an environmentally challenged side (Global Fashion Agenda) and of course how it means business (London College of Fashion). Read expert articles about “Why fashion matters” (by Frances Corner), “4 ways to love both fashion and the planet” (by Eva Kruse) or “How to power dress like history’s greatest women” (by Amber Butchart). About the National Women’s History Museum Founded in 1996, the National Women’s History Museum (NWHM, Inc.) is a nonpartisan, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to educating about the diverse historic contributions of women and raising awareness about the critical need for a national women’s history museum in our nation’s capital.

All News Movies Games TV Culture Anime December 1, 2011 John 'Spartan' Nguyen Apple and Google Say No to ESRB Ratings The ESRB rating system is the standard rating system for video games. Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android reign supreme in the mobile gaming market. It seemed it would be a given that Apple and Google would also participate in the ESRB rating system for the mobile gaming apps, but they’re not. Looks like these two companies are too big to surrender themselves to the ESRB. “We’ve put a lot of effort into Android Market’s rating system, which now works well globally. While we support other systems, we think it’s best for Android users and developers to stick with Android’s existing ratings.” – Google spokesperson To submit a game to the ESRB rating system, one must fill out a survey and answer questions for each game that’s to be reviewed. The ESRB gives them a rating, and they can appeal. Here’s a comical artwork that accurately describes the ESRB rating system.

How can artificial intelligence be leveraged for the greater good?
Simon Bradley
Jun 8, 2017 - 16:09

Beyond self-driving cars and Google Translate software, there is much talk about how artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can be used to transform society for the better. A conference in Geneva this week is examining the pros and cons of AI, and the way forward. 

Some 500 policymakers, academics and executives are gathered in Geneva this week for the inaugural “AI for Good Global Summit”, co-organized by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the Xprize Foundation, a Silicon Valley non-profit group. 

The conference has a grand title and a lofty aim – “to chart a course for AI that will benefit all of humanity”. The UN, which is represented by 20 agencies such as the children’s fund UNICEF, wants to refocus AI on sustainable development and see how it can contribute to global efforts to eliminate poverty and hunger, and to protect the environment. 

“Artificial Intelligence has the potential to accelerate towards a dignified life, in peace and prosperity, for all people,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres told event attendees in a video address. “The time has arrived for all of us – governments, industry and civil society – to consider how AI will affect our future.” 

AI has been steadily grabbing the headlines. Last month, a Google AI programme defeated a Chinese grand master at the ancient board game Go. Unbeknownst to many people, forms of AI are already transforming daily lives. 

“It’s all around us. It’s not the future but is already happening,” declared Jürgen Schmidhuber, scientific director of the Swiss AI laboratory, whose researchers have developed software for companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. “All of us have AI in our pockets when we use our smartphones to do speech recognition.” 

Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist from the University of Montreal, acknowledged that much progress had been made in the areas of speech recognition, and the ability of computers to recognize objects and use and understand human language. 

“More researchers are studying this area, so we are making rapid progress,” he declared. “Right now there is low-hanging fruit like using Al for medical image classification, or detecting cancer cells from video.”


Facebook, for example, is mapping the world’s population by using image-recognition software to read satellite images for signs of human habitation. IBM is using AI techniques to predict pollution levels and scientists at Stanford University are employing AI and satellite remote-sensing data to predict crop yields months ahead of harvest.

She pointed out that developing countries have little use for a smart system to diagnose illness if there are no doctors and nurses, clean running water and electricity or medicines. 

Best or worst thing ever 

The future of AI 

A new survey of machine learning forecasts that AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next decade, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school level essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053). Researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years, with Asian respondents expecting to reach these dates much sooner than North Americans.

Last year, Professor Stephen Hawking warned that the creation of powerful AI would be “either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity”. 

Ensuring that AI is used to redistribute wealth and reduce inequalities between states is just one of many huge challenges for policymakers considering how to govern AI at the global level while technological development accelerates. 

“Discussion on AI is at the fork in the road,” Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, told the audience. 

He described AI’s potential for “huge economic disruption” leading to hundreds of millions of jobs lost to automation. He also warned of the risks for democracy and elections as seen in recent reports of the impact of AI and big data on the US elections and Brexit. 

“In the future, robot cops will patrol our streets and wars will be fought by killer robots,” Shetty said. “Will AI systems become the gatekeepers deciding who can access healthcare and who qualifies for a job or mortgages? Those in power who have access to the fruits of the data economy, a handful of countries and companies, will be those who continue to gain while the vast majority of people will be left behind…we can do better.” 

More initiatives

On Wednesday, Shetty announced that Amnesty International had launched an “AI and Human Rights Initiative” to “enshrine the protection of human rights in the use and development of AI”. It joins a host of other global AI initiatives, such as the Partnership on AI, which includes Google, Microsoft and Human Rights Watch, or OpenAI, a non-profit research company launched in 2015 by philanthropists and entrepreneurs to develop “safe” AI systems. 

The UN is throwing its hat into the ring as well; ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao told the conference that Secretary General Guterres had proposed to start a special advisory committee for AI.

If you're a huge fan of how the Google Assistant looks on Android, we may have some good news for you. Several sources familiar with the matter have told Windows Central that Microsoft is working on a brand new UI for Cortana that will introduce a similar conversational UI that's found in Google's Assistant app on Android. Conversational UI is designed in such a way to mimic a text conversation, as if you were texting a family member or friend. Instead of encouraging the user to use their voice, this takes a more familiar approach of encouraging typing, something we all do all the time on our phones and PCs. You'd simply type you query, hit send, and it'll popup in the UI just like a text message. Cortana will then respond back to you in the same way. Of course, voice input will also be possible, just like on the Google Assistant. The user has the choice of using their voice, or typing, and the assistant understands that. The same goes here for the new Cortana. If you use your voice, your message will still show up as text, as will Cortana's, but Cortana will reply back with her voice in addition to the text. A report from Thurrott appears to confirm similar hearings, with additional info which claims Microsoft may in fact be moving Cortana into the System Tray rather than next to the Start button. This move makes sense if Microsoft is bringing a conversational UI to the assistant, as the "search" bar would no longer make sense for an Assistant that uses a chat-based design. It's unclear when or if this new design will be coming. I started hearing about a new Cortana design that's chat focused several weeks ago, but I'm yet to hear on a time frame for when this could be released. Are you interested in a potential redesign for Cortana? Let us know.

Even Google can fail sometimes, too!

I don't want a system tray that takes up half of my screen, and feels like a Christmas tree full of stuff 😁 7 2 days ago Reply aXross Yeah, moving to System Tray is a bad idea and just clutter up the area which Cortana doesn't even belong over there. The current position seems perfect already and even more logical since Cortana also do a search, and Windows Search is part of Start menu. They can just redesign Cortana and have chat-UI which should've been here from the start, after all Cortana should be a combination of Google Now information cards (old which replaced by Google Assistant) and Siri conversation and personality. 0 1 day ago Reply SuperLDClark I am actually impartial on this one.  I use Cortana all the time via voice and the search box.  My only concern is if i have to constantly launch the Action Center to get to her, that may be a bit annoying. 2 2 days ago Reply Tarkus13 I imagine it will have its own button in the systray. 0 2 days ago Reply SuperLDClark Good point, I didn't think about that.  0 2 days ago Reply johnnypdx I'll not concerned with presentation so much as I am with features and capabilities.

Cortana could've grown to more countries by now but it seems like they forgotten that other countries exist, even countries where MS actually have the stronger foothold that includes where Windows Phones were even had a respectable market share. Cortana isn't really well known in most countries while Siri and especially Google are enjoying mindshare. Despite that Cortana is now on PC, they are really slow to non-existent growth outside US and few others. This renders the search bar on the Taskbar became unnecessary clutter for other people that they just want to disable it because it doesn't have other special functionality to begin with. What's worst is that there is a very useful feature that is only part of Cortana, thus for users not aware what Cortana is because it doesn't even exist won't take advantage of that feature, even they got it first Microsoft won't get much credit. 0 1 day ago Reply mrdvos Country full of small Trumps. 0 18 hours ago Reply Dan Harris Basically what they showed off in a Skype concept a while back 9 2 days ago Reply kevin_tenza Yawwwn... 0 2 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

If the service suspects that the user interacting with the app might be a bot instead of a human, it serves a CAPTCHA that a human must solve before the app can continue executing. Google first introduced reCAPTCHA ten years ago, and the company says that more than a billion users have benefited from reCAPTCHA. Google says that its research recently showed that today’s Artificial Intelligence technology can solve even the most difficult variant of distorted text at 99.8% accuracy. Thus distorted text, on its own, is no longer a dependable test. To counter this, last year it introduced Advanced Risk Analysis backend for reCAPTCHA that actively considers a user’s entire engagement with the CAPTCHA—before, during, and after—to determine whether that user is a human. This enables us to rely less on typing distorted text and, in turn, offer a better experience for users. reCAPTCHA Android API is included with Google SafetyNet, which provides services like device attestation and safe browsing to protect mobile apps. You can check out Google Developers site if you want to integrate reCAPTCHA into your Android app. The reCAPTCHA  API will soon be available for iOS.

Alexa now supports reminders and named timers Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/03 10:28am PDTJun 3, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 114 Share on Twitter Total Shares159 News It has been a little over 200 days since the Google Home was officially released, and owners are still waiting on Google to implement support for reminders. Perhaps in response to the growing competition, Amazon has been hard at work improving Alexa, and has now added reminders and named timers to the assistant. The reminders work pretty much as you would expect - asking "remind me to take out the trash Sunday night" will prompt your Alexa-powered device to notify you when the time comes. The named timers can be created with phrases like, "Set an oven timer for 10 minutes." Amazon only explicitly mentioned the Echo in the announcement, so it's possible these features are limited to Amazon's own devices for now and could require a software update for others (I don't have an Alexa device to test). It also seems to be limited to the United States at the time of writing, for some reason. Tags alexa amazon assistant named timers reminders timers subscribe ...

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Alexa, set guitar reminder for one minute" -- it just gives you an alarm. "Alexa, set reminder for one minute" - Alexa says, "What's the reminder for?" I say, "Guitar". 1 minute later, "Here's your reminder -- guitar." MrCalifornia Can't say I like having to give two inputs every single time. I only use multiple timers like 2% of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Then just say "Alexa, set timer for 1 minute". However, I have a feeling this just a matter of there's no pleasing some people. Especially Google fanboys.

Vinod Yalburgi   June 10, 2017 10:46 IST Major specs leak suggests Google Pixel XL 2 will be worth the waitGoogle Prolific tipster Roland Quandt recently tweeted about the appearance of Google Pixel XL 2 on GFXBench, wherein several key specifications of the handset were confirmed. It is now almost certain that Google is indeed testing the larger variant of its Pixel XL smartphone, which is expected to be released sometime later this year. Google Pixel XL2 shows up on GFXBench: ~5.6in display w/ 18:9 ratio?

The GFXBench report also confirms that the handset will be powered by the latest Snapdragon 835 processor chipset running at 2.4GHz and paired with 4GB of RAM. Among other key specifications, the smartphone is expected to ship with 100GB of internal storage, which can be further expanded up to 128GB via microSD slot. On the camera front, the handset is touted to feature an 8MP selfie camera on the front and a 12MP rear camera. The report also confirms that the handset is capable of running Android 7.1.1 Nougat out-of-the-box. However, a recent Geekbench report suggests that the handset's final release model will ship with Android O. If there is any truth to these reports, the next-gen Pixel XL phone could indeed ship with Android O (aka Android 8.0) instead of Android 7.1.1 Nougat. Given Google's intention to add a bunch of feature enhancements and improvements into its upcoming Android iteration, it is almost certain that we could see several camera enhancements on the upcoming Pixel XL phone, besides a unibody metal construction and glass back panels. Although there is no specific release date for the Pixel XL 2, the handset is likely to get released sometime in the fall of 2017. Given its power-packed specs and the likelihood of featuring Android O at release, the Pixel XL 2 could indeed be worth the wait, if not as exciting as the iPhone 8.

Google`s reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects website from spam and abuse. reCAPTCHA uses an advanced risk analysis engine and adaptive CAPTCHAs to keep automated software from engaging in abusive activities on your site. The company is also bringing its bot-fighting programme to Android and the mobile version will launch with "Invisible reCAPTCHA", meaning websites will be able to tell you are not a bot automatically. "On websites using this new API, a significant number of users will be able to securely and easily verify they are human without actually having to solve a CAPTCHA. Instead, with just a single click, they will confirm they are not a robot," said Vinay Shet, Product Manager, reCAPTCHA, Google, in a blog post. Today`s Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology can solve even the most difficult variant of distorted text at 99.8 per cent accuracy. Thus distorted text, on its own, is no longer a dependable test, the post added. To counter this, last year Google has developed an "Advanced Risk Analysis" backend for reCAPTCHA that actively considers a user`s entire engagement with the CAPTCHA -- before, during, and after -- to determine whether that user is a human. With the new API humans can just check the box and in most cases, they are through the challenge of typing the text. "This new API also lets us experiment with new types of challenges that are easier for us humans to use, particularly on mobile devices. Early adopters, like Snapchat, WordPress, Humble Bundle, and several others are already seeing great results with this new API," added Shet.   TAGS Googleapplication programming interfacegoogle APIreCAPTCHA experienceadaptive CAPTCHAs EuropeWorld London attackers planned to use lorry: Police From Zee News Largest Cruise Ships Ever Built DAY IN PICTURES - 29 May 2017 DAY IN PICTURES - 6 June 2017 EuropeWorld Angela Merkel congratulates Macron, calls election result...

Terms of the deal, announced Friday, including when it might close, were not disclosed. Tokyo-based SoftBank, which offers the chatty childlike Pepper companion robot, said the purchase underlines how robotics is a key part of its business. Boston Dynamics makes various robots, including Big Dog and Spot, which are complex machines that walk and trot on four legs. Another is Atlas, which walks on two legs like a human. Atlas has arms and can open doors and lift items. Some were designed for military purposes. Under Friday’s deal, SoftBank is also buying from Alphabet a company called Schaft that develops biped robots. Schaft’s roots are in a research lab at the University of Tokyo. Pepper has expressive arms but wheels for legs and does little more than sing songs and answer basic questions, and can’t do any heavy lifting. Often it fails to understand even simple speech and will keep asking you to repeat sentences. Speculation had been growing recently that Google might want to sell Boston Dynamics. Alphabet said it remains committed to robotics, such as connecting human-like motor skills, including hand-eye coordination, to machines so they can process images, speech, text and draw pictures. It is also interested in research on helping robots learn from what they “experience,” Alphabet said in a statement.

This is a valid concern, but recently I ran into the opposite problem — Google didn’t know enough about me. Specifically Google didn’t think that my address existed. This may sound like a small problem, but I assure you, it can be a major issue. We first realized something was amiss with Google and our address when the home inspector couldn’t find the house with Google Maps. This wasn’t a major concern, but it was odd given that the street and home are more than 7 years old. When you zoomed in on our address, no streets were listed, though with satellite view enabled, you could clearly see houses and streets. Bing knew where we lived the whole time, but this didn’t help us out too much. What Happens When Google Doesn’t Know Where You Live It wasn’t until after we moved in that we started to really understand what it means to be left off of Google Maps. Shortly after we moved in friends and family wanted to stop over to see the house, but no one could find us on their smartphones. In the past month I have given more over the phone directions than I have in the last 5 years. We also had issues with getting some home repairs accomplished, because drivers had trouble locating the address. Eventually I found that Google would direct people to within viewing distance if I told them to enter a nearby street as their destination. This worked for family, friends and repairmen we could talk to, but wasn’t a permanent solution. The biggest issue came when we wanted to order pizza, something we did quite often while in the upheaval of moving. Because our address doesn’t exist in Google, and Donatos uses Google maps to power their online ordering system we couldn’t place orders online. Not only does this mean more time spent ordering on the phone, it actually cost me about $20 in discounts that are only available online. How To Fix Google Maps Errors Report a Problem with Google Maps Thankfully, there is an easy way to fix a Google Maps issue. You need to go to that spot on the map and choose report a problem. From here, you drag a yellow marker to the area with an issue, and tell Google what is wrong. You can report issues with the street, an address, satellite imagery or choose other to handle any problem you see. Describe the problem in as much detail as possible, so that Google can investigate. If you are signed in, you can get an email notification when your problem is addressed. This also allows Google to followup with questions. Followup After a few days Google emailed to say that I was correct and that they would work to fix the problem. Within a week of that date my address, and the surrounding streets, were appropriately marked in Google Maps. Now friends and family can find me without a host of turn left, turn right, look for this landmark directions. Sadly, Donatos has not updated their maps so I still can’t place orders online.

Reply Desiree Tolliver 06/09/2017 at 9:59 pm I have successfully located my house on google maps. My problem is our house number has been the same for 33 years now: 1009. The street name has apparently been changed to Adam Street from Columbus Street (although we’ve been using Columbus Street for the past 33 years). How do I give google maps our house number and let them know that’s our address? Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

You can’t possibly remember everything you come across. But when something is important, it helps to have a quick way to remember it. Smart technology is dumbing down the human race Is Smarter Technology Dumbing Down the Human Race? Is Smarter Technology Dumbing Down the Human Race? As a child, you memorized your friend's phone numbers; now you just add them to your phone. You used to memorize directions; now you just use your GPS. Are humans becoming stupid? Read More , but it’s also about how you use it. Offloading the non-important bits of your memory to a device will free up room for you to retain other information. There’s no reason for you to remember John the assistant’s birthday or your mother-in-law’s favorite color, so let one of these apps do it for you instead. 1. Google Assistant (Android, iOS): The Best “Remember” Voice Command Google Assistant, the company’s answer to Siri, is the most remarkable piece of artificial intelligence in any phone. You probably don’t know the remarkable things Assistant can do 10 Things You Didn't Know Google Assistant Could Do 10 Things You Didn't Know Google Assistant Could Do Android's version of Siri -- Google Assistant -- is more powerful than most people realize. Read More . One of those is smartly remembering things for you — and we don’t just mean reminders. As usual, this works via voice commands. Say “OK Google” followed by “Remember,” and then speak whatever you need it to remember. For example, “Remember I parked the car on level 2 bay P-3.” Later, ask Google Assistant, “OK Google, where did I park the car?” and it will spit out the answer.

Wonder (Messenger, Google Home, Amazon Echo): The Anti-Google Antidote If you don’t want to offload more of your private information to Google, there’s another app that does what Assistant does. Wonder is a bot that works with Facebook Messenger, and smart voice controllers like Google Home and Amazon Echo Amazon Echo vs. Google Home vs. Apple's Competitor Amazon Echo vs. Google Home vs. Apple's Competitor In this article, you'll learn the differences between the Amazon Echo and Google Home. We'll also take a look at what features an Apple speaker may include. Read More . Wonder calls itself a search engine for your personal life, but it’s not as invasive as it sounds. You need to actively command the things you want it to remember. You will again use the “Remember” command, whether typing it in Messenger or saying it out loud to Echo or Home. Wonder uses natural language processing, so you don’t have to be robotic about how you feed it information. But be warned, it doesn’t work as well as Google Assistant does. 3. Reminder Team (Web): When You Don’t Want to Sign In What do you do when you want to remember something for later, but don’t have one of your gadgets or a reminder app with you? Reminder Team is the easy no-signup website that you need 15 Excellent No-Sign Up Websites for Everyday Use 15 Excellent No-Sign Up Websites for Everyday Use Do you like websites which have no sign-ups, no registerations, and no downloads?

Key in your email address, the message, and when to send it. That’s right, you can schedule the email to be sent later. You can also make that email come to you every month, every quarter, or every year. It’s a ridiculously simple web app that you should bookmark for future use. In fact, make your life easier and remember “ReminderTeam.com” so that you don’t need to remember anything else. 4. WorldBrain (Chrome, Firefox): Full-Text Search of Your Browser It has happened to each of us. You were browsing something on the web a long time ago, and you need it now. But you don’t remember the website’s name or anything else about it. Don’t worry, WorldBrain will remember it for you. WorldBrain calls itself a “(Re)search-Engine” because it’s all about searching your own personal data. While you browse the web, WorldBrain will be quietly remembering everything you do. Don’t worry, all the data is stored locally, it never goes to the cloud (unless you specifically want it to). Plus, it stores all the text of every page, so you are actually searching the whole page, not just the title. When you need to look anything up, search WorldBrain through the omnibar of your Chrome or Firefox browser. And yes, it also works with Opera or other Chromium browsers How to Install Google Chrome Extensions in Opera Browser How to Install Google Chrome Extensions in Opera Browser Opera is making a case for you to switch to it.

Some tasks are so small and repetitive that you don’t add them, and then you don’t complete them. Instead of trying to remember every small piece of an item, use pre-made checklists and to-do lists.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today announced a new tool developers can use to authenticate people securely while simultaneously improving the experience for mobile phone users. The company made available the new reCAPTCHA Android API as a part of Google Play Services. Google says this lets app developers and web sites better tell humans and bots apart from one another, particularly with respect to authentication. The API runs Google's new Invisible reCAPTCHA tech, which runs risk analysis behind the scenes to weed out bots and block spam and other abuses. The API is included with Google SafetyNet so mobile developers can manage both the device and user attestations from the same API. This eliminates risks, according to Google, and is more efficient across the board. For end users, the result will be a less intrusive experience when authenticating within apps and on the mobile web. more info at Google » Related Google Makes More Android APIs Available to Developers Google recently released a new tool for developers who are writing apps for the Android platform. Google made the Google Play Developer Publishing API available to all developers, which will allow them to upload APKs to beta testing, staged rollouts, and production, as well as add publishing operations to their app processes. Google Looking to Improve 3D Gaming on Android Google today announced a new 3D rendering API for Android called Vulkan. The Vulkan API provides developers with more control over how mobile processors render 3D environments like those used in games. Google Play Services 8.3 Improves Sign-In Experience Google today announced the availability of Play Services 8.3, an update to the core APIs that allows developers to do new things with the operating system. Play Services 8.3 updates the Google Sign-In API to provide a more consistent look across Google products. Google Hopes New API Will Improve Android Wear Complications Google today announced a new version of its Complications API for developers in order to help them create better experiences for Android Wear. Complications are dynamic data sets that appear on watch faces, such as step counts, notifications, weather alerts, and similar. Google Offering Its Speech API to App Developers Google today said developers will soon be able to add speech recognition to their apps through the Google Could Speech API. Google is offering the same neural network-based tool it uses in its own voice search and keyboard apps. more news about:   AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

The company has created a series of ads for the Google Home, mostly to highlight the Home's temporary price drop, and one of them is... not good. The ad isn't too bad until the end, when the speaker says "And they'll be like 'O.M.G', and you'll be like 'I K-N-O.W'," at which point it entered Fellow Kids territory.

I, for one, am in the hilarious camp. I think I might be in the target audience for this ad. Tim Harman Yea, it's so stupid that it's funny which I think is what they're going for. I mean, Bruno Mars? Qbancelli Dudes getting worked out about some words spoken in a commercial, lol nxtiak I like the current trend of Google commercials. This has the same voice from the Google Photo Scan app commercial. It's funny. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEyDt0DNjWU Rob Agree with you a lot Willie Chalmers III I like the voice, but what she says annoys me. If Google has determined that this style of advertising increases revenue, I'm okay with it. TechGirl90 Really?......It can always be worse, like this commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lwh2xA4uvo Gjorgi Lazarovski WHAT. THE. FUCK. TechGirl90 LOL! My thoughts exactly when I first saw this Commercial. Oliver Cervera ✔ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHA DanSan what the hell did i just watch? serious question. TechGirl90 One of the worst Commercials LG could ever air. Glad they gotten better with their Marketing though, because this is beyond Cringe-Worthy and come across as desperate to try and get attention of Consumers but ends up deterring them even further away with their Marketing Tactics with this Ad.

For example Google Assistant can be used with voice and text, where users can actually talk to Google Assistant by typing out their commands. Apparently this conversation-like feature is something that Microsoft thinks is a good idea because in a report from Windows Central, they are claiming that Microsoft is trying to make Cortana more like Google Assistant by introducing a conversational UI. This means that if true, users in the future can speak to Cortana like they would when texting a real person, and it will be able to return similar information as if you were to use your voice. This is similar to chatbots where users can speak to bots via text form to ask them things like the weather, flight availability, reserving a table, and so on, and it is also a feature we’re seeing Apple introduce to Siri in iOS 11. This will be handy for situations where you don’t want to use your voice, or like with Google Assistant, where it is integrated into the OS and it will be smart enough to know when you’re trying to make a dinner reservation and will be able to offer a helping hand. It is unclear when these changes to Cortana will be made and when they will be rolled out, but if this is a feature you think might come in handy, then you’ll probably want to keep an eye out for it if and when it is released.

Denisse Moreno International Business Times June 10, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple reportedly already is manufacturing its rumored Siri speaker and is integrating better sound to compete with Amazon's Echo and Google Home devices.More Apple and Amazon are fierce competitors, especially now that the iPhone maker has released its own home speaker. However, the companies seem to have been putting their differences aside lately. This year, Amazon and Apple introduced changes that goes beyond their rivalry, with the most recent move announced this week at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Read: iOS 11 And watchOS 4: New Apple Watch And iPhone Health Features Will Help With Your Workouts Amazon And The Apple TV Apple announced the Amazon video app will finally come to the Apple TV worldwide this year. The move makes it easier for users, since Amazon Prime subscribers previously had to use AirPlay on their device to stream video onto their Apple TV. Amazon’s Prime Video app will be available to those who own generation two, three and four of the Apple TV, Amazon said on Twitter. “You asked (a lot). We listened. Amazon Prime Video is coming to the TV App and all Apple TVs this year,” Amazon tweeted. Apart from the Amazon video app, a BuzzFeed report said Amazon will also start reselling the Apple TV on its site. The online retailer stopped carrying the Apple TV and Google Chromecast devices in 2015. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said at the time that the company wanted its customers to be able to watch Amazon video on devices sold by Amazon. However, neither Amazon nor Apple have confirmed that this will happen. Siri and Alexa Apple and Amazon’s virtual assistants, Siri and Alexa, could work together in the future, David Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president of devices, suggested recently. He said the company believes there should be more openness among rival virtual assistant platforms. Limp said the online retailer is willing to work with Apple or Google to ensure Siri and Alexa are compatible. “You should be able to tell 'Alexa, ask Siri X,’” he said. Read: Siri vs. Alexa vs. Google Assistant: Apple Struggling With Privacy Concerns Limp's comments come after Alexa recently penetrated through the iPhone via the Amazon iOS app. iPhone and iPad users can use Alexa by tapping on the microphone icon on the right side of the search box. Alexa on the iOS app can help users with their shopping, track orders, give weather updates, play music and answer other commands. Alexa’s power is limited on iOS though, since it can only be used while the app is open. HomePod VS. Echo Devices When Apple revealed its new speaker at WWDC, it tried hard not to sell it as an Amazon Echo competitor. The HomePod is powered by Siri, but Apple didn’t mention until it was half way into the segment about the speaker. Apple’s HomePod competes with Amazon’s numerous Echo devices, including the latest ones, Echo Look and Echo Show. Amazon’s Echo speakers stream music from Prime Music, Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn, iHeartRadio and other services except Apple Music. Limp previously told Bloomberg Amazon would "love to have Apple, but they’re not super big” on opening up Apple Music integration. Although there are some parts Apple and Amazon won’t let go of, the recent moves show we may see more cooperation between the two companies in the future.

WHAT HAVE STATE GOVERNMENTS PROMISED? NSW * The state government will spend $47 million over three years as part of next week's budget to fund a new 'mini-max' jail within Goulburn's Supermax in the Southern Tablelands to segregate hard core extremists. * The new facility will house 54 inmates and is part of an overhaul that will include soundproofing and audio and CCTV upgrades to monitor visits from family and friends and improve intelligence gathering. * The government is aiming to have it completed by the end of 2018. QLD * Queensland will get 50 extra police officers to help authorities try to eradicate terrorism by relying on preventative tactics and intelligence techniques. * The $108 .6 million over four years will fund an additional 30 counter-terrorism officers and 20 frontline police throughout the state. * The government has previously allocated $46.7 million to the Wacol facility, known as Westgate, which will include indoor firearms ranges and specialist training areas. VIC * Temporary concrete bollards will be installed across Melbourne, including at Federation Square and Bourke St Mall, to stop unauthorised vehicles entering. * The barriers have already been placed along the northern edge of Federation Square with more expected to be installed across the city in the coming weeks. * They will later be replaced with street furniture or planter boxes.

So is the case with H-Metro. H-Metro has been employing numerous tactics of trying to combat piracy and the most recent one is uploading content as images rather than text. I know the issue of piracy is a big problem in this industry and there hasn’t been any viable breakthrough that I know of yet, but this resolution actually presents more problems than it solves anything.  Let’s go through why… So for starters, the idea is bad in that it will not help their SEO since images cannot be read by the Google search crawler and therefore, Google won’t know that they have the content. With everyone getting their news online, it’s great that H-Metro is online, however presenting their news as images defeats the purpose. I’m saying this because for a while H-Metro wasn’t actually online, for this same issue of piracy. Them making a decision to come online is therefore positive. They just need to do it the right way. advertisement Fine, say H-Metro doesn’t really mind not having a good online presence, all they want is their content protected – but that’s still problematic because of the existence of software such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR software recognises the text on images and PDFs which can then be extracted and converted into editable Word, Excel and Text output formats. And at the end of the day, you realise you really haven’t done much to address the problem. Again, this piracy problem has driven H-Metro to upload their content later in the day after most media houses have already published. But then again, that still is a problem because some online news platforms like iHarare and Nehanda Radio (which basically steals news from other sites and then ‘protects’ it – the irony!) actually manage to upload H-Metro’s content before H-Metro itself can. How? The simplest assumption we’d rather go with is that the content thieves buy the H-Metro hardcopy and transfer (by scanning and converting to text) the information contained onto their sites. And of course there was no way H-metro can gamble by delaying their hardcopy too – I mean who buys newspaper in the evening?? Anyway, using this logic, you’ll discover that the new strategy of converting text to images does not help the case since content thieves still have access to the hardcopy. So in essence: H-Metro’s new resolution will only lead to more frustration and complications rather than solve the initial problem. Enjoyed this article?

Reply Smart Donkey says: June 9, 2017 at 11:17 AM Another irony is how much the Hmetro hardy copy cuts and copies from papers like the Telegraph, The Sun and others. A substantial part of their news is also borrowed. Besides I hope they go out of business with their slanderous coverage which somehow eschews the misdeeds of the powerful bigwigs. Reply iRON says: June 9, 2017 at 12:39 PM True. Agree with all your sentiments Reply Anonymous says: June 9, 2017 at 1:04 PM They are blowing things way out of proportion if you ask me. BTW, why is there no Hmetro page on Facebook? There is even a broken Facebook link on their site.

Reply Q says: June 12, 2017 at 8:09 AM NOT QUITE! Plagiarism – the practice of taking someone else’s work or ideas and passing them off as one’s own.

View All 65 Articles In This Series Sometimes it's the little things in life that bring the most joy. Google often uses Android developer previews to test small changes and gauge public opinion on them ahead of a final release. This may or may not be one such example. Dev Preview 3 has reversed a tiny change that was made in the last version, namely changing the order of the WiFi and cellular icons on the status bar. Granted, this seems like a really insignificant alteration. But clearly there were plenty of users annoyed by the change, and this forced Google into reverting to the previous state. If nothing else it just looks weird when cellular comes first. The angles of the two icons fit nicely together when WiFi leads. If you don't believe me, take a look: Above: The right way round, Dev Preview 3.  Below: The wrong way round, Dev Preview 2. So there you have it. A tiny change, but one that will likely please a good number of Android fans. Cheers, Google.

Midnitte Rip best emoji ever. Frisi :( Wes C Get that <8.0 blob out of here. (Not really, I wish they'd bring the blobs back) ninjustin Bye blobs :( Nick I'm actually kinda torn about the new emojis after using them for a bit. I actually really like Google's blob emojis, they had a distinct style about them that was fun and playful. However, at the end of the day it is a way of communicating with others and it fails at that if they look too different. Although, I do remember that someone did versions without the borders and gradients and I did like that better. Ishimaru RIP blobbies :( :( :( Ryan Cavitt I am one with the blob, the blob is one with me. EH101 Dislike the blobs. Glad they're done. They always reminded me of Dots candy. Best solution would be to have Emojis be interchangeable like fonts are in some skins. someone755 But not all emojis mean the same for all groupsets. If my friend with a GS5 sends me an emoji it could have a totally different meaning for him and myself. (There have been a few awkward times because of it. Don't ask.) EH101 That's true, and the primary reason I prefer a single universal set of Emojis instead of everyone doing their own. For a long time I would switch my Emojis to iOS Emojis to be sure what was meant across device conversations. Probably similar reasoning was used when they designed the new Emojis to look more like Apple's. Scott Scrivens https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/70/43/7043683e2ef6acd3920958ad6509cd60.png Carsten Given that most design changes result in many angry comments, what will happen now?! I'm actually quite interested if now everyone will be like "aww yeah back again" or if the ever-complaining comments switch to "I just started to like the new style more" or something :D A Person You guys get paid per-article, don't you. Nick The order of icons in the status bar is very important, switch them up and people go insane! In all seriousness, it's okay that they go over every little detail in these new releases, it's very easy to scroll on by if I don't want to read them. All_I_do_is_post_gifs http://i.imgur.com/eA85ZxQ.gif Jay I see the battery percentage is still outside of the battery icon though. 😒 I don't understand why we can't have both as a choice. Damnit, Google. Frisi That bothers me so much. I turned it off. Zach Mauch I don't mind this change. I can never read the damn thing as it is. Even on my Pixel XL or 6P. There just is not enough contrast. However, considering it is already a hidden setting it should probably just be an option for either. freshprince_87 It would be even better if the font of the battery 🔋 percentage is the same as the clock 🕒 DragoCubed Choice desu Willie Chalmers III Don't fool me like that, AP. I thought the blob emoji were back. ☹️ create812 Same Lazyboy0172 Also the LTE icon is part of the signal bars again, not a separate icon on the bar. Frisi Holy sh-- you're right! I knew something else changed but it didn't caught my eye! aRvInD Any screenshot? Lazyboy0172 not very exciting because it looks identical to pre 8.0, but yeah I'll take a screenshot for you- http://i.imgur.com/mFDuUOy.png Ryan Cavitt Do you ever roam? I wonder where they decided to stick the roaming indicator. I really like OxygenOS' implementation of the roaming indicator. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/efb226690d019dcf77b60974e74631de485ccc0a127b3481923ca0b68fd1edc3.png Patrick Mustard A globe icon with a little "R" on its corner would do just fine. Willie Chalmers III This makes way more sense. Nick What I thought Google was trying to go for was to display what your data source was in one spot. I think they were aiming to do that since the persistent wifi icon was a bug. I think this was a solid logical choice, but the logical choices are not always the most pretty ones, especially with how hard it is to make a big "LTE" icon look good. Miku is Best Vocaloid In Moto devices the LTE indicator is still part of the mobile signal icon but the icon itself covers two spaces. It's kind of annoying but I already got used t https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/07453798a06ae19d208a210da2196e4026c737a8cd6ba83a2d45b402a9348b87.jpg o it. My1 lol does it have to be that large? I would expect a small "4G" or whatever on the cell but not this abomination Miku is Best Vocaloid I dunno why. It has been like that since at least Jelly Bean on the original Moto G. Ryan Cavitt Funnily enough when the OG Moto G got the Lollipop upgrade, they removed the Moto signal cluster and went with the bog standard AOSP cluster. I guess they really did not care at that point. Álvaro R. Only in some reguons, on most countries was still the big letter Vlad It made sense on the dual SIM Moto G. I thought that was the reason. I guess not. Winston Wasn't so on Lollipop on my 2014 Moto X, at least I don't remember so when I got it (when I bought it, it shipped with 5.0, and to the best of my memory the launch software didn't). But either the 5.1 or the 6.0 update screwed it over and replaced it with a super fat "4G" text. 2 Men-E I would like the indication to be similar to this. The "4G" not as large, but indicated surely...so when we finally get 5G in the states, we know. Bewear I personally hate OEMs that do this. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't really mind, it's only the only change Motorola made to the SystemUI. Patrick Mustard By the way, "LTE" is probably far less user-friendly than "4G". Curt Lavlee. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Can you put the battery percentage in the icon, or is it still separate? Илья There are some things they can't just put in Boomdizzle Still separate, unfortunately. Willie Chalmers III Now only if Google would get forced to change the emojis back because of WAY more annoyed users. Alex Let them stay. There are users (majority I'd think) who have no clue what those weird blobs meant. Frisi Sadly, that's correct. Dennis Ulijn Try using them a few weeks, go back to Android <8 and see if you still feel that way. I think most people that see the emoji in use will prefer the new ones (a game of emoji riddle with assistant is a good way to test). Asuka Tanaka I wish Google would add an option where we can change the Emojis Willie Chalmers III I'll try. I know I'll have to give in eventually, so I'm going to install the third developer preview. Goodbye to my blob brethren. 😞 Boomdizzle That was the thing that drove me nuts the most was that the angles were all off. Flows so much better the old/current way. Jared They also got rid of the grayed out wifi icon in the status bar when wifi is not connected (yay!). They have not allowed disabling notifications for Android System, which means I have a constant notification that SwipePad is displaying over apps (boo!). The Google Play Music widget seems to be working properly now. It was pretty broken in DP2 on my 6P. Sruly J According to Google, the greyed out WiFi icon when not connected was a bug. Zach Mauch Now if only the would make the lines of the two icons parallel. It is hard to see, by the angle of the line on the wifi icon is slightly more steep than the angle on the cell signal icon. It aggravates my OCD. Ian Santopietro I didn't mind the order change. I just didn't want the wifi icon there when I wasn't connected to or searching for a wifi connection Dennis Ulijn That's fixed too :) AND they threw in the small H (for 4G) again, too! Google listens. miscfiles Now they just need to make the angles consistent between the WiFi and cellular icons. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4850d98240afa410b5ca01e63ac91b7e8cd973724d50eb33e4c4559627956720.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c65ec559dd82129b60e8150ead4a70f7b6556ea45d10427018452947ae9e44e8.png Sorry. Once you see, you cannot unsee. Zach Mauch I just said this, but your post on it is SOOOO much better. Nice visual! miscfiles Great minds think alike! As a graphic designer this stuff matters (far too much) to me. Zach Mauch Well, I'm an engineer not a GD, but my wife is. LOL! With how quick you whipped up that example I figured you were. miscfiles The other thing that winds me up is the battery percentage in what looks like Roboto Condensed Light or Regular, while the time is in Roboto (not Condensed) Medium or Bold. So there's a difference both in character width and weight, which doesn't sit well. miscfiles Top is like the current. Middle is same widths, different weights. Bottom is same weights, different widths. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/682ce12d4a97875f5990bfb5b598e8b148eacb30d21f87e29dbd951e76414edb.png Daniel Do you guys remember the Google Pixel commercial, the part where they said the battery chargers really fast?

WHAT HAVE STATE GOVERNMENTS PROMISED? NSW * The state government will spend $47 million over three years as part of next week's budget to fund a new 'mini-max' jail within Goulburn's Supermax in the Southern Tablelands to segregate hard core extremists. * The new facility will house 54 inmates and is part of an overhaul that will include soundproofing and audio and CCTV upgrades to monitor visits from family and friends and improve intelligence gathering. * The government is aiming to have it completed by the end of 2018. QLD * Queensland will get 50 extra police officers to help authorities try to eradicate terrorism by relying on preventative tactics and intelligence techniques. * The $108 .6 million over four years will fund an additional 30 counter-terrorism officers and 20 frontline police throughout the state. * The government has previously allocated $46.7 million to the Wacol facility, known as Westgate, which will include indoor firearms ranges and specialist training areas. VIC * Temporary concrete bollards will be installed across Melbourne, including at Federation Square and Bourke St Mall, to stop unauthorised vehicles entering. * The barriers have already been placed along the northern edge of Federation Square with more expected to be installed across the city in the coming weeks. * They will later be replaced with street furniture or planter boxes. WA * The state's police union is calling for stab-proof ballistic vests and more assault rifles to better equip officers faced with terrorist threats - but there are no plans to grant the request. * Police Minister Michelle Roberts said frontline officers and those in specialist areas were well equipped with force options proportionate to WA's current known terrorism threat level. © AAP 2017 New South Wales Crime Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

The upcoming meetings are described as “tech week,” by sources familiar with the White House. Read: Emmanuel Macron, Trump Feud: French President Trolls With Make Our Planet Great Again Website Leaders from companies including Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Intel and Oracle will get together with Trump’s team. Other firms invited were Adobe, Akamai and Qualcomm, which is in a legal battle with Apple. Trump transition team adviser Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, will also attend the meetings. The main event will be on June 19 for Trump’s new American Technology Council meeting. The companies’ chief executives will meet with the administration in Washington, D.C., to discuss ways to modernize government and the services it offers to Americans and will touch on policies like immigration, the report said. Later in the month, tech experts and the Trump team will discuss drones, the internet of things, autonomous cars, investments in emerging markets and the future of the country’s workforce. Trump’s Rocky Relationship With The Tech Industry The planned meetings come after the tech industry expressed its disappointment over Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement last week. Trump ditched the Paris agreement saying it “disadvantages the United States” and would “undermine” the country’s economy. After the president announced his decision, elected officials, business leaders and tech companies spoke out against the decision. Parties, including Google, Lyft, Adobe, Tesla, Apple, Amazon and Yahoo! signed a “We’re Still In” statement vowing to work “together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions.” Read: Internet Spy Law: Trump Administration, Intel Leaders, Republican Senators Want To Make FISA Section 702 Permanent Apple CEO Tim Cook said Trump made the wrong decision regarding the Paris climate agreement. “I think it’s not in the best interest of the United States what he decided,” Cook told Bloomberg. “My view is that first and foremost things are about, can you help your country and if you can help your country and you do that by interacting, then you do it. The country eclipses politics.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who worked as an advisor for the Trump administration, left Trump’s business advisory councils after the president announced his decision. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said when he announced his departure. Trump previously met with tech leaders last December before he took office. Musk, Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and other tech leaders attended the summit at Trump Tower. At that time Trump praised the tech sector, promised to do "anything we can do" to help the industry and even told executives to call him or his people directly if they needed anything. The affection didn’t last long. Tech leaders expressed their outrage after Trump introduced his travel ban in January.

BMW’s ReachNow introduced its ride-sharing service, Ride, in an open beta test in Seattle. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser) Ever wish your Uber ride came with free chocolate and a “Do Not Disturb” button? That’s exactly what GeekWire reporter Nat Levy found when he tested BMW’s new ride-sharing service this week. The service, simply called Ride, opened in beta testing across Seattle on Thursday and is aiming to take on services like Uber and Lyft. Nat rates his experience and explains the details of the new service on this episode of the Week In Geek. Plus, we explain why Snapchat’s parent company, Snap, paid $200 million for a Seattle startup. The company, called Placed, uses location tracking to analyze how effectively mobile ads bring customers into stores — and that could be a big advantage for Snap. We also take a look at some news that came out of our inaugural GeekWire Cloud Tech Summit on Wednesday: First, Google’s new campus will be dedicated largely to Google cloud, and second, cloud container company Docker is aiming to open a new engineering center in Seattle. And finally, a controversy is embroiling one of Washington’s most beloved mountains: a new initiative might introduce cell phone service to the Paradise Visitors Center on Mount Rainier. It’s a debate between living a connected life and having the chance to go off-grid, and our team is split on what should happen. On the Random Channel this week: Scathing reviews of Amazon Fresh Pickup, and Apple’s new Planet of the Apps show, and a more favorable summary of UberEats’ new McDonald’s delivery service.

Essentially, this allows your watch to install its own apps from its own version of the Play Store, and not be tied to your phone. Some of these are honestly pretty handy, which is why we've rounded up the best ones for you to have a look at. Many of these apps will utilize your watch's heart rate monitor, GPS, and/or speaker. Since many watches will not have some (or in the case of the LG Watch Style, any) of these features, functionality may suffer. Apps Hangouts We all know and love Hangouts, right? Okay, so maybe that "love" part isn't true for some of you, but it's still used by more than a few people. Hangouts for Wear allows you to continue conversations via voice, handwriting, swipe, or regular keyboard input, as well as switch accounts. If you're a Hangouts user, you'll enjoy this update.     Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc. Price: Free Telegram I use a few instant messaging apps, but Telegram isn't one of them. However, if you are one of the millions of people who uses the service and you also have an Android Wear 2.0 watch, you'll be able to create and reply to messages, send stickers, and send photos from your watch without having to install the app on your phone (although I'm not sure exactly why you'd want to do that). Previous Next Download QR-Code Telegram Developer: Telegram Messenger LLP Price: Free Pulse SMS Pulse SMS is a seriously awesome app that allows your SMS and MMS messages to be synced to multiple devices. If you have a few smartphones that you routinely go back and forth between, Pulse is a godsend. Version 2.0 of the app brought a standalone Wear app that allows users to reply via the new input methods, as well as login to your Pulse account on your computer to gain access on your watch. Again, I'm not really sure why you wouldn't want this app on your phone as well. Previous Next How awesome are the devs for including AP in a Play Store screenshot? Download QR-Code Pulse SMS (Phone/Tablet/Web) Developer: Luke Klinker Price: Free+ App in the Air: Flight Tracker App in the Air is a "personal flying assistant" that provides loads of real-time data, maps, and tips on your flights. It covers over 1000 airlines, 5000 airports, and several alliances worldwide, allowing you to never lose track of a flight. It also integrates with TripIt so that you can sync your itineraries together. It essentially offers anything that a flier, whether frequent or infrequent, would need to navigate around. The Wear app brings all of this to your wrist, making access to all this info even more convenient. Download QR-Code App in the Air: Flight Tracker Developer: App in the Air, Inc. Price: Free+ Play Music Here's another Google app that's been updated for use with Wear 2.0: Play Music. I don't personally use GPM, but many do, either as an MP3 player or for GPM All Access. Now, you can stream music via LTE or WiFi independently of your smartphone to play on your watch's speaker or on Bluetooth headphones that are directly connected to your watch. The app has also received a slight redesign to cope with the added features. Download QR-Code Google Play Music Developer: Google Inc. Price: Free ChronoSpin Android Police coverage: ChronoSpin is a game for Android Wear that looks like a watch face There are only two games in this roundup, but ChronoSpin is a pretty cool one. It's based on another game called PipSpin. Essentially, you have to reverse the constantly-moving watch hands on the screen to avoid these small circles that stream in from the top of the screen. You can also change the theme of the game. If you want to have the appearance of just checking your watch while actually doing some light gaming, this is your app. Previous Next Download QR-Code ChronoSpin: Wear Game & Clock Developer: Matthew Burton Price: Free Strava Android Police coverage: With Android Wear 2.0 compatibility, Strava records and uploads activities right from your watch The standalone aspect of Wear 2.0 can really be demonstrated by fitness applications, and Strava is one of these. In case you didn't know, Strava is an app that allows you to track your runs and bike trips via GPS, making this perfect for users of the LG Watch Sport (or any other GPS-equipped watch with Wear 2.0). Finally, you can ditch your bulky phablets at home while going for a run. Strava can even record and upload activity independently of your phone. Download QR-Code Strava Running and Cycling GPS Developer: Strava Inc. Price: Free+ Runkeeper Runkeeper is a fitness app that really suits Wear 2.0. It's similar to Strava, but athletes will swear by one or the other. You can track your run with your watch's GPS, and all of the data recorded will sync with your phone's Runkeeper app. It's really quite well-designed for Wear. Previous Next Download QR-Code Runkeeper - GPS Track Run Walk Developer: FitnessKeeper, Inc. Price: Free+ Robinhood If you trade stocks, Robinhood is an app that you may want to check out. It's well-established, with over 500,000 downloads and an average rating of 4.6 stars. You can make free trades, view market data, and build a personalized watchlist. And with the app on Wear, you can check all that with the flick of a wrist. It also appears to delete the Moto 360's flat tire, and that's something no other stock trading app can claim.   Download QR-Code Robinhood - Free Stock Trading Developer: Robinhood Price: Free Foursquare City Guide Android Police coverage: Foursquare City Guide comes to Android Wear 2.0 Foursquare may not be as popular as it once was, but it still has a following of users who like to see places that others frequent. The Wear 2.0 app allows you to browse different categories, see details and ratings about them, and read tips when you get there - all without being connected to your phone. If you like to try out new places, the Wear app could be useful for you. Download QR-Code Foursquare City Guide Developer: Foursquare Price: Free Nest Nest thermostats are gaining popularity, even in regular consumers' homes, for the convenience and features they offer. Being able to set your home's temperature remotely is very handy, and can actually save you a lot of money over time. Now, you can control all this straight from your wrist, as long as your watch has a data connection through either WiFi or LTE. So should you forget your phone at home, you'll still be able to shut off your utilities remotely. Hey look, another app that deletes the Moto 360's flat tire! Download QR-Code Nest Developer: Nest Labs Inc. Price: Free Google Fit Yep, it's another fitness app, but this time, it's Google's own. Fit is unique in that it can combine info from other apps, including the previously mentioned Strava and Runkeeper. Additionally, the Fit Wear app can automatically log your walks, runs, and bike trips throughout the day. If you're a fitness buff and haven't given Fit a try yet, perhaps now is a good time to. Previous Next Download QR-Code Google Fit - Fitness Tracking Developer: Google Inc. Price: Free Gymatic Person Trainer Workout The fitness apps continue. This time, though, it's less of a tracker and more of a trainer. The poorly-named "Gymatic Person Trainer Workout" touts over 300 exercises, professional voice coaching (which your watch will need to have a speaker for), as well as a workout designed by a trainer named Coach Kozak, who is apparently famous. The app is specially made for Wear, although the graphics do look a bit 1990s. Is it worth the $1.99 cost over our next feature? That'll have to be your decision. Previous Next The app was not found in the store. :-( Go to store Google websearch Seven Going to the gym is all well and good, but what if you just can't cram an hour-long gym session into your schedule? Well, you may want to take a look at Seven. This app allows even the busiest people to fit some exercise into their lives, and now, they don't even have to take their phones out to do so. This is another app that really requires a watch with a speaker to work well; because the Style doesn't have one, I had no idea when different exercises and breaks were starting and finishing. Other than that, though, this is a pretty handy app. Previous Next The app was not found in the store. :-( Go to store Google websearch Lifesum Lifesum is an app that promises to help you make better food decisions and exercise more. Naturally, it would make sense to have an Android Wear app for it so that you can get assistance without having to whip your phone out. Not only can you get health suggestions, but you can also quickly view your activity for the day, as well as log your meals and water intake. For those of you who don't eat well, Lifesum could help you out. Previous Next Download QR-Code Lifesum: Healthy lifestyle app Developer: Lifesum Price: Free+ AccuWeather Android Police coverage: AccuWeather releases standalone Android Wear 2.o app AccuWeather's had a pretty barebones companion Wear app for some time now, but it's now been updated to be standalone. The new app can show current conditions, as well as hourly and daily forecasts. You can also have multiple locations and switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius. It also includes a watchface that allows you to view current conditions with the flick of a wrist. It's a pretty solid update for a pretty solid OS upgrade. Previous Next Download QR-Code AccuWeather Developer: AccuWeather Price: Free+ Spotify Spotify is one of the most popular streaming services, and it's now available as a standalone app for Wear 2.0. From here, you can browse through your music and recently played playlists, as well as control playback. You can also stream music using your watch's LTE or WiFi connection independently of your phone, which might come in handy if you're on a run, at the gym, or any place where having a bulky phone is inconvenient.   Download QR-Code Spotify Music Developer: Spotify Ltd. Price: Free+ PaperCraft PaperCraft is the only other game on this list. As most Wear games are (mostly by necessity), it's simple. Basically, you have to "clear little paper guys" and prevent them from reaching you by shooting them. You can record your results both on your phone's leaderboard and on Google Play Games'. This could be a fun little time waster if you're truly bored. Previous Next Download QR-Code PaperCraft Developer: Cord Project Inc Price: Free Wear Stand-up Alert While sitting is necessary to complete many jobs and tasks, it can prove unhealthy in overly large doses. To solve that issue, DYNA Logix has created an application that will alert you if you've been motionless for too long. After notifying you, the app will then calculate the amount of steps it deems the minimum required to stay healthy, and then reset its clock. It also plugs in to a watchface that we'll feature later in this roundup. Previous Next Download QR-Code Wear Stand-up Alert + Bubble Developer: DYNA Logix Price: $1.95 Audiobooks.com Android Police coverage: Audiobooks.com app update adds Android Wear 2.0 support These days, people are reading less and less due to things like tech, games, and movies occupying our lives. However, it doesn't have to be that way. The Audiobooks.com app has made it easier to listen to audiobooks on the go, and Android Wear support takes that a step further. On your Wear 2.0 watch, you can now browse samples and free books, listen (obviously), and have access to controls like forwarding, rewinding, and volume. If you're an existing Audiobooks.com user with a Wear watch, this is one to look out for.   Download QR-Code Audio Books by Audiobooks Developer: RB Audiobooks USA, LLC. Price: Free Uber Android Police coverage: Uber took a two-year ride to reach its destination on Android Wear 2.0 Here's an app that people use a lot (well, less so lately) - Uber. A Wear companion app was promised two years ago, but never came to fruition. Now, though, a standalone app is here. With it, you can request rides, choose your home and work destinations with ease, see prices and ETAs, see your driver and his car make their way to you, and watch the ride progress once you're in it. It's pretty neat for something that you can use exclusively on your wrist. Download QR-Code Uber Developer: Uber Technologies, Inc. Price: Free Google Maps Remember when everyone used MapQuest to get directions? Those days are no more, as Google Maps has all but destroyed that AOL company. Google Maps has been on Wear for a couple of years, but you can now navigate yourself to a destination with just your watch if you've got GPS built in even without the app installed on your phone (though I'm not sure why you'd do that). You can just browse around, look at nearby places, get and view step-by-step directions, and even keep the map always on with ambient display. Previous Next Download QR-Code Maps - Navigation & Transit Developer: Google Inc. Price: Free Watchfaces Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher This is an app as well, but we figure that it'll be more fitting underneath the watchface section. Bubble Widgets has been around for a while now, but it now supports Wear 2.0's standalone capabilities. The "bubbles" can feature apps, information, and more, and they're all highly customizable. You can even use icon packs. Should you like, this can also be put on your phone's homescreen as a widget. Android Wear 2.0 also brings the ability to use unlimited complications as bubbles. Those of you who like to customize everything to your own specifications will probably find this app/watchface pretty fun. Previous Next Download QR-Code Bubble Wear Launcher Watchface Developer: DYNA Logix Price: Free+ Pujie Black Pujie Black is one of the more established watchfaces for Android Wear out there, with over 50,000 downloads despite having a price tag of $1.99. Why, you may ask? Like the watchface above, it offers tons of customization, all of which has been enhanced by Wear 2.0. The update works in Wear 2.0's complications, which allow data from other apps to be streamed to the face. If you like Bubble Widgets but don't quite like the design, this may be of interest to you. Previous Next Download QR-Code Pujie Black Watch Faces Developer: Pujie Price: $1.49 Krona Sunlight Should AccuWeather's bundled watchface not satisfy your weather appetite, Krona Sunlight may be more suitable for you. The phone app is well-designed and provides a ton of customization for all types of weather measurements, including temperature, wind, rain, and even more advanced things such as UV index and ski data if you purchase a subscription. Krona has been updated to integrate complications from third-parties for Wear 2.0, and allows for some tweaking on your wrist. If you really want every weather option, this could get expensive over time with a subscription, but it'll probably be worth it if you're a true weather buff. Previous Next Download QR-Code Krona Sunlight Watchface Developer: Simon Barke Price: $1.69+ Do you guys use any other solid Wear 2.0 apps that weren't mentioned here? Feel free to discuss them below. And if you're a developer and would like to see your app featured in a future roundup, shoot us an email at our tips line.

Now, I only need AW 2.0 on my Moto Sport :( Carson Saldanha Same :( Daniel Tiberius Had you seen a date when we're supposed to get it? Thomas Gladdines Nobody has it yet, even dev preview watches are stuck on dev preview 5. Only way to get it right now is by getting a 2017 watch. I guess the update will roll out in march/may for older devices. Impulse_Vigil ASUS said early Q1, so about April/May for them. thespacecowboy Same :( Steve Bodine If this is to be believed...Moto 360 v2 and sport should have it by end of March. https://plus.google.com/+MattiaCianfroni/posts/dnBoxkAbXJs Chris Thurber The greatest feature for the Telegram app is the ability to send voice messages through your watch. Super handy when I'm busy to send a quick message to my SO. Jack Smith Prefer Gooogle voice which would give you the same. Or Google make Assistant be a VOIP client. Then could talk between watch and GH. 2×4 does AW hangouts support VOIP like the phone version? Sruly J Short answer: no. You can't play voicemails either from the AW app. 79stanger Is there any Wear 2.0 app that allows you to check phone battery level? I charge my phone at work while I'm doing other things, and would like a way to check it without having to stop what I'm doing. Sruly J You mean besides using a watchface? Impulse_Vigil He wants to know the phone's battery level by looking at the watch, not the watch's battery. It's a genuinely useful request IMO, specially on phones that don't have a charging light. Sruly J I know. I was saying though that some watchfaces natively have an option to show battery level for the phone, although through watchface design apps one could design a watchface with such a meter. Impulse_Vigil Ah gotcha, wasn't aware. Impulse_Vigil Maybe Ampere? I think it lets you check the watchis battery from the phone, not sure if the other way around, or I might have it backwards (makes more sense). 79stanger Installed it. Will check it out. Hopefully it doesn't require a Bluetooth connection. Thanks! yo_asakura Best watch face https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radefffactory.dosface Spoiler: It looks like DOS :D Sruly J Made a DOS watchface using WatchMaker. Thomas Gladdines Working on an android wear 2.0 update for my own watchfaces (free). Is there any example watchface with a github link for the complications? Ming William Lee And not a single AW1.X watch has received the update. brkshr It would be REALLY nice if we could disable apps on our watch, like we can most apps on our phones. I don't need fitness apps to be running all the time. Thomas Gladdines Should be possible trough a shell command, are you sure there is no app for that already(maybe requires root)? If not I can look into making it, shouldn't be much more then just a installed app overview with toggles. brkshr The only way I have found is to completely remove the app through ADB. I'm not particularly fond of messing with my watch like that. I haven't learned to root or restore factory images on my watch, so I don't feel like messing with it. Sruly J Settings -> Apps -> System Apps. I've disabled stock HWatch fitness apps like this. Of course though, some apps use a couple of the system apps, so you may need to go back to System Apps until you fully disable the things you don't want. brkshr On AW 2.0 or what? Are you doing this on your watch? I don't have an Apps option in settings on my ZW3 Sruly J Should've probably mentioned I did it on my HWatch running latest Developer Preview. brkshr Sooo, you're telling me there's a chance! That works for me! JD The Number #1 Android Wear 2 app is: The Check for system update button on Android Wear <2. Maxr1998 I am so much looking forward to Telegram and the new Play Music and Pujie black apps, also that Stand-up alert app seems pretty useful, but I won't get AW2 before April, maybe even May on my Zenwatch 3.. So annoying :/ JD Don't worry at this rate i don't think any AW is getting anything until April, or Microsoft becomes relevant in mobile again. Which ever comes first. Maxr1998 Well, Microsoft definitely has the potential! surethom I'm. Sorry but why do most STILL have white backgrounds, that's what makes android wear look cheap & nasty, Google. Want ALL to use dark backgrounds & I prefer black as best. NotDisliked This watch face should've been on there: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyperflow.connectedwatchfaces 5 tasteful minimal watch faces, they're all really good, I don't think I'll be switching off of them for the foreseeable future. Jens Knutson They're great, some of the best on the Play store IMO, but they don't support AW 2.0's complications. :- Sruly J Shouldn't the Play Store be on this list? 😉 surethom If install watch apps from android wear play store can u still update with WiFi off but Bluetooth connected to phone?? Wifi will drain battery more.? Evan Rittenhouse The only issue with the updated GPM app is that if your watch is paired to your phone it won't use your phone's tethered internet to fetch music. It'll just think it's offline. I'm using AW 2.0 dp5 on my hwatch just to be clear. OligarchyAmbulance How are most of these going to work with the 360 when they have buttons and UI elements where the black bar is? Richard Markert They'll either put the elements higher than the bar, or it'll be incompatible with the 360. F4LL0U7 Has there been any update on the rollout schedule for AW2? I'm using LG GWR. Jonathan Nammour Anyone test the Spotify Standalone app? Sruly J With regards to what? Jonathan Nammour Offline music and actually working without the watch near the phone. Haven't seen Spotify post about it anywhere or update their support documents :( Thomas Gladdines There's no offline option only wifi and lte streaming. Jonathan Nammour Awesome thanks siniux Rocking "atmo Paper" watchface on my Huawei watch. It rocks but I'm biased. RD Can someone tell me if you can connect to new WiFi networks and enter passwords without your phone being handy on 2.0? Sruly J Not natively. However, AppFour released 'Wi-Fi Manager for Android Wear' which should accomplish this. RD Thanks for the response. I'll check out Wi-Fi manager. Really a deal breaker for me Jack Smith Will we get instant tethering? Jordan L is Wear 2.0 officially out? I'm on Dev4 on my Huawei watch. JG For the new LG watches it is... Not sure if the update has gone out for older watches to bump them from 1.x to 2.0 yet. I seem to recall seeing March or Q2 as ETAs for a couple OEMs. Kelevandos LG G Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE here - no update, still preview :-( Jack Smith Need Google assistant and google voice and get majority of what is needed. DYNA Logix Recommended reading: reddit/How to use your Android Wear to the maximum? Rami Hangouts who? Richard Markert As a Motorola owner, this is a useless list. JG Hangouts for Wear allows you to continue conversations via either handwriting, swipe, or regular keyboard input No voice input? Sruly J There is voice input. Dunno why that was left out. Cody Toombs Voice input also works, as does any kind of input method that's installed. Harold JP Castro Does the Spotify app allow to save songs/playlist for offline use like the normal version (for premium users)? Sruly J As of now, the standalone app is pretty much useless compared to what's expected of a standalone AW 2.0 app. I installed it earlier to try it out, and all it really did was just launch recently played music on the phone. Harold JP Castro Thanks for replying 👍🏼👏🏼🙌🏼👏🏼🙌🏼 Brian =( I noticed you missed my puzzle game I put out for the launch of Wear 2.0 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mfstudio.circwear Let me know if you want some review codes for it. voriax I wonder why you completely ignored Minimal & Elegant https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMD4Ckql4Tw&ab_channel=MarcinStepien Sruly J Probably because it's not standalone since you need to setup watch face designs through the phone. voriax You are wrong. Minimal is very standalone what is proven in attached video :-) Sruly J I stand corrected. voriax In a basic way you can tweak any design. So I would say yes. I haven't seen any Watchface with full designer on the watch. All of them have limited editors, it's the same for Minimal. Basic functions are editable via watch. voriax :-) I suppose that article author had own reasons to skip it. Happens...

A penalty in the shopping-search probe could come within weeks and many expect it to exceed a $1.2 billion fine on Intel Corp. in 2009. That would be another show of strength by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager who slapped Apple Inc. with a 13 billion-euro ($14.5 billion) tax bill in August. Google is a top priority case for her as European politicians and publishers push for action against the Mountain View, California-based company that’s come to dominate online advertising. “If there’s going to be a fine, it has to be the biggest ever,” said Stephen Kinsella, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who represents companies that have complained to the EU about Google. “The European Commission has strongly signaled that if there is going to be a fine it would need to be at a level that would have deterrent effect.” Timing on a decision could slip and Google representatives and the commission both remain tight-lipped, declining to talk about it. The company hasn’t yet met with regulators to discuss a potential EU order or how it might implement any changes, according to a person familiar with the probe, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Major Rulings But the EU has a long tradition of issuing major rulings just before officials quit Brussels for their summer break. Last July saw more than $3 billion in fines for truckmakers including Daimler AG and Volvo AB. With one eye on the impending decision, some Google officials have been getting ready, moving vacation dates or making sure they are close to the action, other people familiar with the probe said. Vestager “has a keen eye to maximizing the impact of any announcement on a case and July sees a slowdown in the news cycle,” said Christopher Bright, a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling in Brussels, who’s not involved in the Google probe. “Together with the advanced state of preparation of the case, this points to a July announcement for Google.” Vestager isn’t afraid of big numbers, setting records with the tax bill for Apple — which it’s appealing — and the cartel fine for truck companies. Facebook Inc. may have got off lightly with a mere 110 million-euro penalty for not providing correct information in the WhatsApp merger probe. Top Spot Intel holds the top spot for a monopoly abuse with a fine of 1.06 billion euros. That represented more than 3 percent of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10 percent of yearly sales regulators can impose. As Alphabet Inc. pulled in $90 billion in revenue last year, any fine would be capped at $9 billion. But within that limit, the actual size of the fine would be calculated from sales in the market under investigation. Alphabet’s Google division generated $79 billion in ad revenue in 2016. While it doesn’t break out sales for shopping search advertising, ads from search provide most of its revenue. The EU also factors in how many years the illegal conduct lasted. Regulators say the systematic promotion of Google’s own shopping search started in 2008, allowing Google Product Search and Google Shopping grow more quickly than rival comparison-shopping services. A large penalty and an order for Google to change its ways might just be the start. The EU is also examining its AdSense advertising service and its Android mobile phone software. The Android investigation goes to the heart of what Google does in the mobile-phone space, questioning the strict terms Google places on phone makers and app developers to use the software it provides for free. Cash Pile While money matters, Alphabet has a cash pile of more than $92 billion as of March 31 and any changes to its business model ordered by the EU may “probably be of more significance,” said Spencer Waller, a competition law professor at Loyola University in Chicago. “I doubt this is going to hamstring the company but the commission is going to order what it thinks is necessary to give competition a chance,” he said. EU’s claims that Google Shopping results harm competition “are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics,” general counsel Kent Walker wrote in a blog post last year. The EU’s case “rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online” because price comparison sites aren’t the only way to shop around. Google can appeal, which could take years. Microsoft only won a 4 percent cut to its fine. Intel has been waiting eight years for a final ruling. Vestager’s move against Google is sure to attract further criticism that she’s unfairly singled out U.S. companies. Transatlantic tensions are already on the rise after President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, adding to concerns over global trade. “We’re entering a period in the States where foreign competition enforcement against U.S.-based companies is going to be a matter of more public comment and criticism,” said Waller. “I think you’ll hear similar things” to the outcry over the Apple tax bill when the Google probe wraps up, he said. On the other hand, Vestager is under pressure in Europe from companies and politicians eager to see her punish Google. Complaints about Google continue to pour in to the EU, most recently from publishers about Android software. And new fronts could open; Vestager tweeted recently that she’d be playing close attention to Google’s new ad-blocking feature. For Google, there could be more summers like this.

Android O feature spotlight: Gboard gets an incognito mode for Chrome 2017/06/11 6:23pm PDTJun 11, 2017 View All 65 Articles In This Series With each new version of Android, Google tends to make small tweaks to some of its default apps. Such changes are often nothing more than superficial, a way of giving the new OS release a fresh feel. We're now on the third Android O Developer Preview, and the official clock app has been treated to a visual refresh, its first meaningful update since February. The first noticeable change in version 5.1 is an update to the app's icon. The primary purple color has been replaced by a vibrant blue. The bottom right third is no longer shaded, and the shadows on the clock hands have been removed. The second hand now stands out in bright red. Not sweeping changes, by any means, but I think I prefer the flatter, more striking design.   Left: Out with the old (v5.0).  Right: And in with the new (v5.1). After clicking the icon you would expect to be greeted by bold purple with red accents, but not any longer. The main color has been changed to a blue-ish shade of very dark gray, almost black. And the accent is now blue (cornflower blue, apparently). Curiously, the blue used for the accent is not the same as the blue used in the icon, but it's very similar (#468af5 and #5c94f1, respectively). Granted, this is impossible to tell without close inspection and entirely inconsequential, but it's enough to bug me now I know. Serves me right for taking the time to compare them. Another incredibly minor tweak can be seen in the size of the secondary local clock; it's ever so slightly bigger. There's another tweak relating to the time for a secondary location, but this time as part of the digital clock widget. As you can see below, the font weight of the secondary 'Los Angeles' clock has been increased. Again, only a subtle change. But it does make the time slightly easier to read at a glance, which is no bad thing.   Left: Light.  Right: Heavy. Finally, as well as the new color scheme and flatter design, the app icon now implements the new adaptive icons feature, so it will change shape depending on which setting you choose in your launcher. Here you can see the squircle and cylinder varieties: So this isn't exactly groundbreaking stuff, but it's typical of the incremental changes Google makes to its apps all the time. In my opinion, the clock is a little bit more attractive with the new lick of paint. Even if you're not running DP3, you can still download this latest version from APKMirror and install it manually.

Just make sure you install the right apk. caerestapermitido Got it! Thanks Lord Ravenor Holy Holo, Batman! (RIP Adam West). I prefer the older one since the background color changed shade depending on the time of the day. It's also similar to the default iOS clock app, which has deep gray background - though it isn't quite as dark. Garry Does yours still change shade? Mine hasn't been changing for the past few months.

TedPhillips Yes. Came here to say this. Dynamic background color!!!! Though I admit I prefer the cm/aosp clock build, because I need me some 'shake to snooze'. (Edit, the cm build still changes color too) TANGA FROXA You're welcome, Scott ! -_-' Carson Saldanha Which one do we sideload? 5.1 (3926467) or 5.1 (4015683) Artem Russakovskii The newer one is from DP3. The other from DP2. Carson Saldanha Thanks. Maurício Ugly as hell. Where is that material thing? So, the regression of visual. Android design is completely a mess. James Betti It's a beta. Not the final version. This is likely the first of a few app icon updates. Daniel I don't think that a redesign of the icon and a color change exactly qualify it as hideous. ShadyBrady I also notice that when screen saver is on it rotates now. Not sure if it's the clock app, or just dp3. vmxr tiny makeover why every new update for android feels like a tiny improvement only Suicide_Note Because this is just the clock app. If you seriously think that the difference between Nougat and O is tiny, well, you're very mistaken. brownjames I prefer the old style personally. But the new is not terrible. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Uhh..these new icons, especially with that shade of blue looks like a high resolution render of a wall clock out of one of those old DOS games like Maniac Mansion. caerestapermitido I guess I was hoping the color would change across the day, I thought that black would be only in the evening-night, like it less now :/ Edit: also, I find the icon inconsistent with the app design. Should be black with the hands in that blue.... Stu I see the extra nav bar buttons are still available in the preview but have they added the ability to switch back and recents? YouNex Why is this an android o spotlight feature You receive me, android police The APK will rollout from play store and everybody can already install it manually on their non O devices Funny Funny Funny OMG such important changes, this will change our lives forever... It truly deserved this text! Jean-Mouloud I concur, this is a REVOLUUUUUUUTION ! DragoCubed Have they made the clock icon like the calendar icon and change as time goes by? I'd love to see that in stock Chandan Kumar That'd be stupid. Because the icon will have to change every second, even in background, otherwise it would take some time to update when you switch to app drawer/home screen. Marty Hmmm...iOS can do it but not Android. Interesting. 😋 DragoCubed I wasn't asking for it to update every second. Simply remove the second hand from the icon and it'd have to update every minute. If that's too hard, tell that to Samsung. They've already done it. Captain_Invisible Nobody said that it would be hard to do, just that it would take up unnecessary resources. Dakoziol Who said every second? I was thinking more along the lines of every fifteen minutes. Berkay They should make all the icons animated somehow! Well, all the ones that could serve as a second function maybe? calmdownbro Meanwhile Timely is still there, millions still use it, and there have been no updates to it for two years now. :( Pete And on the Dev Preview my Timely countdowns disappear somewhere along the way... Lord Argyris "Curiously, the blue used for the accent is not the same as the blue used in the icon, but it's very similar (#468af5 and #5c94f1, respectively). Granted, this is impossible to tell without close inspection and entirely inconsequential, but it's enough to bug me now I know." I imagine if they hadn't done this, the design wouldn't have been inconsistent enough. Seriously, though, colors look different when viewed next to other colors, so maybe there's a legitimate, designed-oriented reason for making them different. Scott Scrivens Yeah, I would like to think that's the case. Dmitry Stepanushkin Safari colors on icon 😀 Anuj Oberoi You call that an update!!!!. No additional functionality added. Just some UI change. Yuck... Suicide_Note Changing the UI *is* an update. Araib Shafiq Next up, the clock hand moves as the time changes? Would love to see that.. and it only makes sense after what they did with calendar DragoCubed I'd love to see it too but you can tell as I made a comment two hours before yours :P Araib Shafiq Oh sorry, didn't notice, then again its not like it's copyrighted xD but in all honesty I just read the article went to comment section and posted it without reading any other comment so... my bad..? DragoCubed Nah nah mate. I wasn't serious. I had a :P Araib Shafiq Oh, cool :D Anantha Chaitanya Why don't they make it show current time with seconds hand moving live? You know. Like in the iOS. I say, that'd be pretty cool. Same with the calendar. Make it show today's date. DragoCubed Or like Samsung. The calendar already shows today's date on stock Тарас Мукин I like new icon a bit more, but still — out of all standard or Google apps this icon is the most strange. I keep thinking about all icons now being "something on a white circle" — and what's more natural than black (or blue, whatever) clock hands on a white circle? Why playing with this strangely colored background? Jamal Mitchell I'm glad they clock icon changed. With the shadow behind the second hand, all I could see before was a 3D rounded cube. Jerry This is great news to me! I've installed the new clock apk and I love it! Shades of KitKat (my all time favorite android os) with the black and holo blue. Very nice indeed imo. Android Developer I've noticed the icons of Chrome, Phone, and Contacts apps changed to be rectangles . How come? Chris It's a clock.. hardly the kind to write about. I guess there will be articles on the fonts as well for the next OS beecause there simply is nothing interesting to write about. AbdulB1 Android is becoming more and more like an iOS...... Suicide_Note Actually, it's the other way around. Pratik Thakkar I expected Google to use lots of features and coolness from Timely that they purchased 2 years back. Disappointed :( Wesley Why did Google buy Timely and then ignore features like alarm sync? Also, I think it would be useful if the space under the clock had 3 or 4 cards that show the next calendar events, timers, alarms and reminders based on the nearest time of completion. Marty Google bought Timely?? Wow...didn't know. Timely has been my preferred clock for years. I didn't know it was on Google's radar. papernick A long time ago, actually. That's why Timely hasn't changed in years. Marty It's always been a really nice app. Maybe change would harm it. someone755 The thing is nobody can figure out why they bought the thing if they don't intend to implement Timely's features into Google's (and AOSP's) own Clock app. Nobody expected Timely to ever get updates again but I think it's safe to say everyone that knows about the acquisition has so far been baffled as to how it helped improve on the default Clock app. reggjoo Maybe they bought it because of some intellectual property the makers of the app had. In any case, the new clock seems to be a waste of "time". DragoCubed Timely was such a beautiful clock. I'm sad Google didn't do anything with it. An update here and there would've been okay but it's just dead. instinct Yeah, Timely was the better version of Google's clock. Google buys it, doesn't implement changes in their own clock and doesn't do anything with Timely. Sounds like a waste of money. Marty I just wish there was an Android clock with an active icon...like in iOS. DragoCubed Or like on Samsung phones Marty Only active in TouchWiz. And doesn't have a second hand. tim242 A second hand??? Marty Like in iOS. tim242 I just don't get the need for that. It just seems like something that you wouldn't long for. But whatever floats your boat : ) Marty It might help to know I don't use widgets on my Android devices. Strictly icons...like iOS. I like it that way. It's clean and orderly to my OCD...lol. Suicide_Note Why? Do you really think people should go into the app drawer to tell the time? You can just glance at the status bar. Or pull down the notification shade and the time is there. Or use a homescreen widget. Marty Because it's cool. Ads perceptual value to the system. And to head off any concerns, no, I don't hate Apple and because Apple is doing it is not a valid reason to not want it. Pcmanrules I still disable my clock app and use timely, despite the fact Google had owned it for years but done nothing. My name is…. Android Police with the real news, as always. A whole article for making a few fonts bold and an icon change. And 56 comments already!! smh Suicide_Note And here you are commenting on the article. AP wins! iKon AP wins what? Franco Rossel The ad money, of course. .w Especially with ad-blocker :P My name is…. this guy knows whats up vyktorjonas finally an android O redesign I can get behind I like it jcopernicus dark mode? really? Jason Farrell Still no multi-device cloud sync? Meh. I'll continue using Timely. Alessandro Johnny Why they still didn't put the seconds? :( Nicolás Bahamondes Abarca A good-bye to that wink from that OS... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0ae8d60bc25bb96f402c66ae5a746490bfa6f4286c61756f562c620f700fd74c.jpg Đức Thành Cylinder is probably the worst shape ever since squircle.

Exclusive: Google's new phones will be called the Pixel and Pixel XL David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/09/01 5:57pm PDTSep 1, 2016 818 Plus 1 on G+ 2289 Share on Facebook 990 Share on Twitter Total Shares4097 Exclusives News Pixel Pixel XL Rumors Speaking to two independent sources, we now strongly believe that Google's formerly-maybe-Nexus-phones, Marlin and Sailfish, will be marketed as the Pixel and the Pixel XL. We do not have pricing information. At this time, it is unknown to us when Google decided to shift its in-house smartphone brand from Nexus to Pixel or why (though speculation will likely run wild). The Pixel will be the 5" Sailfish device, while Pixel XL will be the 5.5" Marlin. As to our confidence in this information: given that our two sources are independent, and the fact that one in particular has been exceptionally reliable in the past, we feel comfortable saying you can take this to the bank. Coupled with Android Central's breaking story on Tuesday that the phones would not be branded as Nexuses - what else could they even be branded as? Some will say that Marlin and Sailfish's specifications and HTC manufacture don't live up to the "premium" image that the Pixel brand has been associated with to date. I think that's an interesting topic, and one worth broaching, though I don't think Google themselves have ever truly said that Pixel is supposed to be the very best of everything so much as nice materials and a "pure Google" design and experience. Of course, A9 and Sailfish (now Pixel) associations don't help Google's case with these new phones. On the subject of information that we deem less than completely reliable, one of our sources claims Google plans to market the Pixel and Pixel XL as the first phones built by Google. This seems a bit disingenuous. We remain completely certain the Pixel and Pixel XL will be built by HTC - they'll merely lack HTC's branding. And while Google may be solely responsible for their industrial design, to insinuate that HTC was nothing but a manufacturing partner would probably be fiction. I would not be surprised if that relationship blurs the ODM/OEM lines far more than Google may suggest in its future marketing. But we'll have to wait and see. So, does this mean Nexus is dead? That we can't tell you. Given the Nexus Player has no replacement planned, the latest Google Android tablet is branded a Pixel, and Google's new smart home device Google Home doesn't bear the Nexus moniker, though, Nexus's future does seem bleak. But we don't really know, and it's possibly Google itself doesn't, either. As for the reasoning behind the switch? Given that these new Nexus phones will have the most cohesive and Google-influenced design on smartphones to date, to the extent that the devices will be all but identical in everything but size (plus display resolution and battery capacity), maybe this was the time to make a switch. Or maybe these phones were Nexus devices until former Motorola CEO Rick Osterloh stepped in to unify Google's hardware efforts. Or perhaps this was the grand master plan all along. What gives with all this "Nexus" launcher business, then? It's possible Google was just using the Nexus name as a placeholder, or that the change was recent enough that certain project names simply aren't updated yet. It is rather curious, though. And no, I don't know if they'll have a light bar (but I kind of doubt it, even as cool as it would be).

Mr Z Does the pixie come with a coupon for gender reassignment surgery? F U Google. I'm out. Carson S. Wtf? Danske jfc what kind of comment is this? It's PIXEL, not pixie. A pixel is what you're looking at right now on your screen. Graham_Douglas What people here don't want to hear? Android is on a downward trend. I, like others, don't like the new Google pricing model. Additionally, their updates as of late don't mean Jack S to most people. Their next phones look about as ugly as you can get. There is becoming less and less reason to buy in. Google knows software and numbers. They don't know people and they don't know common sense. lomsha Yea you speak for everybody. Graham_Douglas I'm only speaking for intelligent people. Hence, you cannot appreciate what I'm saying. Mike I would be embarrassed to say I have a "Pixel" phone. I will probably continue to call it a "Nexus" of say its a "Google" phone. Sahri Haha, same here xD The name Pixel just sounds so lame. spookymyo What are the chances these phones will be rootable and bootloader unlockable like their predecessors? SHunter Wait for it. Pixel XL = PXL. Behold, the short hand for Pixel. ken adams http://xl.je or email [email protected] JUMP23MΔN I don't care what they call it, just better be good... The phone I mean. StabbinCabbin They want it to be a premium brand?Pixel sounds like some child's toy that might be made by Fisher Price. I won't be getting one. Give me a $180 Honor 5 X any day Danske Not that I have an issue with the name Pixel, but wouldn't just Gphone or Google Phone be a more logical approach? I mean I've always said "My phones a google phone". I wonder why this wasn't considered. Ben Favored Son A flash of genius ! How about PIXEL GO !! Pompoms, confetti, and of course cheerleaders. I know, it's too Shinjuku 😞 Forget I posted anything. insink71 i have serious misgivings about brand name change.. Google needs to be 100% transparent on what this means.. is it a shift to include some manufacturer software improvements? is it a shift to be more carrier friendly [in lieu of developer friendly]? does this still mean unlocked bootloaders? it wasn't too long ago that a Google update borked nexus7 2013 tabs if they were not bootloader unlocked previously. So color me more measured in my glee factor from this article.. insink71 I hope & trust since htc is a developer friendly manufacturer, Google wouldn't circumvent bootloader unlocking.. but who knows.. insink71 ps.. i kind of think even one of the device codenames might lead itself to slight confusion w/ another open source OS [sailfish] Freddy D. The naiming is better than nexus lol. It immediately caught my attention. Sahri Dropping an established brand like Nexus to work on a completely unfamiliar brand called Pixel is the dumbest mistake Google has ever made. Sahri After reading some of the comments I'll just take a neutral position in this. Google is trying to position itself as a big player in the smartphone market and they didn't really succeed wth the Nexus line, which is a pity. I just hope the Pixel phones will have a pricerange equivalent to the Galaxy J7 of Samsung or a bit above it. If it's gonna be $400+ then they have lost me forever. DeadC4t Are the colors going to be red green blue? frostmore never cared about the name. important thing is the hardware and also,does it sport a sd card slot. i like cloud storage and stuff but i also like to access my data when i decide to go offline. in other words, i like the option of expanding my data storage capacity as and when i want. no sd card slot= no deal. RND TV This covers dam all https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4gZR_QPQ7I aRicK BUT PIXEL IS THE BRAND NAME, IT CAN BE CALL PIXEL+ Trexy Smexy If google removed the front facing speakers for water resistance and micro sd expansion then I'm totally cool with that. Cakefish People being so wound up over a name. The funny thing is it's probably the same people that accuse iPhone buyers of being 'iSheep' and only buying them because of the brand name. And yet here we are with some people in the comments section declaring they won't touch that phones with a bargepole unless they don the name Nexus. Because who cares about hardware and software, it's all the name right? How ironic. Brodie Yg Sorry this ain't no exclusive, it's been public knowledge that they will be called pixel for many months now. Brodie Yg They could of also come up with there own name as pixel is already in use by another company Michael Mantion No microSD = fail.

It is called “Be Internet Awesome”, and it aims to teach children the fundamentals of digital citizenship and safety so they can explore the online world with confidence. “Be Internet Awesome” focuses on five fundamentals in “The Internet Code of Awesome”: Share with Care; Don’t Fall for Fake; Secure Your Secrets; It’s Cool to be Kind; and When in Doubt, Talk it Out. Share With Care points out that good (and bad) news can travel fast online. It encourages kids to communicate responsibly. Keep personal details about family and friends private. It emphasizes “If it isn’t right to say, it isn’t right to post.” Don’t Fall For Fake teaches kids to discern between what’s real and what’s fake online. It notes that people and situations online aren’t always what they seem. Secure Your Secrets also emphasizes privacy. It teaches kids how to safeguard valuable information and helps kids avoid damaging their devices, reputations, and relationships. It’s Cool to Be Kind is a lesson that I think many people on the internet need to learn. This section of the “Be Internet Awesome” fundamentals informs kids that the internet is a powerful amplifier that can be used to spread positivity or negativity. It encourages kids to take the high road and apply the concept “treat others as you would like to be treated.” When in Doubt, Talk It Out was designed to help kids understand what to do if they see something online that is questionable, or that makes them uncomfortable. They should talk it out with a trusted adults. This portion of “Be Internet Awesome” notes that adults can support this behavior by fostering open communication at home and in the classroom. Google has created a video game that pairs with “Be Internet Awesome”. The game is called Internetland, and it can be played directly through a browser via a link that is on the “Be Internet Awesome” website. The game gives kids a safe way to put the key lessons of digital safety into practice. It includes four challenging games. Educators can download the “Be Internet Awesome” curriculum (which includes lesson plans and classroom activities.) Parents can download the “Be Internet Awesome Pledge”, which can be used to encourage the entire family to review the fundamentals and be safe on the internet.

Android O Dev Preview 3 is rolling out with final APIs [Update] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 10:34am PDTJun 8, 2017 78 Plus 1 on G+ 199 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares342 Android O Android OS Google News Update 1: 2017/06/08 10:40am PDT OTAs Google dropped the second Android O developer preview on the first day of I/O last month, but here we are just a few weeks later and Dev Preview 3 is available. The full system images are available for immediate flashing on supported devices, and beta program devices will probably be updated soon. Importantly, this update should include the final APIs for Android O. Again, the only supported devices are the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL. If you've got one of those with an unlocked bootloader, you can install the DP3 system images. According to Google, this build will include the final APIs for Android O, allowing developers to finalize their plans for app support. However, this is still a preview. Some things won't work, and Google warns performance can be sketchy. Keep that in mind if you intend to use it as a daily driver. There's no OTA rolling out to beta devices at this time, but it shouldn't be long. We are still expecting one more developer preview before the final build is ready, but we seem to be running ahead of schedule compared to last year. At this rate, Android O might be official later this summer. Update 1: 2017/06/08 10:40am PDT OTAs OTAs are live as well. These can be used to update your existing O Preview device.

JSo I'm sure they will report on it if there is. FelschR As far as I can see there are lots of changes... but it's mainly API related Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It is now Android 8.0.0 DavidW yep Abdelmouttaleb Azeddine Wish my beloved galaxy nexus get android O .... VAVAMk_2 Can I haz apk for my Verizon GNEX? NeverrKnowsBest It probably will unofficially somehow. Will it be usable? Probably not. Max Johnson Probably will, through LineageOS. Brian Demodulated Best phone I ever owned. RyanWhitwam Stop lying. Brian Demodulated Ferreal! It's been the most reliable, glitch-free Android I've ever owned with an excellent microphone and comfortable feel. It's my only Android still working today, 5+ years later. It's the phone I keep switching to when my latest and greatest Android invariably fails months after the warranty expires. -edit- My current 6P is still working but all my other phones since the SGN have failed me. RyanWhitwam I said stop lying. NeverrKnowsBest Ok, I owned one, and now I know you're lying. Phoenix I was in love with that phone until it got stolen :( Shagnscooby It's definitely the most comfortable phone in-hand I've ever owned. Oliver Cervera ✔ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To me, Nexus 4 was one of the prettiest. JasonIvers I liked my Nexus 4. I liked my Nexus 6, too, but it failed _just_ before the warranty ran out, and T-Mobile replaced it with a Galaxy S7. I don't feel like buying a Pixel half way through the cycle, so I'm waiting for the Pixel 2 (or whatever Google ends up calling it) to get back to a proper phone. Nigel Antonio did they fix the significant lag after several days of non reboot. or libraries for certain security files for banks? ( yes i know its not final but damn at least my bank app worked in all other betas) FelschR it's still listed in their "known issues" list. Bill Stebbins Hopefully it fixes the laggy camera that was noted as an expected bug in the last build. Mine has been very stable so far. FelschR Well, they still list "Camera may be slow to launch.". Bill Stebbins Oh. Well then Michael Pahl Not only is my camera slow to launch, its so laggy it takes 4-5 pics at a time, then randomly deletes pics from camera roll. its beta so im not bjtching, just stating. Carlos Rodríguez The full OTAs are here: https://developer.android.com/preview/download-ota.html Cheers! Total Insecurity U are my destiny and my heart! Thanks for posting that info right now while I looked here! Borgman Any new notable features? FelschR final APIs! Such final very API wow! bozzykid It would be quite odd to be adding new features at this point in the process. Rob Well, it was speculated that the Files app would get new features some time (APK breakdown? Not sure). That could be tested in other ways than the developer preview and be added to final release of O. blindexecutioner Yep. Persistent notification you can't remove for running apps Tiuri Elvander very annnoying Good_Ole_Pinocchio "At this rate, Android O might be official later this summer." David first week or 2 of August. Pretty early. Brian Demodulated I upgraded my 6P to the previous beta and regretted it. I wiped and reinstalled N the next day. I think I'll wait for the gold RTM this time around. morteum Same here. It isn't a significant enough difference from Nougat for me to care too much. Ismail Akram When I Installed first preview I regretted too and reverted back to N. but developer preview 2 was pretty good for me. ( not the same but no hiccups ) so from developer preview 2 I've not went back to N and my radios works better too on O before I could either can get 2g, 3g or 3g,4g now I get all three modes. FelschR This has been the most stable Android developer preview. Even DP1 was already extraordinarily stable. Amit_N DP2 was definitely laggy on my device (which was case with lot of people) el_smurfo Yup...first Preview I've regretted flashing. Lost a lot of good shots with the laggy crashing camera. Jordan L agreed, I actually removed DP1 and went back to 7.1.2. DP2 has been good. I get lag. I upgraded to DP2 from 7.1.2, maybe I should fresh install these, but I've heard it should not matter. FelschR well, yes, it is laggy but most of my apps actually work on DP3 (with a few exceptions). EvilHowl And for me. Nexus 5X. Ploppy DP3 seems much better performance wise. What I noticed: no more lags when in settings of apps, no more lag when switching between apps. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach The new default icons for the Nexus 6P are squares with rounded corners. vivekkrish Yep, looks like the option to change icon shape has been removed in this update (as speculated in this post: http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/17/android-o-feature-spotlight-pixel-launcher-lets-select-icon-shapes/). Bummer! Now there is an odd-mix of sqaure, circular and app-specific (keep, youtube) shapes....blech! Frisi Make sure you have Developers Options on. I still see the option. vivekkrish Unfortunately doesn't seem to help (I had developer options on). Toggling it off then on also did not do anything. Snowsky Mountain Is the "All Apps" button still the same (the white circle with 6 dots)? Or is there a swipe-up thing now (like on the Pixel)? Nick Yeah, I'm sticking with action launcher. I cannot use Google Now launcher because it just looks so ugly. Fayas Nexus 5X also same. No circle option. I don't like this rounded corner squares :( Matej Scibravy is there an option to revert this? Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It is officially Android 8.0.0 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/50b60dca0b5a8c943cdac4dd581e751f150d254cf997d0cb108e332b2e4e55ff.png Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e3174e1cc4e379e0cf23534565dbaeab101f385692e9c9d6141b9340516ebf50.png Frisi When WiFi Off, is it still persistent (the wifi icon)? Maxwell “Max” Weinbach no Frisi Finally! Thanks! Franco Rossel No, that was a bug according to Google and they fixed it. Frisi Praise the lord. It was bugging the hell out of me. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ For now no OTA for me :( Frisi I'm downloading the zip. tmartin Anyone running this with N5X? Okay for a daily driver at this point? I don't mind the occasional reboot, but how's the camera and Android Pay? SB up to today on Android O - pay works for me. camera seemed buggy - have not tried what is released today - downloading now. Ploppy Tested on dev preview 3 and no problem with the camera. vivekkrish There seems to be a new Camera switching UI (from photo to video) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ae30ad7478f482794c3c3515e5a25df9c29ebd1e3ff702164b3bb815d6c91146.gif sgtguthrie I like it. Carson Saldanha I liked the previous one of swiping. sgtguthrie It's really a subtle change. You can still swipe. Rebeccadgonzalez *EXCLUSIVE OFFER BY GOOGLE*... !ds165c: +$97/hr pay by google, I am making a good salary from home $7500-$9000/WEEK , which is amazing, one year ago I was jobless in a horrible economy, I thank God every day I was blessed with these instructions and now it's my duty to pay it forward and share it with everyone,Here is I started,,, !ds165c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleMoneyTree445DirectPlaza$97hourly/Careers... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!ds165c:....,....... sgtguthrie Why do you people bother? We just mark your shit as spam and move on. I don't think anyone even reads your spam. Teja Seriously, this is very useful than swipe gesture. On my oneplus 3, when I switch to manual mode and try adjusting focus, ISO etc. by swiping, it accidentally changes to video mode. Hell yeah, thats frustrating. Frisi I'm trying to sideload, but I'm getting this on adb connecting... falling back to older sideload method... error: closed Max I re-enrolled! Hopefully they fixed the Android Auto problems or I'll have to roll back again... swimdude1120 Does the notification/quick settings still look like garbage from DP2? Nick Yes, looks the exact same. swimdude1120 Ah darn Gonzales So I should get O on my Z Play about the time that P is is in beta Brandon David Obert I flashed back to N because I couldn't use Samsung Pay on my Gear S3 when my N6P was on O preview 2. I wonder if that is still the case Frisi Whoa, Aurora Live Wallpaper is gone. O: Michel R. Android O Beta 3 Flashable Image (not ota update) https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html?utm_campaign=android_launch_npreview_061516&utm_source=anddev&utm_medium=blog#flash Jordan L ran flash-all.bat worked great, phone booted up, I bypassed all setup to enable developer options so I could re-lock bootloader, relocked it. booted back up and now I'm stuck on "Checking device info..." anyone else?!?!? rebooted, same thing. I guess I'll just wait. If I can't get past this I can't enable developer tools... can't reflash.. not good. Frisi I also don't see the Navigation Bar options in System UI settings (I'm stuck now with the ones I programmed) Frisi Wi-Fi icon and Mobile icons are now corrected (those two used to be inverted) EvilHowl What device do you have? Frisi Pixel XL EvilHowl Okay. I have a Nexus 5X and DP2 was laggy, I hope DP3 gets better... Frisi So far buttery smooth. Camera launches slightly faster too. EvilHowl Good, maybe I'll try DP3 tomorrow. Pixelexel Is it still smooth? I installed the last one on my 6P and switching between apps and other stuff was really slow. I'd really like to go back to O so if these UI transitions are smooth please let me know. Darth Vader They are really smooth for me. Frisi I just checked switching between apps, smooth and fast. (On DP2 there was some lag and jitter). Nick It seems it's corrected all around. It's back to the way it was in N. Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Thank God!!!!!! vyktorjonas can anyone tell me how it is on the Nexus Player? the last build wasn't very fast, you couldn't close app anymore and couldn't install APKs either JSo I just posted the same question. lol. I hope it improves it. The things I use still work but it is definitely clunky still JSo Anyone using this on a Nexus Player? Any Improvements? sodsavage Big improvement for me, all my apps such as Hulu are working now and the OS is much smoother with no crashes. It's actually performing better then when on Nougat. EvilHowl Anyone using this on a Nexus 5X? Is there the recents lag? SB Yes. A bit laggy. Especially the camera when taking multiple pictures or panoramas. And my bank app didn't work, but that's ok. Ismail Akram As far as I remember 5X had lag issue from the very beginning isn't it? EvilHowl I don't know what lag was it. Scott Harris I had a boot loop problem pop up the other day ago on the O beta. Ended up having to do a factory reset through recovery. Once I got everything set back up after the reset, happened again. I was forced to go back to Nougat. Tempted to re-enroll in the beta but don't know if it's worth the trouble since it seems like it was an app-related issue. Jordan L I'm completely stuck on "Checking device info..." factory wiped. I can't get past it. I guess I'll just keep waiting. my phone may be bricked. tried with no sim in, with sim, off wifi, etc... this happened after I re-locked the bootloader on DP3. could be my first bricked android phone. I googled "android 'checking device info...' " hardly any hits! this is nuts! Greg Signed up for an account here just to say thank you. I was stuck at the same place. I removed the SIM, skipped WiFi connection, now I'm good to go. Thank you so much for coming back and updating your post with the solution. Jordan L are you on Verizon too??? I really feel like this was a carrier issue. it eventually started working for me. I don't know why. I'd LOVE to know what actually is happening during "Checking device info..." clearly it goes to the internet for something. Total Insecurity @ryan whitwam: "Today we're rolling out Developer Preview 3 with the final Android O APIs, the latest system images, and an update to Android Studio to help you get ready for the consumer release later in the summer." Nick Gmail notifications work again. create812 I was wondering about this! Daniel Morata Netflix didn't work for me on the last beta. Is it working on DP3? Let's hope, Nexus 5X. Fayas Has the OTA been pushed to beta devices yet? SB go to the settings and check for an update. at first it will say you're up to date, then it will show you have an update. Fayas Got it. Replying​ after the update 😊 Thank you Jordan L OEM unlocking disabled for anyone on Verizon after flashing this?! man, I'm having a hard time with dp3. clearly I screwed something up as everyone else seems happy... I've been flashing phones for years! JSo If you flashed this, wouldn't that mean your bootloader is already unlocked? I think if it's unlocked already, it's greyed out in the settings. Jordan L "Device is LOCKED" in the bootloader. I f'ed something up. I think Verizon has my bootloader locked even though I bought the phone from Google Michael Tran Chrome 59 installs on this DP YAY! needa Woot. Sure does :). Fayas Holy shit! Why it's all square? Oh god. It's ugly AF! Am I alone? (Nexus 5X) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5bf32afc40521b1768d1e714b76c0d9f272e5d7273e81f1e61b85bba0c2e421a.png ctk4949 Mine arent like that on my Pixel XL. All round icons. JSo Google Now Launcher? I assume this because of the search bar. Fayas Yes. I had Pixel launcher. Removed it see the difference. But still the same. Also in the Settings > Apps also it's Square. Don't have options to change it (Trying figure out if there is any) Cassidy James Blaede You have to turn on Developer Settings by mashing the Build Number in the settings app. Then the shape option shows up in the Pixel Launcher settings. Fayas The option shows. But no circular option. Even on the Google Now Launcher also it's square. No way to change it to square. Only possible to change to other shapes on PIxel Launcher. Not circle for any reason. rndusrnm479461 You can change it in the launcher settings. There are options like square, circle, squircle, cylinder and some more. JSo Are you on the latest beta? Because I thought I read someone mentioned that being removed. Fayas It's not available for me... Cassidy James Blaede You have to turn on Developer Settings by mashing the Build Number in the settings app. Then the shape option shows up in the Pixel Launcher settings. Darth Vader There are no cicular icon options in those settings tho. Anyone else with 5X experiencing this? Fayas Yes, No circular option. I'm on N5X. I saw comments N6P also got the same. matesc Nothing here in the settings - N6P Fayas Now I updated the latest Pixel Launcher, When it's set to default, I still get that same Square icons, But changes to other options. No circle or rounded one. Default is square. WTF Google! Winston The prophecy is coming true. xip To refresh memories... I can't believe we actually got there. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3678d49065fb54fcc9e5288addb16b7b581084c98080a1cc32510b64b6676ea7.jpg eddiepearson Are you done? Are you really? Fruity101079 Ho! a icon (circle for music) in a triangle in a square!? xip Holy shit, seriously. What the flying f are these!? These are so ugly that I actually bothered to take a screenshot, crop it, and post a comment here a day late. https://i.imgur.com/Dz7cmHE.png https://i.imgur.com/hwYlkSl.png https://i.imgur.com/UwTcQKC.png Like, OK, Google, stop. This is starting to get retarded. I don't care if you wanna make the Pixels special with circles and if you want to keep that exclusive or whatever. Just please please please, don't do anything at all to my 5X. (Why the hell would you even do this!? It makes no sense!) ;_; ctk4949 Anyone tried Wells Fargo app, does it work?? I need to deposit some checks!! lol ctk4949 It works :) needa You need my routing and account numbers? My accts have plenty o room to store your checks. ctk4949 lol, u dont want these checks. David Hyman Hopefully it fixes the random crashes it's been causing on my Pixel C! sgtguthrie https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f63746703c57603770453cd7712690339188bac3fd4a3c26e5973a0225ad2c67.png The ota can be pulled now. Besnik Rrustemi id like to see someone upload the Pixel Launcher from this build from a Google Pixel device on APKMirror. Artem Russakovskii It's up now. Besnik Rrustemi Thank you Boss ! I can also confirm that icon shape is still there just install latest pixel launcher,enable dev options and system ui tuner. There's also a new Teardrop icon shape. Wish there was a circle option. (Nexus 6P) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5c57593deb1af7218377ea8cbb14a44cafd918ca99ebe0222ae0cb30e8affc5d.png Fayas Nexus 5X also same. No circle option :( Winston What's teardrop? boop Allo shape Snowsky Mountain Is square with rounded corners the default on the Nexus 6P? And is it possible to change it back to how it was before (or to another shape)? Alexithymia Is anyone else's phone five minutes slow using network time? needa im one to two min behind my other att phone. blindexecutioner Man fuck Google and their persistent notifications. They're so shitty when it comes to UI design. Cyan Thayn Options for notification priority appear to be gone for me. In fact, the whole notification management system seems kinda broken right now, sometimes some settings don't display at all when they should. This is sure going to be annoying until fixed. bhanik Is youtube picture in picture feature working in DP3 ? needa Yep. Been working for weeks. bhanik Thanks. For some reason its not working on my Pixel running DP3 Android o needa Just want to verify... with video playing in portrait mode, not shrunken down, you cannot hit home or multi and have video go into pip. I had issues at first too, but then a couple of days later it started working. I know I went into settings and messed around. Seems like there was something in there. But as I said... it took a day or two after messing with it before it worked. bhanik Yes. So in Settings -> Apps & Notifications -> Special App access -> Picture in Picture mode, I see Youtube has access When a youtube video is playing and I hit the home button, the entire app goes to background and the video stops playing. needa That's sucks. Are you using 'red'? That might be the difference. bhanik No. Havent used red. Unfortunately no free trial for me since I already tried it when it was launched StankyChikin Don't be afraid of the GoatBeef Mike in KC Do you have to lock bootloader to flash DP3? Thinking about giving it a try but I'm currently on Pure Nexus ROM. EvilHowl No, you must have it unlocked. boop Still no Files app Rob Perhaps it's coming in final release. I'm hoping! David Now square icons? How do I change them like in DP2? Rusty 1 are y'all like real police or internet police.. or just internet safety patrol Rusty 1 hey don't be hackin me im new at this Rusty 1 jus wanna learn how to operate phone Rusty 1 hello can u hear me AFDTechTalk Refreshing to know the notification icon mess has been fixed. That persistent WiFi icon was killing me. ctk4949 Yes!! Im glad that is gone!! Flint_PS Is it still choppy on Nexus 5X? DP2 was horrible. Fernando Pena Srsly Google? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ac3feb4f625fd752d6925ca21a76cc26bd09e38ecda081f6a5c9ffa6a3efc00f.png Fernando Pena I suggest not to install the latest pixel launcher from DP3. The icons in the new one are kinda messy, just stick with the stable version... theAlexo83 Can someone confirm please if apple music app is not crushing on this build? It used to crush on the previous build.. Thanks! sdcoiner76 The apps on this version seem very unstable. I am seeing lots of crashes. Also when I install an app the icon does not appear on the home screen automatically. Kevin Johnson Where is the June security update? Have DP3 on 6P, but no June...

There are those who see the upgrade as Android’s chance to blend the best of every operating system. The pending Android Lollipop Moto X 2014 update was one of the reasons I upgraded to a Moto X 2014 when my contract with T-Mobile finally ended and now it’s available. Earlier today Motorola released the Moto X 2014 update for is Moto X 2014 and the Moto G 2014. Here’s what some first impressions of the operating system based on my use of it thus far. Read: Android Lollipop Moto X 2014 Updates Arrives Upgrading & Performance When I made the decision to switch from Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system to Android earlier this year, I went it knowing that this upgrade was going to happen. I also went into it knowing that most Android device maker’s track record for upgrading devices was pretty checkered. I wanted a device that I could count on updates for and that’s exactly how I ended up with a Moto X 2014 Pure Edition. Upgrading to Android Lollipop on the Moto X 2014 was a pretty straight forward affair. Motorola announced the upgrade and I went into the Settings app and downloaded it over a wireless internet connection. Upgrade time was roughly 20 minutes, I’d say. The upgrade process could be more of a pain for users who have a Moto X 2014 from a carrier. Certainly they’ll be waiting days or weeks for the upgrade. Since the Moto X 2014 rebooted from its Android Lollipop upgrade I haven’t noticed any sluggishness. At least, nothing that I’m willing to say is a big issue at this point. Every instrument and connection on my Moto X 2014 worked just as well as it did before. New Features Let’s talk about new features. Android Lollipop on the Moto X 2014 is stuffed with them and they all seem to make a lot of sense. Design Android Lollipop on the Moto X 2014 includes a lot of the things that I liked about Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system. That starts, of course, with the Material Design Language Google showed off earlier this year and began rolling out in app updates. Everything is stark and minimalist. There’s a big focus on content and I love it. When I’m looking through a contact I want to see that contact’s photo and information. I don’t want extras competing with that.  Lock Screen & Notifications The new lock screen and notifications in Android Lollipop are the first thing that hit you. This release gives users more granular notification control. Immediately, the Moto X 2014 asked if I wanted to hide notification information from apps when it is locked. I did, and while I was still able to figure out pretty easily what apps and services had info for me, none of my info was publically available. I quickly turned it off because my Xbox Music controls won’t work though. I suspect that’s something that Microsoft and other app developers will need to investigate but we’re still early days. The lock screen notifications themselves look a bit different and I have to say I’m not in love with the look them. That being said, Being able to access and clear all notifications without jumping into the Moto X 2014 is awesome and I’m sure i’ll be using that a lot. Again, almost every app has been upgraded with the new design language in mind. That includes Play Now and a few extras. About the only thing that has changed on the Google Launcher is the navigation buttons. They are just shapes now. The app drawer is now pearl white, making it easier to see different apps if you’re searching in a hurry. The notification shade for Android Lollipop is the star of the show here. Google has gone and integrated quick action settings, notification access and user account switching into one single area.  It looks great, but it also feels like you have more power at your fingertips. I haven’t found any settings to customize these though, which is pretty ridiculous considering I have an empty space being wasted on Screen Casting. There’s a new multitasking menu that treats everything as cards. I’m not seeing why everyone made such a big deal out of this other than the web app uses for things opened in Chrome. There are other changes too. Android Lollipop is littered with changes and most are them are for the better. Moto Suite Google clearly took a lot of what software designers at Motorola added to Android and included it for everyone. For Moto X 2014 owners this means that there are some fundamentally different things happening. Moto X 2014 users have Moto Display. Wave your hand across the screen and you see what notifications you have waiting. In addition to this the device lights up part of the screen when new notifications come in. The Moto X 2014 with Android Lollipop adds a new option to turn this off so that you can enable Google’s version. It’s called Ambient Display and it doesn’t have access to the infrared sensors so that hand waving thing isn’t possible for those that switch over. I’d rather keep Moto Display. Downtime is Google co-opting some of the options found in Moto Assist. Now users can choose which things happening on their Moto X 2014 are priority interruptions and which aren’t. Certain days can be configured for Downtime. For example, you can hide email notifications from your work account on the weekend. I absolutely love this option and I’ll be playing with it a lot. With a good visual design and easy installation, I’d say Android Lollipop on the Moto X 2014 is pretty great. If you have a Pure Edition Moto X 2014, download when you can.

After a spate of terror attacks, Western leaders appear to be contemplating the sort of internet controls that Asia has become infamous for By Bhavan Jaipragas 11 Jun 2017 0 Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on LinkedIn Share on Google Plus Share on Sina 0Comments Armed police stand over one of three terrorists shot after an incident at London Bridge and Borough Market last weekend. Photo: AFP Silicon Valley’s deep-pocketed internet giants have long been the darlings of Western governments, but these days the likes of the “GAFAs” – Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon – just cannot catch a break with officialdom on either side of the Atlantic. Fresh from battling the United States’ new immigration curbs, leading web firms are now facing accusations in Europe of inadvertently abetting terror, and the spectre of Western policymakers enacting the sort of internet regulations that Asian countries from China to Singapore have become infamous for. After the assault on London last week – Britain’s third terror attack in three months – Prime Minister Theresa May slammed internet companies for being partly responsible for providing extremist ideology “the safe space it needs to breed”. May, whose Conservative Party held onto power after a knife-edge general election on Thursday, urged “allied democratic governments to reach international agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremism and terrorist planning”. May’s comments are the clearest sign yet that Western leaders are on the verge of banding together to ratchet up control over the internet – against the wishes of the tech industry. Web policing has traditionally been frowned upon in the West and is seen as a regressive practice consigned to Asia’s less democratic societies – think China’s Great Internet Firewall, for example. In Southeast Asia, countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand have routinely faced criticism for using internet laws to suppress online government critics. Is Hong Kong ready to combat global terrorism? In comparison, Hong Kong has minimal internet controls beyond laws criminalising the distribution of obscenities like child pornography. The city’s Security Bureau did not directly respond to This Week in Asia queries on whether it has demanded the take down of extremist content, but said the police requests information and cooperation from organisations including internet platforms “in accordance with relevant laws and established procedures”. “Whether in the real world or in the cyber world, anyone who commits an unlawful act shall be criminally responsible and brought to justice,” the bureau said. May and her continental counterparts like France’s Emmanuel Macron say they are not seeking new laws to browbeat online dissidents. Instead, they want specific powers that will make it compulsory for sites to immediately take down terror-related material when it appears. They also want case-by-case “backdoor” access to smartphone communication such as text messages on apps like WhatsApp. And it is not only the officials who are blaming the internet for fuelling the jihadis. Valeria Khadija Collina, the Italian mother of one of three men who went on a knife rampage near London Bridge last weekend in Britain’s most recent terror attack, said in the aftermath that her son was radicalised partly because “he had the internet and that’s where everything comes from”. London Bridge terror: What Britain has to learn from Turkey REGULATION NOT THE CURE Industry insiders acknowledge the web’s influence on the new waves of young, tech-savvy extremists, but say government regulation is not the cure to the problem. “Fighting terrorism should not translate into fighting internet freedom and security,” Andy Yen, the co-founder of the Geneva-based hack-proof email service ProtonMail, told This Week in Asia. The service, seen as one of the world’s most secure email providers, relies on end-to-end encryption technology like many other state-of-the-art web platforms including WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. This means messages are scrambled while in transmission rendering them unreadable to eavesdropping government agencies. Even the service providers have no means of accessing the information. British officials have complained that this makes counterterrorism efforts harder. Under laws passed last November, they have wide-ranging surveillance powers to intercept online communications but have so far been unsuccessful in getting access to encrypted services. In the case of the March attack on the British parliament – when a terrorist drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a policeman – investigators have been unable to access the WhatsApp messages sent by the perpetrator Khalid Masood. In a bid to justify the government’s demands, the British interior minister Amber Rudd in May compared the creation of back doors to encryption services as akin to traditional wiretapping with a legal warrant. Experts say such thinking is naive. “Calls to weaken the encryption that is used to secure the internet really represent a fundamental misunderstanding of how the internet works,” Yen said. Islamic State lone wolves: the risk in Hong Kong’s strategy Singapore-based cybersecurity expert John Ellis said “systems that implement encryption back doors would only invite attacks from a variety of cyber adversaries ranging from nation states, criminal operators and potentially cyber terrorists”. Bryce Boland, the Asia-Pacific chief technology officer for the cybersecurity firm FireEye, said if governments forced tech firms to establish back doors to the encryption technology, “we’ll all become less secure and criminals will still find workarounds”. THOUSANDS RADICALISED ONLINE Encryption aside, other experts acknowledged the government’s complaint that extremist online content is too easily accessible. Britain’s prime minister “is correct that thousands of individuals in the West and elsewhere are radicalised because of the internet and social media,” said Steve Stalinsky, a Washington-based expert. A Google search from a Hong Kong location by This Week in Asia produced working links to last month’s edition of the Islamic State’s English-language e-magazine Rumiyah. The mobile app for the IS-linked Amar News Agency could also be downloaded, even though it is unavailable on the app stores of leading mobile operating systems. The Rumiyah edition contained a full page detailing ways for jihadis to acquire a heavy-duty truck, pick a location, and execute attacks. Since an extremist ploughed a truck into Bastille Day crowds in Nice last July, killing 84 people, there have been four vehicle-related terror attacks in Europe including the rampage at London Bridge last week that left eight people dead. In Asia, governments say foreign militants from across the region are flocking to the Philippine town of Marawi to help build a regional IS base there partly due to online calls to action by the group’s leaders on these web platforms. In a report released on June 1, the Singapore government pointed to IS “online propaganda” as one of the factors leading to rising radicalisation. Stalinsky, whose Middle East Media Research Institute archives and researches jihadist online content, said efforts by social platforms to remove such material from the web should not be understated. “Facebook has been leading the way over the past two plus years, and Twitter grudgingly joined in these efforts after lots of pressure from governments in the West,” he said. Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook this week told Bloomberg the company had been cooperating with Britain “not only in law enforcement kind of matters but on some of the attacks”. Facebook, which vowed to “aggressively remove terrorist content” following last week’s London assault, last month said it was adding 3,000 new employees to screen for inappropriate material on its platform. The popular encrypted text messaging app Telegram however remains errant, experts say. The Berlin-based app, developed by the exiled Russian internet guru Pavel Durov, was used by IS to claim responsibility for last week’s vehicle attack as well as the May 23 attack at a pop concert in Manchester. It is seen as superior to WhatsApp because apart from encrypted technology, data that is not scrambled is kept in infrastructure across the world, making it harder for authorities to subpoena. Has Chinese pressure forced Pakistan U-turn on anti-India terror groups “It has become the go-to platform for IS, al-Qaeda, its offshoots, and every other main jihadist organisation worldwide – from the Taliban to Hamas and Hezbollah,” Stalinsky said. The company did not respond to queries. A spokesman previously told This Week in Asia it relied on users to report “Islamic State content” before the incriminating chat groups are shut down. As governments train their eyes on the internet, there is a risk they may take their foot off the pedal in offline counterterrorism efforts, some observers say. OFFLINE RADICALISATION Peter Neumann and Shiraz Maher, two leading Britain-based counterterrorism experts, said their research showed “radicalisation rarely happens exclusively online, and the role of the internet is complex”. “The internet plays an important role in terms of disseminating information and building the brand of organisations such as IS, but it is rarely sufficient in replacing the potency and charm of a real-world recruiter,” the two researchers wrote in a BBC commentary this week, drawing on information they had gathered about some 800 Western recruits of IS. At least one of the London Bridge attackers was part of the banned extremist network al-Muhajiroun, founded by Anjem Choudary, a leading British Islamic preacher jailed last year for encouraging support of IS. Some of Choudary’s associates, including fellow British preacher Abu Haleema, the Syrian-born Omar Bakri Muhammad and the US-based imam Ahmad Musa Jebril remain free and a source of inspiration for militants. “It is one thing for the internet companies to pull down radical propaganda,” said Neumann and Maher. “But they face an uphill battle while preachers such as Choudary have spent years spreading their message virtually unchallenged on British streets.” ■ Bhavan Jaipragas recent articles Indian actor’s accent sparks debate on Singaporeans’ attitude to race 3 Jun 2017 6 Comments Amazon Prime Now: Can Singapore deliver? 27 May 2017 9 Comments Mindanao violence: Duterte’s excuse to impose martial law? 25 May 2017 3 Comments Newsletter Sign-up Asian insights and analysis direct to your inbox.

Every day at The Direct Transfer we sort through over 1,500 news items  about cities and share the best ones with our email list. At the end of  the week we take some of the most popular stories and share them with Urban Milwaukee readers. They are national links, sometimes entertaining and sometimes absurd, but hopefully useful. Transit advocates seek congestion pricing for New York: Transit advocates in New York City are calling for the city to override the State of New York and implement congestion pricing in Manhattan, but it’s unclear whether Mayor Bill de Blasio would support that. The push from advocates references a 1957 state law which supposedly allows the city to set its own bridge toll rates. (Curbed NYC). Read more. Nobody wants these McMansions: Baby boomers don’t want to live in big McMansion-style suburban houses anymore, and nobody wants to buy them either. Both younger generations and old want more urban environments with proximity to amenities, creating a mismatch in demand. (Realtor) Read more. Air pollution, mapped (by Google): Researchers are using Google’s Street View vehicles to measure different air pollutants. Through 14,000 miles of travel and three million measurements, the cars saw high levels of black carbon, nitrous oxide, and other pollutants in area of Oakland known for instances of childhood asthma and other diseases that come from poor air quality. (Google Keyword). Read more. Should we have an infrastructure garage sale? The Trump Administration wants to copy an infrastructure financing scheme popular in Australia called asset recycling. The idea is to sell of old infrastructure and reinvest the money into… new infrastructure. The idea isn’t without its challenges, including that local governments want to keep public control of assets and that the tax laws related to this are complicated. (Governing). Read more. For delivery in densifying cities, no need to reinvent the wheel: As European cities grow and become more crowded, delivery demand is going to go up. New ideas (which may not be so new) include possibly sharing warehouses in dense urban areas, sharing transportation delivery methods the same way we share transit rides, relying on time-tested modes like water transportation and trucking. (JLL Real Views). Read more. Quote of the Week Working class whites or African Americans could have afforded a home [in Levittown] especially with a mortgage that was FHA-insured and a Veterans Administration loan, perhaps, that required no down payment. It wasn’t affordability—African Americans were as able to afford those homes as whites were—but they were prohibited from doing so by the federal government. Now those houses sell for $300,000 or $400,000, so the white families that moved there gained $200,000 or $300,000 in equity while black families gained nothing. – Richard Rothstein in Slate discussing his new book The Color of Law, in which he points at the federal government as responsible for neighborhood segregation.

Chrome 59 on the desktop has a new Material settings page Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/05 3:15pm PDTJun 5, 2017 7 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares164 Applications Google News Google has been a bit slow to adopt Material Design in Chrome. The browser got a Material makeover in Chrome 52 for Mac and 53 for Windows, but the Settings page has remained relatively unchanged since Chrome's introduction. Chrome 59, which was released today on the desktop, includes a new Material settings area. I'm sure most of you have seen the browser's old settings menu before, but just for reference, here it is: And here is Chrome 59's settings page (click on the images for a larger preview):   The new design has been in testing for a while, accessible through a Chrome flag, but now it's visible by default. You still have all of the basic settings, like appearance and search engine options, at the top with a link at the bottom to show advanced settings. The hamburger menu doesn't change pages, only skips to the selected section on the main settings page. While this is definitely an improvement, I do think it could still be a bit better. Just like Android's stock settings app, everything is in one column (in this case, with a maximum width of 680px), so there is a lot of wasted space on widescreen monitors. Google could at least have the hamburger menu pinned to the side for wide displays. Also, the extensions page is still using the old design. You can manually update Chrome by clicking the menu icon, navigating to Help > About Chrome, and waiting for the new version to download. We'll have a more complete post about Chrome 59 once it is released for Android. Source: Chrome Releases blog Tags chrome chrome 59 desktop material design options settings subscribe ...

Berkay I hate it, everything is now hidden in the hamburger menu and they increased the padding on bookmarks which no one asked for. WitnessG Nothing is hidden in the hamburger menu. You can scroll down and find everything like before. The hamburger menu is just a shortcut to whichever settings you want. TedPhillips the main upshot i think is that there are some upcoming settings that will only be visible in the material settings UI (like night mode settings), that have been behind flags for a while. didn't realize it was this close to being de-flagged. Lord Argyris We are living in a Material world, and Chrome is a Material...er...browser. I'm not sure how I feel about it. The individual options within each card seem a bit squished vertically, as though there should be more padding between each one somehow. Also, the obvious issue of the tiny, thin column with nothing around it. It's almost like Google got used to using its own tablets and figured everybody actually liked using interfaces designed for phones that don't scale to take advantage of additional space. Hint, guys: we don't (make the settings expand to two columns when there's enough space). Gabby I've had it enabled from the flags for a while (Downloads as well). I'm looking forward to the Extensions getting the same makeover. But I also think past a certain width, it doesn't make sense to auto-hide the sidebar. Putting things in multiple columns wouldn't always work without grouping unrelated items. kmare And finally, gtk3 enabled by default on Linux!

Jones Investments has emerged as the buyer of 15 Barrow Street, a low-rise industrial warehouse that was on the market for €2m last year. Jones plans to demolish the building and replace it with an enterprise centre with “collaborative workspace”, a cafe, landscaped courtyard and a roof terrace. The new building would include a double basement and span almost 3,800 sq m, well over double the size of the existing building on the site. It is close to Google’s headquarters complex on Barrow Street and opposite the Bolands Quay… Want to read more? Register with a few details to continue reading this article.

A penalty in the shopping-search probe could come within weeks and many expect it to exceed a $1.2 billion fine on Intel Corp. in 2009. That would be another show of strength by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager who slapped Apple Inc. with a 13 billion-euro ($14.5 billion) tax bill in August. Google is a top priority case for her as European politicians and publishers push for action against the Mountain View, California-based company that’s come to dominate online advertising. "If there’s going to be a fine, it has to be the biggest ever," said Stephen Kinsella, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who represents companies that have complained to the EU about Google. “The European Commission has strongly signaled that if there is going to be a fine it would need to be at a level that would have deterrent effect.” Timing on a decision could slip and Google representatives and the commission both remain tight-lipped, declining to talk about it. The company hasn’t yet met with regulators to discuss a potential EU order or how it might implement any changes, according to a person familiar with the probe, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Major Rulings But the EU has a long tradition of issuing major rulings just before officials quit Brussels for their summer break. Last July saw more than $3 billion in fines for truckmakers including Daimler AG and Volvo AB. With one eye on the impending decision, some Google officials have been getting ready, moving vacation dates or making sure they are close to the action, other people familiar with the probe said. Vestager “has a keen eye to maximizing the impact of any announcement on a case and July sees a slowdown in the news cycle,” said Christopher Bright, a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling in Brussels, who’s not involved in the Google probe. “Together with the advanced state of preparation of the case, this points to a July announcement for Google.” Vestager isn’t afraid of big numbers, setting records with the tax bill for Apple -- which it’s appealing -- and the cartel fine for truck companies. Facebook Inc. may have got off lightly with a mere 110 million-euro penalty for not providing correct information in the WhatsApp merger probe. Top Spot Intel holds the top spot for a monopoly abuse with a fine of 1.06 billion euros. That represented more than 3 percent of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10 percent of yearly sales regulators can impose. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up As Alphabet Inc. pulled in $90 billion in revenue last year, any fine would be capped at $9 billion. But within that limit, the actual size of the fine would be calculated from sales in the market under investigation. Alphabet’s Google division generated $79 billion in ad revenue in 2016. While it doesn’t break out sales for shopping search advertising, ads from search provide most of its revenue. The EU also factors in how many years the illegal conduct lasted. Regulators say the systematic promotion of Google’s own shopping search started in 2008, allowing Google Product Search and Google Shopping grow more quickly than rival comparison-shopping services. A large penalty and an order for Google to change its ways might just be the start. The EU is also examining its AdSense advertising service and its Android mobile phone software. The Android investigation goes to the heart of what Google does in the mobile-phone space, questioning the strict terms Google places on phone makers and app developers to use the software it provides for free. Cash Pile While money matters, Alphabet has a cash pile of more than $92 billion as of March 31 and any changes to its business model ordered by the EU may “probably be of more significance," said Spencer Waller, a competition law professor at Loyola University in Chicago. "I doubt this is going to hamstring the company but the commission is going to order what it thinks is necessary to give competition a chance," he said. EU’s claims that Google Shopping results harm competition "are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics," general counsel Kent Walker wrote in a blog post last year. The EU’s case "rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online" because price comparison sites aren’t the only way to shop around. Google can appeal, which could take years. Microsoft only won a 4 percent cut to its fine. Intel has been waiting eight years for a final ruling. Vestager’s move against Google is sure to attract further criticism that she’s unfairly singled out U.S. companies. Transatlantic tensions are already on the rise after President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, adding to concerns over global trade. "We’re entering a period in the States where foreign competition enforcement against U.S.-based companies is going to be a matter of more public comment and criticism," said Waller. "I think you’ll hear similar things" to the outcry over the Apple tax bill when the Google probe wraps up, he said. On the other hand, Vestager is under pressure in Europe from companies and politicians eager to see her punish Google. Complaints about Google continue to pour in to the EU, most recently from publishers about Android software. And new fronts could open; Vestager tweeted recently that she’d be playing close attention to Google’s new ad-blocking feature. For Google, there could be more summers like this. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

By Denisse Moreno On 06/10/17 AT 5:47 PM Close Apple and Amazon are fierce competitors, especially now that the iPhone maker has released its own home speaker. However, the companies seem to have been putting their differences aside lately. This year, Amazon and Apple introduced changes that goes beyond their rivalry, with the most recent move announced this week at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Read: iOS 11 And watchOS 4: New Apple Watch And iPhone Health Features Will Help With Your Workouts The Apple logo is displayed at a store in the central business district of Sydney, April 6, 2017. Photo: Getty Images Amazon And The Apple TV Apple announced the Amazon video app will finally come to the Apple TV worldwide this year. The move makes it easier for users, since Amazon Prime subscribers previously had to use AirPlay on their device to stream video onto their Apple TV. Amazon’s Prime Video app will be available to those who own generation two, three and four of the Apple TV, Amazon said on Twitter. “You asked (a lot). We listened. Amazon Prime Video is coming to the TV App and all Apple TVs this year,” Amazon tweeted. Apart from the Amazon video app, a BuzzFeed report said Amazon will also start reselling the Apple TV on its site. The online retailer stopped carrying the Apple TV and Google Chromecast devices in 2015. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said at the time that the company wanted its customers to be able to watch Amazon video on devices sold by Amazon. However, neither Amazon nor Apple have confirmed that this will happen. Siri and Alexa Apple and Amazon’s virtual assistants, Siri and Alexa, could work together in the future, David Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president of devices, suggested recently. He said the company believes there should be more openness among rival virtual assistant platforms. Limp said the online retailer is willing to work with Apple or Google to ensure Siri and Alexa are compatible. “You should be able to tell 'Alexa, ask Siri X,’” he said. Read: Siri vs. Alexa vs. Google Assistant: Apple Struggling With Privacy Concerns Limp's comments come after Alexa recently penetrated through the iPhone via the Amazon iOS app. iPhone and iPad users can use Alexa by tapping on the microphone icon on the right side of the search box. Alexa on the iOS app can help users with their shopping, track orders, give weather updates, play music and answer other commands. Alexa’s power is limited on iOS though, since it can only be used while the app is open. HomePod VS. Echo Devices When Apple revealed its new speaker at WWDC, it tried hard not to sell it as an Amazon Echo competitor. The HomePod is powered by Siri, but Apple didn’t mention until it was half way into the segment about the speaker. Apple’s HomePod competes with Amazon’s numerous Echo devices, including the latest ones, Echo Look and Echo Show. Amazon’s Echo speakers stream music from Prime Music, Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn, iHeartRadio and other services except Apple Music. Limp previously told Bloomberg Amazon would "love to have Apple, but they’re not super big” on opening up Apple Music integration. Although there are some parts Apple and Amazon won’t let go of, the recent moves show we may see more cooperation between the two companies in the future.

Duo v12 enables auto-hiding controls, hints at low-bandwidth audio mode and a couple logical notifications [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 12:19pm PDTJun 8, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 58 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares116 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Auto-hide controls during video chat 2 Teardown 2.1 Low-bandwidth audio mode 2.2 New notifications 3 Download Duo remains one of Google's most minimal apps, so it feels like even small changes were carefully considered before earning a place in an update. The latest version of Duo is rolling out now with one such tweak that allows the on-screen controls to disappear when they're not in use. A teardown also reveals plans to make audio calls even more resilient on low-bandwidth connections and to add a couple of notifications that might give users more reasons to open the app more often. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Auto-hiding video chat controls Auto-hide controls during video chat The key element in any video chat is obviously the video, and nothing gets in the way more than a busy interface that blocks most of your view. Okay, so Duo's interface was already very minimalistic, but that doesn't mean there aren't still a few things to take away. The latest update does just that as the buttons to hang up, mute audio, and switch between front and rear cameras will now vanish shortly after a call begins. Just like most apps that have an overlay with buttons on top of video, tapping on the screen will briefly restore the controls. The little round window with a live view of yourself is the only part of the interface that doesn't auto-hide. Tapping it still swaps the primary view between your own camera and the remote feed. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Low-bandwidth audio mode It was about two months ago when Duo gained audio-only calling, which was a good thing for people that don't want to video chat or simply don't have the bandwidth to maintain a decent video feed. However, it seems Google may be experimenting with lowering the bar for data throughput even further. A couple of new lines in the apk indicate that there's a mode in development that will switch into a low bandwidth mode that would presumably be optimized for really limited data environments. <string name="pref_lowbitratemode_title">Low bandwidth audio mode</string> <string name="pref_lowbitratemode_dlg">Enable low bandwidth (2G) audio mode</string> Even though the setting described by the lines above is not marked as a testing mode or developer tool, that's probably how it's being used. After all, regular people probably shouldn't need to switch to this manually, it's just something that should happen automatically if bandwidth is bad enough that it becomes necessary. Sometimes modes like this are also added just so developers can test to see what happens in special conditions, and they are never intended to become part of the feature set. I doubt that's the case here for the simple reason that those modes usually have descriptions like "simulate low bandwidth" or "test poor network conditions." Of course, we might never know the difference if Duo is intended to switch into low bandwidth mode transparently. New notifications This one is really simple, but it deserves a quick mention. There had previously been text for a setting that would enable notifications about "contacts and features" as new information came up. As far as I'm aware, the option and notifications it may have related to were never actually live. the old line <string name="pref_engagement_notifications_enabled_summary">Get updates on contacts and features.</string> That line is now gone, but in its place is text for a pair of notifications that make a bit more sense. Users will soon have two options: One enables notifications for new features in Duo and the other will enable notifications when people in your contact list join Duo. code <string name="pref_new_features_notifications_enabled_summary">Get updates on brand new features</string> <string name="pref_new_features_notifications_enabled_title">New in Duo</string> <string name="pref_new_features_notifications_enabled_key">new_features_notifications_enabled_key</string> <string name="pref_contacts_notifications_enabled_summary">Get alerts when your contacts join Duo</string> <string name="pref_contacts_notifications_enabled_title">Contact updates</string> <string name="pref_contacts_notifications_enabled_key">contacts_notifications_enabled_key</string> Whether or not you're interested in a notification about new features will probably depend on how closely you follow Android Police and if you're reading a teardown about Duo. Admit it, if you're reading this now, you'll turn this on when it becomes available. Getting notifications about other people joining Duo is a bit different and probably depends heavily on how big your contact list is and if it's filled with people that would be super curious about trying video chat. Too many of either of these will surely lead to them being turned off... But I kinda doubt that's going to be the problem.

Beebs Kitty cam? Can Duo now auto answer for a pet cam? Ryan With a web interface and the ability to have more than just two people in a call Id love to use it, but until then no go. I do too many group chats to give up hangouts. jcopernicus They should auto hide the app. Borgman Anyone with an iphone, how does the overall visual quality compare to Facetime. Just curious madmaglio Dou rivaled Facetime in quality for me when it first came out. Lately it's been terrible, almost unuseable. I use facetime on my ipad in same conditions and its perfection. It makes me sad. Borgman Damn, that's disappointing to hear :/ sam1331 I can't compare to FaceTime, but I use it frequently and it looks great. drcaveman You're right I noticed that to recently even on decent WiFi the quality in the past several weeks has gone way down Harsha I don't receive any missed call notification in Duo unless I open the app explicitly. Anyone else? Caio Everton Yeah, that happens to me too. I tried with no success posting in Duo app forum, they always hint its me connection, even if my wifi is strong at home and no other app suffers from disappearing notifications. Harsha Yup.. no connection problems with me either. It's so annoying when there are no notification at all. Also at times the other person would have tried calling me and Duo would not have ringed up on my end. Sounds like file server issue to me. Caio Everton Oh finally I've found someone with the same problems! Which phone are you using? I was starting to think it was just my original Moto X getting old, messing with this specific app. Harsha I'm using the OnePlus One. Even I myself was thinking that it's because that my phone is getting older. However it happens with my friend's OP3T too. Caio Everton Can you post about it on this thread? Just to let them know I'm not the only one having these problems. https://productforums.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/duo/5MwBvk9NMSM/4QMCFqfEBQAJ Santos Chavez Nah, I haven't opened the app in a while but I always get notifications of missed calls, as well as the call appearing right as the person calls. Probably just something wrong with your phone in particular derk p duo BURNS thru data. i was on it for about 30 minutes the other night, how about it used 334 MB. thank goodness i have unlmtd but you know, not everyone does and if they dont realize it they could burn their plan up!!!! xyz "Duo remains one of Google's most minimal apps" in that it's used by a minimal number of people. Santos Chavez That is very subjective, of course. For instance for me 75% of the people on my contacts list uses it, most of them being me pushing for them to try it and them falling in love with it. DragoCubed I can't get anyone to use duo. Everyone uses whatsapp for video calls and chat. No one I knows have even heard of duo. The last time I laughed at duo someone bashed on me. Santos Chavez Yeah, it doesn't help that WhatsApp has video calling now. My other contacts who don't use Duo have WhatsApp so that kills their reason to use it. Luckily (?) only a small amount of my contacts have WhatsApp and didn't really have any video chat apps beforehand, hence why I was able to convince them to try Duo. DragoCubed Ooh. Everyone I know uses whatsapp. Marcelove You could use this simple rule : Google'apps that make no sense only get a respectful public at USA... Outside it others options way better are used... jdrch The funny thing about this news is I read the headline and went "Duo? WTH is that?" Grey Wait so before this update the on-screen display always showed those buttons? andy_o It was a bug actually, it happened when the were accessibility services enabled, like Tasker and LastPass, so not everyone had it. Alamda Ali nnnNice Winston Duo needs to be more efficient about running in background. How do I know? Even after exiting, it keeps the capacitive softlight on my S7 on long after I've left the app. angryone Well, they keep coming out with updates with new and improved features but keep skipping over the most important ones. For instance, I, my family, my friends, and just about any and every one that I know to make video calls do so on their tablets. Phones are too small for the purpose. But Google doesn't seem to get that. Or that we require the ability to sync our accounts over multiple devices. Without these features, Duo will die off regardless of its great features or how much it uses and/or saves. DragoCubed And why is it connected to our phone number? Everyone I know has a google account. Multi device and web support would be easier a google sign in. I also wish we could group call and hide video from my side. Duo is practically dead to me for as long as these developers continue working on it. Santos Chavez Duo is great, but I do wish it were multi platform. They could keep the whole only two people per call thing, but you're able to place a call from tablet---> phone for example. Even better, Phone---->PC DragoCubed Hangouts is still so much better. Can you hide your video yet? Can you use it on the web? chocolate_drizzle The best thing Google could do for Duo's popularity is add seamless integration into the Google Phone, Contacts, and Android Messages app. I think adding a simple video calling button to those apps will increase the use Duo a lot.

The upcoming meetings are described as “tech week,” by sources familiar with the White House. Read: Emmanuel Macron, Trump Feud: French President Trolls With Make Our Planet Great Again Website Leaders from companies including Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Intel and Oracle will get together with Trump’s team. Other firms invited were Adobe, Akamai and Qualcomm, which is in a legal battle with Apple. Trump transition team adviser Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, will also attend the meetings. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Republican Congressional leadership at the White House in Washington, June 6, 2017. Photo: Reuters The main event will be on June 19 for Trump’s new American Technology Council meeting. The companies’ chief executives will meet with the administration in Washington, D.C., to discuss ways to modernize government and the services it offers to Americans and will touch on policies like immigration, the report said. Later in the month, tech experts and the Trump team will discuss drones, the internet of things, autonomous cars, investments in emerging markets and the future of the country’s workforce. Trump’s Rocky Relationship With The Tech Industry The planned meetings come after the tech industry expressed its disappointment over Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement last week. Trump ditched the Paris agreement saying it “disadvantages the United States” and would “undermine” the country’s economy. After the president announced his decision, elected officials, business leaders and tech companies spoke out against the decision. Parties, including Google, Lyft, Adobe, Tesla, Apple, Amazon and Yahoo! signed a “We’re Still In” statement vowing to work “together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions.” Read: Internet Spy Law: Trump Administration, Intel Leaders, Republican Senators Want To Make FISA Section 702 Permanent Apple CEO Tim Cook said Trump made the wrong decision regarding the Paris climate agreement. “I think it’s not in the best interest of the United States what he decided,” Cook told Bloomberg. “My view is that first and foremost things are about, can you help your country and if you can help your country and you do that by interacting, then you do it. The country eclipses politics.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who worked as an advisor for the Trump administration, left Trump’s business advisory councils after the president announced his decision. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said when he announced his departure. Trump previously met with tech leaders last December before he took office. Musk, Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and other tech leaders attended the summit at Trump Tower. At that time Trump praised the tech sector, promised to do "anything we can do" to help the industry and even told executives to call him or his people directly if they needed anything. The affection didn’t last long. Tech leaders expressed their outrage after Trump introduced his travel ban in January.

View All 65 Articles In This Series Android O's third developer preview has just landed, and we're already spotting some pretty cool changes. Among the first we spotted is color-coding for rich media notifications, meaning that these notifications will be themed based on album art / video thumbnails.   It appears that Google is using pastel/muted colors (I'm not an artist, so excuse me if this isn't the correct terminology) to produce these notifications. This is probably to ensure that while the notifications are easier on the eyes, less boring, and more immediately identifiable, they're still not overly shouty. Smart move, Google.   left: 7.1.1 Nougat. right: 8.0 O DP3. In addition to this color-coding, the thumbnail now fades into the notification. This was done not only for a minor visual effect, but it also allows the album art / thumbnail to get noticeably larger while still leaving a decent amount of space for the title and author of the work. For apps that contain thumbnails that are wide-screen (namely YouTube), you'll unfortunately get some black bars on the top and bottom, but that's an issue that was already present prior to DP3. You'll see these pretty notifications from music apps such as Google Play Music, Spotify, and YouTube Music, as well as apps that allow videos to be played in the background like YouTube Red and Chrome. It's definitely a sweet addition, and I'm glad Google is continuing to add little tweaks even in the second-to-last O developer preview.

I really, reeeally like this. Awesome! Mark I love these emoji. What a shame they will die rndusrnm479461 Oh my god. It's beautiful... David Onter The fading looks hideous, Google should just do it like Phonograph used to. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5af0b6c17ab07d0c012bdf0bc1a5fff9c0309c6a4ab71636186c32e483c977aa.png whispy_snippet Material design offers guidance, not a set of hard rules. If everything was completely flat it would get stale really quickly. I don't see a problem with the odd gradient. Jonathan Hernández Please tell me that Phonograph doesn't use that layout on 7.0+. Also, there is nothing in the guidelines that specifies that this is material or the new one isn't. It's okay you don't like it, but that doesn't mean it's not material. Teja Yeah the colors are way too harsh. Adrianus AJ Nadeak I do prefer the album art on the left side so the controls stay on the right side regardless of the notification's size. Maxr1998 Glad that I'm not the only one who thinks that fade looks ugly af. -_- Colored notifications are generally fine though, if done right - like above. maybe I'm just angry because Google removed/broke OMS3 again in DP3, and I have to destroy my eyes with that terrible white and teal everywhere.. Bala Where did that black theme came from 🙄🙄🙄 God of chaos This is Nougat. Santos Chavez I really don't see the big deal, I rather like Google's implementation of it, especially for the first version of it. It'll probably improve over time. Adrianus AJ Nadeak I like that one simply because they keep the controls on one side. Currently, it jumps from off-center right to all the way left. Grey In my mind this idea sounded garrish and ugly, but the images look simple, understated, and muted. It's really nice! SomeGuy112 Very nice, too bad they seem to be sticking with the ugly white device theme though. Rohan An theme/color scheme option would be nice. Ibrahim Yusuf This looks so good, love it 😍💕 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2440fc282d940020032f634444bd7ca4f40eb7d77cb2dbc89fdd9504b9b4b302.png needa That does look good.

Boomdizzle I did notice those pop-up quite a lot. I guess I'll have to see if they get annoying or not or if I find them useful down the road. Miku is Best Vocaloid I had this in Phonograph ages ago. Ash I still miss the full screen music lockscreen from KitKat. That thing was awesome. Boomdizzle I usually have a full lock screen of the music album and the navigation pane in the middle for the music if I pause the music and turn off the screen or pull the cable out of the phone (essentially doing the same thing.) Was the KitKat one different than that? I honestly don't even remember. Boomdizzle I usually have a full lock screen of the music album and the navigation pane in the middle for the music when I go to unlock the phone with music playing. Was the KitKat one different than that? I honestly don't even remember. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/231ab1b3e6336be8c2d93a501c8f528518fd52d5b6fdedd139750ce63b6126c1.png Santos Chavez Yeah, for me on my Pixel XL it displays an image of the album right on the lockscreen as well. Not sure how it was in KitKat. Chandan Kumar https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/936ade7908c74409abeced3bf67e9ba3d56a5fee8aedbdd91544657cea80fe16.png Boomdizzle Ah I remember that now. I guess it's a little cleaner looking but essentially the same thing. Freek Smulders How often do you see a lockscreen with today's Fingerprint Sensors? Rohan Fingerprint is Integrated in power button on my phone so i can't even see the lockscreen long enough to register my notifications Alejandro You can, you only have to use the wrong finger :) Rohan The way I hold my phone, my thumb naturally rests on the power button. If I hold it in left hand I have either the index or middle finger on it. Both of them too are registered. Any other finger is just awkward. Adrianus AJ Nadeak I only registered the thumbs and middle finger. I don't see the need for the index to do the same. Boomdizzle I use my fingerprint reader all the time but I do glance at my phone for the time or to quickly see a notification that I can't respond to right away, also to quickly skip a song. P. Sherman This is... quite amazing, actually. Stu It looks awkward with YouTube, but the rest are really nice. i_say_uuhhh I like it, but needs some work design wise. iCON "Glad you came" Indeed. needa Woohoo. Waking up to this put a big ol' shit eating grin on my face. Hope this build is less stressful to deal with. And the media notifs look great. meijin3 I love this change! Also, that wallpaper on the left looks awesome. Where might I find it? Corbin Davenport It's from the HTC U11 wallpapers! http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/16/htc-u11s-included-wallpapers/ Nomaan Holding battery icon from quick settings or just going to battery option from settings app now has an animation of battery getting filled up to current level. boop And it also now has a separate persistent notification when music is playing in the background that can't be disabled. Lord Argyris I guess I'm in the minority then. I don't like it, from both an aesthetic and functional standpoint. Aesthetically, I just think it looks ugly, though there's no accounting for taste so that's just my opinion. Functionally, however, whenever you have a set of controls that changes appearance arbitrarily, it's less functional because you have to waste a split second identifying and confirming it's what you're looking for every time you use it. The time spent doing this is minimal, but for something like quick play controls, which you often use as part of a complex workflow in lieu of switching back to the full app, that tiny recognition pause can be jarring and, over time, irritating. I'll reserve final judgement for when I've actually had an opportunity to use these controls. In any case, this is just another example of Google spending time making small, arbitrary changes to the UI. At least they didn't just outright ditch playback controls and replace them with nothing, or eliminate some of the controls to make it look "better" (e.g. I seem to remember early versions of Lollipop got rid of one of the transport controls, which was quickly reinstated). needa I have used it several times now. There is no stopping to confirm as much as stopping to look at what is there. The all black youtube on chromecast notifs look great. Nothing really slowing me down controls wise... they are every bit as pronounced as before. If anything they will slow you down when scanning other notifs, as it draws your attention to it. boop Another change is that music controls won't be displaced by general notifications anymore and more stable positioning could just as well increase the speed of recognising the controls. marclee i thought material design is about material-like and this is not..... needa Kind of a bummer to see that this doesn't also work if casting from a different device. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3630e4168a0b706449d426e3bde5bafa1f832512b92c95ed675d8efca0f8430f.png Rohan I hate this notification. It should be opt in, not opt out. Rob Agreed. Rizki Putra Perdana goddamn this is beautiful K9 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d85ebf4967024b84956a2be939638ec1ef3d7e5c89db1f4e6642d220cdd60054.png Sry if this is not a new feature but I hv just noticed tht u can select where u want to edit your number in calc EvilHowl Yeah, that's new! Rohan Alsot the Arrow on the right sheet looks new. Thomas Gladdines Trying to replicate this using the pallete library, but can't seem to get the right colors :/ kalehv I thought it's not just the ongoing ones. They have a new notification API that let's apps put a colored background. Isn't that for the notifications that can be dismissed as well? Maybe they're automatically extracting the color in album art for music apps but I think this is also available for notifications they can be dismissed Alejandro Luckily, Substratum will work on Android O and I will keep taking advantage of my AMOLED display with black themes. Rod That looks great. Haider Rehman Butt Wtf at that white notification area? Badouken Its gross isn't it? Looks like someone accidentally hit the invert colors toggle but its not... Rob Hope there's a way to turn this off. I don't want thumbnails on my notification screen...sometimes the artwork is offensive. Atoqir Don't like this all. I was so happy that in 7.0 all notifications are forced to have the samr white background matteventu They weren't forced like that lol Adrianus AJ Nadeak Seems forced to me. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f726473a5e659c7293bcecf92435d580f678f6728586c34a1114b18fd5e531ac.png miscfiles Looks great! I also noticed they've rounded off the triangle "play" button so it looks more consistent with the back button on the nav bar. sbeaulieu Wonder how pornhub chrome video notification will look like😂 fijisiv I wish this was possible with standard notifications as well. The visual indicator on notifications is so small I end up reading... all. of. them. every. time. For example, make the Gmail notification red so when I hear a new mail notification I don't have to re-read the notifications from Photos, Maps, Google App, et al, I just look for the red one, ah ha, my email notification. evang18 Um no google, keep the player controls to the far right where they belong. And move the time and quick toggle expansion button back up PLEASE. boop What I like about this is that it'll actually pull black and white from an image, contrary to prior versions of the palette api that would pull random colors out of compression artifacts. Ste Tan Man this looks so sexy. I absolutely love it 😍😍. (These new emojis are awesome too) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d252b8f6de00ebce08d504efe94357541503d90d4c23d6e69955681db498bc42.png Leo Arten I just really wish they would include further control to the notifications, like fast forward, rewind etc etc.. Adrianus AJ Nadeak So they're not all white? Great! I don't like the all white ones. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f726473a5e659c7293bcecf92435d580f678f6728586c34a1114b18fd5e531ac.png I'd still like the controls to stay on one side regardless of the size.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Better Buy: Microsoft Corporation vs. Alphabet, Inc. Each famous company has a blockbuster core business and is investing heavily in new areas like AI. But which is better for investors right now? Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Jun 10, 2017 at 1:00PM For much of the last 30 years, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been a staple on computer desktops via its Windows operating system and its Office suite of productivity software. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), since the introduction of Google search in the late 1990s, has similarly dominated its core search market. While both companies have ventured into a variety of other areas, none has provided the outright dominance or revenue of their core products. Investors are more interested in the future than the past, and both companies are making strategic investments in potential blockbuster technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and cloud services. Yes, they're both great companies. But which one should investors add to their portfolios now? In the battle of the tech titans, which has a better outlook? Image source: Getty Images. Financial fortitude As you can see from the table below, both companies are remarkably fit from a financial standpoint: Company Cash and Investments Debt Free Cash Flow (TTM) Current Ratio Microsoft $126.0 billion $83.4 billion $28.46 billion 2.8 Alphabet $86.3 billion $3.94 billion $27.65 billion 6.3 Data source: YCharts, filings with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Chart by author. TTM = trailing twelve months. Both have sufficient cash to meet any operational needs, and continue to generate boatloads of the green stuff. This allows for investments in growing areas of the business, or potential acquisitions to enter new or more diverse areas. Alphabet has been on a buying spree over the last several years, snapping up companies in the field of AI, so its significant cash balance has served it well. While the two have similar levels of cash flow, Alphabet has a better current ratio and much higher level of net cash, and takes this round. Winner: Alphabet. Recent results and growth prospects In Alphabet's most recent quarter, the company increased its revenue to $24.75 billion, up 22% over the prior year quarter, and produced net income of $5.4 billion, an increase of 29% year over year. Advertising revenue related to its core search and YouTube still produced the lion's share, accounting for more than 86% of total revenue. Alphabet has been making heavy investments in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous driving, though those have yet to become substantial revenue drivers. The company has been integrating AI to improve products and apps like Assistant and Maps, while producing more relevant results in its core search. In its most recent quarter, Microsoft grew revenue to $22.1 billion, up 8% over the prior-year quarter, with net income of $4.8 billion, an increase of 28% year over year. Microsoft's Office and Windows accounted for nearly $17 billion in revenue, Intelligent Cloud grew to $6.75 billion, and LinkedIn accounted for $975 million. Microsoft has also been incorporating AI into its Bing search and Cortana virtual assistant. At the Build developer conference on May 17, the company announced its intention to infuse AI into essentially all of its products and services including Office, Windows, and even Xbox. Both companies have tremendous core businesses and both are staking a claim in the soon-to-arrive technological future. If one had an edge, I would suspect it is Alphabet, but it is simply too early to tell. Winner: Tie. Stock performance and valuation The stock performance of both companies has been very similar over the trailing twelve months, with Microsoft returning 38% to Alphabet's 37%, so this is statistically a tie. Over the longer term it's a different story, but more on that in the next category. From a price-to-earnings standpoint, Alphabet trades at 34 times trailing earnings to Microsoft's multiple of 32. There is a departure from the similarities looking forward, as Microsoft's forward multiple of 30 is a bit higher than Alphabet's forward valuation of 24, making Google's parent look less expensive going forward: PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Winner: Alphabet. Dividends and share buybacks Microsoft pays a dividend that currently yields 2.1%, while Alphabet does not yet pay a dividend. Quite often, a company investing heavily in growth initiatives will forgo paying a dividend, believing that shareholders would realize a greater overall return as a result of its investments. In this case, over the past five years, Alphabet stock has gained 246% -- compared to Microsoft's 145% -- so that argument holds water. Over the last year, Microsoft's share count has fallen by 1.5%, while Alphabet's is up over 7%, but that doesn't tell the entire story. A look at the chart below shows that Alphabet offsets its share-based compensation twice per year, in July and January, and we've caught them between the two. After those offsets, the count is typically down by about 1%: Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YCharts. However, here Microsoft's shareholder-friendly dividend gives it the edge. Winner: Microsoft. Final tally In the battle of the tech titans, Google parent Alphabet comes out ahead. A review of these metrics shows two companies with strong financials and great prospects. The story of AI is yet to be told, and either company could be in the running for victory there. But if investors are looking for both growth and income in their portfolios, they could do worse than buying Microsoft.

Gadget Hacks Android WonderHowTo Gadget Hacks Next Reality Invisiverse Driverless Null Byte Android Basics Glossary of Terms Galaxy S8 Info HTC 11 Rumors Everything Pixel Rooting Guide Gaming Roundups Forum Stay Secure How-Tos News SafetyNet: How to Fix 'CTS Profile Mismatch' Errors By Dallas Thomas Fri 5:08 PM Gadget Hacks SafetyNet: How to Fix 'CTS Profile Mismatch' Errors Because of Android's new SafetyNet system, certain apps can now block rooted users or prevent you from accessing them altogether — but at least for now, there are still ways around these restrictions. You can pass most of SafetyNet's checks with Magisk and systemless root, but Google's Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) remains a hurdle in some cases. With certain setups, you'll still get a "CTS Profile Mismatch" error that causes the SafetyNet check to fail, even with Magisk installed. If this has happened to you, there are a number of potential causes, ranging from incompatible root management apps to issues with Magisk Hide. So to help you get to the bottom of the issue, we'll go over seven solutions below. Don't Miss: Why SafetyNet Shows That Google Actually Cares About Android Root Before You Begin This guide assumes you've already installed Magisk, which is a systemless root utility that can hide its presence from SafetyNet. If you haven't already done this, head here to get started. When it comes to actually checking your SafetyNet status, the easiest way to do that would be to open the Magisk Manager app and tap the "SafetyNet Check" button at the bottom of the screen. So while following this guide, periodically re-check your SafetyNet status by opening the Magisk Manager app, swiping down to refresh, then tapping the "SafetyNet Check" button again. Checking SafetyNet status in Magisk Manager. Step 1: Get Rid of SuperSU and Use MagiskSU with Magisk Hide The most likely cause of a CTS profile mismatch is a root management app that doesn't hide itself from SafetyNet. This is the case with Chainfire's SuperSU, which is the most popular root management out there. Chances are, you originally rooted your phone using the SuperSU ZIP or CF Auto Root, which both install SuperSU as the default root management app. If you did that, and then installed Magisk, the leftover root binaries from SuperSU will cause SafetyNet to trip. So if this is the cause of your CTS issues, you'll need to uninstall SuperSU's binaries and replace them with Magisk's built-in root management app. But there's one more wrinkle: If you have the Xposed Framework installed or if you've modified any system files using root access, you'll need to undo those changes as well. Not to worry, though, we've outlined that entire process with a separate guide, so head to the following link to get squared away. Don't Miss: How to Switch from SuperSU to Magisk to Bypass SafetyNet Once you've done that, make sure the "Magisk Hide" option is enabled in your Magisk Manager app. From there, you may want to hide additional apps using Magisk Hide, which essentially prevents the apps from knowing that you're rooted. To do that, head to the side navigation menu in your Magisk Manager app and select "Magisk Hide." From here, it may be helpful to tick the boxes next to Google Play Store and Google Services Framework as well as any other app you're having SafetyNet issues with. Step 2: Still No Good? Try Flashing unSU If the above guide didn't fix your CTS profile mismatch problems and you're certain you've undone any system mods, it's possible that you still have a few bits of data left over from SuperSU. The "Full Unroot" option in the SuperSU app is supposed to get rid of everything, but it's not always perfect. So to make sure you've completely eradicated SuperSU and its binaries, you can use a flashable ZIP created by developer osm0sis. To start, just tap the following link from your Android device, then boot into custom recovery. Download unSU to completely remove SuperSU (.zip) From there, tap the "Install" button in TWRP's main menu, then navigate to your Download folder and select UPDATE-unSU-signed.zip. After that, swipe the slider to flash the ZIP and eradicate all traces of SuperSU, and when you're done, go back and re-flash the Magisk ZIP. After rebooting, check your SafetyNet status again — if you still don't pass, move onto the next step. Step 3: Change SELinux to Enforcing If you're still stuck, this next step is rather simple, though it would only apply if you've previously used an app to set your SELinux mode to "Permissive." Magisk attempts to hide your SELinux status from SafetyNet, but it's not always perfect, so your best bet is to set SELinux back to its default mode of "Enforcing." So open whichever SELinux mode changer app you used to set the mode to "Permissive" in the first place, then toggle the setting back to "Enforcing" and reboot. Sadly, we can't share apps that change SELinux modes since Google blacklists sites that do, so if you've uninstalled the app, you'll have to find it again on your own. That's easy, though — just head to the XDA forums and search for "SELinux." Step 4: Turn Off USB Debugging For some strange reason, a fairly common cause of SafetyNet issues with Magisk is the "USB Debugging" setting in Developer options. So if you have this option enabled, head to your Settings menu to disable it, then reboot and see if that solved your SafetyNet issues. Step 5: Custom ROM? Try a Custom Kernel As I mentioned earlier, CTS stands for "Compatibility Test Suite." This is the process Google uses to verify that a device and its firmware meet certification standards, and to put it simply, a custom ROM will never officially pass this test. However, some custom kernels can help with this issue. The most popular kernel that's been known to help with custom ROM incompatibility is Franco Kernel. It's available for all Nexus, Pixel, and OnePlus devices, as well as the Redmi Note3, and the easiest way to install it would be to purchase the FKU app, then tap the "Download" button on the main page. Otherwise, you can search your device's XDA forum to find a free flashable ZIP. For some custom ROMs (particularly Lineage OS), this option may not fully solve the problem. However, many apps that use SafetyNet only check one CTS-related aspect called "Basic Integrity," and flashing Franco kernel will usually fix that aspect. So while Magisk Manager may still report a CTS mismatch, you may very well be able to use all of your apps now. Finally, for Xiaomi users that are running a custom ROM, there's another option. This Magisk module by developer Deic will reportedly make your phone pass the CTS test, so try installing it, then rebooting. Step 6: Address Other Potential Problems Before you take the nuclear approach outlined in Step 7 below, there are a few less-common issues that might cause SafetyNet to fail based on a CTS profile mismatch, so they're worth a shot. First, it's possible that the Magisk Hide daemon isn't starting properly on your phone. To fix that, try heading to the settings menu in your Magisk Manager app, then toggling the "Magisk Hide" option off and back on. Failing that, disable Magisk Hide, reboot, then re-enable the option. Some users have also reported that Magisk's "Systemless hosts" and "BusyBox" options caused them to experience issues with SafetyNet. As such, you may want to disable these two options in the Magisk Manager app's settings menu, though note that disabling systemless hosts may cause issues with ad blockers like AdAway. As a last-ditch effort, you can try enabling the "Core only mode" option in Magisk Manager's settings. This will disable any Magisk modules you've installed which could be causing conflicts with SafetyNet, leaving you only with Magisk SU and root. Step 7: If All Else Fails, Start from Scratch We've saved this step for last because it's a catchall solution, but it's a painful pill to swallow. If all else fails, simply restore your device's stock firmware, reinstall custom recovery, then flash the Magisk ZIP that you can download in the Magisk Manager app. This will work in almost all cases. The process of restoring your stock firmware will vary depending on the device, but if your phone has a bootloader menu that supports Fastboot commands, we've covered the process at this guide. Failing that, your best bet would be to do a Google search for "restore stock firmware <phone name>." When you're done there, you can reference this guide for re-installing TWRP. So have you finally solved your CTS profile mismatch issues? Do you have any other tips that will help get people past that dreaded SafetyNet check?

View All 65 Articles In This Series Sometimes it's the little things in life that bring the most joy. Google often uses Android developer previews to test small changes and gauge public opinion on them ahead of a final release. This may or may not be one such example. Dev Preview 3 has reversed a tiny change that was made in the last version, namely changing the order of the WiFi and cellular icons on the status bar. Granted, this seems like a really insignificant alteration. But clearly there were plenty of users annoyed by the change, and this forced Google into reverting to the previous state. If nothing else it just looks weird when cellular comes first. The angles of the two icons fit nicely together when WiFi leads. If you don't believe me, take a look: Above: The right way round, Dev Preview 3.  Below: The wrong way round, Dev Preview 2. So there you have it. A tiny change, but one that will likely please a good number of Android fans. Cheers, Google.

Midnitte Rip best emoji ever. Frisi :( Wes C Get that <8.0 blob out of here. (Not really, I wish they'd bring the blobs back) ninjustin Bye blobs :( Nick I'm actually kinda torn about the new emojis after using them for a bit. I actually really like Google's blob emojis, they had a distinct style about them that was fun and playful. However, at the end of the day it is a way of communicating with others and it fails at that if they look too different. Although, I do remember that someone did versions without the borders and gradients and I did like that better. Ishimaru RIP blobbies :( :( :( Ryan Cavitt I am one with the blob, the blob is one with me. EH101 Dislike the blobs. Glad they're done. They always reminded me of Dots candy. Best solution would be to have Emojis be interchangeable like fonts are in some skins. someone755 But not all emojis mean the same for all groupsets. If my friend with a GS5 sends me an emoji it could have a totally different meaning for him and myself. (There have been a few awkward times because of it. Don't ask.) EH101 That's true, and the primary reason I prefer a single universal set of Emojis instead of everyone doing their own. For a long time I would switch my Emojis to iOS Emojis to be sure what was meant across device conversations. Probably similar reasoning was used when they designed the new Emojis to look more like Apple's. Scott Scrivens https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/70/43/7043683e2ef6acd3920958ad6509cd60.png Carsten Given that most design changes result in many angry comments, what will happen now?! I'm actually quite interested if now everyone will be like "aww yeah back again" or if the ever-complaining comments switch to "I just started to like the new style more" or something :D A Person You guys get paid per-article, don't you. Nick The order of icons in the status bar is very important, switch them up and people go insane! In all seriousness, it's okay that they go over every little detail in these new releases, it's very easy to scroll on by if I don't want to read them. All_I_do_is_post_gifs http://i.imgur.com/eA85ZxQ.gif Jay I see the battery percentage is still outside of the battery icon though. 😒 I don't understand why we can't have both as a choice. Damnit, Google. Frisi That bothers me so much. I turned it off. Zach Mauch I don't mind this change. I can never read the damn thing as it is. Even on my Pixel XL or 6P. There just is not enough contrast. However, considering it is already a hidden setting it should probably just be an option for either. freshprince_87 It would be even better if the font of the battery 🔋 percentage is the same as the clock 🕒 DragoCubed Choice desu Willie Chalmers III Don't fool me like that, AP. I thought the blob emoji were back. ☹️ create812 Same Lazyboy0172 Also the LTE icon is part of the signal bars again, not a separate icon on the bar. Frisi Holy sh-- you're right! I knew something else changed but it didn't caught my eye! aRvInD Any screenshot? Lazyboy0172 not very exciting because it looks identical to pre 8.0, but yeah I'll take a screenshot for you- http://i.imgur.com/mFDuUOy.png Ryan Cavitt Do you ever roam? I wonder where they decided to stick the roaming indicator. I really like OxygenOS' implementation of the roaming indicator. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/efb226690d019dcf77b60974e74631de485ccc0a127b3481923ca0b68fd1edc3.png Patrick Mustard A globe icon with a little "R" on its corner would do just fine. Willie Chalmers III This makes way more sense. Nick What I thought Google was trying to go for was to display what your data source was in one spot. I think they were aiming to do that since the persistent wifi icon was a bug. I think this was a solid logical choice, but the logical choices are not always the most pretty ones, especially with how hard it is to make a big "LTE" icon look good. Miku is Best Vocaloid In Moto devices the LTE indicator is still part of the mobile signal icon but the icon itself covers two spaces. It's kind of annoying but I already got used t https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/07453798a06ae19d208a210da2196e4026c737a8cd6ba83a2d45b402a9348b87.jpg o it. My1 lol does it have to be that large? I would expect a small "4G" or whatever on the cell but not this abomination Miku is Best Vocaloid I dunno why. It has been like that since at least Jelly Bean on the original Moto G. Ryan Cavitt Funnily enough when the OG Moto G got the Lollipop upgrade, they removed the Moto signal cluster and went with the bog standard AOSP cluster. I guess they really did not care at that point. Álvaro R. Only in some reguons, on most countries was still the big letter Vlad It made sense on the dual SIM Moto G. I thought that was the reason. I guess not. Winston Wasn't so on Lollipop on my 2014 Moto X, at least I don't remember so when I got it (when I bought it, it shipped with 5.0, and to the best of my memory the launch software didn't). But either the 5.1 or the 6.0 update screwed it over and replaced it with a super fat "4G" text. 2 Men-E I would like the indication to be similar to this. The "4G" not as large, but indicated surely...so when we finally get 5G in the states, we know. Bewear I personally hate OEMs that do this. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't really mind, it's only the only change Motorola made to the SystemUI. Patrick Mustard By the way, "LTE" is probably far less user-friendly than "4G". Curt Lavlee. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Can you put the battery percentage in the icon, or is it still separate? Илья There are some things they can't just put in Boomdizzle Still separate, unfortunately. Willie Chalmers III Now only if Google would get forced to change the emojis back because of WAY more annoyed users. Alex Let them stay. There are users (majority I'd think) who have no clue what those weird blobs meant. Frisi Sadly, that's correct. Dennis Ulijn Try using them a few weeks, go back to Android <8 and see if you still feel that way. I think most people that see the emoji in use will prefer the new ones (a game of emoji riddle with assistant is a good way to test). Asuka Tanaka I wish Google would add an option where we can change the Emojis Willie Chalmers III I'll try. I know I'll have to give in eventually, so I'm going to install the third developer preview. Goodbye to my blob brethren. 😞 Boomdizzle That was the thing that drove me nuts the most was that the angles were all off. Flows so much better the old/current way. Jared They also got rid of the grayed out wifi icon in the status bar when wifi is not connected (yay!). They have not allowed disabling notifications for Android System, which means I have a constant notification that SwipePad is displaying over apps (boo!). The Google Play Music widget seems to be working properly now. It was pretty broken in DP2 on my 6P. Sruly J According to Google, the greyed out WiFi icon when not connected was a bug. Zach Mauch Now if only the would make the lines of the two icons parallel. It is hard to see, by the angle of the line on the wifi icon is slightly more steep than the angle on the cell signal icon. It aggravates my OCD. Ian Santopietro I didn't mind the order change. I just didn't want the wifi icon there when I wasn't connected to or searching for a wifi connection Dennis Ulijn That's fixed too :) AND they threw in the small H (for 4G) again, too! Google listens. miscfiles Now they just need to make the angles consistent between the WiFi and cellular icons. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4850d98240afa410b5ca01e63ac91b7e8cd973724d50eb33e4c4559627956720.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c65ec559dd82129b60e8150ead4a70f7b6556ea45d10427018452947ae9e44e8.png Sorry. Once you see, you cannot unsee. Zach Mauch I just said this, but your post on it is SOOOO much better. Nice visual! miscfiles Great minds think alike! As a graphic designer this stuff matters (far too much) to me. Zach Mauch Well, I'm an engineer not a GD, but my wife is. LOL! With how quick you whipped up that example I figured you were. miscfiles The other thing that winds me up is the battery percentage in what looks like Roboto Condensed Light or Regular, while the time is in Roboto (not Condensed) Medium or Bold. So there's a difference both in character width and weight, which doesn't sit well. miscfiles Top is like the current. Middle is same widths, different weights. Bottom is same weights, different widths. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/682ce12d4a97875f5990bfb5b598e8b148eacb30d21f87e29dbd951e76414edb.png Daniel Do you guys remember the Google Pixel commercial, the part where they said the battery chargers really fast?

Bewear It looks like a seriously handicapped heart symbol. Lord Argyris Please, please, please don't give them any ideas! Gah! Seriously, though, I never considered the width as a constraint. You're right; they had to choose between different widths or different heights depending on what they prioritized. Boomdizzle Gee thanks for pointing that out! miscfiles I just want to share my pain... ;) Scott Scrivens Why would you do that, my eyes :( miscfiles I'm hoping to be headhunted by Google as Pedantic Design Critic... :P JD I wonder if it's on purpose to fit in LTE or 4G+ those labels on top of the cell reception bar during hand over. duke1 Report these issues to Google issue tracker. Hopefully they'll get this squared away Ed. Blake Google is almost an engineer-only company and was never good on designing UIs.

What was once a product of science fiction movies is now transitioning into one of the most powerful marketing tools of the 21st century. Industry giants like Facebook, Samsung, Sony, and Google investing in VR. Clearly, VR will be around for the long haul. In fact, a Greenlight Insights survey, reported by Adweek, found that 71 percent of consumers view a brand utilizing VR as “forward-thinking.” The purpose of VR is to create authentic experiences void of background noises. Through the act of putting on a headset, a user can be teleported anywhere from a peaceful beach to the ends of the universe. The beauty of using this tool for marketing is that you, as a brand, are in complete control of everything the user sees or hears in a 360-degree environment. Even though it’s still very much in the infancy stages, companies of all backgrounds are wise to begin thinking about what VR can do for their content marketing. Here are three tips to keep in mind when planning your strategy for the not-so-distant future. 1. Focus on Immersive Storytelling In today’s marketing landscape, storytelling is an incredibly popular way to present brand messaging. Using VR is a strategy that helps brands connect with audiences in ways traditional marketing simply cannot. The gaming industry has proven VR to be an avenue in which storytelling can flourish. But we currently lack a substantial amount of hard evidence on how exactly to build a great experience from a promotional standpoint. In other words, today’s marketers are the pioneers of VR in business. As content strategists, all we can do is gauge what other companies are doing and pinpoint the common threads that make an experience successful. UNICEF’s “Clouds Over Sidra” remains one of the most impactful displays of VR used in storytelling to date. The experience was meant to provide an immersive illustration of the harsh realities faced by over 80,000 Syrians living in the Za’atari refugee camp in their attempt to flee the horrors of civil war. The story features a 12-year-old girl trying to live out the formative years of her childhood in the camp. The video depicts her living situation, going to school, socializing, and doing her best to enjoy life under the bleak circumstances. It was the first film shot in VR for the United Nations and ended up raising $3.8 billion. The reason this content was so successful is that it contextualized the innocence of an everyday civilian by showcasing the inhumanity and costly effects of war. The storytelling truly put the “reality” factor into VR and created a greater sense of empathy in the viewer by bringing them directly to the front lines of the Syrian Refugee Crisis. So what are the lessons we can glean from this? The impact of cultural immersion is extraordinarily meaningful in conveying an authentic experience from a new perspective. Brands can use this concept in their VR strategy to educate audiences by creating a whole scope of which to consume content. Marketers need to think native. It’s no secret that traditional marketing strategies are not as effective as they used to be. That being said, a VR experience should place priority on emphasizing both context and creativity in a non-invasive way. Doing so will be instrumental in promoting organic engagement. Storytelling is a cornerstone of content marketing. VR has the capability to supercharge it with an outstanding degree of user immersion. 2. Encourage User-Generated Content User-generated content (UGC) has proven time and time again to be beneficial in content marketing. Some of the most influential brands, such as Red Bull and GoPro, have been incredibly successful in making UGC a staple in their marketing strategies. At a foundational level, one of the core objectives of content marketing is to create communities. While user-generated VR content is a new concept still finding its bearings, it will likely be the engine that drives further development in VR hardware. In the future, general consumers will be able to equip themselves with the proper cameras to create their own high-grade VR experiences. The seeds have already been planted as Facebook and YouTube now support the 360-degree camera format. Tools like the Insta360 give people the ability to turn their phones into 360-degree cameras capable of shooting advanced content. In the coming years, the demand for high-quality VR creation will only continue to grow. As one of the premier benefits of VR gives marketers complete control over their messaging, some are hesitant to embrace full-scale UGC. On the contrary, doing so can have significant B2C benefits in terms of boosting engagement and overall brand trust. As with any forms of UGC, its effectiveness depends entirely on the type of brand using it and the method they are employing. However, the creativity and success of the major UGC campaigns can’t be ignored. Brands looking to make VR a significant part of their marketing efforts should prepare themselves accordingly. It’s never too early to start brainstorming a compelling campaign for when user-generated VR content becomes a widespread phenomenon. 3. Bring the Product Right to the Customer One of the most outstanding benefits of VR is that users are able to completely experience what a business is selling without leaving the comfort of their own home. If this revolutionary form of shopping has taught us anything, it’s that AR/VR solutions are going to have a huge impact in upcoming years. Goldman Sachs predicts the market share of these entities will hit $80 billion by 2025. IKEA has been pioneering this concept for years with their augmented reality product catalog. If you aren’t familiar, the app allows shoppers to browse product listings and use their phone camera to envision exactly what items would look like in their home. eBay and Myer are working to forge the path to VR shopping with their innovative “Shoptical” cardboard. Using the device, shoppers are treated to a highly-personalized virtual department store at their leisure. Similar to browsing on the e-commerce website, shoppers are shown a series of relevant products once an item is placed in the shopping cart. The thing that sets this concept apart from other forms of online shopping can be summed up in one word: discovery. As the vast amounts of consumers know, the biggest disadvantage of online shopping is that you don’t know exactly what an item will look like until it shows up at your door. You can only get so much detail from the pictures. With Shoptical, users can get a more in-depth look at products with the ability to move, zoom, and rotate from every angle with full freedom. By allowing customers to get a close look at each and every little aspect of their order, eBay and Myer are providing the closest thing possible to an in-store experience, in turn creating a stronger level of trust with buyers. The idea of VR browsing is by no means limited to just e-commerce. For instance, Google is bringing a whole new VR dimension to tourism. With Google Cardboard, people can choose from a variety of virtual tours such as the Peacock Room, Temple of Juno, Robben Island Prison, and more. The food industry is getting on the VR train as well. McDonald’s Sweden launched a campaign in which customers could turn the iconic happy meal box into a headset called “Happy Goggles.” From e-commerce to tourism to food, it is clear that VR is going to play a huge role in how companies present their product. Regardless of what industry you are working in, the sky is the limit in discovering captivating ways to promote brand messaging. Final Thoughts As great as VR sounds, there are several pressing obstacles standing in the way of widespread usage in marketing. For one, the technology, in a sense, is still in the stone age and lacks sophistication. Additionally, there is an extremely limited amount of data available in relation to what consumers are looking for in a VR experience. This makes it expensive, time-consuming, and risky to produce content — which is why most of the innovation is coming from giant enterprises. The low level of sophistication results in content being awfully tough to distribute. In turn, the user adoption rates are low as well. Lastly, many brands rely on consumers owning headsets to fully experience their VR material. Although these are available at a commercial level, they are costly and the bulk of customers aren’t willing to make the purchase. Need proof? Only 6.3 million headsets were sold for home use in 2016. This number isn’t exactly enticing for marketers to create large amounts of space in their budgets to fund VR projects. Although the numbers themselves aren’t super promising, the innovation of current VR marketing strategies proves it is going to be a major player in the future. The potential has been realized. Now the trick is striking an economical balance between consumer accessibility and production value. Once that happy medium is found, businesses will truly be able to let their messaging flourish in this futuristic environment. Image Credits Screenshots by author. Taken May 2017.

View All 65 Articles In This Series Sometimes it's the little things in life that bring the most joy. Google often uses Android developer previews to test small changes and gauge public opinion on them ahead of a final release. This may or may not be one such example. Dev Preview 3 has reversed a tiny change that was made in the last version, namely changing the order of the WiFi and cellular icons on the status bar. Granted, this seems like a really insignificant alteration. But clearly there were plenty of users annoyed by the change, and this forced Google into reverting to the previous state. If nothing else it just looks weird when cellular comes first. The angles of the two icons fit nicely together when WiFi leads. If you don't believe me, take a look: Above: The right way round, Dev Preview 3.  Below: The wrong way round, Dev Preview 2. So there you have it. A tiny change, but one that will likely please a good number of Android fans. Cheers, Google.

Midnitte Rip best emoji ever. Frisi :( Wes C Get that <8.0 blob out of here. (Not really, I wish they'd bring the blobs back) ninjustin Bye blobs :( Nick I'm actually kinda torn about the new emojis after using them for a bit. I actually really like Google's blob emojis, they had a distinct style about them that was fun and playful. However, at the end of the day it is a way of communicating with others and it fails at that if they look too different. Although, I do remember that someone did versions without the borders and gradients and I did like that better. Ishimaru RIP blobbies :( :( :( Ryan Cavitt I am one with the blob, the blob is one with me. EH101 Dislike the blobs. Glad they're done. They always reminded me of Dots candy. Best solution would be to have Emojis be interchangeable like fonts are in some skins. someone755 But not all emojis mean the same for all groupsets. If my friend with a GS5 sends me an emoji it could have a totally different meaning for him and myself. (There have been a few awkward times because of it. Don't ask.) EH101 That's true, and the primary reason I prefer a single universal set of Emojis instead of everyone doing their own. For a long time I would switch my Emojis to iOS Emojis to be sure what was meant across device conversations. Probably similar reasoning was used when they designed the new Emojis to look more like Apple's. Scott Scrivens https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/70/43/7043683e2ef6acd3920958ad6509cd60.png Carsten Given that most design changes result in many angry comments, what will happen now?! I'm actually quite interested if now everyone will be like "aww yeah back again" or if the ever-complaining comments switch to "I just started to like the new style more" or something :D A Person You guys get paid per-article, don't you. Nick The order of icons in the status bar is very important, switch them up and people go insane! In all seriousness, it's okay that they go over every little detail in these new releases, it's very easy to scroll on by if I don't want to read them. All_I_do_is_post_gifs http://i.imgur.com/eA85ZxQ.gif Jay I see the battery percentage is still outside of the battery icon though. 😒 I don't understand why we can't have both as a choice. Damnit, Google. Frisi That bothers me so much. I turned it off. Zach Mauch I don't mind this change. I can never read the damn thing as it is. Even on my Pixel XL or 6P. There just is not enough contrast. However, considering it is already a hidden setting it should probably just be an option for either. freshprince_87 It would be even better if the font of the battery 🔋 percentage is the same as the clock 🕒 DragoCubed Choice desu Willie Chalmers III Don't fool me like that, AP. I thought the blob emoji were back. ☹️ create812 Same Lazyboy0172 Also the LTE icon is part of the signal bars again, not a separate icon on the bar. Frisi Holy sh-- you're right! I knew something else changed but it didn't caught my eye! aRvInD Any screenshot? Lazyboy0172 not very exciting because it looks identical to pre 8.0, but yeah I'll take a screenshot for you- http://i.imgur.com/mFDuUOy.png Ryan Cavitt Do you ever roam? I wonder where they decided to stick the roaming indicator. I really like OxygenOS' implementation of the roaming indicator. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/efb226690d019dcf77b60974e74631de485ccc0a127b3481923ca0b68fd1edc3.png Patrick Mustard A globe icon with a little "R" on its corner would do just fine. Willie Chalmers III This makes way more sense. Nick What I thought Google was trying to go for was to display what your data source was in one spot. I think they were aiming to do that since the persistent wifi icon was a bug. I think this was a solid logical choice, but the logical choices are not always the most pretty ones, especially with how hard it is to make a big "LTE" icon look good. Miku is Best Vocaloid In Moto devices the LTE indicator is still part of the mobile signal icon but the icon itself covers two spaces. It's kind of annoying but I already got used t https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/07453798a06ae19d208a210da2196e4026c737a8cd6ba83a2d45b402a9348b87.jpg o it. My1 lol does it have to be that large? I would expect a small "4G" or whatever on the cell but not this abomination Miku is Best Vocaloid I dunno why. It has been like that since at least Jelly Bean on the original Moto G. Ryan Cavitt Funnily enough when the OG Moto G got the Lollipop upgrade, they removed the Moto signal cluster and went with the bog standard AOSP cluster. I guess they really did not care at that point. Álvaro R. Only in some reguons, on most countries was still the big letter Vlad It made sense on the dual SIM Moto G. I thought that was the reason. I guess not. Winston Wasn't so on Lollipop on my 2014 Moto X, at least I don't remember so when I got it (when I bought it, it shipped with 5.0, and to the best of my memory the launch software didn't). But either the 5.1 or the 6.0 update screwed it over and replaced it with a super fat "4G" text. 2 Men-E I would like the indication to be similar to this. The "4G" not as large, but indicated surely...so when we finally get 5G in the states, we know. Bewear I personally hate OEMs that do this. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't really mind, it's only the only change Motorola made to the SystemUI. Patrick Mustard By the way, "LTE" is probably far less user-friendly than "4G". Curt Lavlee. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Can you put the battery percentage in the icon, or is it still separate? Илья There are some things they can't just put in Boomdizzle Still separate, unfortunately. Willie Chalmers III Now only if Google would get forced to change the emojis back because of WAY more annoyed users. Alex Let them stay. There are users (majority I'd think) who have no clue what those weird blobs meant. Frisi Sadly, that's correct. Dennis Ulijn Try using them a few weeks, go back to Android <8 and see if you still feel that way. I think most people that see the emoji in use will prefer the new ones (a game of emoji riddle with assistant is a good way to test). Asuka Tanaka I wish Google would add an option where we can change the Emojis Willie Chalmers III I'll try. I know I'll have to give in eventually, so I'm going to install the third developer preview. Goodbye to my blob brethren. 😞 Boomdizzle That was the thing that drove me nuts the most was that the angles were all off. Flows so much better the old/current way. Jared They also got rid of the grayed out wifi icon in the status bar when wifi is not connected (yay!). They have not allowed disabling notifications for Android System, which means I have a constant notification that SwipePad is displaying over apps (boo!). The Google Play Music widget seems to be working properly now. It was pretty broken in DP2 on my 6P. Sruly J According to Google, the greyed out WiFi icon when not connected was a bug. Zach Mauch Now if only the would make the lines of the two icons parallel. It is hard to see, by the angle of the line on the wifi icon is slightly more steep than the angle on the cell signal icon. It aggravates my OCD. Ian Santopietro I didn't mind the order change. I just didn't want the wifi icon there when I wasn't connected to or searching for a wifi connection Dennis Ulijn That's fixed too :) AND they threw in the small H (for 4G) again, too! Google listens. miscfiles Now they just need to make the angles consistent between the WiFi and cellular icons. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4850d98240afa410b5ca01e63ac91b7e8cd973724d50eb33e4c4559627956720.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c65ec559dd82129b60e8150ead4a70f7b6556ea45d10427018452947ae9e44e8.png Sorry. Once you see, you cannot unsee. Zach Mauch I just said this, but your post on it is SOOOO much better. Nice visual! miscfiles Great minds think alike! As a graphic designer this stuff matters (far too much) to me. Zach Mauch Well, I'm an engineer not a GD, but my wife is. LOL! With how quick you whipped up that example I figured you were. miscfiles The other thing that winds me up is the battery percentage in what looks like Roboto Condensed Light or Regular, while the time is in Roboto (not Condensed) Medium or Bold. So there's a difference both in character width and weight, which doesn't sit well. miscfiles Top is like the current. Middle is same widths, different weights. Bottom is same weights, different widths. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/682ce12d4a97875f5990bfb5b598e8b148eacb30d21f87e29dbd951e76414edb.png Daniel Do you guys remember the Google Pixel commercial, the part where they said the battery chargers really fast?

Ron Amadeo (US) - Jun 10, 2017 2:10 pm UTC reader comments 52 Share this story The third Android O Developer Preview hit the Internet yesterday, giving us just one more version before Android O hits final release. While Google's new OS seems to be mostly in a finished state, there are a few new additions to this third developer preview that are worth mentioning. Welcome Android 8.0! Enlarge / Android O Preview 3 identifies itself as "Android 8.0." Not that the version number of a release really matters, but for people who care about this sort of thing, the third Android O preview spilled the beans on what Android O will be called when it gets released. The "about" screen identifies the OS as "Android 8.0," killing any speculation about whether it would be called either 8.0 or 7.2. We still don't know what sugary snack the "O" will stand for, but we're at least halfway to the real name. The new media notification The Palette API takes the album art, extracts some colors, and applies it to the media player notification. The new notifications look beautiful and, amazingly, always have a decent amount of contrast for the text. Third-party apps like Pocketcasts and Soundcloud get in on the action, too. Way back in Android 5.0 Lollipop, Google introduced the "Palette API" as part of the material design rollout. This API could automatically extract colour from a source image and serve it up to an app for UI colouring. It preserved text contrast, and the API pooled colours into a few buckets like "Vibrant," "Muted," "Light," and "Dark." While the Palette API has been hanging around in Android for a while, Google basically never used it for anything. That changes with Android O Developer Preview 3, where ongoing media notifications get a beautiful, vibrant colour scheme pulled from each song's album art. This instantly became my favourite feature in Android O—once I saw it was working, I immediately starting tapping through my music collection to see what cool colour combos it would come up with. Grungy album art gets a dark colour scheme, happy neon album art gets an eyeball-searing notification, and subdued mellow album art gets a matching muted colour scheme. And because the API is automatically detecting light and dark colours, I never ran into a single readability problem. There are new rules for background apps in Android O—basically silent, unbound background tasks are no longer a thing. Starting in the third Android O preview, any app that is doing stuff in the background will have a notification automatically created for it. The idea is to alert users to apps that are running in the background and using system resources. These notifications go in a new spot all the way at the bottom of the notification panel that Google is calling the "by the way" section. Everything here is a tiny, one-line notification, and for the most part it seems like a useful heads-up for the user. The problem right now is that this notification setup is a little excessive for media apps. As you can see in the screenshots, when a media app is playing music in the background, it generates both a big, coloured "currently playing media" notification and a tiny "[Music app] is running in the background" notification. It really seems like, as long as an app is generating a large, ongoing notification, the little one is redundant and should be hidden. Maybe that's a change we'll see for preview 4. New icons and a new clock The clock app gets a new icon. It's blue! There's also a new color scheme. The funky purple is gone, replaced with a nice dark theme. Ditto for the settings. The Clock app gets a new colour scheme and a new icon. The icon switches from purple to blue, and the app switches from purple to a nice dark theme. If you've ever set your alarm just before going to bed, the darker colour scheme will be welcome. For now, there's not​ much more to see in the new Android O Preview. Google seems to have much of the UI nailed down now, and while there are under-the-hood stability and bug fix improvements, finalised APIs, and other internal work, there aren't many user-facing additions to talk about. Google says the final version of Android O should be out sometime this summer.

One machine learning practitioner sees Core ML as analogous to the TensorFlow software Google released before introducing its TPU chip. Jordan Novet | @jordannovet Friday, 9 Jun 2017 | 5:14 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., speaks during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California, U.S., on Monday, June 5, 2017. Apple on Monday introduced Core ML, a set of tools that developers can use to incorporate machine learning techniques into their apps. The news was little noticed amid all the new hardware and iOS updates. But it's important. The capabilities of Core ML are a "dead giveaway" that Apple is preparing to introduce a new kind of processor, presumably just for iPhones at first, that could make trendy machine learning workloads run more efficiently. That's according to one person inhabiting the world of machine learning, Reza Zadeh, CEO of image recognition startup Matroid. A company would only release something like Core ML "if there's a really intense piece of hardware that it was going do compile down into," said Zadeh, who built the machine learning algorithms for Twitter's Who to Follow feature before starting Matroid last year. "All those converters and everything, it's a dead giveaway there's going to be some intense [processor] available down the line." Alphabet's Google introduced its TensorFlow open-source framework for machine learning in November 2015, and then unveiled a custom tensor processing unit, or TPU, six months later. Zadeh thinks Apple is doing something similar with the launch of Core ML. Meanwhile startups like Deep Vision and Mythic have been working on processors that could be plunked into smaller devices, as opposed to data centers, where Google's TPUs are located. Another startup, Movidius, which touts its vision processing unit for drones and other gadgets, was acquired by Intel in 2016. Bloomberg reported last month on Apple's plans to build a artificial intelligence (AI) chip. This would build on the inclusion of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for certain computations in the iPhone 7 last year. Core ML provides machine learning models that developers can drop right into iOS, macOS and tvOS apps, while also providing ways to use their own models. Apps drawing on Core ML will be able to recognize objects in images, follow the movement of things in video frames or just make smart calculations given a certain amount of previous data. These processes can run on current iPhones and iPads. But it's reasonable to think Apple wants to improve performance on future hardware, while also lengthening battery life. It could do that sending machine learning workloads to a dedicated AI chip, instead of devices' central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), which are not always optimized for those computing duties, Zadeh said. But that's not all. Emerging specialized processors like the rumored Apple AI chip could become the computational workhorse in the next few decades, Zadeh said.

Previously available to Pixel phones, Google Assistant lets users talk to his phone in a conversational way, providing answers to questions about weather, flight information and appointments. Yes, it’s like Apple’s Siri. LG was one of the first smartphone makers to reveal it would feature the assistant on its new device, the G6. In its blog post, the assistant will be rolled out this week in the US, while users in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK will get the feature soon as well. “With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,” Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, said. To use this (if you have Nougat or Marshmallow operating system), just long press the Home button and say “Ok Google” to get started. And now, you can ask things such as ‘What’s my confirmation number for my London flight,’ ‘Take me to Museu Picasso,’ ‘Do I need an umbrella today,’ and many more. According to its blog, there is no need to download the update because Google Assistant will be usable on phones running Nougat and Marshmallow with Google Play Services. “Our goal is to make the Assistant available anywhere you need it. It came to Android Wear 2.0 – via new smartwatches – just a few weeks ago and, as we previewed in January, the Assistant is also coming to TVs and cars,” Hafsteinsson said.   Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply ab5Pn3 My brother suggested I might like this website.

Really Cool. RobertDream May 13th, 2017 Reply It’s recommended to preserve a journal of the anxieties and be truthful in taking the fears that you think may influence your leadership qualities. Eliminating fears That is thus as the first-step generally deals with acknowledgement. It will take humility to tell the truth about these things, and getting rid of them becomes extra. You think about now on what you’re to get rid of the said concerns in your life as being a leader, and you also do this by being alert to the cases where these doubts overrule your thoughts and judgment as being a leader. Show patience with yourself if you learn yourself not able to beat your anxieties immediately. Hence, it sometimes becomes an effort and problem and perseverance is a great characteristic that you’re mastering while you cope with the anxieties. In working with your concerns, you’re increasing strength and intelligence like a boss. For you to carry on carrying out a superior occupation, you must also make time to reward oneself to be a better boss.

'If you go into what I call a bubble boom, every bubble bursts.' - Margaret Thatcher Home Articles Authors Search About Us HOME / Articles / Doug Noland / Crowded Longs, Shorts and a New Z1 Crowded Longs, Shorts and a New Z1 By: Doug Noland | Sat, Jun 10, 2017 Share Print Email It was a week that saw Mario Draghi cling stubbornly to ultra-dovish monetary policy, the UK's Brexit strategy thrown into even greater disarray after Prime Minister May's failed election gambit, and the former Director of the FBI essentially testify that our President is a scoundrel. And then there's the Middle East... In the midst of it all, after trading at a 24-year low 9.37 Friday morning, an abrupt reversal had the VIX ending the week at 10.70. Looking at the S&P500's slight (0.3%) decline for the week, one might be tempted to think comfortably "boring." Market internals, though, were anything but boring or comforting. Friday's session saw the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) swing wildly. After trading to an all-time high 5,898 in the first hour of U.S. trading, the index sank over 4.0% to 5,658 before closing the session down 2.44% at 5,742. Amazon traded in an intraday range of 1013 to 927. Looking at "FANG" plus Microsoft and Apple, major market cap was evaporating in a hurry. By the end of Friday's session, Facebook had declined 3.3%, Apple 3.9%, Amazon 3.2%, Microsoft 2.3%, Netflix 4.7% and Google 3.4%. The semiconductors (SOX) traded at a multi-year high 1,149 early in Friday's session, then sank 7.0% before recovering somewhat to close the day down 4.3% at 1,090. Biotech (BTK) rose 1.5% in the morning to an all-time high and then closed the session slightly lower. Yet it was not just Friday - and not only tech. After trading Tuesday morning at a low of 88.38, bank stocks (BKX) surged over 6% before closing the week up 4.9% to 93.79. The broker/dealers jumped 3.6% this week. The small cap Russell 2000 traded Tuesday morning at a low of 1,387 before rallying 3.3% to end the week with a gain of 1.2%. It was an unpleasant day and week for the Momentum Crowd all crowded into outperforming technology stocks. It was even worse for those long momentum and short the underperformers. Long tech versus short financials had been a big winner until the late-week "rip your face off" - with Friday trading seeing bank stocks up 2.3% and the Morgan Stanley High Tech Index down 3.0%. Long big technology against short small caps had also been easy money - until the last few sessions. This week saw the NDX drop 2.4%, while the small cap Russell 2000 gained 1.2%. And it's worth noting some of Friday's winners: Dillards (10.2%), Urban Outfitters (7.8%), J.C. Penny (6.8%) and Barnes & Noble (6.0%) - all heavily shorted in the despised retail sector. Moreover, the leading gainers in the S&P500 - including Kohl's (7.2%), Chesapeake Energy (4.9%), Nordstrom (5.7%), Tractor Supply Company (4.7%) and Murphy Oil 4.7% - are popular short targets. It was a rotten day and a poor week for many long/short strategies. As for the ECB decision and the UK election, I'll this evening posit the briefest of thoughts. Mario Draghi has been kicking the can down the road since 2012, and he clearly is in no mood to see what happens when his leg turns weary. We'll apparently have to wait until later in the year to have a clearer understanding of the ECB's stimulus program end-game. The Wall Street Journal ran an interesting pre-meeting article - with the catchy headline "ECB Critic Holds His Tongue as Race Nears for Bank's Top Job" - discussing how the Germans have set their sights on the end of Draghi's term in 2019. June 7 - Wall Street Journal (Tom Fairless): "Jens Weidmann, the German central-bank chief who made his name by loudly attacking the European Central Bank's crisis-fighting efforts, has become a quiet defender of the ECB against its German critics. The shift has been subtle. Mr. Weidmann still criticizes the bank's radical stimulus measures. But his tone has softened as evidence accumulates that the ECB's policies are working—and as the race to become the institution's next president approaches. 'There is currently no doubt that an expansionary monetary policy stance is appropriate,' Mr. Weidmann said..., while suggesting he might not agree with his colleagues on the details. Only five years ago, he was boasting of clashes with fellow policy makers, and comparing easy-money policies to drugs and alcohol. As ECB officials gather Wednesday and Thursday in Estonia, what was once a bitter argument over the bank's far-reaching monetary stimulus is expected instead to be a pragmatic discussion about whether to start reducing it." And why the big surprise from the dismal Conservative party showing in the UK election? Has there been any brightening of the underlying dour public mood? Folks suddenly content with the "establishment," "elites" and the status quo? Feelings the "system" is working more fairly? Market and media complacency returned after Emmanuel Macron's huge market-pleasing victory in the French presidential election. I would suggest the Mr. Macron owes his presidency and apparent mandate to Mario Draghi. I wouldn't, however, wager on a long honeymoon period - let along some new golden age in French (and European) policy management. The political instability that had pundits fretting coming into 2017 is merely in a bit of remission. Wait until the ECB tap goes dry and the Draghi Bubble bursts. Closer to home, there was a new Federal Reserve "flow of funds" Z.1 report this week. From my perspective, interesting data raised more questions than were answered. Certainly not inconsistent with downshifting GDP (Q1 1.2% vs. Q4 2.1%), Credit growth somewhat fell off a cliff. Total Non-Financial Debt (NFD) growth slowed to a 1.4% pace in Q1, down from Q4 2016's 2.8% to the slowest expansion in years. In seasonally-adjusted and annualized (SAAR) dollars, NFD expanded $676bn in Q1, down from $1.338 TN in Q4 and $2.406 TN in Q1 2016. Seeing such data, I would normally be chronicling a dramatic tightening of Credit Availability and financial conditions. It's yet another example of these being the most abnormal of times. Household mortgage Credit expanded at a 3.0% rate during Q1, second only to Q4's 3.2% going all the way back to the pre-crisis era. Consumer (non-mortgage) Credit expanded at a 6.5% pace, matching Q4 (strongest since Q3 '15). Corporate borrowings bounced back strongly from Q4's abrupt stall (0.2%). Q1's 6.9% growth rate surpassed Q3's 6.3% and was the strongest expansion of Corporate borrowings since Q1 '16 (10.7%). Data just don't speak to a tightening of Credit conditions. Q1 saw Federal government borrowings contract at a 3.3% pace and State & Local borrowings fall at a 3.5% rate. It was this atypical decline in government Credit that largely explains Q1's tepid overall Credit expansion. At least at the federal level, a significant drawdown in deposits helps to explain the one-quarter hiatus from market borrowings. A Q2 bounce back in government borrowings should push system Credit growth significantly higher. To see booming securities markets in the face of 1.2% pace NFD growth is strange indeed. But while overall Non-Financial borrowings slowed to a crawl, the financial sector seemed to be frantically scurrying about. The Domestic Financial Sector's "Net Acquisition of Financial Assets" surged an unusual SAAR $4.840 TN (vs. Q4's $291bn and Q3's $2.716 TN). After three straight quarters of contraction, Net Interbank Assets expanded an extraordinary SAAR $1.589 TN. The Financial Sector also increased Miscellaneous Assets SAAR $1.811 TN, while expanding Debt Securities holdings SAAR $452bn and Fed Funds and Repos SAAR $158bn. Depository Institutions' Loans expanded a robust SAAR $924bn during Q1, up from Q4's SAAR $595bn but somewhat below Q1 '16's booming $1.241 TN. Clearly, booming asset markets had much more to do with a booming financial sector than a robust real economy. It would be quite unusual for booming markets not to provide some degree of economic stimulus, though bubbling markets create myriad fragilities. Securities markets remain the epicenter of this cycle's historic inflation. Q1 saw Equities increase a nominal $939bn to a record $40.755 TN. This boosted Equities as a percent of GDP to a record 214%. This compares to the previous peak levels from 2007 and 1999 of 181% and 202%. Total Debt Securities increased nominal $320bn during Q1 to a record $41.464 TN. Debt Securities-to-GDP at a near-record 218% has been relatively stable over recent quarters. Total (Debt and Equities) Securities ended Q1 at a record $82.220 TN and a record 432% of GDP. This compares to the cyclical peaks of 379% at Q3 2007 and 359% at Q1 2000. The Household Balance Sheet continues to be a centerpiece of U.S. Bubble Economy analysis. U.S. Household Assets ended Q1 at a record $110 TN, increasing $2.383 TN during the quarter. And with Household Liabilities up $36 billion (to $15.152 TN), Household Net Worth surged another (remarkable) $2.347 TN during the quarter to a record $94.835 TN. It's worth noting that Household Net Worth has now inflated $39.1 TN, or 70%, since Q1 2009. Over the past year, Net Worth inflated $7.259 TN, or 8.3%, one of the largest one-year gains on record. By major component, Household Financial Assets increased $1.781 TN during Q1 to a record $77.115 TN, with a notable one-year rise of $5.734 TN (8.0%). At 125% of GDP, Real Estate holdings gained $499bn during the quarter to a record $26.866 TN, with a large one-year rise of $1.794 TN (7.2%). Q1 Household Net Worth reached a record 498% of GDP. For comparison, Net Worth/GDP ended the ("decade of greed") eighties at 379%, Bubble year 1999 at 446% and peak mortgage finance Bubble 2007 at 461%. Unless something dramatic unfolds over the next few weeks, Net Worth/GDP will have cruised through 500% during Q2. It's worth noting that Household Total Equities (equities and mutual funds) holdings have doubled from 2009 levels to approach the record 129% of GDP from year-end 1999. Helping to offset tepid domestic Credit, Rest of World (ROW) had strong Q1 flows into U.S. financial assets. At SAAR $1.20 TN, Q1 ROW flows compare to an outflow of SAAR $187bn in Q4 and an inflow of SAAR $501bn in Q1 2016. Curiously, Treasury purchases (SAAR $344bn) dominated flows into U.S. debt securities and were the strongest since 2014. Purchases of U.S. corporates slowed to SAAR $132bn, down from Q4's SAAR $433bn. After big Q4 outflows (SAAR $480bn), ROW increased U.S. equities holdings SAAR $219bn during Q1. It's difficult to comprehend that ROW holdings of U.S. financial assets have grown to almost $25 TN, inflating about ten-fold from the mid-nineties. Returning to the markets, players will spend the weekend pondering whether Friday's tech swoon was a mere flash in the pan or the beginning of something more serious. That intense selling manifested from market dynamics rather than in response to some news event might make it more difficult to spin. Rotations have become a common feature of this speculative marketplace, and the bulls will spin rotations positively. This week saw previous underperformers gain momentum, while the highflyer Wall Street darlings saw melt-ups rather abruptly indicate potential trouble below. When the Crowded Trade phenomenon has finally made it to the top of the food chain - to a select group of speculative favorite megacaps - a big rotation away from the darlings will present a formidable market challenge. From my vantage point, such dynamics are consistent with equities (and risk markets) working toward putting in a major top.   For the Week: The S&P500 slipped 0.3% (up 8.6% y-t-d), while the Dow added 0.3% (up 7.6%).

Trump Administration Watch: June 6 - Wall Street Journal (Kristina Peterson, Stephanie Armour and Louise Radnofsky): "Republican senators left their first decision-making meeting on overhauling the nation's health-care system Tuesday deeply divided over the fate of Medicaid, a fissure that threatens to thwart their ambitions to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. The divide among Senate Republicans over Medicaid was wide enough that some GOP lawmakers and aides said they now believe it may be impossible to broker a deal to unwind the health law known as Obamacare. Some senators are already preparing to move to another goal, an overhaul of the tax code. 'It's more likely to fail than not,' Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said of the health bill... 'We need to bring this to an end and move to taxes.'" June 6 - Financial Times (Robin Wigglesworth and Ben McLannahan): "Investors are growing more sceptical that the Trump administration will be able to nurture an economic bounce, with Treasury yields and the US dollar sagging to new post-election lows and the US equity market increasingly dependent on technology stocks to maintain its highs. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped as low as 2.13% on Tuesday, its lowest since the immediate post-election surge in November." China Bubble Watch: June 3 - New York Times (Ryan McMorrow): "When a Chinese tech company with global ambitions began to run short of cash last year, it sought billions of dollars from new investors. One of them was a music teacher. Li Shenghong, who teaches out of a mall storefront in southern China, was already a fan of the smartphones and televisions sold by the company, an internet-and-gadgets conglomerate called LeEco. When LeEco also began selling investment products online, Mr. Li snapped them up, even though the company said little about where the money would go. 'Whenever I have leftover money from my salary, I'll invest it,' Mr. Li said, explaining that he had invested $7,000 in the company. 'My spare change? I put it in.' LeEco, buffeted by rapid expansion, has turned to murky and potentially risky ways to stay afloat, including tapping China's shadowy informal banking system, which many people believe threatens the Chinese economy." June 4 - Wall Street Journal (Chao Deng and Lingling Wei): "China's crackdown on debt is driving some companies to a murkier form of financing as it gets harder to secure bank loans or tap the bond market. New loans from so-called trusts, firms that raise money from individuals and corporations to plow into riskier areas of the economy, reached 882.3 billion yuan ($129.5 billion) in the first four months of this year..., nearly five times as much as the same period in 2016. Trust firms, which often charge borrowers higher rates than banks, occupy a middle ground between banking and asset management. They are licensed and loosely regulated by China's banking watchdog, but they lack some of banks' protections, such as government deposit insurance, and they have more flexibility to invest in risky areas than banks do." June 6 - Wall Street Journal (Shen Hong): "A sharp rise in the cost of borrowing in China's bond markets is the latest sign of conflict between Beijing's effort to rein in financial-system risk and its long-term goal of modernizing the economy. In a little-noticed shift, Chinese companies in recent weeks have been able to take out medium-term bank loans at a lower interest rate than bond investors demand. The average yield on AAA-rated five-year corporate bonds, currently 4.90%, has been above the central bank's corresponding benchmark lending rate of 4.75% since May 3... The highly unusual reversal—it hadn't happened since records began in 2006—is largely down to Chinese regulators' attempts to tamp down speculation by investment funds that borrow heavily to leverage their bets." June 5 - Reuters (Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo): "Activity in China's services sector expanded at the fastest pace in fourth months in May thanks to a surge in new orders, a private business survey showed, helping to offset worries about unexpected weakness in manufacturing. The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 52.8 in May from April's 51.5, breaking a four-month decline and marking the highest reading since January." June 7 - Reuters (Yawen Chen and Kevin Yao): "China's foreign exchange reserves rose in May for a fourth consecutive month and by more than markets had expected, as stringent capital control measures and a weakening in the dollar helped staunch outflows. Reserves rose $24 billion in May to a seven-month high of $3.054 trillion, compared with an increase of $21 billion in April... It was the first time since June 2014 that reserves climbed for four months in a row, and the biggest gain since reserves moved back above the closely watched $3 trillion level in February." June 7 - Bloomberg: "China's overseas shipments accelerated from a year earlier in May, aided by more buoyant global demand, and robust imports signaled resilience in the domestic economy. Exports rose 8.7% in May in dollar terms, more than the 7.2% increase forecast... Imports surged 14.8% in dollar terms, more than the 8.3% forecast. The trade surplus widened to $40.81 billion." Europe Watch: June 7 - Reuters (Jesús Aguado and Francesco Guarascio): "European authorities stepped in to avert a collapse of Spain's Banco Popular following a run on the bank, orchestrating a last-minute rescue on Wednesday by Santander, the country's biggest lender. Owners of Popular bonds faces losses of some 2 billion euros, while Santander will ask its shareholders for around 7 billion euros ($7.9bn) of capital to absorb Spain's sixth biggest bank." June 7 - Reuters (Francesco Guarascio and Stefano Bernabei): "European Union regulators believe their rescue of Spanish lender Banco Popular has strengthened the case for intervening in Italy's two weakest lenders, but expect it will be harder to use the same approach, a senior EU official said... EU regulators arranged for Spain's biggest bank, Santander, to take over Banco Popular, but only after wiping out the investments of the troubled lender's shareholders and junior creditors -- a move welcomed by financial markets which saw it as a possible template for other EU banking crises." June 8 - Reuters (Gavin Jones): "A proposed Italian electoral law that looked set to usher in early elections has lost the support of major parties, sending shares and bonds higher and easing nerves among investors wary of yet more political uncertainty in Europe. 'The accord on the electoral law is dead,' Emanuele Fiano, a deputy from the ruling Democratic Party... told reporters after his group lost a parliamentary vote on a proposed amendment." June 8 - Bloomberg (Carolynn Look): "German industrial production rose more than analysts predicted, with a fourth consecutive increase in manufacturing adding to signs of underlying strength in Europe's largest economy. Output... jumped 0.8% in April after an upwardly revised drop of 0.1%... The typically volatile measure compares with a median estimate for a 0.5% gain in a Bloomberg survey. Production was up 2.9% from a year earlier." June 7 - Financial Times (Mehreen Khan): "Things are on the up for the eurozone economy. With growth accelerating, unemployment steadily falling, and inflation at comfortable levels, the European Central Bank should be resting easy that its more than two-year stimulus experiment is bearing dividend after years of concerns about the eurozone's political stability. But there are still some worries for the central bank of 19 eurozone countries. Among them is a growing headache over the implementation of its QE measures and more specifically, a shortage of available German bonds. Latest data from the central bank's QE holdings show the ECB fell short of its monthly target for German bond purchases for the second month in a row in May, raising concerns about the longevity of the aggressive stimulus policies in place since 2015." Brexit Watch: June 9 - Reuters (David Milliken and Kate Holton): "British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would lead a minority government backed by a small Northern Irish party after she lost an election gamble days before the start of talks on Britain's departure from the European Union. May called the snap election confident her Conservative Party would increase its majority and strengthen her hand in the Brexit talks. Instead, Thursday's vote damaged her authority and made her negotiating position more vulnerable to criticism." Global Bubble Watch: June 6 - Bloomberg (Miles Weiss): "High up in a New York City skyscraper, China's biggest bank is playing in the shadows of American finance. The prize for Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. isn't stocks, bonds or currencies. It's the grease in the wheels of all those markets: repurchase agreements. By exploiting a loophole in rules intended to keep U.S. banks from getting 'too big to fail,' the state-owned ICBC has become a go-to dealer in repos in just a few short years, alongside longtime powerhouses like Goldman Sachs... The short-term loans allow investors to borrow money by lending securities, serving a vital role in day-to-day trading on Wall Street. ICBC's rise reflects not only China's global ambitions in high finance, but also how post-crisis rules have let a whole host of new players profit from the murky world of shadow banking, largely beyond the reach of bank regulators." June 5 - Bloomberg (Noah Smith): "In the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, Calvin asks his dad how engineers determine the weight limit on bridges. The dad answers that they do this by driving heavier and heavier trucks over the bridge until it breaks, then rebuild the bridge after discovering what it took to break it. This isn't how engineers actually figure out the safety specifications of bridges -- since they know a lot about how physics works, they can predict how much it would take to break a bridge without actually breaking it. But the same isn't true in the financial world. No one knows the basic laws that govern asset markets, so there's a tendency to use new technologies until they fail, then start over. Calvin's dad was effectively describing the process by which we test financial innovation. Mortgage-backed bonds are a good example... In the years since the crisis, financial markets have started to be transformed by a new innovation -- exchange-traded funds." June 6 - Financial Times (Robin Wigglesworth): "Is leverage, the poison that brought the global economy to its knees less than a decade ago, creeping back into financial markets? The global economy is enjoying a rare spell of broad if not strong growth, financial markets are tranquil, corporate earnings are buoyant, and monetary policy remains supportive. As a result, the MSCI World equity index sits at a record, up more than 11% so far this year, while bond markets are becalmed. Yet some investors, analysts and economists fret that beneath the calm surface there are some worrying cross-currents that could turn the sea choppy once more. In particular, signs that leverage — in the form of borrowed money or derivatives when they are used to amplify bets on asset prices — is creeping up. 'The low volatility frightens me, because I know what it does to people's behaviour,' says Robert Frey, chief investment officer at FQS, a fund-of-hedge-funds... He compares it to building a flimsy oceanfront house because there have been no storms recently. 'Eventually a hurricane will hit and the house will fall down.'" June 7 - Bloomberg (Beth Jinks and Simone Foxman): "Billionaire investor Paul Singer said 'distorted' monetary and regulatory policies have increased risks for investors almost a decade after the financial crisis.'I am very concerned about where we are,' Singer said... 'What we have today is a global financial system that's just about as leveraged -- and in many cases more leveraged -- than before 2008, and I don't think the financial system is more sound.' Years of low rates have eroded the effectiveness of central banks to contend with downturns, Singer said..." June 7 - Bloomberg (Enda Curran): "Central bankers and investors are grappling with a $100 trillion question: why consumer price inflation remains so low in most parts of the world even as economic growth quickens. Compounding the riddle, question marks are now emerging over the one part of the global inflation picture that had been moving higher -- producer prices. That's because two engines of that turnaround -- China's resurgent factories and prospects for tax-cut fueled stimulus under President Donald Trump -- are showing signs of fading. Which way the inflation mystery unravels is crucial for the global monetary policy outlook and the world's $100 trillion bond market." June 5 - Bloomberg (Greg Quinn and Erik Hertzberg): "Toronto's housing fever is showing signs of cooling as price gains slowed and new listings surged in May, the first full month reflecting a new tax on foreign buyers and a crisis at mortgage lender Home Capital Group Inc. The number of new listings soared 49% last month from a year earlier to 25,837, the biggest increase since 2010... The average price rose 15% to C$863,910 ($640,076), compared with annual gains of 25% in April and 33% in March. The benchmark price index, which measures more typical mid-priced homes, rose 29%, also down from a 32% gain in April." June 7 - Wall Street Journal (James Glynn): "Data analyst Ben Reid recently took out a 25-year loan on a home outside Sydney despite a frothy housing market in Australia, believing in the market's staying power. Payments on the $500,000 mortgage will consume about half his take-home pay. 'I'd like a new car in the next couple of years but not sure where that cash will come from,' said Mr. Reid... Big personal debts and spending worries like Mr. Reid's are a gathering storm over Australia's economy, threatening a 25-year streak without recession. Growth rose an anemic 0.3% in the first quarter.., putting annual growth on track to be the weakest since September 2009... Australian household debt has risen to a record 212% of income, according to the latest available data... That's the fourth-highest globally..." June 7 - Wall Street Journal (Lynn Cook): "American oil exports are emerging as a disruptive new force in global markets. The U.S. exported 1 million barrels of oil a day during some months so far this year—double the pace of 2016—and is on track to average that amount for all of 2017... In another era, a domestic glut and low prices, currently hovering under $50 a barrel, might have caused companies to slow the pace of drilling. But since Congress lifted a ban on oil exports at the end of 2015, shipments out of Texas and Louisiana have skyrocketed, taking the fruits of the U.S. fracking revolution to new markets." Federal Reserve Watch: June 5 - CNBC (Jeff Cox): "President Donald Trump appears ready to remake the Federal Reserve in an image that will be considerably different than what investors have known for many years. The president is prepared to nominate Randal Quarles and Marvin Goodfriend to two of three vacancies at the central bank, according to multiple press accounts... Quarles likely would assume the role vacated by Daniel Tarullo to oversee the nation's banking system... Should Trump nominate the two men and they receive confirmation, it will represent the first steps in a possible substantial remaking of a Fed that has practiced ultra-loose monetary policy for the past decade but has been tight on banking regulations. Trump will have the opportunity to name one more person now, then can fill two even more critical vacancies in 2018 — that of Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer. If the Quarles and Goodfriend moves are indicators of what's to come, things could start getting less comfortable for Yellen. Both are considered solidly conservative, in line with the Republican president and Congress but perhaps not with Yellen." U.S. Bubble Watch: June 7 - New York Times (Landon Thomas Jr.): "Facebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google. Not only do they dominate our daily lives, but as their stocks continue to soar, these technology giants may also dictate our financial futures. In the last three years, their share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes — Amazon leads the way, up 206%; Apple trails the pack with a 67% gain — as investors of virtually every stripe have piled into these companies. But this gold-rush mentality, reminiscent of investor frenzies for Nifty 50 stocks in the late 1970s and the dot-com boom and bust at the end of the last century, is giving investors pause... 'There is valuation anxiety out there, that is for sure,' said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist... 'No one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive.'" June 4 - Wall Street Journal (Lev Borodovsky, Ben Eisen and Tom DeStefano): "By now it's no epiphany that technology stocks are in favor. Apple recently passed $800 billion in market value for the first time, and both Amazon.com and Alphabet, the parent of Google, are each hovering around the rarely seen $1,000-a-share level. What you may not know is that by one measure, the 2017 tech-stock rally is already at levels last seen in 2000. The S&P technology sector accounts for nearly a quarter of the S&P 500's market value. The last time that happened was 1999." June 6 - CNBC (Diana Olick): "This spring may be one of the hottest sellers' markets in history, but even off-the-chart-demand can't put every potential buyer in a home of their own. If the house is too expensive for the region's demand, it won't sell. That is becoming the case in more and more neighborhoods this spring — and is likely behind the first sign that big price gains are starting to shrink. Home values rose a healthy 6.9% in April compared with April 2016, ...but that is a drop from the 7.1% annual gain in March... 'I think we are beginning to see it in selected markets,' said Frank Nothaft, CoreLogic's chief economist. 'You just can't have house prices grow at 7% year after year, when income growth is 2-3% a year.'" June 6 - Bloomberg (Vince Golle): "If you're building or renovating a home in the U.S. these days, you've got plenty of company. Americans' spending on residential construction projects -- from the pouring of foundations to home improvement -- just hammered out its strongest three-month period since 1994. Solid job growth, low borrowing costs and a recovery in home equity since the market crash a decade ago are generating momentum... While a report... showed a 2.9% drop in April outlays for improvements from the prior month, such spending was still 32.3% higher than it was a year ago." June 6 - Bloomberg (Sho Chandra): "An increase in U.S. job openings in April to a record high indicates demand for workers remains strong in the world's largest economy while the supply is tightening, a Labor Department report showed... Number of positions waiting to be filled rose by 259k to 6.044m (est. 5.75m), from revised 5.785m in March, according to Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS..." June 6 - Bloomberg (Patricia Laya): "Chief executive officers of some of the largest U.S. companies are becoming even more sanguine about sales and spending, a good omen for the economy after a lackluster first-quarter expansion, according to a quarterly survey from the Business Roundtable... Main index gained 0.6 point to 93.9, highest since 2Q 2014..." June 7 - Bloomberg (John Gittelsohn and Erik Schatzker): "U.S. markets are at their highest risk levels since before the 2008 financial crisis because investors are paying a high price for the chances they're taking, according to Bill Gross, manager of the $2 billion Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund. 'Instead of buying low and selling high, you're buying high and crossing your fingers,' Gross, 73, said... Central bank policies for low-and negative-interest rates are artificially driving up asset prices while creating little growth in the real economy and punishing individual savers, banks and insurance companies, according to Gross." June 6 - Bloomberg (Matt Scully): "After bingeing on credit for a half decade, U.S. consumers may finally be feeling the hangover. Americans faced with lackluster income growth have been financing more of their spending with debt instead. There are early signs that loan burdens are growing unsustainably large for borrowers with lower incomes. Household borrowings have surged to a record $12.73 trillion, and the percentage of debt that is overdue has risen for two consecutive quarters." Japan Watch: June 8 - Bloomberg (Toru Fujioka and Masahiro Hidaka): "The Bank of Japan is re-calibrating its communications to acknowledge that it is thinking about how to handle a future exit from monetary stimulus, without giving the impression that this is on the agenda anytime soon, according to people with knowledge of discussions... With inflation still far below target, the BOJ is contending with increasing debate about exit in markets, the media and among some lawmakers. Officials realize it's unrealistic and unconstructive to try to remain silent on the issue and the BOJ now wants to make it known that it's conducting simulations internally on how an exit could play out... Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who has been called before parliament 18 times this year, was grilled by lawmakers last month on his thinking about post-stimulus policy. Kuroda responded by saying he would carefully consider external communications..." EM Watch: June 3 - Reuters (Anthony Boadle and Lisandra Paraguassú): "Former Brazilian lawmaker Rodrigo Rocha Loures, a close aide and friend of President Michel Temer, was arrested at his home on Saturday in a corruption investigation that also targets the president... In a police video released in May, Loures was seen running out of a Sao Paulo restaurant carrying a bag with 500,000 reais ($154,000) in cash that prosecutors say was a bribe from the owners of the world's largest meatpacker JBS SA. Plea bargain testimony by two executives of JBS's holding company J&F Investimentos SA implicated Temer and other politicians in graft..." June 6 - Bloomberg (Arabile Gumede, Amogelang Mbatha, and Aarti Bhana): "South Africa's economy fell into a recession for the first time since 2009 after it contracted for a second straight quarter in the first three months of the year as all bar two industries shrank. Gross domestic product receded an annualized 0.7% in the first quarter from a contraction of 0.3% in the previous three months..." June 8 - Reuters (Andrew Torchia): "Standard & Poor's downgraded Qatar's debt... as the riyal currency fell to an 11-year low amid signs that portfolio investment funds were flowing out of the country because of Doha's diplomatic rift with other Arab states. S&P cut its long-term rating of Qatar by one notch to AA- from AA and put the rating on CreditWatch with negative implications..." Leveraged Speculator Watch: June 5 - Bloomberg (Miles Weiss and Katherine Burton): "The walls keep closing in on John Paulson. A decade after Paulson shot to fame betting on the collapse of the U.S. housing market, the hedge-fund mogul is struggling to persuade investors to stick with him after a string of missteps on everything from gold to European bonds to drug stocks. Since the end of 2015 alone, assets at Paulson & Co. have fallen by $6 billion from losses and client withdrawals. The decline, underscored in the firm's most recent regulatory filing, leaves Paulson and his employees with just $2 billion in client money." Geopolitical Watch: June 5 - Financial Times (Erika Solomon): "Qatar paid up to $1bn to release members of the Gulf state's royal family who were kidnapped in Iraq while on a hunting trip, according to people involved in the hostage deal — one of the triggers behind Gulf states' dramatic decision to cut ties with Doha. Commanders of militant groups and government officials in the region told the Financial Times that Doha spent the money in a transaction that secured the release of 26 members of a Qatari falconry party in southern Iraq and about 50 militants captured by jihadis in Syria. By their telling, Qatar paid off two of the most frequently blacklisted forces of the Middle East in one fell swoop: an al-Qaeda affiliate fighting in Syria and Iranian security officials. The deal, which was concluded in April, heightened concerns among Qatar's neighbours about the small gas-rich state's role in a region plagued by conflict and bitter rivalries." June 7 - Financial Times (Monavar Khalaj and Erika Solomon): "Iran's Revolutionary Guards ratcheted up the tensions with Saudi Arabia as it accused Tehran's regional rival of involvement in Wednesday's double terrorist attack in the capital... Gunmen and suicide bombers launched simultaneous attacks on the parliament building in Tehran and the nearby shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic's founder. The attacks were claimed by Isis, in what would be the jihadi group's first significant strike in the Islamic Republic. However a statement from the Revolutionary Guards linked the 'brutal attack' to Donald Trump's visit last month to Riyadh, where the US president singled out Iran for fuelling 'the fires of sectarian conflict and terror'." June 4 - Reuters: "China has expressed its strong dissatisfaction with what it labeled 'irresponsible remarks' on the South China Sea by U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis during a security forum at the weekend. Mattis accused China of having contempt for other nations' interests and disregarding international law. He told the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore that the construction and militarization of artificial islands in the South China Sea undermined regional stability."     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. Author: Doug Noland Doug Noland Credit Bubble Bulletin I just wrapped up 25 years (persevering) as a "professional bear." My lucky break came in late-1989, when I was hired by Gordon Ringoen to be the trader for his short-biased hedge fund in San Francisco. Working as a short-side trader, analyst and portfolio manager during the great nineties bull market - for one of the most brilliant individuals I've met - was an exciting, demanding and, in the end, a grueling and absolutely invaluable learning experience. Later in the nineties, I had stints at Fleckenstein Capital and East Shore Partners. In January 1999, I began my 16 year run with PrudentBear, working as strategist and portfolio manager with David Tice in Dallas until the bear funds were sold in December 2008. In the early-nineties, I became an impassioned reader of The Richebacher Letter. The great Dr. Richebacher opened my eyes to Austrian economics and solidified my lifetime passion for economics and macro analysis. I had the good fortune to assist Dr. Richebacher with his publication from 1996 through 2001. Prior to my work in investments, I worked as a treasury analyst at Toyota's U.S. headquarters. It was working at Toyota during the Japanese Bubble period and the 1987 stock market crash where I first recognized my love for macro analysis. Fresh out of college I worked as a Price Waterhouse CPA. I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Oregon (Accounting and Finance majors, 1984) and later received an MBA from Indiana University (1989). By late in the nineties, I was convinced that momentous developments were unfolding in finance, the markets and policymaking that were going unrecognized by conventional analysis and the media. I was inspired to start my blog, which became the Credit Bubble Bulletin, by the desire to shed light on these developments. I believe there is great value in contemporaneous analysis, and I'll point to Benjamin Anderson's brilliant writings in the "Chase Economic Bulletin" during the Roaring Twenties and Great Depression era. Ben Bernanke has referred to understanding the forces leading up to the Great Depression as the "Holy Grail of Economics." I believe "The Grail" will instead be discovered through knowledge and understanding of the current extraordinary global Bubble period.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Google Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL get leaked in renders, benchmark specs Mobile Phones Google Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL get leaked in renders, benchmark specs By Sohil Nikam - Jun 10, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Google’s next Pixel 2 has just gotten leaked in two separate instances, with one showing off an alleged render of the regular version and the other revealing key specs related to the larger XL version. There’s no mention of the largest XXL model in either, leaving it under a shroud of mystery. Starting off with the image, the so-called Pixel 2 seen in the photo above features a minimal bezel design, keeping in line with the overall trend of 2017 to ditch borders and expand on screen real estate. There is also a pair of dual cameras on its back, another hot trend that Google is yet to hop on to. Other than these two major differences, the Pixel 2 looks mostly the same as its previous variant. The render may well be a fake, given how easy it can be to Photoshop the original to make it look more like the Galaxy S8. Also See: Google Pixel 2 ‘Taimen’ pops up on Geekbench running Android O Moving on to the Pixel 2 XL, a GFXBench listing suggests that the smartphone will feature an unusual 2560 x 1912p resolution through a 5.6-inch screen. One explanation for this unique combination is that the phone will have a roughly 2:1 or 18:9 aspect ratio, just like the LG G6 and Galaxy S8. Another reason could be that this is simply a discrepancy on the benchmark’s part where it’s not taking into account the Pixel 2 XL’s navigation bar at the bottom. If accounted for, GSMArena says the resolution comes to the standard 2560 x 1440p, while the size would actually be 5.7-inch diagonally. As per the rest of the listing, Google may equip the device with 4GB of RAM, a 2.4GHz Snapdragon 835 processor, a 12MP primary camera, an 8MP selfie snapper, and 128GB of ROM. The smartphone was tested on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, but it’s more than likely the company will send it out to the world running Android 8.0 inside.

View All 65 Articles In This Series Android O's third developer preview has just landed, and we're already spotting some pretty cool changes. Among the first we spotted is color-coding for rich media notifications, meaning that these notifications will be themed based on album art / video thumbnails.   It appears that Google is using pastel/muted colors (I'm not an artist, so excuse me if this isn't the correct terminology) to produce these notifications. This is probably to ensure that while the notifications are easier on the eyes, less boring, and more immediately identifiable, they're still not overly shouty. Smart move, Google.   left: 7.1.1 Nougat. right: 8.0 O DP3. In addition to this color-coding, the thumbnail now fades into the notification. This was done not only for a minor visual effect, but it also allows the album art / thumbnail to get noticeably larger while still leaving a decent amount of space for the title and author of the work. For apps that contain thumbnails that are wide-screen (namely YouTube), you'll unfortunately get some black bars on the top and bottom, but that's an issue that was already present prior to DP3. You'll see these pretty notifications from music apps such as Google Play Music, Spotify, and YouTube Music, as well as apps that allow videos to be played in the background like YouTube Red and Chrome. It's definitely a sweet addition, and I'm glad Google is continuing to add little tweaks even in the second-to-last O developer preview.

Thanks for the catch. rndusrnm479461 DP3 released today. No DP4 yet. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1c7458f72cd0685f9c96bb162334ebaaa5411e7b62fba437d04ce72df2a551e0.gif whispy_snippet Yep. I really, reeeally like this. Awesome! Mark I love these emoji. What a shame they will die rndusrnm479461 Oh my god. It's beautiful... David Onter The fading looks hideous, Google should just do it like Phonograph used to. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5af0b6c17ab07d0c012bdf0bc1a5fff9c0309c6a4ab71636186c32e483c977aa.png whispy_snippet Material design offers guidance, not a set of hard rules. If everything was completely flat it would get stale really quickly. I don't see a problem with the odd gradient. Jonathan Hernández Please tell me that Phonograph doesn't use that layout on 7.0+. Also, there is nothing in the guidelines that specifies that this is material or the new one isn't. It's okay you don't like it, but that doesn't mean it's not material. Teja Yeah the colors are way too harsh. Adrianus AJ Nadeak I do prefer the album art on the left side so the controls stay on the right side regardless of the notification's size. Maxr1998 Glad that I'm not the only one who thinks that fade looks ugly af. -_- Colored notifications are generally fine though, if done right - like above. maybe I'm just angry because Google removed/broke OMS3 again in DP3, and I have to destroy my eyes with that terrible white and teal everywhere.. Bala Where did that black theme came from 🙄🙄🙄 God of chaos This is Nougat. Santos Chavez I really don't see the big deal, I rather like Google's implementation of it, especially for the first version of it. It'll probably improve over time. Adrianus AJ Nadeak I like that one simply because they keep the controls on one side. Currently, it jumps from off-center right to all the way left. Grey In my mind this idea sounded garrish and ugly, but the images look simple, understated, and muted. It's really nice! SomeGuy112 Very nice, too bad they seem to be sticking with the ugly white device theme though. Rohan An theme/color scheme option would be nice. Ibrahim Yusuf This looks so good, love it 😍💕 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2440fc282d940020032f634444bd7ca4f40eb7d77cb2dbc89fdd9504b9b4b302.png needa That does look good. Willie Chalmers III It gives a sophisticated feel like iOS, but it appears more elegant than iOS. blindexecutioner You mean all those stupid ongoing notifications? Curtis Bond Womp, womp... Boomdizzle I did notice those pop-up quite a lot. I guess I'll have to see if they get annoying or not or if I find them useful down the road. Miku is Best Vocaloid I had this in Phonograph ages ago. Ash I still miss the full screen music lockscreen from KitKat. That thing was awesome. Boomdizzle I usually have a full lock screen of the music album and the navigation pane in the middle for the music if I pause the music and turn off the screen or pull the cable out of the phone (essentially doing the same thing.) Was the KitKat one different than that? I honestly don't even remember. Boomdizzle I usually have a full lock screen of the music album and the navigation pane in the middle for the music when I go to unlock the phone with music playing. Was the KitKat one different than that? I honestly don't even remember. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/231ab1b3e6336be8c2d93a501c8f528518fd52d5b6fdedd139750ce63b6126c1.png Santos Chavez Yeah, for me on my Pixel XL it displays an image of the album right on the lockscreen as well. Not sure how it was in KitKat. Chandan Kumar https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/936ade7908c74409abeced3bf67e9ba3d56a5fee8aedbdd91544657cea80fe16.png Boomdizzle Ah I remember that now. I guess it's a little cleaner looking but essentially the same thing. Freek Smulders How often do you see a lockscreen with today's Fingerprint Sensors? Rohan Fingerprint is Integrated in power button on my phone so i can't even see the lockscreen long enough to register my notifications Alejandro You can, you only have to use the wrong finger :) Rohan The way I hold my phone, my thumb naturally rests on the power button. If I hold it in left hand I have either the index or middle finger on it. Both of them too are registered. Any other finger is just awkward. Adrianus AJ Nadeak I only registered the thumbs and middle finger. I don't see the need for the index to do the same. Boomdizzle I use my fingerprint reader all the time but I do glance at my phone for the time or to quickly see a notification that I can't respond to right away, also to quickly skip a song. P. Sherman This is... quite amazing, actually. Stu It looks awkward with YouTube, but the rest are really nice. i_say_uuhhh I like it, but needs some work design wise. iCON "Glad you came" Indeed. needa Woohoo. Waking up to this put a big ol' shit eating grin on my face. Hope this build is less stressful to deal with. And the media notifs look great. meijin3 I love this change! Also, that wallpaper on the left looks awesome. Where might I find it? Corbin Davenport It's from the HTC U11 wallpapers! http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/16/htc-u11s-included-wallpapers/ Nomaan Holding battery icon from quick settings or just going to battery option from settings app now has an animation of battery getting filled up to current level. boop And it also now has a separate persistent notification when music is playing in the background that can't be disabled. Lord Argyris I guess I'm in the minority then. I don't like it, from both an aesthetic and functional standpoint. Aesthetically, I just think it looks ugly, though there's no accounting for taste so that's just my opinion. Functionally, however, whenever you have a set of controls that changes appearance arbitrarily, it's less functional because you have to waste a split second identifying and confirming it's what you're looking for every time you use it. The time spent doing this is minimal, but for something like quick play controls, which you often use as part of a complex workflow in lieu of switching back to the full app, that tiny recognition pause can be jarring and, over time, irritating. I'll reserve final judgement for when I've actually had an opportunity to use these controls. In any case, this is just another example of Google spending time making small, arbitrary changes to the UI. At least they didn't just outright ditch playback controls and replace them with nothing, or eliminate some of the controls to make it look "better" (e.g. I seem to remember early versions of Lollipop got rid of one of the transport controls, which was quickly reinstated). needa I have used it several times now. There is no stopping to confirm as much as stopping to look at what is there. The all black youtube on chromecast notifs look great. Nothing really slowing me down controls wise... they are every bit as pronounced as before. If anything they will slow you down when scanning other notifs, as it draws your attention to it. boop Another change is that music controls won't be displaced by general notifications anymore and more stable positioning could just as well increase the speed of recognising the controls. marclee i thought material design is about material-like and this is not..... needa Kind of a bummer to see that this doesn't also work if casting from a different device. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3630e4168a0b706449d426e3bde5bafa1f832512b92c95ed675d8efca0f8430f.png Rohan I hate this notification. It should be opt in, not opt out. Rob Agreed. Rizki Putra Perdana goddamn this is beautiful K9 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d85ebf4967024b84956a2be939638ec1ef3d7e5c89db1f4e6642d220cdd60054.png Sry if this is not a new feature but I hv just noticed tht u can select where u want to edit your number in calc EvilHowl Yeah, that's new! Rohan Alsot the Arrow on the right sheet looks new. Thomas Gladdines Trying to replicate this using the pallete library, but can't seem to get the right colors :/ kalehv I thought it's not just the ongoing ones. They have a new notification API that let's apps put a colored background. Isn't that for the notifications that can be dismissed as well? Maybe they're automatically extracting the color in album art for music apps but I think this is also available for notifications they can be dismissed Alejandro Luckily, Substratum will work on Android O and I will keep taking advantage of my AMOLED display with black themes. Rod That looks great. Haider Rehman Butt Wtf at that white notification area? Badouken Its gross isn't it? Looks like someone accidentally hit the invert colors toggle but its not... Rob Hope there's a way to turn this off. I don't want thumbnails on my notification screen...sometimes the artwork is offensive. Atoqir Don't like this all. I was so happy that in 7.0 all notifications are forced to have the samr white background matteventu They weren't forced like that lol Adrianus AJ Nadeak Seems forced to me. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f726473a5e659c7293bcecf92435d580f678f6728586c34a1114b18fd5e531ac.png miscfiles Looks great! I also noticed they've rounded off the triangle "play" button so it looks more consistent with the back button on the nav bar. sbeaulieu Wonder how pornhub chrome video notification will look like😂 fijisiv I wish this was possible with standard notifications as well. The visual indicator on notifications is so small I end up reading... all. of. them. every. time. For example, make the Gmail notification red so when I hear a new mail notification I don't have to re-read the notifications from Photos, Maps, Google App, et al, I just look for the red one, ah ha, my email notification. evang18 Um no google, keep the player controls to the far right where they belong. And move the time and quick toggle expansion button back up PLEASE. boop What I like about this is that it'll actually pull black and white from an image, contrary to prior versions of the palette api that would pull random colors out of compression artifacts. Ste Tan Man this looks so sexy. I absolutely love it 😍😍. (These new emojis are awesome too) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d252b8f6de00ebce08d504efe94357541503d90d4c23d6e69955681db498bc42.png Leo Arten I just really wish they would include further control to the notifications, like fast forward, rewind etc etc.. Adrianus AJ Nadeak So they're not all white? Great! I don't like the all white ones. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f726473a5e659c7293bcecf92435d580f678f6728586c34a1114b18fd5e531ac.png I'd still like the controls to stay on one side regardless of the size.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Smartphones Google Pixel XL 2 GFXBench listing suggests Snapdragon 835 processor, 5.6in screen and 4GB RAM The smartphone is expected to pack a 12 megapixel rear camera. By Sarmistha Acharya June 10, 2017 13:30 BST Google Pixel XL 2 appears in GFXBenchGetty Images/Jewel Samad The successor to Google's last year's Pixel XL smartphone has made an appearance at the GFXBench database, revealing the hardware features of the upcoming smartphone. The listing on GFXBench, spotted by WinFuture, suggests the Pixel XL 2 will sport a 5.6in screen with resolution at 2560 x 1312 pixels. The mobile application processor in use is Snapdragon 835 featuring an octa-core processor clocked at 2.4GHz. The processor is paired with Qualcomm's Adreno 540 graphics unit. Other technical specifications listed in the benchmark are 4GB of RAM, 128GB of internal storage, a 12 megapixel camera at the back with 4K video and an eight megapixel front-facing camera, almost the same hardware elements seen in last year's Pixel XL. While the spec listing suggests Android 7.1.1 operating system onboard, the final product is expected to run Android O bearing version number 8.0. The features of the upcoming Pixel smartphones have appeared previously through leaks. In March, Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of hardware at Google, confirmed the Pixel smartphone would get its successor. "There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it. You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now," he said.

The new Android O developer preview includes some visual tweaks and new features. Android O now comes with new and colorful notifications. The new layout allows notifications to change color if they contain embedded images and the background gradually fades into the picture. Moreover, the Android System now automatically displays a persistent notification, letting users know if an application is running in the background. Still, Google lets users disable the feature using the new notification channels. Aside from this, Google introduced a new feature that allows users to change the shape of icons from cylinder to teardrop, square, rounded square, squircle or use system default.

View All 65 Articles In This Series Sometimes it's the little things in life that bring the most joy. Google often uses Android developer previews to test small changes and gauge public opinion on them ahead of a final release. This may or may not be one such example. Dev Preview 3 has reversed a tiny change that was made in the last version, namely changing the order of the WiFi and cellular icons on the status bar. Granted, this seems like a really insignificant alteration. But clearly there were plenty of users annoyed by the change, and this forced Google into reverting to the previous state. If nothing else it just looks weird when cellular comes first. The angles of the two icons fit nicely together when WiFi leads. If you don't believe me, take a look: Above: The right way round, Dev Preview 3.  Below: The wrong way round, Dev Preview 2. So there you have it. A tiny change, but one that will likely please a good number of Android fans. Cheers, Google.

Midnitte Rip best emoji ever. Frisi :( Wes C Get that <8.0 blob out of here. (Not really, I wish they'd bring the blobs back) ninjustin Bye blobs :( Nick I'm actually kinda torn about the new emojis after using them for a bit. I actually really like Google's blob emojis, they had a distinct style about them that was fun and playful. However, at the end of the day it is a way of communicating with others and it fails at that if they look too different. Although, I do remember that someone did versions without the borders and gradients and I did like that better. Ishimaru RIP blobbies :( :( :( Ryan Cavitt I am one with the blob, the blob is one with me. EH101 Dislike the blobs. Glad they're done. They always reminded me of Dots candy. Best solution would be to have Emojis be interchangeable like fonts are in some skins. someone755 But not all emojis mean the same for all groupsets. If my friend with a GS5 sends me an emoji it could have a totally different meaning for him and myself. (There have been a few awkward times because of it. Don't ask.) EH101 That's true, and the primary reason I prefer a single universal set of Emojis instead of everyone doing their own. For a long time I would switch my Emojis to iOS Emojis to be sure what was meant across device conversations. Probably similar reasoning was used when they designed the new Emojis to look more like Apple's. Scott Scrivens https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/70/43/7043683e2ef6acd3920958ad6509cd60.png Carsten Given that most design changes result in many angry comments, what will happen now?! I'm actually quite interested if now everyone will be like "aww yeah back again" or if the ever-complaining comments switch to "I just started to like the new style more" or something :D A Person You guys get paid per-article, don't you. Nick The order of icons in the status bar is very important, switch them up and people go insane! In all seriousness, it's okay that they go over every little detail in these new releases, it's very easy to scroll on by if I don't want to read them. All_I_do_is_post_gifs http://i.imgur.com/eA85ZxQ.gif Jay I see the battery percentage is still outside of the battery icon though. 😒 I don't understand why we can't have both as a choice. Damnit, Google. Frisi That bothers me so much. I turned it off. Zach Mauch I don't mind this change. I can never read the damn thing as it is. Even on my Pixel XL or 6P. There just is not enough contrast. However, considering it is already a hidden setting it should probably just be an option for either. freshprince_87 It would be even better if the font of the battery 🔋 percentage is the same as the clock 🕒 DragoCubed Choice desu Willie Chalmers III Don't fool me like that, AP. I thought the blob emoji were back. ☹️ create812 Same Lazyboy0172 Also the LTE icon is part of the signal bars again, not a separate icon on the bar. Frisi Holy sh-- you're right! I knew something else changed but it didn't caught my eye! aRvInD Any screenshot? Lazyboy0172 not very exciting because it looks identical to pre 8.0, but yeah I'll take a screenshot for you- http://i.imgur.com/mFDuUOy.png Ryan Cavitt Do you ever roam? I wonder where they decided to stick the roaming indicator. I really like OxygenOS' implementation of the roaming indicator. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/efb226690d019dcf77b60974e74631de485ccc0a127b3481923ca0b68fd1edc3.png Patrick Mustard A globe icon with a little "R" on its corner would do just fine. Willie Chalmers III This makes way more sense. Nick What I thought Google was trying to go for was to display what your data source was in one spot. I think they were aiming to do that since the persistent wifi icon was a bug. I think this was a solid logical choice, but the logical choices are not always the most pretty ones, especially with how hard it is to make a big "LTE" icon look good. Miku is Best Vocaloid In Moto devices the LTE indicator is still part of the mobile signal icon but the icon itself covers two spaces. It's kind of annoying but I already got used t https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/07453798a06ae19d208a210da2196e4026c737a8cd6ba83a2d45b402a9348b87.jpg o it. My1 lol does it have to be that large? I would expect a small "4G" or whatever on the cell but not this abomination Miku is Best Vocaloid I dunno why. It has been like that since at least Jelly Bean on the original Moto G. Ryan Cavitt Funnily enough when the OG Moto G got the Lollipop upgrade, they removed the Moto signal cluster and went with the bog standard AOSP cluster. I guess they really did not care at that point. Álvaro R. Only in some reguons, on most countries was still the big letter Vlad It made sense on the dual SIM Moto G. I thought that was the reason. I guess not. Winston Wasn't so on Lollipop on my 2014 Moto X, at least I don't remember so when I got it (when I bought it, it shipped with 5.0, and to the best of my memory the launch software didn't). But either the 5.1 or the 6.0 update screwed it over and replaced it with a super fat "4G" text. 2 Men-E I would like the indication to be similar to this. The "4G" not as large, but indicated surely...so when we finally get 5G in the states, we know. Bewear I personally hate OEMs that do this. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't really mind, it's only the only change Motorola made to the SystemUI. Patrick Mustard By the way, "LTE" is probably far less user-friendly than "4G". Curt Lavlee. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Can you put the battery percentage in the icon, or is it still separate? Илья There are some things they can't just put in Boomdizzle Still separate, unfortunately. Willie Chalmers III Now only if Google would get forced to change the emojis back because of WAY more annoyed users. Alex Let them stay. There are users (majority I'd think) who have no clue what those weird blobs meant. Frisi Sadly, that's correct. Dennis Ulijn Try using them a few weeks, go back to Android <8 and see if you still feel that way. I think most people that see the emoji in use will prefer the new ones (a game of emoji riddle with assistant is a good way to test). Asuka Tanaka I wish Google would add an option where we can change the Emojis Willie Chalmers III I'll try. I know I'll have to give in eventually, so I'm going to install the third developer preview. Goodbye to my blob brethren. 😞 Boomdizzle That was the thing that drove me nuts the most was that the angles were all off. Flows so much better the old/current way. Jared They also got rid of the grayed out wifi icon in the status bar when wifi is not connected (yay!). They have not allowed disabling notifications for Android System, which means I have a constant notification that SwipePad is displaying over apps (boo!). The Google Play Music widget seems to be working properly now. It was pretty broken in DP2 on my 6P. Sruly J According to Google, the greyed out WiFi icon when not connected was a bug. Zach Mauch Now if only the would make the lines of the two icons parallel. It is hard to see, by the angle of the line on the wifi icon is slightly more steep than the angle on the cell signal icon. It aggravates my OCD. Ian Santopietro I didn't mind the order change. I just didn't want the wifi icon there when I wasn't connected to or searching for a wifi connection Dennis Ulijn That's fixed too :) AND they threw in the small H (for 4G) again, too! Google listens. miscfiles Now they just need to make the angles consistent between the WiFi and cellular icons. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4850d98240afa410b5ca01e63ac91b7e8cd973724d50eb33e4c4559627956720.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c65ec559dd82129b60e8150ead4a70f7b6556ea45d10427018452947ae9e44e8.png Sorry. Once you see, you cannot unsee. Zach Mauch I just said this, but your post on it is SOOOO much better. Nice visual! miscfiles Great minds think alike! As a graphic designer this stuff matters (far too much) to me. Zach Mauch Well, I'm an engineer not a GD, but my wife is. LOL! With how quick you whipped up that example I figured you were. miscfiles The other thing that winds me up is the battery percentage in what looks like Roboto Condensed Light or Regular, while the time is in Roboto (not Condensed) Medium or Bold. So there's a difference both in character width and weight, which doesn't sit well. miscfiles Top is like the current. Middle is same widths, different weights. Bottom is same weights, different widths. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/682ce12d4a97875f5990bfb5b598e8b148eacb30d21f87e29dbd951e76414edb.png Daniel Do you guys remember the Google Pixel commercial, the part where they said the battery chargers really fast? They had a different battery indicator (than the usual one) and I thought for sure that's how 7.0's battery was gonna look Nathan Gin https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0bc6b74974180b009dc776faae5f64ddcdde0a96b5db3ab9078c47e158cf2d99.png This?

Bewear It looks like a seriously handicapped heart symbol. Lord Argyris Please, please, please don't give them any ideas! Gah! Seriously, though, I never considered the width as a constraint. You're right; they had to choose between different widths or different heights depending on what they prioritized. Boomdizzle Gee thanks for pointing that out! miscfiles I just want to share my pain... ;) Scott Scrivens Why would you do that, my eyes :( miscfiles I'm hoping to be headhunted by Google as Pedantic Design Critic... :P JD I wonder if it's on purpose to fit in LTE or 4G+ those labels on top of the cell reception bar during hand over. duke1 Report these issues to Google issue tracker. Hopefully they'll get this squared away Ed. Blake Google is almost an engineer-only company and was never good on designing UIs. They focus on hardware, binaries, scalability, new technical inovantion and etc... They're really need some designers. Now more than ever. Lord Argyris "Sorry. Once you see, you cannot unsee."

Tj Hariharan oh great, i hate you for making me see this btw...damn it! Borgman Is the battery % displayed like that only when charging, or it's now an option to have it outside the battery icon? Tr3ple Always like that Federico Rios hope they keep it Trooper311 Ahh so much better! Thank you Google! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wow! Scoop of the century. This is Pulitzer level stuff.

Denholm Willmer Of course they do JD It's not a secret Kristian Ivanov Nobody messes with the WaiFu icons! ...I mean WiFi icons >_> Margaritas Ante Porcos Bands switcher buried even deeper than before. In my apartment I can make and receive calls only in 2G. Every time I am forced to switch manually between 2G and LTE because my carrier won't switch to 2G automatically. Long story short, Android O makes my life even more difficult. P.S.: Since Android 7 I noticed like Google in favour of UI aesthetics hid many useful functions deeper. Things I could do with one-two click on Android 6, on Android 7 take at least one click more. With Android 0 things got even worse. JD That makes no sense Ten Bears this is the real news. mxwp But the cute blob emoji is still gone. Sad face. Hexlattice "order has been restored" = golden!

Search Watch Live Home Vote 2017 UK Brexit Trump World Business Tech Entertainment Offbeat Weather Sponsored By Technology tycoons lose billions in stock market fall A decline in technology companies' shares comes as investors pause to consider whether the stock prices can keep on growing. 12:27, UK, Saturday 10 June 2017 Image: Jeff Bezos has been hit by the fall in the Amazon share price Twitter Facebook Google+ Whats App Mail A drop in the value of US technology stocks has wiped billions of dollars off the net worth of some of the world's richest people. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stumbled in his sprint to become the planet's wealthiest man when his company's share price fell more than 3% on Friday, wiping $2.6bn (£2bn) off his net worth. The Nasdaq stock market, where many tech stocks are listed, closed down 1.8% on Friday, with the tech sector declining 2.7% overall. Bezos became number two in the rich stakes in March when his company announced plans to acquire Dubai based e-tailer Souq. He has now dropped back to third, behind Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who is top, and Zara fashion boss Amancio Ortega. Image: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's net worth is also down Shares in Facebook, Google's parent company Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft were also trading down. Mark Zuckerberg lost $2bn, while the net worth of Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin was down $1.32bn and $1.31bn respectively. Gates is worth $89.2bn, Ortega $84.6bn, Bezos $83.9bn, Zuckerberg $64bn, Page $48.1bn and Brin $47bn. Apple's shares had sunk 4.7% as a result of news that its new iPhones could have slower speeds. Image: Google founders Larry Page (L) and Sergey Brin The drop came as investors paused after a period of enormous growth in the technology sector. Analysts have said there has been nothing in the news which would explain the drop, but suggests it is a response to the success of technology shares in recent period. Goldman Sachs warned the successes of the tech giants such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet, may be overextended. "Tech stocks have done so well, have made such a big move, and people are asking 'How much better can it get for them?'" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust.

Shares Google's follow-ups to last year's Pixel and Pixel XL are two of the flagships we've still not  seen this year - with a reveal expected October time - but judging by the specs that just leaked onto the web, they're going to be worth the wait. The posted benchmarks show a phone with a 2.4GHz Snapdragon 835 CPU, 4GB of RAM, 128GB of internal storage space and a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with 4K video support. On the front there's a 7-megapixel snapper. Those specs more or less match up with earlier rumors of what the Pixel 2 phones are going to be packing, and if they're right then these handsets are going to be a match for the 2017 flagships from the likes of Apple and Samsung. Remember we're anticipating that two or maybe even three Pixel 2 phones will make an appearance. Screen time The spec that really stands out from the benchmark listing is a 2,560 x 1,312 pixel, 5.6-inch display - not only does that suggest this is the larger XL model but it also hints that Google is joining the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 in going for a 18:9 screen. With phone display bezels disappearing fast, that extra screen space gives users more room for webpages, movies, photos, games and whatever else they want to bring up on screen. Netflix has even started filming some of its shows in a 2:1 aspect ratio. We're just four months away from the expected Pixel 2 reveal date and the rumors are starting to flow in: based on the speculation that's appeared so far, we're looking at a set of flagship phones that are going to be waterproof, headphone jack-less, and rather expensive.

On Friday, Softbank said it had struck a deal to acquire Boston Dynamics from Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which had acquired the robotics company in 2013 but decided last year to put it up for sale. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. “Boston Dynamics are the clear technology leaders in advanced dynamic robots,” said Softbank chief executive Masayoshi Son. “I am thrilled to welcome them to the SoftBank family and look forward to supporting them as they continue to advance the field of robotics.” Boston Dynamics is widely known for developing robots with potential military applications. The robots are built to withstand substantial abuse. Videos on the company’s YouTube channel show its four-legged contraptions recovering after being shoved and kicked, while its bipedal robots have been hit with hockey sticks. When Alphabet signaled that it was looking to shed the company last year, reports suggested that one major factor was the high cost of developing the robots, as well as a hazy path to market. Since Google reorganized as Alphabet in 2015, the company has ramped up its focus on financial sustainability — particularly among its so-called other bets, which include Google Fiber, X and Nest. It appears that Softbank may be more willing to accept Boston Dynamics’s leisurely R&D timeline. And it makes some sense culturally, too: As its population ages, Japan has turned increasingly to robots to make up for workers who are leaving the labor pool. More than 26 percent of Japan’s population is over the age of 60, according to the World Bank. As a result, Japan has invested heavily in robots for elderly care, hospitality and other applications, leading to a boom in the technology. In 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe predicted that Japan’s robot market will be worth $21 billion by 2020. A spokesperson for Alphabet didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the sale. Shares of Softbank closed up 7.43 percent on the Tokyo stock exchange on Friday. Alphabet’s stock was little changed as of 11 a.m. Friday.

The firm now has times listed for when it will stop providing telephone and online services. As you can see from the table, the firm has listed in detail what kind of support each of its devices will receive. The older Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 7, and Nexus 10 have long had their telephone and online support expire, while the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 still have it available until October of 2017. Those still using a Nexus 5X or Nexus 6P will be happy to know that they still have quite a bit of time left, as it is set to expire in September 2018. Last, but certainly not least, Google's latest Pixel and Pixel XL will have coverage until October of 2019. If curious, you can head to the sources listed below, to find out how long Google will be supporting your particle device with Android updates and its monthly security updates. As far as operating systems are concerned, the firm has most recently announced Android O, which is expected to arrive officially in August but is still currently in beta for a handful of handsets.         LATEST STORIES (10) CCTV Footage of the Moment ISIL Terrorists Attack Imam Khomeini's Shrine US Senate Advances Iran Sanctions Bill - Irrationality and the Illegal Syrian Army Intensifies Operations East of Palmyra to Seize Arak Energy Field Syrian Pro-Government Forces Fortify Positions at Border with Iraq In Fight for Philippine City, A Painful Window on War Iraqi Popular Forces at Syrian Border Position Homs: Syrian Army Makes Gains against ISIL on Hills Near Arak Gas Fields Over 50 Families Return to Western Qalamoun Town Following Recent Army Achievements Iraqis Pay Tribute to 1,700 Fallen Cadets on 3rd Anniversary of Speicher Massacre Muslim Supporters Deliver Message of Peace to Anti-Muslim Protesters in NYC Top Commander: Iran to Give Unforgettable Lessons to Terrorists Official: Iranian Ports Ready to Send Needed Goods to Qatar Tens of Terrorists Killed, Injured in Clashes between Rival Groups in Northern Syria Tens of Saudi Mercenaries Killed, Wounded in Clashes with Yemeni Forces Syria: Up to 60 FSA Gunmen Join Ranks of Pro-Gov't Forces CCTV Footage of the Moment ISIL Terrorists Attack Imam Khomeini's Shrine TEHRAN (FNA)- New CCTV footage released by the IRGC on Iran's state-run TV shows unseen parts of ISIL's Wednesday terrorist attack on the mausoleum of Imam Khomeini.

Chrome 59 adds Animated PNG support, a new Image Capture API, and more [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/07 12:35pm PDTJun 7, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 101 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares184 Applications Google News Article Contents 1 Animated PNG support 2 Image Capture API 3 Improved security 4 Other features 5 APK Download Chrome 59 has just been released for Android and desktop platforms, with the most important new features being Animated PNG support and a new Image Capture API. Without further ado, let's take a look at everything version 59 offers. Animated PNG support GIFs have long been the image format of choice when it came to short silent animations or clips, but over the past few years, the format has started to show its age. GIF files can often balloon in size when used for anything other than short sequences. That's why services like Gfycat and Imgur, which convert GIFs to video files, have become popular. Animated PNG (or aPNG for short) is one of several file formats created to replace GIFs, with support for 24-bit images and 8-bit transparency. Starting with Chrome 59, Google finally supports aPNG. The file format hasn't really taken off on the web, but Apple does use it as the file format for iMessage stickers. Take a look at the image below - if the ball is bouncing, it means your browser supports Animated PNG. If you're curious, we compared aPNG to Animated WebP and GIF in this post. Firefox has supported Animated PNG since Firefox 3, released in 2008. Opera started supporting the format with version 10 in 2009, but stopped after the browser switched to Chrome's engine (once Opera updates to Chrome 59's engine, they should work again). Image Capture API You probably know that web pages have been able to take pictures (with your permission) for years now. But all pages could do is take the pictures - not change any camera settings. The new Image Capture API, which is enabled by default in Chrome 59, gives web pages more control over your device's camera.    Using an Image Capture API demo on Chrome 59 The new API makes it easy for pages to not only take pictures, but also to detect and switch between available cameras, use the flash, zoom in and out, and even focus the image. Best of all, pictures taken with this API are full resolution. Previous methods required taking a snapshot of a camera feed, which yielded lower quality images. Just like with other camera APIs, you must give the page permission to access your camera(s) for this to work. You can try out a demo of the Image Capture API here. Just select a video source from the dropdown menu and allow access to your camera. Improved security Google has been taking security with Chrome very seriously lately. Google plans to mark all HTTP pages with text entry fields as insecure later this year (in Chrome 62), but in the meantime, some minor changes have been included in Chrome 59. First off, pages embedded using iFrames are no longer allowed to send notifications. iFrames are commonly used to embed advertisements and videos on sites, so there really wasn't a need for them to provide notifications anyway (outside of malicious ads). Secondly, pages can no longer embed content from FTP servers (URLs starting with ftp://). At the time of writing, about 0.0002% of web pages accessed in Chrome do this, so you're not likely to notice this change. Finally, Chrome 59 blocks requests for sub-resources that contain embedded credentials. For example, if a web page tried to embed a file with the URL "http://user:[email protected] /test.pdf," it would show a network error. Other features Like always, Chrome includes changes for both users and developers. Here are some smaller features that ship with Chrome 59. The Installed Related Apps API is included in Chrome 59, but requires switching a flag to use. This will allow websites to ckeck if their mobile app is installed. For example, the Twitter mobile site could check if the Twitter Android app is installed. Pages can no longer modify some aspects of Chrome's HTML5 player with Shadow DOM. Chrome now uses a white status bar if the Chrome Home flag is enabled. The Presentation API is now supported, which gives pages the ability to access external presentation-type displays. You can view a demo here. On the desktop, Chrome 59 can be run in 'headless mode,' which hides the Chrome user interface and only shows the specified web page/app. Chrome will block a site from asking for notifications for one week after you deny it three times. On the desktop, Chrome 59 includes a new Material settings page. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Which is a shame. Tom Erlandsen It's more for tablets I'd like to see extension support. Web browsing on my Pixel C feels very basic compared to using any kind of desktop or laptop Berkay And Desktop, too :P My name is…. I only want performance improvements. There are browsers much faster than chrome out there. Tom Erlandsen Completely agree. Web browsing is one of the few places I notice stuttering on my XL David Onter Which one? KitchUK The Samsung Internet browser is blazing fast on my S7 compared to laggy Chrome. Wilson been waiting to install uBlock Origins on Chrome for Android :X CA-Sandra ^ This! OG1502 Firefox for Android has Add-On support. Corbin Davenport Yep, and it also supports WebExtensions, which is Mozilla's implementation of the Chrome extensions API. So technically speaking, Firefox for Android supported Chrome extensions before Chrome on Android. Rod Unfortunately, this fix won't be applied until v60. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641 PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Chrome 59 ... desktop DT Chrome will never support a DL of YT video extension, which is a dealbreaker for me. https://testpilot.firefox.com/static/images/thumbnail-facebook.png needa PC updated as soon as I loaded the about page. Wish I could say the same for my phone. Corbin Davenport That's what APKMirror is for :P needa Tried it twice. DP2 XL. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ee1cef4f68ef7ad59b4cae9369fa2e2651746e8f8d79287d7ddb5f03afc24349.png Makay Chapulets Tried it once and bang https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bdfac6356ffaef73ac90555a253ef1ec037200b036dd671fd6f2242b4ef980a9.png needa No worries mate. I will continue to beta test this freaking bugged out version of Android O, in order to better your life in a few months. PSA: If anyone is thinking about jumping on the O bandwagon... don't. The memory management is absolutely horrid. Loads of other annoying things going on also. Good enough for daily? Yes. But irritating as hell if you prefer a fluid experience. Makay Chapulets If only I had a Nexus or Pixel device, i probably will be on the O version by now. Artem Russakovskii Check the internal version of the one you have installed and the one you're installing. Are you getting the Android 7.0+ one? Usually these errors are because you're attempting to downgrade versions as far as internal version comparison is concerned. needa Yeah I got the 7.0 one. I already deleted the apk. I will try it again. I assume since your commenting... you have it running on O. So worth trying again. Artem Russakovskii No, I'm still on N myself. needa They have it locked down then. I am on 3029.82. Apk Mirror doesn't have that version, but it does have 3029.83 for May's update. I tried installing that one to get there, before I tried today's again. That didn't work either. Artem Russakovskii That's odd. Try looking at logcat - it'll tell you the exact reason. needa not rooted. Artem Russakovskii You don't need root to access logcat, just adb and a computer. needa Spent a good fifteen or twenty minutes trying to read it. I should look at what different levels do to filter out the stuff I don't need. Pretty cool though. Lots of stuff to look up to make sure these network requests are legit. Anywho... I got a lot of failed to bind and failed to resolve hosts. Crypto shutdowns. Lots of Greek to me. Can write to a log to file if you are wanting to see it. Artem Russakovskii Sure, I can take a look. needa Waited ten secs to start. Took about twenty-five secs to fail. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6Dso39VLflWZy1UU1V1TDU1UU0/view?usp=sharing Artem Russakovskii This is the line responsible for the failure: "06-07 21:10:25.573 941 1046 W PackageManager: Can't install package targeting released sdk." Looks like it only wants apps built for O+. Michael Tran Anyone on Pixel with Android O having success manually installing? It goes almost all the way and then stops and says app not installed. I'm downloading the ARM64 version. boo Jay Same issue. No dice. Justin Osborne It'll do this for other stock apps as well, like YouTube. I think it's related to the package signing, but I don't really know and just guessing. Kieron Quinn It is, it was confirmed in the official Google+ group StW This version (all variants) doesn't seem to install on Android O, preview 2. Dustin Wyatt > On the desktop, Chrome 59 can be run in 'headless mode,' which hides the Chrome user interface and only shows the specified web page/app. That's not what headless mode is. Headless mode allows you to run Chrome without any UI at all...not even the web page. This is useful for programmers who want to do things like generate screenshots of websites, scrape info off of sites, or run automated tests of their own sites. SupahNin10doh I never understood why the browser has access to the phones vibration, those ads are the worst. I wonder if this iFrames change fixes this. PI Stop Watching P-O-R-N Corbin Davenport It doesn't. But yeah, I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea for pages to vibrate the device (at least without permission first). My1 that can be said for pretty much anything websites can do. permissions and the ability of removing them are important. ESPECIALLY if some of those can be used for tracking My1 sure took their time for APNG. also whats the problem with ftp embedding? Corbin Davenport FTP is pretty insecure at this point. https://thehackernews.com/2013/12/security-risks-of-ftp-and-benefits-of.html My1 well it's not too much better or worse than HTTP and that is still allowed. Teja As Samsung opened up its browser for other Android phones, I've been using it from past few days and I feel Samsung's browser is much smoother than Chrome. Is it just me?

Ramona Pringle Technology Columnist Ramona Pringle is an associate professor in the RTA School of Media and director of the Transmedia Zone at Ryerson University. She is a CBC contributor who writes and reports on the relationship between people and technology. Related Stories The past is painful enough without targeted ads to remind you Peddling authenticity: Social media influencers undermine traditional ads Facebook warns again on ad growth, shares dip from high Critics worry Facebook could be targeting ads to meet users' emotions There's a very good likelihood that you, reading this, use some kind of ad blocker. If that's the case, then you've managed to outsmart Wall Street, Silicon Valley and Madison Avenue, and can go about your Googling, Facebook browsing and YouTube viewing without having to endure relentless pop-up ads and pre-roll video commercials. Well, for now at least. Is Facebook using all your 'feels' to sell you stuff? Spark: The past is painful enough without targeted ads to remind you According to recent reports, Google is set to start blocking ads with a proprietary filter for the Chrome web browser. But in some ways, the announcement is a bit of a red herring distracting us from the long game the tech giants are playing. Many marketing experts are touting ads that are targeted to you based on the images you post on social media as the next big thing in advertising. In her anticipated annual trends report, technology forecaster Mary Meeker noted that just as Google uses Adwords to deliver users ads based on what they type, companies such as Snap are now seeing success with ads based on what images users share. For instance, if you post images from a beach vacation, you might be targeted with advertisements for bathing suits. If you post photos of your kitchen renovation, you might see ads for new appliances. Just the start As image recognition continues to advance, new apps that utilize your smartphone's camera will only propel this trend forward, by being able to recognize what you're looking at and pair you with the most relevant ads, no searching necessary. Major tech companies such as Google are no longer just in the business of advertising to consumers — they’re also in the business of selling the actual goods. (Kim Jin-a/Associated Press) Just as many photo apps now enable facial recognition, soon they'll also recognize other things in your images, from settings to objects. This means that before you even post your photos to social media publicly, your smartphone will know what you're looking at and be able to match you with relevant ads. Let's say you're staying in a hotel and you like the couch in the lobby —taking a photo of it could connect you with ads for similar home furnishings. But once the technology is in place to connect users to relevant advertisements based on what they photograph, there's really no reason that companies won't be able to leapfrog ads entirely. Imagine taking a photo of that couch and being sent to the source of similar styles or models directly. Chances are, if you take a photo, Google, Amazon or Snap will be able to track down the brand and lead you to the source to actually buy it.  In the not-too-distant future, companies clamouring to sell us their wares won't even need ads — or rather, we won't notice them, because everything we interact with using our smartphone cameras will be selling us something, and often times, available for purchase with one simple tap or click. Advertisements, as we currently understand them, will just be middlemen, an extra and unnecessary step between consumers and products. And this is where the tech giants have an advantage.  This shift away from advertising as we know it will benefit the big guys and likely lead to even greater monopolies. One-stop shopping Giants such as Google and Amazon have powerful search engines capable of matching us with targeted ads. But these companies are no longer just in the business of advertising to us — they're also in the business of selling us the actual goods. And as they increasingly become the destination for our purchases, it will be at the peril of small businesses and bricks-and-mortar store fronts. You can already buy groceries (and pretty much anything else you can think of) directly from Google, which is inching its way into Amazon's territory.  Amazon started as a destination for one-stop shopping and has recently turned heads as a media company, churning out some of the most acclaimed TV series of the past few years. Their incentive for producing Emmy Award-winning shows such as Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle reflects how advertising is morphing. Coupled with the explosive growth of voice search, it seems inevitable that soon we'll be able to buy the jeans we see on the lead character in a show, as it plays before us, with a simple swipe or voice command. Amazon has the show, they've got the products, and they've got the infrastructure and interface that connects it all — who needs ads? Ad blockers might be the hot issue of today, helping to save our sanity by filtering out the barrage of online ads that appear across social media and in our searches, but the way products are sold to us is set for rapid upheaval. Ads as we know them could soon be a thing of the past — but advertisers could very well end up selling us more stuff than ever.

Eoin Morgan and Ben Stokes didn’t cope with the pressure so much as ignore it, launching a memorable counter-attack that took England to the brink of victory. They could hardly have played better. Stokes, in particular, scored at modern speed by playing classical strokes. One dreamy shot off Pat Cummins has taken out a lease in the memory bank. So, England will play in Wednesday’s first semi-final against the runners-up in Group B.

Updated at 1.04pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.53pm EDT 12:53 39th over: England 233-4 (Stokes 96, Buttler 28) Ricky Ponting and Nasser Hussain are on commentary, which means an avalanche of insight. One of the better things about growing old is when players you liked become great commentators. They have plenty to say about handspeed, head position and much else besides when Buttler launches Zampa for a storming straight six. That’s the eighth six of the innings. There’s a carnival atmosphere at Edgbaston, and I’d imagine at least one of the Australian fielders is discretely gritting his teeth. “Speaking of being 10-15 years behind,” says Matt Dony, caressing his Hoxton fin. “Yes, this is a great one-day team, with genuinely exciting batting. But imagine how much better they’ll be when KP comes back...” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.46pm EDT 12:46 38th over: England 226-4 (Stokes 95, Buttler 22) Some people say England are playing with 10 men because of Jason Roy’s poor form.

Buttler then hammers the ball towards long-on, where Cummins can’t decide whether to go for the catch or save boundary and as a result does neither.

That would have been extremely tight with a direct hit. An otherwise stress-free over for England yields five, all in ones and twos. “Stokes is the real deal it seems,” says John Treacy. “Great to see him really progress in the last 12 months . The IPL is helping these guys get self-confidence and break the auras of their competition.” Indeed. The experience is worth, er, a million dollars.

England 194-4 (Morgan run out 87) A stunning partnership ends with a shambolic run out. Stokes chips Starc’s slower ball just short of mid-on and sets off for a single anyway. Morgan is extremely late to respond - he was ballwatching - and isn’t in the frame when Zampa’s superb throw hits the stumps at the batsman’s end. Michael Slater, commentating on Sky, almost has a fatal orgasm as he describes the action. It’s an important wicket for Australia, but maybe not that important. Eoin Morgan is run out by Zampa.

One of the best shots I've seen for a while!👌 June 10, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.19pm EDT 12:19 31st over: England 193-3 (Morgan 86, Stokes 85) A wide low full toss from Cummins is pinged beautifully through extra cover for four by Stokes. Australia no longer need a wicket; they need three. “If Ben Stokes delivers peak Ben Stokes, I think England are unbeatable,” says Gary Naylor. “I’m not sure that you could say that about Flintoff (nor Botham in ODIs). When he’s off peak, England still have options. This might be the best white-ball England team I’ve ever seen.” It’s really hard to compare eras, as they are playing a different sport to the 1992 team. They’d be the only other contenders, wouldn’t they, plus Norman Gifford’s Sharjah Massive.

Australia look resigned to a flight home. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.12pm EDT 12:12 29th over: England 184-3 (Morgan 85, Stokes 77) Oh, hello, massive! Massive! Morgan charges Hazlewood and hoicks a 91-metre six over midwicket, the fifth of his innings. This is devastating stuff, an exhilarating sight for historical sore English eyes. I’m so pleased for Morgan, who has had to endure plenty of criticism in the last few years but has stayed true to himself in every way. Whether England win anything or not, he really has had total and complete vindication. “I don’t want to speak for others,” says Matt Dony, “but surely I’m not alone amongst OBOers in being consistently 10-15 years behind the cutting edge. Really should get around to finishing Lost, but I’m too busy listening to Hail To The Thief.” You jest, but I’m a YouTube rabbit hole away from discovering Monty Python.

This is now England’s highest fourth-wicket partnership against Australia in ODIs, 142 from 135 balls. In its conception and execution, it has been the most emphatic statement. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.01pm EDT 12:01 27th over: England 170-3 (Morgan 73, Stokes 75) Hazlewood replaces Maxwell, an attempt to restore order. Which he does, in the short term, conceding just a single. England need 108 from 23 overs. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.59am EDT 11:59 26th over: England 169-3 (Morgan 73, Stokes 74) More technical problems - sorry. England continue to romp towards victory. Stokes blasted Zampa over the leaping Warner at long-on for six in the previous over; now he flicks Cummins from outside off stump to the midwicket boundary. That was a stunning piece of timing. “As good a shot as you’ll ever see,” says Shane Warne. In terms of technique, authority, chutzpah and sheer accomplishment, I can’t think of many England ODI innings better than this from Stokes. It’s been that good. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.51am EDT 11:51 24th over: England 152-3 (Morgan 70, Stokes 61) A few technical problems here - apologies. Maxwell bowls the first over after drinks, a quiet affair until Morgan launches his last ball for another mighty six. Updated at 11.55am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.45am EDT 11:45 23rd over: England 144-3 (Morgan 63, Stokes 60) England are around 15 runs ahead of DLS, though a wicket would change that. It shouldn’t feel like a procession but it does, such is the Edgbaston atmosphere and the emphatic nature of England’s batting. Morgan pulls out the reverse sweep for old times’s sake, whirling Zampa to third man for four. It’s time for drinks, and a chance for Australia to regroup. “Great points by Van Der Gucht a few overs back, that Stokes is often more than the sum of his already impressive stats,” says Guy Hornsby. “I’d love to think that Wood’s the same, if we can just keep him fit. I’ve not seen another bowler for a while that seems to have that ability to take those key wickets with a ball that just does a bit more. Finn (Mk 1) had it for a bit, Flintoff at times, but Wood is something else: short, sprinting run up, and such zip and weight off that big delivery leap. It helps that he’s a gloriously rare & lively character, very much not of the “good chap” mould. My god, we need him in cotton wool.” Yes he’s a gem isn’t he. There’s a fair bit of Darren Gough about him I think, though Gough was better at the death and Wood might be better in the middle overs. The wicket-taking ability of Plunkett, Rashid and Wood in the middle overs has been so important to England’s ODI improvement. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.42am EDT 11:42 22nd over: England 138-3 (Morgan 58, Stokes 59) Hello! Glenn Maxwell comes into the attack, and Morgan slaughters his first ball over midwicket for six! Savage batting, which brings up the century partnership at better than a run a ball. Morgan has now hit more sixes than Australia. Brendon McCullum, new into the commentary box, is effusive in his praise of England’s approach. He might even feel a bit of paternal pride, given his influence of this team. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.39am EDT 11:39 21st over: England 132-3 (Morgan 51, Stokes 59) Stokes makes room to scorch a short ball from Zampa through extra cover for four. He is playing disgustingly well, which means Morgan - who started this counter-attack - is now happy to play a supporting role. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.36am EDT 11:36 20th over: England 126-3 (Morgan 51, Stokes 54) A bit of an escape for Morgan, who mishits Starc just over the man at short extra cover. A wicket would change the mood again, so I’d counsel against premature schadenfreude. A good over, two from it. “I’m neither a hipster nor a sad old git (I don’t think),” says Simon McMahon. “I just like some of their tunes. And a day out in Edinburgh following the OBO, watching Scotland v England, maybe a beer or three, then Kraftwerk in 3D is not to be sniffed at. Even if Mrs McMahon is here too.” You mis-spelt ‘especially as’, Simon. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.32am EDT 11:32 19th over: England 124-3 (Morgan 50, Stokes 53) The legspinner Adam Zampa is belatedly introduced. He’s a good bowler and, crucially in the circumstances, a wicket-taker - he has an ODI strike rate of 30. England play low-risk cricket, and Morgan drives a single to reach a terrific fifty from 51 balls. It’s been a different sort of captain’s innings, an uncompromising reinforcement of the team philosophy at a time of difficulty. “Great from England this,” says Ian Copestake. “Can I make an Exit poll prediction? Roy will not play again not just due to his form but the fact that he took the review into his own hands. That was a moment the interests of the team were blotted out by the struggles of the individual and he should not be rewarded for that.” I do think it was a consequence of a scrambled brain rather than selfishness but yes, it was indicative. I’d be surprised if he played the semi-final; I’d be equally surprised if he didn’t play the first game of the 2019 World Cup.

Stokes swivel-pulls a tremendous flat six to reach a pretty majestic fifty from just 39 balls. George Dobell (@GeorgeDobell1) More rain on its way. Be pleasantly surprised if we get 30 overs of this second innings. So keep an eye on DLS. Even at moment. June 10, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.24am EDT 11:24 17th over: England 114-3 (Morgan 47, Stokes 46) The occasional seamer Moises Henriques replaces Pat Cummins, who went for 33 in four overs - and one of those was a maiden. Stokes charges the first ball and misses, but connects later in the over with a sweet drive over mid-on for four. This has been a game of moodswings, and at the moment the force is with England. “England bat more like Australia than Australia do,” says Gary Naylor. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.21am EDT 11:21 16th over: England 108-3 (Morgan 47, Stokes 40) England milk Head for four singles. They need 170 from 34 overs, so the run-rate is not a problem. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.19am EDT 11:19 15th over: England 104-3 (Morgan 45, Stokes 38) Stokes flashes hard at Cummins, edging over backward point for four, and then whips a dismal full toss to the midwicket boundary to bring up the hundred in the 15th over. It’s all-action stuff: Stokes drives this far short of extra cover and then drives sweetly wide of the same man for the third boundary of the over. It’s been an exhilarating, macho contest, but maybe Australia need to rein it in for a bit. Ten more overs of this and they will be going home. The required rate remains below six, so Australia need regular wickets if they are to win the game. I wouldn’t go so far as to say they in control, but it’s fair to say that rain break was perfectly timed for England and Bangladesh.

That don’t impress Shane Warne much. A low full toss is whipped behind square for four by Stokes. Ben Stokes looks for more runs.

England’s batsmen are putting pressure on Australia for the first time, and a misfield at mid-off from Starc gives Stokes a couple of bonus runs. This is a brilliant match, and it’s so refreshing to see England respond to the loss of early wickets by going even further out of their shell. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.08am EDT 11:08 12th over: England 77-3 (Morgan 41, Stokes 15) Morgan continues to take on the short ball, top-edging Hazlewood for another six over long leg. He sure is certainly practicing what he preaches, and he’s raced to 41 from 37 balls. He’s such an impressive, singular character. He does things his way and the hell wit you if you don’t like it. “Hang on a minute,” says Phil Sawyer, “pocket calculators are no longer cool?” I hate to break it to you Phil, but Campri jackets don’t have their old street-cred either. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.03am EDT 11:03 11th over: England 69-3 (Morgan 34, Stokes 14) Stokes gets his first boundary with a classical flick wide of mid-on, and his second with a hook round the corner next ball. He has now scored more runs at No5 than any other player since the last World Cup. This is fascinating stuff, with neither side backing down at all. “A question if I may,” says Andrew Benton. “Eng/SA T20 - better a day off work for Southampton or for Taunton? Cardiff’s on Sunday....(?)” You lost me at Cardiff. The Rose Bowl is a lovely ground. I haven’t been to Taunton, but it’s Taunton so I’d probably go for that.

Shane Warne declares a moral victory for Australia. “He got it high on the bat...” The relentlessly optimistic commentary of Warne and Sir Ian Botham is a fascinating insight into the mindset that enabled them to pull off so many missions impossible. “Hi Rob,” says Steve Hudson. “Steve Coogan has had a similar journey with Partridge - he used to need makeup to play a 45-year-old man in 1990, and he still needs make-up to play a 45-year-old man in 2017, but from the opposite direction.” Eoin Morgan hits a six. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images Updated at 11.09am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.55am EDT 10:55 9th over: England 51-3 (Morgan 28, Stokes 2) Pat Cummins replaces Mitchell Starc. When Cummins is good, he’s frightening, though he can travel as well. Morgan hits the field with a few well-time drives and then ducks under a short ball. A maiden. Meanwhile, this is an excellent spot from Tim de Lisle: the first four wickets today averaged 60 (239-4), the last eight have averaged 11 (38-5 and 51-3) . Updated at 11.09am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.51am EDT 10:51 8th over: England 51-3 (Morgan 28, Stokes 2) Morgan drives Hazlewood in the air for four. That could easily have been out .Either through luck or judgement, it perfectly bisected the men at cover and point. His intent is admirable though, and later in the over he gives Hazlewood the charge and inside-edge a single. “England have a bit of a tail,” says Shane Warne, who could find positives for Australia in the bubonic plague. “I think Stokes inhabits the ‘Boys’ Own heroic all-rounder’ plane of existence whereby statistics are, to a certain degree, irrelevant,” says Tom Van der Gucht. “A bit like Botham and Flintoff before him, it’s not so much the batting and bowling averages that count as the moments when they step up to the plate and make something happen. They seem to have some sort of aura, which emboldens their teammates and intimidates the opposition - making vital breakthroughs when others are starting to let their heads bow down. If there are any statistics regarding the standard of the player they get out, and how well set the player was when they got out, or the swashbuckling nature of runs scored in difficult situations. Or even player/supporter satisfaction ratings for the performances of these type of players, I imagine they would be very telling.” Yes, that last point is a very good one. Flintoff’s numbers are pretty ordinary but he has my unconditional love. Wisden doesn’t record how often a player makes your spine tingle. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.46am EDT 10:46 7th over: England 44-3 (Morgan 23, Stokes 0) The sun is out as play resumes. Starc’s first two deliveries are half-volleys that Morgan thumps to the cover boundary. A lovely statement of intent from Morgan, albeit from some unusually poor bowling. Starc pulls his length back thereafter, with Morgan swaying away from a bouncer before swishing at fresh air. That was another four-ball from Starc. “Would prefer Moeen to open with Bairstow floating between 4 and 7 depending on circumstances. How I bet they are wishing they had that option today,” says Brian Withington. “But Bairstow opening perfectly acceptable if the above is too eclectic (and personally threatening) for Morgan.” Bairstow’s a very good one-day player but he’ll never be as good as he is right now. Some people talk about him like he’s Virat Kohli.

A phone leaker, Evan Blass, last week, put on Twitter that the most awaited version of Android Wear will at last come. The second version of the watch, according to cnet.com report, looks to completely revamp the operating system and help make watches less reliant on phones. Aside from that, the next version will add an on-watch app store and built-in keyboard. As if it isn’t cool enough, the firm will also includes support for both Android Pay (mobile payments) and the Google Assistant, Google’s intelligent voice assistant that debuted on the Pixel smartphone. The report noted that earlier, it was already confirmed that not all Android watches will get the updated version. The original Moto 360 and LG G Watch won’t be upgraded to Android Watch 2.0.

By: AP | New York | Published:June 10, 2017 2:06 pm Verizon has programs that use mobile-customer data for targeted ads and may combine that with data gathered by AOL and Yahoo. (Image for representation, Source: AP) Related News How Verizon hopes to grab digital ad dollars with Yahoo From Sundar Pichai to Elon Musk: A look at salaries of top tech CEOs Cyberattacks involving extortion are on the rise, says Verizon About 2,100 jobs are on the chopping block as Verizon prepares to combine Yahoo and AOL for a digital advertising offensive. Yahoo’s shareholders on Thursday approved the $4.5 billion sale of its key businesses to Verizon. The deal is expected to close by Tuesday. AOL and Yahoo will cut 15 percent of the 14,000 workers they now employ, or about 2,100 jobs, said a person familiar with the matter who requested not to be identified discussing the cuts. USING YAHOO Verizon has a simple goal in buying Yahoo’s core business: It wants to challenge Google and Facebook in the huge and lucrative field of digital advertising. But Verizon faces its own challenge in doing so, given that it will be competing against a slew of other companies also looking to break in. Verizon wants to become a strong third choice for advertisers by adding Yahoo’s popular sites and billion users worldwide to its own media business, which includes AOL and Verizon’s home-grown go90 video service. It can place ads on those sites, and can also combine data from visitors to those sites with AOL’s ad technologies and sales teams, and possibly also personal data from Verizon mobile customers such as location and other information, in order to better target ads at individuals. Verizon has programs that use mobile-customer data for targeted ads and may combine that with data gathered by AOL and Yahoo. Verizon says customers can choose whether to participate. Yahoo and AOL are “positioned to do better together than apart,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. Also Read: How Verizon hopes to grab digital ad dollars with Yahoo But he is setting the bar low. While Verizon talks of growth from the deal, Wieser said “not declining would be a success. Five years from now, if the combined entity were the same size as it is today, I would consider that to be successful.” THE VISION Verizon sees online ads _ particularly targeted ads _ as a potential new source of growth as the wireless industry fights for US users with lower prices and other discounts. Verizon has “essentially turned into a no-growth business,” said CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino. The ad business would be a “big deal” for Verizon if it goes well, he said. Tim Armstrong, the former Google executive who joined AOL as CEO in 2009, has for years wanted to combine AOL with the long-declining Yahoo. Although AOL has big-name properties such as HuffPost and Engadget, it hasn’t been as big of an online destination as Yahoo’s mail, finance, sports and other properties. The combined business, to be called Oath, will expand its news, sports, entertainment, finance and lifestyle coverage. Like everyone else, Oath will focus on video and mobile, where consumers increasingly spend their time online. Armstrong says he wants Oath properties to be a place consumers “come and visit every day” and predicts users growing to 2 billion from 1.3 billion by 2020, with annual revenue of $10 billion to $20 billion from roughly $7 billion today. Also Read: Verizon, Yahoo agree to lowered $ 4.48 billion deal Lowell McAdam, CEO of New York-based Verizon, teased last month that this could set the stage for a new streaming video service, competing with the slew of internet-TV services already out there. Verizon already has a free mobile video service, go90, that isn’t well known. ALTERNATIVES TO THE DUOPOLY Facebook and Google together draw about half the world’s spending on digital ads, and in the U.S., they’re even more dominant. They’re also where the majority of mobile-ad dollars go, eMarketer data show.  The sway Facebook and Google hold for advertisers isn’t expected to change in the next few years. They had a head start on mobile. Yahoo has poured billions into acquisitions that have helped Yahoo make some leeway in mobile _ but not enough. It’s gotten better at doing mobile ads, but it has had no major hit apps. Still, AOL and Yahoo together provide a much-smaller No. 3 in the US for advertisers looking to reach lots of people. But even if Verizon’s goal is to just be happy at No. 3, there are several much smaller players that also draw advertisers. Snapchat is a niche hit with young people. Amazon has an under-the-radar ad business that supports its e-commerce dominance. Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, is expected to grow its piece of the ad pie; Microsoft will be just behind the combined AOL-Yahoo in the US once the deal closes. Twitter, although it’s sorting out its ad business, is a significant smaller player. Globally, several Chinese companies also rake in ad dollars. Also Read: Oath, a new Verizon unit, to debut when Yahoo is merged with AOL And the combined company will also have to compete for people’s attention, and not just with other services that rely on ad dollars to survive. Popular sites like Amazon or Netflix also suck up time spent online, said eMarketer analyst Martin Utreras. “They’ve acquired these two dinosaurs and you kind of wonder, can they be successful?” Zino said. That will depend on Verizon being able to convince marketers that they know more about consumers than anyone else, he said.

View All 65 Articles In This Series Sometimes it's the little things in life that bring the most joy. Google often uses Android developer previews to test small changes and gauge public opinion on them ahead of a final release. This may or may not be one such example. Dev Preview 3 has reversed a tiny change that was made in the last version, namely changing the order of the WiFi and cellular icons on the status bar. Granted, this seems like a really insignificant alteration. But clearly there were plenty of users annoyed by the change, and this forced Google into reverting to the previous state. If nothing else it just looks weird when cellular comes first. The angles of the two icons fit nicely together when WiFi leads. If you don't believe me, take a look: Above: The right way round, Dev Preview 3.  Below: The wrong way round, Dev Preview 2. So there you have it. A tiny change, but one that will likely please a good number of Android fans. Cheers, Google.

However, at the end of the day it is a way of communicating with others and it fails at that if they look too different. Although, I do remember that someone did versions without the borders and gradients and I did like that better. Ishimaru RIP blobbies :( :( :( Ryan Cavitt I am one with the blob, the blob is one with me. EH101 Dislike the blobs. Glad they're done. They always reminded me of Dots candy. Best solution would be to have Emojis be interchangeable like fonts are in some skins. someone755 But not all emojis mean the same for all groupsets. If my friend with a GS5 sends me an emoji it could have a totally different meaning for him and myself. (There have been a few awkward times because of it. Don't ask.) EH101 That's true, and the primary reason I prefer a single universal set of Emojis instead of everyone doing their own. For a long time I would switch my Emojis to iOS Emojis to be sure what was meant across device conversations. Probably similar reasoning was used when they designed the new Emojis to look more like Apple's. Scott Scrivens https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/70/43/7043683e2ef6acd3920958ad6509cd60.png Carsten Given that most design changes result in many angry comments, what will happen now?! I'm actually quite interested if now everyone will be like "aww yeah back again" or if the ever-complaining comments switch to "I just started to like the new style more" or something :D A Person You guys get paid per-article, don't you. Nick The order of icons in the status bar is very important, switch them up and people go insane! In all seriousness, it's okay that they go over every little detail in these new releases, it's very easy to scroll on by if I don't want to read them. All_I_do_is_post_gifs http://i.imgur.com/eA85ZxQ.gif Jay I see the battery percentage is still outside of the battery icon though. 😒 I don't understand why we can't have both as a choice. Damnit, Google. Frisi That bothers me so much. I turned it off. Zach Mauch I don't mind this change. I can never read the damn thing as it is. Even on my Pixel XL or 6P. There just is not enough contrast. However, considering it is already a hidden setting it should probably just be an option for either. freshprince_87 It would be even better if the font of the battery 🔋 percentage is the same as the clock 🕒 DragoCubed Choice desu Willie Chalmers III Don't fool me like that, AP. I thought the blob emoji were back. ☹️ create812 Same Lazyboy0172 Also the LTE icon is part of the signal bars again, not a separate icon on the bar. Frisi Holy sh-- you're right! I knew something else changed but it didn't caught my eye! aRvInD Any screenshot? Lazyboy0172 not very exciting because it looks identical to pre 8.0, but yeah I'll take a screenshot for you- http://i.imgur.com/mFDuUOy.png Ryan Cavitt Do you ever roam? I wonder where they decided to stick the roaming indicator. I really like OxygenOS' implementation of the roaming indicator. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/efb226690d019dcf77b60974e74631de485ccc0a127b3481923ca0b68fd1edc3.png Patrick Mustard A globe icon with a little "R" on its corner would do just fine. Willie Chalmers III This makes way more sense. Nick What I thought Google was trying to go for was to display what your data source was in one spot. I think they were aiming to do that since the persistent wifi icon was a bug. I think this was a solid logical choice, but the logical choices are not always the most pretty ones, especially with how hard it is to make a big "LTE" icon look good. Miku is Best Vocaloid In Moto devices the LTE indicator is still part of the mobile signal icon but the icon itself covers two spaces. It's kind of annoying but I already got used t https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/07453798a06ae19d208a210da2196e4026c737a8cd6ba83a2d45b402a9348b87.jpg o it. My1 lol does it have to be that large? I would expect a small "4G" or whatever on the cell but not this abomination Miku is Best Vocaloid I dunno why. It has been like that since at least Jelly Bean on the original Moto G. Ryan Cavitt Funnily enough when the OG Moto G got the Lollipop upgrade, they removed the Moto signal cluster and went with the bog standard AOSP cluster. I guess they really did not care at that point. Álvaro R. Only in some reguons, on most countries was still the big letter Vlad It made sense on the dual SIM Moto G. I thought that was the reason. I guess not. Winston Wasn't so on Lollipop on my 2014 Moto X, at least I don't remember so when I got it (when I bought it, it shipped with 5.0, and to the best of my memory the launch software didn't). But either the 5.1 or the 6.0 update screwed it over and replaced it with a super fat "4G" text. 2 Men-E I would like the indication to be similar to this. The "4G" not as large, but indicated surely...so when we finally get 5G in the states, we know. Bewear I personally hate OEMs that do this. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't really mind, it's only the only change Motorola made to the SystemUI. Patrick Mustard By the way, "LTE" is probably far less user-friendly than "4G". Curt Lavlee. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Can you put the battery percentage in the icon, or is it still separate? Илья There are some things they can't just put in Boomdizzle Still separate, unfortunately. Willie Chalmers III Now only if Google would get forced to change the emojis back because of WAY more annoyed users. Alex Let them stay. There are users (majority I'd think) who have no clue what those weird blobs meant. Frisi Sadly, that's correct. Dennis Ulijn Try using them a few weeks, go back to Android <8 and see if you still feel that way. I think most people that see the emoji in use will prefer the new ones (a game of emoji riddle with assistant is a good way to test). Asuka Tanaka I wish Google would add an option where we can change the Emojis Willie Chalmers III I'll try. I know I'll have to give in eventually, so I'm going to install the third developer preview. Goodbye to my blob brethren. 😞 Boomdizzle That was the thing that drove me nuts the most was that the angles were all off. Flows so much better the old/current way. Jared They also got rid of the grayed out wifi icon in the status bar when wifi is not connected (yay!). They have not allowed disabling notifications for Android System, which means I have a constant notification that SwipePad is displaying over apps (boo!). The Google Play Music widget seems to be working properly now. It was pretty broken in DP2 on my 6P. Sruly J According to Google, the greyed out WiFi icon when not connected was a bug. Zach Mauch Now if only the would make the lines of the two icons parallel. It is hard to see, by the angle of the line on the wifi icon is slightly more steep than the angle on the cell signal icon. It aggravates my OCD. Ian Santopietro I didn't mind the order change. I just didn't want the wifi icon there when I wasn't connected to or searching for a wifi connection Dennis Ulijn That's fixed too :) AND they threw in the small H (for 4G) again, too! Google listens. miscfiles Now they just need to make the angles consistent between the WiFi and cellular icons. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4850d98240afa410b5ca01e63ac91b7e8cd973724d50eb33e4c4559627956720.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c65ec559dd82129b60e8150ead4a70f7b6556ea45d10427018452947ae9e44e8.png Sorry. Once you see, you cannot unsee. Zach Mauch I just said this, but your post on it is SOOOO much better. Nice visual! miscfiles Great minds think alike! As a graphic designer this stuff matters (far too much) to me. Zach Mauch Well, I'm an engineer not a GD, but my wife is. LOL! With how quick you whipped up that example I figured you were. miscfiles The other thing that winds me up is the battery percentage in what looks like Roboto Condensed Light or Regular, while the time is in Roboto (not Condensed) Medium or Bold. So there's a difference both in character width and weight, which doesn't sit well. miscfiles Top is like the current. Middle is same widths, different weights. Bottom is same weights, different widths. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/682ce12d4a97875f5990bfb5b598e8b148eacb30d21f87e29dbd951e76414edb.png Daniel Do you guys remember the Google Pixel commercial, the part where they said the battery chargers really fast? They had a different battery indicator (than the usual one) and I thought for sure that's how 7.0's battery was gonna look Nathan Gin https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0bc6b74974180b009dc776faae5f64ddcdde0a96b5db3ab9078c47e158cf2d99.png This?

Long story short, Android O makes my life even more difficult. P.S.: Since Android 7 I noticed like Google in favour of UI aesthetics hid many useful functions deeper. Things I could do with one-two click on Android 6, on Android 7 take at least one click more. With Android 0 things got even worse. JD That makes no sense Ten Bears this is the real news. mxwp But the cute blob emoji is still gone. Sad face. Hexlattice "order has been restored" = golden!

So is the case with H-Metro. H-Metro has been employing numerous tactics of trying to combat piracy and the most recent one is uploading content as images rather than text. I know the issue of piracy is a big problem in this industry and there hasn’t been any viable breakthrough that I know of yet, but this resolution actually presents more problems than it solves anything.  Let’s go through why… So for starters, the idea is bad in that it will not help their SEO since images cannot be read by the Google search crawler and therefore, Google won’t know that they have the content. With everyone getting their news online, it’s great that H-Metro is online, however presenting their news as images defeats the purpose. I’m saying this because for a while H-Metro wasn’t actually online, for this same issue of piracy. Them making a decision to come online is therefore positive. They just need to do it the right way. advertisement Fine, say H-Metro doesn’t really mind not having a good online presence, all they want is their content protected – but that’s still problematic because of the existence of software such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR software recognises the text on images and PDFs which can then be extracted and converted into editable Word, Excel and Text output formats. And at the end of the day, you realise you really haven’t done much to address the problem. Again, this piracy problem has driven H-Metro to upload their content later in the day after most media houses have already published. But then again, that still is a problem because some online news platforms like iHarare and Nehanda Radio (which basically steals news from other sites and then ‘protects’ it – the irony!) actually manage to upload H-Metro’s content before H-Metro itself can. How? The simplest assumption we’d rather go with is that the content thieves buy the H-Metro hardcopy and transfer (by scanning and converting to text) the information contained onto their sites. And of course there was no way H-metro can gamble by delaying their hardcopy too – I mean who buys newspaper in the evening?? Anyway, using this logic, you’ll discover that the new strategy of converting text to images does not help the case since content thieves still have access to the hardcopy. So in essence: H-Metro’s new resolution will only lead to more frustration and complications rather than solve the initial problem. Enjoyed this article?

Reply Smart Donkey says: June 9, 2017 at 11:17 AM Another irony is how much the Hmetro hardy copy cuts and copies from papers like the Telegraph, The Sun and others. A substantial part of their news is also borrowed. Besides I hope they go out of business with their slanderous coverage which somehow eschews the misdeeds of the powerful bigwigs. Reply iRON says: June 9, 2017 at 12:39 PM True. Agree with all your sentiments Reply Anonymous says: June 9, 2017 at 1:04 PM They are blowing things way out of proportion if you ask me. BTW, why is there no Hmetro page on Facebook? There is even a broken Facebook link on their site.

Reply Q says: June 12, 2017 at 8:09 AM NOT QUITE! Plagiarism – the practice of taking someone else’s work or ideas and passing them off as one’s own.

That was roughly two years after Android co-founder Andy Rubin left Google after he spearheaded a series of prominent robotics acquisitions, most prominently Boston Dynamics, for the search giant.

Softbank will acquire Boston Dynamics through a subsidiary whose terms have not yet been disclosed but will include the acquisition of Schaft, owned by tech giant Google. Smart robotics are going to be a key driver of the next stage of the Information Revolution, and Marc (Raibart, Boston Dynamics founder and CEO) and his team at Boston Dynamics are the clear technology leaders in advanced dynamic robots, said Masayoshi Son, Chairman and CEO of the SoftBank Group, in a statement. Raibart said that the Californian team is looking forward to working with the Japanese company to overcome the limits currently faced by robotics. Established in 1992, Boston Dynamics specializes in the manufacture of robots for military purposes, while Schaft, founded in 2012 by a graduate of the University of Tokyo, grabbed headlines worldwide after winning the prize for the best rescue robot in a competition organized by the Pentagon in 2013. The purchase of Boston Dynamics and Schaft is part of SoftBanks international expansion strategy, which this year alone has made an announcement to buy the US investment management firm Fortress Investment besides unveiling another major investment in the INTELSAT satellite provider. Softbank also owns Sprint, Americas fourth largest mobile operator, since 2013 and in 2016 it purchased a 25 percent stake in the British ARM Holdings, a multinational dedicated to semiconductors and software development and a supplier of Apple.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

Forerunner Ventures and GV led the round. Packagd was incubated at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers by Eric Feng, founding chief technology officer at Hulu and former CTO of Flipboard. PRESS RELEASE SAN FRANCISCO, California — June 8, 2017 — Today, Packagd — a new platform fueling commerce through mobile video — is launching out of stealth with the introduction of its first app, Unboxed, which offers curated, hosted shows of the hottest tech products, gadgets, and devices. Incubated at KPCB by founding CTO of Hulu and former Flipboard CTO Eric Feng, Packagd is also announcing a $6 million Series A investment led by Forerunner Ventures and GV (formerly Google Ventures), bringing the company’s total funding to $7.5 million following its initial seed round which was led by KPCB. “Our vision for Packagd has evolved over the last 10 years, inspired by how ‘commerce as entertainment’ helped traditional players like HSN and QVC build multi-billion dollar empires during the TV era,” said Feng, co-founder and CEO of Packagd and general partner at KPCB. “Using video to drive commerce is not a new concept, but Packagd has the opportunity to bring this user experience to a new generation of mobile consumers.” The unboxing phenomenon, led by a robust community of content creators producing product review and how-to videos for online audiences, has shown a meteoric rise in recent years, with an estimated 10 billion unboxing video views a month worldwide. Google also found that 62% of people who watch unboxing videos are researching a potential purchase. While the unboxing trend is entrenched in digital culture, Packagd is the first to take advantage of the underlying retail opportunity left vacant by a disjointed shopping experience for the consumer. Built on the core pillars of discovery, community, and commerce, Packagd’s apps feature expert-curated shows, enabling consumers to discover new products with authentic reviews, interact with hosts and audiences through a live chat, and buy products securely via Apple Pay, all within the app. Packagd also works with a trusted network of content creators who curate and host programs that allow them to receive affiliate revenue generated from the purchases of products featured on the shows they host. The platform will offer content creators greater engagement with viewers through live chat and Q&A, helping to build deeper loyalty with their fans. “The overall retail industry is experiencing a seismic change as the consumer redefines the path to purchase. With the increasing consumption of video, particularly on mobile devices, we see meaningful opportunity for a video-inspired commerce experience,” said Kirsten Green, founder of Forerunner Ventures. “Packagd’s apps have the ability to redefine the mobile shopping industry, combining the best aspects of YouTube with Facebook’s live social interactions and Amazon’s effortless shopping experience in one platform for consumers.” “There’s a pretty clear trend of people, and young people in particular, gravitating towards the influencers they trust when it comes to making buying decisions. This will have profound ramifications in commerce going forward and it’s right where Packagd is aiming to play,” said M.G. Siegler, general partner at GV. Packagd’s first app, Unboxed, will target a key retail vertical: technology. Unboxed will feature programming for products like smartphones, computers, gaming consoles, videogames, cameras, drones and more, leveraging a network of content creator hosts who will serve as live video moderators for the shows. At launch, Unboxed will feature popular unboxing stars with millions of social media followers such as Austin Evans, Dom Esposito, Chris Denker (DenkOps), Frank Passalacqua (randomfrankp), Kevin Nether (Kevin the Tech Ninja), Andru Edwards (Gear Live), Matt Schaefer (MS Tech), and Jervina Coston (TechMe0ut). Also, Best Buy will support users on Unboxed to purchase technology directly from the app while videos are streamed. Unboxed is currently available for download in the Apple App Store. Stay up to date on the latest Unboxed news via Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, and join the conversation using #GETUNBOXED. Unboxed will also participate as an exhibitor at E3 2017 (booth No. 2853), held at the Los Angeles Convention Center June 13 – 15. Tune in to the Unboxed E3 nightly recap shows in app from 6:00 p.m. – 6:30 p.m. PT June 14 – 16 to be eligible to win a Nintendo Switch, DJI Spark, or Microsoft Surface Pro.* The Packagd platform will expand into additional retail verticals, starting with beauty and toys apps launching later this year. About Packagd: Packagd is a Silicon Valley-based startup building a video platform for a family of apps offering a new mobile shopping experience. Built on the core pillars of discovery, community and commerce, Packagd’s first app, Unboxed, features expert-curated shows on the latest tech products and trends. The company was co-founded in 2016 by Kleiner Perkins general partner Eric Feng and also Nick Chang, Larry Chen, Eden Li, and Kai Ju Liu. For more information, please visit https://packagd.com/.

Sell first, read later: Analyst reports say that tech stocks will continue to rise but investors still sold...what gives? By Nicholas Jasinski Updated June 9, 2017 5:08 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large After a banner year, big tech stocks fell hard on Friday. Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet (Google)--collectively referred to as the FANG stocks--have been unbeatable this year. That is until Friday, when a pair of Wall Street analyst reports seemed to send tech stocks plummeting. A report from Goldman Sachs was titled “Is FANG Mispriced?” UBS wrote its own report with the headline “Is Tech about to be de-FANGed?” The notes put the market on edge. Panicked investors did the rest. At the low Friday, the FANGs were down at least 4.5%, with Netflix off 6.5%. Each member of the group ultimately lost more than 3% on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, by contrast, was up 0.4% on the day. And the S&P 500 was down just 0.1% It wasn’t just the FANGs, of course. Other big tech stocks felt the pain, as well. Shortly before 3 p.m. Friday, Apple was down 5.5%, roughly $40 billion worth of lost market value. For the Nasdaq it became the most heavily traded day in almost a year -- more shares traded hands on the Nasdaq since June 24, 2016. But what if investors missed the point? Neither Goldman nor UBS were particularly negative on tech stocks, despite the inflammatory headlines. What did the reports actually say? Analysts from the investment banks Goldman Sachs and UBS both chose to focus on the harder to pronounce acronym FAAMG in their report. The group is made up of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet--the five most valuable tech stocks. Netflix is left out because of its relatively small market capitalization. Together, FAAMG has added over $650 billion of market cap and is responsible for 37% of the S&P 500’s gains this year, with hardly a single major down day until Friday. The reports both highlighted the lack of volatility in the soaring tech stocks, warning investors that while FAAMG is likely to continue beating the rest of the market over the long term, they shouldn’t expect the ride to always be this smooth. Investors apparently didn’t want to hear that, but the banks’ view would just mark a return to the historical norm. Tech stocks like FAAMG are considered “growth stocks,” meaning that investors flock to them because they expect to profit when their share prices increase, rather than because they seek stable income from dividends. Historically, growth stocks are more volatile than the rest of the market because they are involved in new and risky businesses and their profits can vary from year to year. This is contrary to companies in industries most people would consider boring including utilities or consumer staples such as food and household items. These companies’ earnings are relatively steady and consistent, and their share prices don’t tend to be volatile. So far this year, however, FAAMG stocks have been less volatile than the average utilities and consumer staples stock. The analysts don’t expect this to continue. Additionally, Goldman Sachs’ report brought up the possibility that investors have been confusing momentum and growth. Momentum is the idea that stocks that have been recently rising or falling will continue to do so. Of late, growth stocks have gotten caught up in the momentum trade, but that isn’t always the case. For the FAAMGs, momentum has taken over--now fundamental growth may need some time to catch up. Both reports also compared the current rally in tech stocks to the Tech Bubble of the late 1990s, concluding that on various metrics the market is healthier today. The analysts found that FAAMG shares are cheaper based on price to earnings, cash balances, cash flow, and more.

Android O Dev Preview 3 is rolling out with final APIs [Update] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 10:34am PDTJun 8, 2017 78 Plus 1 on G+ 199 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares342 Android O Android OS Google News Update 1: 2017/06/08 10:40am PDT OTAs Google dropped the second Android O developer preview on the first day of I/O last month, but here we are just a few weeks later and Dev Preview 3 is available. The full system images are available for immediate flashing on supported devices, and beta program devices will probably be updated soon. Importantly, this update should include the final APIs for Android O. Again, the only supported devices are the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL. If you've got one of those with an unlocked bootloader, you can install the DP3 system images. According to Google, this build will include the final APIs for Android O, allowing developers to finalize their plans for app support. However, this is still a preview. Some things won't work, and Google warns performance can be sketchy. Keep that in mind if you intend to use it as a daily driver. There's no OTA rolling out to beta devices at this time, but it shouldn't be long. We are still expecting one more developer preview before the final build is ready, but we seem to be running ahead of schedule compared to last year. At this rate, Android O might be official later this summer. Update 1: 2017/06/08 10:40am PDT OTAs OTAs are live as well. These can be used to update your existing O Preview device.

JSo I'm sure they will report on it if there is. FelschR As far as I can see there are lots of changes... but it's mainly API related Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It is now Android 8.0.0 DavidW yep Abdelmouttaleb Azeddine Wish my beloved galaxy nexus get android O .... VAVAMk_2 Can I haz apk for my Verizon GNEX? NeverrKnowsBest It probably will unofficially somehow. Will it be usable? Probably not. Max Johnson Probably will, through LineageOS. Brian Demodulated Best phone I ever owned. RyanWhitwam Stop lying. Brian Demodulated Ferreal! It's been the most reliable, glitch-free Android I've ever owned with an excellent microphone and comfortable feel. It's my only Android still working today, 5+ years later. It's the phone I keep switching to when my latest and greatest Android invariably fails months after the warranty expires. -edit- My current 6P is still working but all my other phones since the SGN have failed me. RyanWhitwam I said stop lying. NeverrKnowsBest Ok, I owned one, and now I know you're lying. Phoenix I was in love with that phone until it got stolen :( Shagnscooby It's definitely the most comfortable phone in-hand I've ever owned. Oliver Cervera ✔ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To me, Nexus 4 was one of the prettiest. JasonIvers I liked my Nexus 4. I liked my Nexus 6, too, but it failed _just_ before the warranty ran out, and T-Mobile replaced it with a Galaxy S7. I don't feel like buying a Pixel half way through the cycle, so I'm waiting for the Pixel 2 (or whatever Google ends up calling it) to get back to a proper phone. Nigel Antonio did they fix the significant lag after several days of non reboot. or libraries for certain security files for banks? ( yes i know its not final but damn at least my bank app worked in all other betas) FelschR it's still listed in their "known issues" list. Bill Stebbins Hopefully it fixes the laggy camera that was noted as an expected bug in the last build. Mine has been very stable so far. FelschR Well, they still list "Camera may be slow to launch.". Bill Stebbins Oh. Well then Michael Pahl Not only is my camera slow to launch, its so laggy it takes 4-5 pics at a time, then randomly deletes pics from camera roll. its beta so im not bjtching, just stating. Carlos Rodríguez The full OTAs are here: https://developer.android.com/preview/download-ota.html Cheers! Total Insecurity U are my destiny and my heart! Thanks for posting that info right now while I looked here! Borgman Any new notable features? FelschR final APIs! Such final very API wow! bozzykid It would be quite odd to be adding new features at this point in the process. Rob Well, it was speculated that the Files app would get new features some time (APK breakdown? Not sure). That could be tested in other ways than the developer preview and be added to final release of O. blindexecutioner Yep. Persistent notification you can't remove for running apps Tiuri Elvander very annnoying Good_Ole_Pinocchio "At this rate, Android O might be official later this summer." David first week or 2 of August. Pretty early. Brian Demodulated I upgraded my 6P to the previous beta and regretted it. I wiped and reinstalled N the next day. I think I'll wait for the gold RTM this time around. morteum Same here. It isn't a significant enough difference from Nougat for me to care too much. Ismail Akram When I Installed first preview I regretted too and reverted back to N. but developer preview 2 was pretty good for me. ( not the same but no hiccups ) so from developer preview 2 I've not went back to N and my radios works better too on O before I could either can get 2g, 3g or 3g,4g now I get all three modes. FelschR This has been the most stable Android developer preview. Even DP1 was already extraordinarily stable. Amit_N DP2 was definitely laggy on my device (which was case with lot of people) el_smurfo Yup...first Preview I've regretted flashing. Lost a lot of good shots with the laggy crashing camera. Jordan L agreed, I actually removed DP1 and went back to 7.1.2. DP2 has been good. I get lag. I upgraded to DP2 from 7.1.2, maybe I should fresh install these, but I've heard it should not matter. FelschR well, yes, it is laggy but most of my apps actually work on DP3 (with a few exceptions). EvilHowl And for me. Nexus 5X. Ploppy DP3 seems much better performance wise. What I noticed: no more lags when in settings of apps, no more lag when switching between apps. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach The new default icons for the Nexus 6P are squares with rounded corners. vivekkrish Yep, looks like the option to change icon shape has been removed in this update (as speculated in this post: http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/17/android-o-feature-spotlight-pixel-launcher-lets-select-icon-shapes/). Bummer! Now there is an odd-mix of sqaure, circular and app-specific (keep, youtube) shapes....blech! Frisi Make sure you have Developers Options on. I still see the option. vivekkrish Unfortunately doesn't seem to help (I had developer options on). Toggling it off then on also did not do anything. Snowsky Mountain Is the "All Apps" button still the same (the white circle with 6 dots)? Or is there a swipe-up thing now (like on the Pixel)? Nick Yeah, I'm sticking with action launcher. I cannot use Google Now launcher because it just looks so ugly. Fayas Nexus 5X also same. No circle option. I don't like this rounded corner squares :( Matej Scibravy is there an option to revert this? Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It is officially Android 8.0.0 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/50b60dca0b5a8c943cdac4dd581e751f150d254cf997d0cb108e332b2e4e55ff.png Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e3174e1cc4e379e0cf23534565dbaeab101f385692e9c9d6141b9340516ebf50.png Frisi When WiFi Off, is it still persistent (the wifi icon)? Maxwell “Max” Weinbach no Frisi Finally! Thanks! Franco Rossel No, that was a bug according to Google and they fixed it. Frisi Praise the lord. It was bugging the hell out of me. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ For now no OTA for me :( Frisi I'm downloading the zip. tmartin Anyone running this with N5X? Okay for a daily driver at this point? I don't mind the occasional reboot, but how's the camera and Android Pay? SB up to today on Android O - pay works for me. camera seemed buggy - have not tried what is released today - downloading now. Ploppy Tested on dev preview 3 and no problem with the camera. vivekkrish There seems to be a new Camera switching UI (from photo to video) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ae30ad7478f482794c3c3515e5a25df9c29ebd1e3ff702164b3bb815d6c91146.gif sgtguthrie I like it.

Frisi I'm trying to sideload, but I'm getting this on adb connecting... falling back to older sideload method... error: closed Max I re-enrolled! Hopefully they fixed the Android Auto problems or I'll have to roll back again... swimdude1120 Does the notification/quick settings still look like garbage from DP2? Nick Yes, looks the exact same. swimdude1120 Ah darn Gonzales So I should get O on my Z Play about the time that P is is in beta Brandon David Obert I flashed back to N because I couldn't use Samsung Pay on my Gear S3 when my N6P was on O preview 2. I wonder if that is still the case Frisi Whoa, Aurora Live Wallpaper is gone. O: Michel R. Android O Beta 3 Flashable Image (not ota update) https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html?utm_campaign=android_launch_npreview_061516&utm_source=anddev&utm_medium=blog#flash Jordan L ran flash-all.bat worked great, phone booted up, I bypassed all setup to enable developer options so I could re-lock bootloader, relocked it. booted back up and now I'm stuck on "Checking device info..." anyone else?!?!? rebooted, same thing. I guess I'll just wait. If I can't get past this I can't enable developer tools... can't reflash.. not good. Frisi I also don't see the Navigation Bar options in System UI settings (I'm stuck now with the ones I programmed) Frisi Wi-Fi icon and Mobile icons are now corrected (those two used to be inverted) EvilHowl What device do you have? Frisi Pixel XL EvilHowl Okay. I have a Nexus 5X and DP2 was laggy, I hope DP3 gets better... Frisi So far buttery smooth. Camera launches slightly faster too. EvilHowl Good, maybe I'll try DP3 tomorrow. Pixelexel Is it still smooth? I installed the last one on my 6P and switching between apps and other stuff was really slow. I'd really like to go back to O so if these UI transitions are smooth please let me know. Darth Vader They are really smooth for me. Frisi I just checked switching between apps, smooth and fast. (On DP2 there was some lag and jitter). Nick It seems it's corrected all around. It's back to the way it was in N. Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Thank God!!!!!! vyktorjonas can anyone tell me how it is on the Nexus Player? the last build wasn't very fast, you couldn't close app anymore and couldn't install APKs either JSo I just posted the same question. lol. I hope it improves it. The things I use still work but it is definitely clunky still JSo Anyone using this on a Nexus Player? Any Improvements? sodsavage Big improvement for me, all my apps such as Hulu are working now and the OS is much smoother with no crashes. It's actually performing better then when on Nougat. EvilHowl Anyone using this on a Nexus 5X? Is there the recents lag? SB Yes. A bit laggy. Especially the camera when taking multiple pictures or panoramas. And my bank app didn't work, but that's ok. Ismail Akram As far as I remember 5X had lag issue from the very beginning isn't it? EvilHowl I don't know what lag was it. Scott Harris I had a boot loop problem pop up the other day ago on the O beta. Ended up having to do a factory reset through recovery. Once I got everything set back up after the reset, happened again. I was forced to go back to Nougat. Tempted to re-enroll in the beta but don't know if it's worth the trouble since it seems like it was an app-related issue. Jordan L I'm completely stuck on "Checking device info..." factory wiped. I can't get past it. I guess I'll just keep waiting. my phone may be bricked. tried with no sim in, with sim, off wifi, etc... this happened after I re-locked the bootloader on DP3. could be my first bricked android phone. I googled "android 'checking device info...' " hardly any hits! this is nuts! Greg Signed up for an account here just to say thank you. I was stuck at the same place. I removed the SIM, skipped WiFi connection, now I'm good to go. Thank you so much for coming back and updating your post with the solution. Jordan L are you on Verizon too??? I really feel like this was a carrier issue. it eventually started working for me. I don't know why. I'd LOVE to know what actually is happening during "Checking device info..." clearly it goes to the internet for something. Total Insecurity @ryan whitwam: "Today we're rolling out Developer Preview 3 with the final Android O APIs, the latest system images, and an update to Android Studio to help you get ready for the consumer release later in the summer." Nick Gmail notifications work again. create812 I was wondering about this! Daniel Morata Netflix didn't work for me on the last beta. Is it working on DP3? Let's hope, Nexus 5X. Fayas Has the OTA been pushed to beta devices yet? SB go to the settings and check for an update. at first it will say you're up to date, then it will show you have an update. Fayas Got it. Replying​ after the update 😊 Thank you Jordan L OEM unlocking disabled for anyone on Verizon after flashing this?! man, I'm having a hard time with dp3. clearly I screwed something up as everyone else seems happy... I've been flashing phones for years! JSo If you flashed this, wouldn't that mean your bootloader is already unlocked? I think if it's unlocked already, it's greyed out in the settings. Jordan L "Device is LOCKED" in the bootloader. I f'ed something up. I think Verizon has my bootloader locked even though I bought the phone from Google Michael Tran Chrome 59 installs on this DP YAY! needa Woot. Sure does :). Fayas Holy shit! Why it's all square? Oh god. It's ugly AF! Am I alone? (Nexus 5X) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5bf32afc40521b1768d1e714b76c0d9f272e5d7273e81f1e61b85bba0c2e421a.png ctk4949 Mine arent like that on my Pixel XL. All round icons. JSo Google Now Launcher? I assume this because of the search bar. Fayas Yes. I had Pixel launcher. Removed it see the difference. But still the same. Also in the Settings > Apps also it's Square. Don't have options to change it (Trying figure out if there is any) Cassidy James Blaede You have to turn on Developer Settings by mashing the Build Number in the settings app. Then the shape option shows up in the Pixel Launcher settings. Fayas The option shows. But no circular option. Even on the Google Now Launcher also it's square. No way to change it to square. Only possible to change to other shapes on PIxel Launcher. Not circle for any reason. rndusrnm479461 You can change it in the launcher settings. There are options like square, circle, squircle, cylinder and some more. JSo Are you on the latest beta? Because I thought I read someone mentioned that being removed. Fayas It's not available for me... Cassidy James Blaede You have to turn on Developer Settings by mashing the Build Number in the settings app. Then the shape option shows up in the Pixel Launcher settings. Darth Vader There are no cicular icon options in those settings tho. Anyone else with 5X experiencing this? Fayas Yes, No circular option. I'm on N5X. I saw comments N6P also got the same. matesc Nothing here in the settings - N6P Fayas Now I updated the latest Pixel Launcher, When it's set to default, I still get that same Square icons, But changes to other options. No circle or rounded one. Default is square. WTF Google! Winston The prophecy is coming true. xip To refresh memories... I can't believe we actually got there. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3678d49065fb54fcc9e5288addb16b7b581084c98080a1cc32510b64b6676ea7.jpg eddiepearson Are you done? Are you really? Fruity101079 Ho! a icon (circle for music) in a triangle in a square!? xip Holy shit, seriously. What the flying f are these!? These are so ugly that I actually bothered to take a screenshot, crop it, and post a comment here a day late. https://i.imgur.com/Dz7cmHE.png https://i.imgur.com/hwYlkSl.png https://i.imgur.com/UwTcQKC.png Like, OK, Google, stop. This is starting to get retarded. I don't care if you wanna make the Pixels special with circles and if you want to keep that exclusive or whatever. Just please please please, don't do anything at all to my 5X. (Why the hell would you even do this!? It makes no sense!) ;_; ctk4949 Anyone tried Wells Fargo app, does it work?? I need to deposit some checks!! lol ctk4949 It works :) needa You need my routing and account numbers? My accts have plenty o room to store your checks. ctk4949 lol, u dont want these checks. David Hyman Hopefully it fixes the random crashes it's been causing on my Pixel C! sgtguthrie https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f63746703c57603770453cd7712690339188bac3fd4a3c26e5973a0225ad2c67.png The ota can be pulled now. Besnik Rrustemi id like to see someone upload the Pixel Launcher from this build from a Google Pixel device on APKMirror. Artem Russakovskii It's up now. Besnik Rrustemi Thank you Boss ! I can also confirm that icon shape is still there just install latest pixel launcher,enable dev options and system ui tuner. There's also a new Teardrop icon shape. Wish there was a circle option. (Nexus 6P) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5c57593deb1af7218377ea8cbb14a44cafd918ca99ebe0222ae0cb30e8affc5d.png Fayas Nexus 5X also same. No circle option :( Winston What's teardrop? boop Allo shape Snowsky Mountain Is square with rounded corners the default on the Nexus 6P? And is it possible to change it back to how it was before (or to another shape)? Alexithymia Is anyone else's phone five minutes slow using network time? needa im one to two min behind my other att phone. blindexecutioner Man fuck Google and their persistent notifications. They're so shitty when it comes to UI design. Cyan Thayn Options for notification priority appear to be gone for me. In fact, the whole notification management system seems kinda broken right now, sometimes some settings don't display at all when they should. This is sure going to be annoying until fixed. bhanik Is youtube picture in picture feature working in DP3 ? needa Yep. Been working for weeks. bhanik Thanks. For some reason its not working on my Pixel running DP3 Android o needa Just want to verify... with video playing in portrait mode, not shrunken down, you cannot hit home or multi and have video go into pip. I had issues at first too, but then a couple of days later it started working. I know I went into settings and messed around. Seems like there was something in there. But as I said... it took a day or two after messing with it before it worked. bhanik Yes. So in Settings -> Apps & Notifications -> Special App access -> Picture in Picture mode, I see Youtube has access When a youtube video is playing and I hit the home button, the entire app goes to background and the video stops playing. needa That's sucks. Are you using 'red'? That might be the difference. bhanik No. Havent used red. Unfortunately no free trial for me since I already tried it when it was launched StankyChikin Don't be afraid of the GoatBeef Mike in KC Do you have to lock bootloader to flash DP3? Thinking about giving it a try but I'm currently on Pure Nexus ROM. EvilHowl No, you must have it unlocked. boop Still no Files app Rob Perhaps it's coming in final release. I'm hoping! David Now square icons? How do I change them like in DP2? Rusty 1 are y'all like real police or internet police.. or just internet safety patrol Rusty 1 hey don't be hackin me im new at this Rusty 1 jus wanna learn how to operate phone Rusty 1 hello can u hear me AFDTechTalk Refreshing to know the notification icon mess has been fixed. That persistent WiFi icon was killing me. ctk4949 Yes!! Im glad that is gone!! Flint_PS Is it still choppy on Nexus 5X? DP2 was horrible. Fernando Pena Srsly Google? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ac3feb4f625fd752d6925ca21a76cc26bd09e38ecda081f6a5c9ffa6a3efc00f.png Fernando Pena I suggest not to install the latest pixel launcher from DP3. The icons in the new one are kinda messy, just stick with the stable version... theAlexo83 Can someone confirm please if apple music app is not crushing on this build? It used to crush on the previous build.. Thanks! sdcoiner76 The apps on this version seem very unstable. I am seeing lots of crashes. Also when I install an app the icon does not appear on the home screen automatically. Kevin Johnson Where is the June security update? Have DP3 on 6P, but no June...

View All 65 Articles In This Series Sometimes it's the little things in life that bring the most joy. Google often uses Android developer previews to test small changes and gauge public opinion on them ahead of a final release. This may or may not be one such example. Dev Preview 3 has reversed a tiny change that was made in the last version, namely changing the order of the WiFi and cellular icons on the status bar. Granted, this seems like a really insignificant alteration. But clearly there were plenty of users annoyed by the change, and this forced Google into reverting to the previous state. If nothing else it just looks weird when cellular comes first. The angles of the two icons fit nicely together when WiFi leads. If you don't believe me, take a look: Above: The right way round, Dev Preview 3.  Below: The wrong way round, Dev Preview 2. So there you have it. A tiny change, but one that will likely please a good number of Android fans. Cheers, Google.

Midnitte Rip best emoji ever. Frisi :( Wes C Get that <8.0 blob out of here. (Not really, I wish they'd bring the blobs back) ninjustin Bye blobs :( Nick I'm actually kinda torn about the new emojis after using them for a bit. I actually really like Google's blob emojis, they had a distinct style about them that was fun and playful. However, at the end of the day it is a way of communicating with others and it fails at that if they look too different. Although, I do remember that someone did versions without the borders and gradients and I did like that better. Ishimaru RIP blobbies :( :( :( Ryan Cavitt I am one with the blob, the blob is one with me. EH101 Dislike the blobs. Glad they're done. They always reminded me of Dots candy. Best solution would be to have Emojis be interchangeable like fonts are in some skins. someone755 But not all emojis mean the same for all groupsets. If my friend with a GS5 sends me an emoji it could have a totally different meaning for him and myself. (There have been a few awkward times because of it. Don't ask.) EH101 That's true, and the primary reason I prefer a single universal set of Emojis instead of everyone doing their own. For a long time I would switch my Emojis to iOS Emojis to be sure what was meant across device conversations. Probably similar reasoning was used when they designed the new Emojis to look more like Apple's. Scott Scrivens https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/70/43/7043683e2ef6acd3920958ad6509cd60.png Carsten Given that most design changes result in many angry comments, what will happen now?! I'm actually quite interested if now everyone will be like "aww yeah back again" or if the ever-complaining comments switch to "I just started to like the new style more" or something :D A Person You guys get paid per-article, don't you. Nick The order of icons in the status bar is very important, switch them up and people go insane! In all seriousness, it's okay that they go over every little detail in these new releases, it's very easy to scroll on by if I don't want to read them. All_I_do_is_post_gifs http://i.imgur.com/eA85ZxQ.gif Jay I see the battery percentage is still outside of the battery icon though. 😒 I don't understand why we can't have both as a choice. Damnit, Google. Frisi That bothers me so much. I turned it off. Zach Mauch I don't mind this change. I can never read the damn thing as it is. Even on my Pixel XL or 6P. There just is not enough contrast. However, considering it is already a hidden setting it should probably just be an option for either. freshprince_87 It would be even better if the font of the battery 🔋 percentage is the same as the clock 🕒 DragoCubed Choice desu Willie Chalmers III Don't fool me like that, AP. I thought the blob emoji were back. ☹️ create812 Same Lazyboy0172 Also the LTE icon is part of the signal bars again, not a separate icon on the bar. Frisi Holy sh-- you're right! I knew something else changed but it didn't caught my eye! aRvInD Any screenshot? Lazyboy0172 not very exciting because it looks identical to pre 8.0, but yeah I'll take a screenshot for you- http://i.imgur.com/mFDuUOy.png Ryan Cavitt Do you ever roam? I wonder where they decided to stick the roaming indicator. I really like OxygenOS' implementation of the roaming indicator. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/efb226690d019dcf77b60974e74631de485ccc0a127b3481923ca0b68fd1edc3.png Patrick Mustard A globe icon with a little "R" on its corner would do just fine. Willie Chalmers III This makes way more sense. Nick What I thought Google was trying to go for was to display what your data source was in one spot. I think they were aiming to do that since the persistent wifi icon was a bug. I think this was a solid logical choice, but the logical choices are not always the most pretty ones, especially with how hard it is to make a big "LTE" icon look good. Miku is Best Vocaloid In Moto devices the LTE indicator is still part of the mobile signal icon but the icon itself covers two spaces. It's kind of annoying but I already got used t https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/07453798a06ae19d208a210da2196e4026c737a8cd6ba83a2d45b402a9348b87.jpg o it. My1 lol does it have to be that large? I would expect a small "4G" or whatever on the cell but not this abomination Miku is Best Vocaloid I dunno why. It has been like that since at least Jelly Bean on the original Moto G. Ryan Cavitt Funnily enough when the OG Moto G got the Lollipop upgrade, they removed the Moto signal cluster and went with the bog standard AOSP cluster. I guess they really did not care at that point. Álvaro R. Only in some reguons, on most countries was still the big letter Vlad It made sense on the dual SIM Moto G. I thought that was the reason. I guess not. Winston Wasn't so on Lollipop on my 2014 Moto X, at least I don't remember so when I got it (when I bought it, it shipped with 5.0, and to the best of my memory the launch software didn't). But either the 5.1 or the 6.0 update screwed it over and replaced it with a super fat "4G" text. 2 Men-E I would like the indication to be similar to this. The "4G" not as large, but indicated surely...so when we finally get 5G in the states, we know. Bewear I personally hate OEMs that do this. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't really mind, it's only the only change Motorola made to the SystemUI. Patrick Mustard By the way, "LTE" is probably far less user-friendly than "4G". Curt Lavlee. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Can you put the battery percentage in the icon, or is it still separate? Илья There are some things they can't just put in Boomdizzle Still separate, unfortunately. Willie Chalmers III Now only if Google would get forced to change the emojis back because of WAY more annoyed users. Alex Let them stay. There are users (majority I'd think) who have no clue what those weird blobs meant. Frisi Sadly, that's correct. Dennis Ulijn Try using them a few weeks, go back to Android <8 and see if you still feel that way. I think most people that see the emoji in use will prefer the new ones (a game of emoji riddle with assistant is a good way to test). Asuka Tanaka I wish Google would add an option where we can change the Emojis Willie Chalmers III I'll try. I know I'll have to give in eventually, so I'm going to install the third developer preview. Goodbye to my blob brethren. 😞 Boomdizzle That was the thing that drove me nuts the most was that the angles were all off. Flows so much better the old/current way. Jared They also got rid of the grayed out wifi icon in the status bar when wifi is not connected (yay!). They have not allowed disabling notifications for Android System, which means I have a constant notification that SwipePad is displaying over apps (boo!). The Google Play Music widget seems to be working properly now. It was pretty broken in DP2 on my 6P. Sruly J According to Google, the greyed out WiFi icon when not connected was a bug. Zach Mauch Now if only the would make the lines of the two icons parallel. It is hard to see, by the angle of the line on the wifi icon is slightly more steep than the angle on the cell signal icon. It aggravates my OCD. Ian Santopietro I didn't mind the order change. I just didn't want the wifi icon there when I wasn't connected to or searching for a wifi connection Dennis Ulijn That's fixed too :) AND they threw in the small H (for 4G) again, too! Google listens. miscfiles Now they just need to make the angles consistent between the WiFi and cellular icons. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4850d98240afa410b5ca01e63ac91b7e8cd973724d50eb33e4c4559627956720.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c65ec559dd82129b60e8150ead4a70f7b6556ea45d10427018452947ae9e44e8.png Sorry. Once you see, you cannot unsee. Zach Mauch I just said this, but your post on it is SOOOO much better. Nice visual! miscfiles Great minds think alike! As a graphic designer this stuff matters (far too much) to me. Zach Mauch Well, I'm an engineer not a GD, but my wife is. LOL! With how quick you whipped up that example I figured you were. miscfiles The other thing that winds me up is the battery percentage in what looks like Roboto Condensed Light or Regular, while the time is in Roboto (not Condensed) Medium or Bold. So there's a difference both in character width and weight, which doesn't sit well. miscfiles Top is like the current. Middle is same widths, different weights. Bottom is same weights, different widths. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/682ce12d4a97875f5990bfb5b598e8b148eacb30d21f87e29dbd951e76414edb.png Daniel Do you guys remember the Google Pixel commercial, the part where they said the battery chargers really fast? They had a different battery indicator (than the usual one) and I thought for sure that's how 7.0's battery was gonna look Nathan Gin https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0bc6b74974180b009dc776faae5f64ddcdde0a96b5db3ab9078c47e158cf2d99.png This?

Bewear It looks like a seriously handicapped heart symbol. Lord Argyris Please, please, please don't give them any ideas! Gah! Seriously, though, I never considered the width as a constraint. You're right; they had to choose between different widths or different heights depending on what they prioritized. Boomdizzle Gee thanks for pointing that out! miscfiles I just want to share my pain... ;) Scott Scrivens Why would you do that, my eyes :( miscfiles I'm hoping to be headhunted by Google as Pedantic Design Critic... :P JD I wonder if it's on purpose to fit in LTE or 4G+ those labels on top of the cell reception bar during hand over. duke1 Report these issues to Google issue tracker. Hopefully they'll get this squared away Ed. Blake Google is almost an engineer-only company and was never good on designing UIs. They focus on hardware, binaries, scalability, new technical inovantion and etc... They're really need some designers. Now more than ever. Lord Argyris "Sorry. Once you see, you cannot unsee." I pretty much hate you right now. Philipp Gaßner You. You're a sick monster. Now, I have to switch to iOS! Dakoziol I knew I couldn't be the only one bugged by this. Tj Hariharan oh great, i hate you for making me see this btw...damn it! Borgman Is the battery % displayed like that only when charging, or it's now an option to have it outside the battery icon? Tr3ple Always like that Federico Rios hope they keep it Trooper311 Ahh so much better! Thank you Google! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wow! Scoop of the century. This is Pulitzer level stuff. Linkzy Sometimes I wonder if Google secretly read Android Police 😍 freshprince_87 I think they do Sruly J You mean aside from Liam? Sure. Denholm Willmer Of course they do JD It's not a secret Kristian Ivanov Nobody messes with the WaiFu icons! ...I mean WiFi icons >_> Margaritas Ante Porcos Bands switcher buried even deeper than before. In my apartment I can make and receive calls only in 2G. Every time I am forced to switch manually between 2G and LTE because my carrier won't switch to 2G automatically. Long story short, Android O makes my life even more difficult. P.S.: Since Android 7 I noticed like Google in favour of UI aesthetics hid many useful functions deeper. Things I could do with one-two click on Android 6, on Android 7 take at least one click more. With Android 0 things got even worse. JD That makes no sense Ten Bears this is the real news. mxwp But the cute blob emoji is still gone. Sad face. Hexlattice "order has been restored" = golden!

We’re expecting at least two phones this year like we did last year, but there are rumors that there could be a third phone in the works as well. However regardless of the rumors, a device has surfaced on GFXBench which is allegedly that of the Google Pixel XL 2, the larger of the two devices. Assuming the benchmarks are accurate, which sometimes they aren’t as they could be testing out prototypes, the Pixel XL 2 appears to sport a 5.6-inch display with a resolution of 2560×1312. We are also looking at an octa-core Qualcomm CPU clocked at 2.4GHz but there was no mention of its make and model, although it does appear to sport an Adreno 540 GPU. It also appears to be packing 4GB of RAM which some might argue seems a bit low especially with handsets out there sporting 6GB of RAM. It also seems that the phone will come with 128GB of storage which we’re not sure if it is the default amount or if it is one of the higher tier offerings in terms of storage. Other hardware features also includes a 12MP rear-facing camera, a 7MP front-facing camera, and it looks like it is running on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. Take it with a grain of salt for now, but Google is expected to unveil the handset later on in the year so check back with us in the coming months where hopefully we’ll have more details to share.

View All 65 Articles In This Series Sometimes it's the little things in life that bring the most joy. Google often uses Android developer previews to test small changes and gauge public opinion on them ahead of a final release. This may or may not be one such example. Dev Preview 3 has reversed a tiny change that was made in the last version, namely changing the order of the WiFi and cellular icons on the status bar. Granted, this seems like a really insignificant alteration. But clearly there were plenty of users annoyed by the change, and this forced Google into reverting to the previous state. If nothing else it just looks weird when cellular comes first. The angles of the two icons fit nicely together when WiFi leads. If you don't believe me, take a look: Above: The right way round, Dev Preview 3.  Below: The wrong way round, Dev Preview 2. So there you have it. A tiny change, but one that will likely please a good number of Android fans. Cheers, Google.

Midnitte Rip best emoji ever. Frisi :( Wes C Get that <8.0 blob out of here. (Not really, I wish they'd bring the blobs back) ninjustin Bye blobs :( Nick I'm actually kinda torn about the new emojis after using them for a bit. I actually really like Google's blob emojis, they had a distinct style about them that was fun and playful. However, at the end of the day it is a way of communicating with others and it fails at that if they look too different. Although, I do remember that someone did versions without the borders and gradients and I did like that better. Ishimaru RIP blobbies :( :( :( Ryan Cavitt I am one with the blob, the blob is one with me. EH101 Dislike the blobs. Glad they're done. They always reminded me of Dots candy. Best solution would be to have Emojis be interchangeable like fonts are in some skins. someone755 But not all emojis mean the same for all groupsets. If my friend with a GS5 sends me an emoji it could have a totally different meaning for him and myself. (There have been a few awkward times because of it. Don't ask.) EH101 That's true, and the primary reason I prefer a single universal set of Emojis instead of everyone doing their own. For a long time I would switch my Emojis to iOS Emojis to be sure what was meant across device conversations. Probably similar reasoning was used when they designed the new Emojis to look more like Apple's. Scott Scrivens https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/70/43/7043683e2ef6acd3920958ad6509cd60.png Carsten Given that most design changes result in many angry comments, what will happen now?! I'm actually quite interested if now everyone will be like "aww yeah back again" or if the ever-complaining comments switch to "I just started to like the new style more" or something :D A Person You guys get paid per-article, don't you. Nick The order of icons in the status bar is very important, switch them up and people go insane! In all seriousness, it's okay that they go over every little detail in these new releases, it's very easy to scroll on by if I don't want to read them. All_I_do_is_post_gifs http://i.imgur.com/eA85ZxQ.gif Jay I see the battery percentage is still outside of the battery icon though. 😒 I don't understand why we can't have both as a choice. Damnit, Google. Frisi That bothers me so much. I turned it off. Zach Mauch I don't mind this change. I can never read the damn thing as it is. Even on my Pixel XL or 6P. There just is not enough contrast. However, considering it is already a hidden setting it should probably just be an option for either. freshprince_87 It would be even better if the font of the battery 🔋 percentage is the same as the clock 🕒 DragoCubed Choice desu Willie Chalmers III Don't fool me like that, AP. I thought the blob emoji were back. ☹️ create812 Same Lazyboy0172 Also the LTE icon is part of the signal bars again, not a separate icon on the bar. Frisi Holy sh-- you're right! I knew something else changed but it didn't caught my eye! aRvInD Any screenshot? Lazyboy0172 not very exciting because it looks identical to pre 8.0, but yeah I'll take a screenshot for you- http://i.imgur.com/mFDuUOy.png Ryan Cavitt Do you ever roam? I wonder where they decided to stick the roaming indicator. I really like OxygenOS' implementation of the roaming indicator. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/efb226690d019dcf77b60974e74631de485ccc0a127b3481923ca0b68fd1edc3.png Patrick Mustard A globe icon with a little "R" on its corner would do just fine. Willie Chalmers III This makes way more sense. Nick What I thought Google was trying to go for was to display what your data source was in one spot. I think they were aiming to do that since the persistent wifi icon was a bug. I think this was a solid logical choice, but the logical choices are not always the most pretty ones, especially with how hard it is to make a big "LTE" icon look good. Miku is Best Vocaloid In Moto devices the LTE indicator is still part of the mobile signal icon but the icon itself covers two spaces. It's kind of annoying but I already got used t https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/07453798a06ae19d208a210da2196e4026c737a8cd6ba83a2d45b402a9348b87.jpg o it. My1 lol does it have to be that large? I would expect a small "4G" or whatever on the cell but not this abomination Miku is Best Vocaloid I dunno why. It has been like that since at least Jelly Bean on the original Moto G. Ryan Cavitt Funnily enough when the OG Moto G got the Lollipop upgrade, they removed the Moto signal cluster and went with the bog standard AOSP cluster. I guess they really did not care at that point. Álvaro R. Only in some reguons, on most countries was still the big letter Vlad It made sense on the dual SIM Moto G. I thought that was the reason. I guess not. Winston Wasn't so on Lollipop on my 2014 Moto X, at least I don't remember so when I got it (when I bought it, it shipped with 5.0, and to the best of my memory the launch software didn't). But either the 5.1 or the 6.0 update screwed it over and replaced it with a super fat "4G" text. 2 Men-E I would like the indication to be similar to this. The "4G" not as large, but indicated surely...so when we finally get 5G in the states, we know. Bewear I personally hate OEMs that do this. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't really mind, it's only the only change Motorola made to the SystemUI. Patrick Mustard By the way, "LTE" is probably far less user-friendly than "4G". Curt Lavlee. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Can you put the battery percentage in the icon, or is it still separate? Илья There are some things they can't just put in Boomdizzle Still separate, unfortunately. Willie Chalmers III Now only if Google would get forced to change the emojis back because of WAY more annoyed users. Alex Let them stay. There are users (majority I'd think) who have no clue what those weird blobs meant. Frisi Sadly, that's correct. Dennis Ulijn Try using them a few weeks, go back to Android <8 and see if you still feel that way. I think most people that see the emoji in use will prefer the new ones (a game of emoji riddle with assistant is a good way to test). Asuka Tanaka I wish Google would add an option where we can change the Emojis Willie Chalmers III I'll try. I know I'll have to give in eventually, so I'm going to install the third developer preview. Goodbye to my blob brethren. 😞 Boomdizzle That was the thing that drove me nuts the most was that the angles were all off. Flows so much better the old/current way. Jared They also got rid of the grayed out wifi icon in the status bar when wifi is not connected (yay!). They have not allowed disabling notifications for Android System, which means I have a constant notification that SwipePad is displaying over apps (boo!). The Google Play Music widget seems to be working properly now. It was pretty broken in DP2 on my 6P. Sruly J According to Google, the greyed out WiFi icon when not connected was a bug. Zach Mauch Now if only the would make the lines of the two icons parallel. It is hard to see, by the angle of the line on the wifi icon is slightly more steep than the angle on the cell signal icon. It aggravates my OCD. Ian Santopietro I didn't mind the order change. I just didn't want the wifi icon there when I wasn't connected to or searching for a wifi connection Dennis Ulijn That's fixed too :) AND they threw in the small H (for 4G) again, too! Google listens. miscfiles Now they just need to make the angles consistent between the WiFi and cellular icons. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4850d98240afa410b5ca01e63ac91b7e8cd973724d50eb33e4c4559627956720.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c65ec559dd82129b60e8150ead4a70f7b6556ea45d10427018452947ae9e44e8.png Sorry. Once you see, you cannot unsee. Zach Mauch I just said this, but your post on it is SOOOO much better. Nice visual! miscfiles Great minds think alike! As a graphic designer this stuff matters (far too much) to me. Zach Mauch Well, I'm an engineer not a GD, but my wife is. LOL! With how quick you whipped up that example I figured you were. miscfiles The other thing that winds me up is the battery percentage in what looks like Roboto Condensed Light or Regular, while the time is in Roboto (not Condensed) Medium or Bold. So there's a difference both in character width and weight, which doesn't sit well. miscfiles Top is like the current. Middle is same widths, different weights. Bottom is same weights, different widths. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/682ce12d4a97875f5990bfb5b598e8b148eacb30d21f87e29dbd951e76414edb.png Daniel Do you guys remember the Google Pixel commercial, the part where they said the battery chargers really fast? They had a different battery indicator (than the usual one) and I thought for sure that's how 7.0's battery was gonna look Nathan Gin https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0bc6b74974180b009dc776faae5f64ddcdde0a96b5db3ab9078c47e158cf2d99.png This?

Bewear It looks like a seriously handicapped heart symbol. Lord Argyris Please, please, please don't give them any ideas! Gah! Seriously, though, I never considered the width as a constraint. You're right; they had to choose between different widths or different heights depending on what they prioritized. Boomdizzle Gee thanks for pointing that out! miscfiles I just want to share my pain... ;) Scott Scrivens Why would you do that, my eyes :( miscfiles I'm hoping to be headhunted by Google as Pedantic Design Critic... :P JD I wonder if it's on purpose to fit in LTE or 4G+ those labels on top of the cell reception bar during hand over. duke1 Report these issues to Google issue tracker. Hopefully they'll get this squared away Ed. Blake Google is almost an engineer-only company and was never good on designing UIs. They focus on hardware, binaries, scalability, new technical inovantion and etc... They're really need some designers. Now more than ever. Lord Argyris "Sorry. Once you see, you cannot unsee." I pretty much hate you right now. Philipp Gaßner You. You're a sick monster. Now, I have to switch to iOS! Dakoziol I knew I couldn't be the only one bugged by this. Tj Hariharan oh great, i hate you for making me see this btw...damn it! Borgman Is the battery % displayed like that only when charging, or it's now an option to have it outside the battery icon? Tr3ple Always like that Federico Rios hope they keep it Trooper311 Ahh so much better! Thank you Google! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wow! Scoop of the century. This is Pulitzer level stuff. Linkzy Sometimes I wonder if Google secretly read Android Police 😍 freshprince_87 I think they do Sruly J You mean aside from Liam? Sure. Denholm Willmer Of course they do JD It's not a secret Kristian Ivanov Nobody messes with the WaiFu icons! ...I mean WiFi icons >_> Margaritas Ante Porcos Bands switcher buried even deeper than before. In my apartment I can make and receive calls only in 2G. Every time I am forced to switch manually between 2G and LTE because my carrier won't switch to 2G automatically. Long story short, Android O makes my life even more difficult. P.S.: Since Android 7 I noticed like Google in favour of UI aesthetics hid many useful functions deeper. Things I could do with one-two click on Android 6, on Android 7 take at least one click more. With Android 0 things got even worse. JD That makes no sense Ten Bears this is the real news. mxwp But the cute blob emoji is still gone. Sad face. Hexlattice "order has been restored" = golden!

The phones will be available in Europe over the next few months. The J3 will also come to the USA, although its design will be slightly different from the European variant. The Samsung Galaxy J3 is the smallest of all three devices with its 5” AMOLED HD display. It’s powered by a hefty octa-core Exynos 7570 processor and each core has a clock speed of 1.4GHz. It ships with 2GB of RAM and 16GB internal storage which can be expanded with a microSD card (up to 256GB). The rear camera is 13MP, and the front facing camera is 5MP. The J3, which is powered by Google’s latest version of Android Nougat (7.0), features a 2600mAh battery. The Galaxy J5 is the mid-spec device of the line-up. It includes a 5.2” full HD AMOLED display and is powered by an octa-core Exynos 7870 processor. There’s 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage just like the J3. The storage is expandable with a microSD card (up to 256GB). The cameras on this device are the same as on the J3 as well as the operating system. The larger screen on this device has allowed Samsung to fit a bigger, 3000 mAh battery. Lastly, the Galaxy J7 features a 5.5” display, it retains the same CPU as the J5 but the RAM has been bumped to 3GB. It features an AMOLED display, but has a larger 1080p resolution. There’s a bigger 3600mAh battery in the J7, and a better front facing camera which is 13MP, the rear camera has stayed the same at 13MP. The J7 has also been issued with an IP54 splash resistance certification, which the other devices weren't given. The J5 is available from June, the J7 is due in July, and the J3 is due in August. The Galaxy J7 will cost 339 EUR ($380), with the Galaxy J5 coming in at 279 EUR ($245), and the Galaxy J3 costing 219 EUR ($245).

The rapid adoption of highly secure and compute-intensive standards, such as Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and App Transport Security (ATS), require organizations to meet this demand or risk losing increasingly security-conscious customers. The Internet has seen an explosion of SSL encryption with up to 70 percent of traffic now being encrypted. Cipher suite analysis also shows more than 85 percent of encrypted traffic is using ECC and PFS. There are many reasons why encryption adoption is climbing. For example, websites with encryption garner more favorable page rankings in Google searches. Another example could be a lack of ATS support potentially affecting app listing in the Apple App Store. Ignoring encrypting traffic can directly impact a business’s revenue. The third-generation SSL processors are available in select A10 Thunder® hardware appliances. Existing customers can upgrade select Thunder appliances. Unlike competitive solutions, A10’s “SSL modularity,” helps existing customers scale to accommodate future traffic without a forklift upgrade to replace their existing appliance, offering true investment protection and savings. A10’s new SSL solutions are available for Thunder ADC (Application Delivery Controller), Thunder SSLi (SSL Insight), and Thunder CFW (Convergent Firewall) product lines. A10 Thunder ADC’s application delivery and server load balancing functionality ensures application acceleration by offloading compute-intensive SSL/TLS processing from web servers. This ensures fast and secure responses to customer requests. A10 Thunder SSLi provides visibility into encrypted traffic for a wide range of security vendors by eliminating the SSL blind spot, protecting enterprise users from attacks. Solution highlights include: • High-performance encryption processing o Hardware-assisted processing of advanced ECC ciphers using third-generation of security processors. o Advanced cipher support processing in hardware, for example: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 and more. • Scalable performance and lowest TCO o Thunder ADC provides superior performance, with up to twice the connections per second (CPS) than competing vendors with ECC and PFS at a lower cost. o Thunder ADC, on a cost-per-SSL connection basis, can reduce the SSL offload cost by half compared to competing vendors. o Thunder SSLi can process more than 40 Gbps of traffic for SSL/TLS visibility with advanced ciphers. • Supported products o Thunder ADC, Thunder SSLi, and Thunder CFW product lines support the new third-generation security processors. • SSL Modularity o Select Thunder ADC, Thunder SSLi, and Thunder CFW hardware appliances can be upgraded as required, avoiding fork lift upgrades. Availability Third-generation SSL options are available now for the following Thunder ADC, Thunder SSLi, and Thunder CFW appliances: • Thunder 3040S, 3230S, 3430S, 4440S, 5330S, 5440S, and 5840S.

That was another tremendous shot. India need nine to win from 72 balls. Meanwhile, this is a good point from the Godfather of the OBO.

He hasn’t always looked at his best in this tournament - yet he’s still averaging 150. Yuvraj survives an LBW appeal - and then a review - because of a late inside edge.

JP Duminy comes on after the drinks break. He took a hat-trick against Sri Lanka in the World Cup quarter-final two years ago; even that wouldn’t be enough here.

That looked out, yet South Africa haven’t bothered to review. Maybe it pitched outside leg. I can’t see any other reason why it wasn’t out.

India 151-2 (Dhawan c du Plessis b Tahir 78) You know things are bad when Imran Tahir doesn’t celebrate a wicket.

Dhawan then belts Morris for two leg-side boundaries; he has the chance of yet another century in an ICC tournament. His record is remarkable, which is why I’ve just remarked upon it. “How many Yorkshire players do you think Root will select in his first Test team?” says Tom Van der Gucht. “Do you think Ballance, based on his county format, and Rashid may sneak in alongside YJB?” I don’t think Ballance will play, though I wouldn’t rule it out as I have a horrible feeling they might do something silly at the top of the order (see below). Rashid should be in ahead of Moeen Ali every day of the week but I doubt that will happen. And if they omit Haseeb Hameed because of his poor county form, I’ll do time. Kohli brings up his 50.

He doesn’t deserve this. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.06am EDT 09:06 Thanks Geoff. South Africa, so much to answer for. They spent the two years between the World Cup and the Champions Trophy ascending to No1 in the world, and the whole goddamn enterprise unravelled in just six deliveries. That’s how long it took for AB de Villiers and David Miller to be run out in a manner that brought all South Africa’s old demons rushing to the surface. They lost their last eight wickets for 51 – and, just for good measure, finished the innings with a third ridiculous run-out. It was pretty hard to watch, and it was no surprise that #chokers was doing plenty of business on Twitter. Not even Malcolm Tucker could put a positive spin on it, though he could probably come up with an alternative C-word for their performance. India have a straightforward target of 192. It would take a twist of Lord’s 1983 proportions for them to lose this game. They were brilliant, and the dream final against England looks likely, but this is primarily about South Africa. Nervous, needless run-outs in England; a horrible, shambolic performance at the most important time: South Africa are suffering death by déjà vu. Again! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.46am EDT 08:46 South Africa are bowled out for 191 I’ve said it 30 times before, and I’ll say it just once more: disaster. Holy hand grenades. South Africa have a great batting line-up on paper, but like most things on paper it appears relatively easy to put holes in it. Those batsmen have been dismissed in 44.3 overs, the exact same number of overs that Bangladesh were dismissed for on this ground by Australia earlier in the week. India, though, will not be thwarted in their chase by weather.The sky remains relatively clear, the clouds of the friendly persuasion. India will be chasing 192 to win, and considering they have in their ranks two batsmen who each average over 90 in winning run chases (MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli, if you’re really bad at guessing), you suspect they won’t find it too difficult. Nonetheless, if Kagiso Rabada and Morne Morkel can jag two or three wickets early, you never know what pressure can do. South Africa lost 8 for 51 in the back end of that innings, with very little coming after de Kock’s 53, Amla’s 35 and du Plessis’ 36. Three of India’s five bowlers went at less than 4 runs per over. The highest rate was Pandya’s 5.2, and he got the key wicket of du Plessis. Bumrah got 2-28 from eight overs, Bhuvneshwar 2-23 from 7.3, Ashwin 1-43 and Jadeja 1-39, with the balance of the wickets falling to South Africa’s run-outs, the footage of which will continue to circulate for years to come. That’s it for me - Geoff Lemon out, and I’ll leave you in the hands of our Dear Leader, Rob Smyth, who will certainly not be facing any challenges for his position before the end of the year.

Tahir turns back and tries to regain his crease. The dive again, not as grand as AB’s, but pretty good in the circumstances. Again Dhoni’s hands are too fast.

Julian Norton 09:00 Sunday 11 June 2017 0 Have your say Richard called at the practice on Wednesday morning. He was worried about one of his recently acquired bullocks. He had bought the batch of cattle a few days previously and, as they settled in to their new surroundings, he noticed that one had a very swollen eye. “I’ve looked it up on YouTube,” he told me, “And I wonder whether it might need to be removed?” Heading out into the hills was rather more appealing to Julian than paperwork back at the veterinary practice. Picture by James Hardisty. How times have changed! Farmers know their stock very well and it is not uncommon for them to have reached a diagnosis and come up with a plan for treatment some time before the veterinary surgeon arrives. Our small animal clients frequently turn to Dr Google for answers (sometimes rushing in with their pet, convinced it is suffering from a condition that has only been documented twice - in wild dogs in Peru) but this was the first time a farmer had presented me with a solution found on YouTube. “I”ll come up and have a look if you’d like?” I offered. It was a sunny day and a visit up to the Hambleton hills was a much better prospect than the large pile of mundane practice admin that really needed my attention. I thought it was unlikely that the eye would need to be removed. It is not a common procedure in cattle (unless you are a vet in New Zealand, apparently, where they have a special implement, a bit like a grapefruit spoon, which is designed especially for the job). I’d only done the operation once before, in an effort to remove a tumour that was invading around the eyelids of a Hereford cow. It was many years ago and, as I recall, it did not go particularly well. There was blood everywhere and the tumour was much deeper seated than I had expected. I wasn’t in a rush to repeat the experience. Farmers know their stock very well and it is not uncommon for them to have reached a diagnosis and come up with a plan for treatment some time before the veterinary surgeon arrives. When I arrived at the farm, the black and white Friesian was standing patiently in the cattle crush, quite unperturbed by the huge protrusion that was its right eye. I couldn’t quite believe what I was looking at. The eyeball was of joke-shop proportions and was bulging alarmingly. The technical term for an eyeball swollen beyond its normal size is “Buphthalmos”, derived from the Greek word “Ox eye” and could not have been more apposite. I prodded and probed the eye to work out the best course of action. There was clearly no vision at all and the edges of the cornea - the surface layer - were distended to the point where rupture was an imminent possibility. It was tempting to agree with Richard and his search engine that the eye needed to be removed. But the removal of any part of the body is not something to take lightly. It is always a last resort. I pulled various faces, just like the builder who is making an estimate for a complicated bit of work - not because I thought this would be an expensive procedure, but simply because I was trying to think through all the options. After lengthy deliberations, I suggested to Richard that we try a more conservative approach in the first instance. I would give two steroid injections into the eye with the hope and intention that the swelling would recede. For all its gruesome appearance, it was hard to say that the bullock was actually in a lot of pain or discomfort, and this way it might be possible to avoid some fairly major surgery. We both felt the simple approach was the correct one. I administered the medication and arranged to call back next week. Watch this space...

Android O feature spotlight: Gboard gets an incognito mode for Chrome 2017/06/11 6:23pm PDTJun 11, 2017 View All 65 Articles In This Series With each new version of Android, Google tends to make small tweaks to some of its default apps. Such changes are often nothing more than superficial, a way of giving the new OS release a fresh feel. We're now on the third Android O Developer Preview, and the official clock app has been treated to a visual refresh, its first meaningful update since February. The first noticeable change in version 5.1 is an update to the app's icon. The primary purple color has been replaced by a vibrant blue. The bottom right third is no longer shaded, and the shadows on the clock hands have been removed. The second hand now stands out in bright red. Not sweeping changes, by any means, but I think I prefer the flatter, more striking design.   Left: Out with the old (v5.0).  Right: And in with the new (v5.1). After clicking the icon you would expect to be greeted by bold purple with red accents, but not any longer. The main color has been changed to a blue-ish shade of very dark gray, almost black. And the accent is now blue (cornflower blue, apparently). Curiously, the blue used for the accent is not the same as the blue used in the icon, but it's very similar (#468af5 and #5c94f1, respectively). Granted, this is impossible to tell without close inspection and entirely inconsequential, but it's enough to bug me now I know. Serves me right for taking the time to compare them. Another incredibly minor tweak can be seen in the size of the secondary local clock; it's ever so slightly bigger. There's another tweak relating to the time for a secondary location, but this time as part of the digital clock widget. As you can see below, the font weight of the secondary 'Los Angeles' clock has been increased. Again, only a subtle change. But it does make the time slightly easier to read at a glance, which is no bad thing.   Left: Light.  Right: Heavy. Finally, as well as the new color scheme and flatter design, the app icon now implements the new adaptive icons feature, so it will change shape depending on which setting you choose in your launcher. Here you can see the squircle and cylinder varieties: So this isn't exactly groundbreaking stuff, but it's typical of the incremental changes Google makes to its apps all the time. In my opinion, the clock is a little bit more attractive with the new lick of paint. Even if you're not running DP3, you can still download this latest version from APKMirror and install it manually.

Patrick Kemp Probably. I'm on DP3 and I got the changes. Artem Russakovskii No, you don't need to be on O. Artem Russakovskii I'm on 7.1.2 Pixel, and I see it. Just make sure you install the right apk. caerestapermitido Got it! Thanks Lord Ravenor Holy Holo, Batman! (RIP Adam West). I prefer the older one since the background color changed shade depending on the time of the day. It's also similar to the default iOS clock app, which has deep gray background - though it isn't quite as dark. Garry Does yours still change shade? Mine hasn't been changing for the past few months. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Mine either but I really liked when it did. Lorenarperkins Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Lord Ravenor Oh. I probably should have been less ambiguous. When I wrote the ' older one,' I meant the one that changed color since the 'current one' that's a shade of blue and doesn't do that anymore is the current official release. The version 5.1 that we have on APKMirror is still only a preview extracted from the Android O beta -- i.e. it's the 'future one.' Alicecjones Google is paying 97$ per hour!

TedPhillips Yes. Came here to say this. Dynamic background color!!!! Though I admit I prefer the cm/aosp clock build, because I need me some 'shake to snooze'. (Edit, the cm build still changes color too) TANGA FROXA You're welcome, Scott ! -_-' Carson Saldanha Which one do we sideload? 5.1 (3926467) or 5.1 (4015683) Artem Russakovskii The newer one is from DP3. The other from DP2. Carson Saldanha Thanks. Maurício Ugly as hell. Where is that material thing? So, the regression of visual. Android design is completely a mess. James Betti It's a beta. Not the final version. This is likely the first of a few app icon updates. Daniel I don't think that a redesign of the icon and a color change exactly qualify it as hideous. ShadyBrady I also notice that when screen saver is on it rotates now. Not sure if it's the clock app, or just dp3. vmxr tiny makeover why every new update for android feels like a tiny improvement only Suicide_Note Because this is just the clock app. If you seriously think that the difference between Nougat and O is tiny, well, you're very mistaken. brownjames I prefer the old style personally. But the new is not terrible. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Uhh..these new icons, especially with that shade of blue looks like a high resolution render of a wall clock out of one of those old DOS games like Maniac Mansion. caerestapermitido I guess I was hoping the color would change across the day, I thought that black would be only in the evening-night, like it less now :/ Edit: also, I find the icon inconsistent with the app design. Should be black with the hands in that blue.... Stu I see the extra nav bar buttons are still available in the preview but have they added the ability to switch back and recents? YouNex Why is this an android o spotlight feature You receive me, android police The APK will rollout from play store and everybody can already install it manually on their non O devices Funny Funny Funny OMG such important changes, this will change our lives forever... It truly deserved this text! Jean-Mouloud I concur, this is a REVOLUUUUUUUTION ! DragoCubed Have they made the clock icon like the calendar icon and change as time goes by? I'd love to see that in stock Chandan Kumar That'd be stupid. Because the icon will have to change every second, even in background, otherwise it would take some time to update when you switch to app drawer/home screen. Marty Hmmm...iOS can do it but not Android. Interesting. 😋 DragoCubed I wasn't asking for it to update every second. Simply remove the second hand from the icon and it'd have to update every minute. If that's too hard, tell that to Samsung. They've already done it. Captain_Invisible Nobody said that it would be hard to do, just that it would take up unnecessary resources. Dakoziol Who said every second? I was thinking more along the lines of every fifteen minutes. Berkay They should make all the icons animated somehow! Well, all the ones that could serve as a second function maybe? calmdownbro Meanwhile Timely is still there, millions still use it, and there have been no updates to it for two years now. :( Pete And on the Dev Preview my Timely countdowns disappear somewhere along the way... Lord Argyris "Curiously, the blue used for the accent is not the same as the blue used in the icon, but it's very similar (#468af5 and #5c94f1, respectively). Granted, this is impossible to tell without close inspection and entirely inconsequential, but it's enough to bug me now I know." I imagine if they hadn't done this, the design wouldn't have been inconsistent enough. Seriously, though, colors look different when viewed next to other colors, so maybe there's a legitimate, designed-oriented reason for making them different. Scott Scrivens Yeah, I would like to think that's the case. Dmitry Stepanushkin Safari colors on icon 😀 Anuj Oberoi You call that an update!!!!. No additional functionality added. Just some UI change. Yuck... Suicide_Note Changing the UI *is* an update. Araib Shafiq Next up, the clock hand moves as the time changes? Would love to see that.. and it only makes sense after what they did with calendar DragoCubed I'd love to see it too but you can tell as I made a comment two hours before yours :P Araib Shafiq Oh sorry, didn't notice, then again its not like it's copyrighted xD but in all honesty I just read the article went to comment section and posted it without reading any other comment so... my bad..? DragoCubed Nah nah mate. I wasn't serious. I had a :P Araib Shafiq Oh, cool :D Anantha Chaitanya Why don't they make it show current time with seconds hand moving live? You know. Like in the iOS. I say, that'd be pretty cool. Same with the calendar. Make it show today's date. DragoCubed Or like Samsung. The calendar already shows today's date on stock Тарас Мукин I like new icon a bit more, but still — out of all standard or Google apps this icon is the most strange. I keep thinking about all icons now being "something on a white circle" — and what's more natural than black (or blue, whatever) clock hands on a white circle? Why playing with this strangely colored background? Jamal Mitchell I'm glad they clock icon changed. With the shadow behind the second hand, all I could see before was a 3D rounded cube. Jerry This is great news to me! I've installed the new clock apk and I love it! Shades of KitKat (my all time favorite android os) with the black and holo blue. Very nice indeed imo. Android Developer I've noticed the icons of Chrome, Phone, and Contacts apps changed to be rectangles . How come? Chris It's a clock.. hardly the kind to write about. I guess there will be articles on the fonts as well for the next OS beecause there simply is nothing interesting to write about. AbdulB1 Android is becoming more and more like an iOS...... Suicide_Note Actually, it's the other way around. Pratik Thakkar I expected Google to use lots of features and coolness from Timely that they purchased 2 years back. Disappointed :( Wesley Why did Google buy Timely and then ignore features like alarm sync? Also, I think it would be useful if the space under the clock had 3 or 4 cards that show the next calendar events, timers, alarms and reminders based on the nearest time of completion. Marty Google bought Timely?? Wow...didn't know. Timely has been my preferred clock for years. I didn't know it was on Google's radar. papernick A long time ago, actually. That's why Timely hasn't changed in years. Marty It's always been a really nice app. Maybe change would harm it. someone755 The thing is nobody can figure out why they bought the thing if they don't intend to implement Timely's features into Google's (and AOSP's) own Clock app. Nobody expected Timely to ever get updates again but I think it's safe to say everyone that knows about the acquisition has so far been baffled as to how it helped improve on the default Clock app. reggjoo Maybe they bought it because of some intellectual property the makers of the app had. In any case, the new clock seems to be a waste of "time". DragoCubed Timely was such a beautiful clock. I'm sad Google didn't do anything with it. An update here and there would've been okay but it's just dead. instinct Yeah, Timely was the better version of Google's clock. Google buys it, doesn't implement changes in their own clock and doesn't do anything with Timely. Sounds like a waste of money. Marty I just wish there was an Android clock with an active icon...like in iOS. DragoCubed Or like on Samsung phones Marty Only active in TouchWiz. And doesn't have a second hand. tim242 A second hand??? Marty Like in iOS. tim242 I just don't get the need for that. It just seems like something that you wouldn't long for. But whatever floats your boat : ) Marty It might help to know I don't use widgets on my Android devices. Strictly icons...like iOS. I like it that way. It's clean and orderly to my OCD...lol. Suicide_Note Why? Do you really think people should go into the app drawer to tell the time? You can just glance at the status bar. Or pull down the notification shade and the time is there. Or use a homescreen widget. Marty Because it's cool. Ads perceptual value to the system. And to head off any concerns, no, I don't hate Apple and because Apple is doing it is not a valid reason to not want it. Pcmanrules I still disable my clock app and use timely, despite the fact Google had owned it for years but done nothing. My name is…. Android Police with the real news, as always. A whole article for making a few fonts bold and an icon change. And 56 comments already!! smh Suicide_Note And here you are commenting on the article. AP wins! iKon AP wins what? Franco Rossel The ad money, of course. .w Especially with ad-blocker :P My name is…. this guy knows whats up vyktorjonas finally an android O redesign I can get behind I like it jcopernicus dark mode? really? Jason Farrell Still no multi-device cloud sync? Meh. I'll continue using Timely. Alessandro Johnny Why they still didn't put the seconds? :( Nicolás Bahamondes Abarca A good-bye to that wink from that OS... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0ae8d60bc25bb96f402c66ae5a746490bfa6f4286c61756f562c620f700fd74c.jpg Đức Thành Cylinder is probably the worst shape ever since squircle. Adrianus AJ Nadeak And I'm still using Timely because it still syncs alarms. Papa Georgio looks like iOS safari tbh mauswe Nice. But the icon didn't change for me. Why?

(AP Photo/Steven Senne) - Bulletin false Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the commencement address at Harvard University commencement exercises in May. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) 6397331 A-A+ By Leonid BershidskyBloomberg View U.S.-based social media giants may soon face a new attack in Europe: There’s a perception among activists and officials that the basis of their business model — targeted advertising — can be a threat to democracy. In a speech on Wednesday, Commissioner Margrethe Vestager — who, as the top European Union antitrust official, has been the nemesis of American tech companies such as Google and Apple — laid out her problems with the way social networking changes people’s political behavior. One of her complaints is familiar: Facebook and its peers tend to sort people into political and ideological filter bubbles and silos, destroying, as Vestager sees it, the chances of meaningful debate. The other has received less media attention. It concerns political ads and, generally, campaigns’ social messaging. ­Vestager said: “If political ads only appear on the timelines of certain voters, then how can we all debate the issues that they raise? How can other parties and the media do their job of challenging those claims? How can we even know what mandate an election has given, if the promises that voters relied on were made in private?” There are reasonable arguments against Vestager’s complaints. Long before social networks, people have grouped together on the basis of compatible views; confirmation biases, too, are as old as human society. The social networks merely reflect reality and make it more palpable. As for targeted messages, old campaigning instruments such as direct mailings and phone calls also delivered private messages to potential voters, and the media usually parsed them — just as they parse modern campaign activities on social platforms. It’s become easier because everyone is on Facebook and Twitter. Vestager, however, is on to something. The old tools allowed for rather generic targeting — say, by voting or campaign donation history. Modern campaigns try to target messages using people’s private data or even psychological profiles created on the basis of social network and browsing activity. That’s not necessarily effective, but it means certain voters get ads and messages that they wouldn’t have chosen to receive. Imagine I’m a social media junkie for whom Facebook is the primary news source, as for about two-thirds of Americans and a fifth of Europeans. I see a political ad because someone — or, most likely, an artificially intelligent entity — has profiled me in a certain way, not because I made a donation to a certain party or voted for a specific candidate in the last election. Unless another algorithm profiles me differently, I don’t see the other parties’ responses to the content with which I’ve been plied. I have no idea what the party that advertises to me has promised people in different target groups. I have less of an idea of the campaigns parties are running than if I watched TV like a 20th-century voter. At the same time, Facebook releases no data about what campaigns do on its platform. In a country that hasn’t removed campaign spending limits as the United States effectively did with Citizens United, that makes it hard to check what they spend on ads. Facebook’s position is that it’s the campaigns’ responsibility to follow their countries’ laws, and that a user has full control over which ads are shown to him or her. The former is irrelevant to the task of checking campaigns’ self-reporting. The latter is true only to a degree: On Facebook, you can opt out of certain ads, but algorithms will still decide how they will be replaced. In the run-up to Thursday’s British election, a group called Who Targets Me recruited 10,000 volunteers to install a browser extension that registers targeted messages, ranging from Facebook videos to Google search ads. The group calls them “dark ads” because they are so hard to monitor. Last year’s U.S. election led to pressure on the social networks to crack down on fake news stories and the bot networks that spread them. Facebook responded by introducing well-publicized mechanisms for reporting likely fake stories and having them fact-checked. During the recent French presidential election, it said, it suspended 30,000 fake accounts to stop them from spreading false stories. None of that really fixes the filter bubble problem — people will still believe what they want to believe, and if they mistrust mainstream media, they are likely to discount fact-checkers’ efforts, too. In a manifesto earlier this year, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote about moving relationships and social structures formed on the networks into the offline world. “These changes have been so fast that I’m not sure our democracy has caught up,” Vestager said in her speech. One can be sure European regulators will choose to slow down the development of Zuckerberg’s vision rather than rewrite campaigning rules to catch up with it. — Leonid Bershidsky is a Bloomberg View columnist. 17443831 Share this story By Leonid BershidskyBloomberg View More from Opinion Commentary: Denouncing the peaceful group will set back the war on terror Commentary: Brotherhood provides spiritual grounding for jihadist terror Column: Jerry Brown a good buddy of CO2 Column: I have tweet fatigue Editorial: A tax plan to make an onion grower cry Comment on this story Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Get top headlines daily Submit Local & State Sports Business Lifestyle Opinion Entertainment Outdoors Health Science/Tech Events Classifieds Subscribe Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin.

Android O feature spotlight: Gboard gets an incognito mode for Chrome 2017/06/11 6:23pm PDTJun 11, 2017 View All 65 Articles In This Series With each new version of Android, Google tends to make small tweaks to some of its default apps. Such changes are often nothing more than superficial, a way of giving the new OS release a fresh feel. We're now on the third Android O Developer Preview, and the official clock app has been treated to a visual refresh, its first meaningful update since February. The first noticeable change in version 5.1 is an update to the app's icon. The primary purple color has been replaced by a vibrant blue. The bottom right third is no longer shaded, and the shadows on the clock hands have been removed. The second hand now stands out in bright red. Not sweeping changes, by any means, but I think I prefer the flatter, more striking design.   Left: Out with the old (v5.0).  Right: And in with the new (v5.1). After clicking the icon you would expect to be greeted by bold purple with red accents, but not any longer. The main color has been changed to a blue-ish shade of very dark gray, almost black. And the accent is now blue (cornflower blue, apparently). Curiously, the blue used for the accent is not the same as the blue used in the icon, but it's very similar (#468af5 and #5c94f1, respectively). Granted, this is impossible to tell without close inspection and entirely inconsequential, but it's enough to bug me now I know. Serves me right for taking the time to compare them. Another incredibly minor tweak can be seen in the size of the secondary local clock; it's ever so slightly bigger. There's another tweak relating to the time for a secondary location, but this time as part of the digital clock widget. As you can see below, the font weight of the secondary 'Los Angeles' clock has been increased. Again, only a subtle change. But it does make the time slightly easier to read at a glance, which is no bad thing.   Left: Light.  Right: Heavy. Finally, as well as the new color scheme and flatter design, the app icon now implements the new adaptive icons feature, so it will change shape depending on which setting you choose in your launcher. Here you can see the squircle and cylinder varieties: So this isn't exactly groundbreaking stuff, but it's typical of the incremental changes Google makes to its apps all the time. In my opinion, the clock is a little bit more attractive with the new lick of paint. Even if you're not running DP3, you can still download this latest version from APKMirror and install it manually.

Patrick Kemp Probably. I'm on DP3 and I got the changes. Artem Russakovskii No, you don't need to be on O. Artem Russakovskii I'm on 7.1.2 Pixel, and I see it. Just make sure you install the right apk. caerestapermitido Got it! Thanks Lord Ravenor Holy Holo, Batman! (RIP Adam West). I prefer the older one since the background color changed shade depending on the time of the day. It's also similar to the default iOS clock app, which has deep gray background - though it isn't quite as dark. Garry Does yours still change shade? Mine hasn't been changing for the past few months. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Mine either but I really liked when it did. Lorenarperkins Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Lord Ravenor Oh. I probably should have been less ambiguous. When I wrote the ' older one,' I meant the one that changed color since the 'current one' that's a shade of blue and doesn't do that anymore is the current official release. The version 5.1 that we have on APKMirror is still only a preview extracted from the Android O beta -- i.e. it's the 'future one.' Alicecjones Google is paying 97$ per hour!

TedPhillips Yes. Came here to say this. Dynamic background color!!!! Though I admit I prefer the cm/aosp clock build, because I need me some 'shake to snooze'. (Edit, the cm build still changes color too) TANGA FROXA You're welcome, Scott ! -_-' Carson Saldanha Which one do we sideload? 5.1 (3926467) or 5.1 (4015683) Artem Russakovskii The newer one is from DP3. The other from DP2. Carson Saldanha Thanks. Maurício Ugly as hell. Where is that material thing? So, the regression of visual. Android design is completely a mess. James Betti It's a beta. Not the final version. This is likely the first of a few app icon updates. Daniel I don't think that a redesign of the icon and a color change exactly qualify it as hideous. ShadyBrady I also notice that when screen saver is on it rotates now. Not sure if it's the clock app, or just dp3. vmxr tiny makeover why every new update for android feels like a tiny improvement only Suicide_Note Because this is just the clock app. If you seriously think that the difference between Nougat and O is tiny, well, you're very mistaken. brownjames I prefer the old style personally. But the new is not terrible. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Uhh..these new icons, especially with that shade of blue looks like a high resolution render of a wall clock out of one of those old DOS games like Maniac Mansion. caerestapermitido I guess I was hoping the color would change across the day, I thought that black would be only in the evening-night, like it less now :/ Edit: also, I find the icon inconsistent with the app design. Should be black with the hands in that blue.... Stu I see the extra nav bar buttons are still available in the preview but have they added the ability to switch back and recents? YouNex Why is this an android o spotlight feature You receive me, android police The APK will rollout from play store and everybody can already install it manually on their non O devices Funny Funny Funny OMG such important changes, this will change our lives forever... It truly deserved this text! Jean-Mouloud I concur, this is a REVOLUUUUUUUTION ! DragoCubed Have they made the clock icon like the calendar icon and change as time goes by? I'd love to see that in stock Chandan Kumar That'd be stupid. Because the icon will have to change every second, even in background, otherwise it would take some time to update when you switch to app drawer/home screen. Marty Hmmm...iOS can do it but not Android. Interesting. 😋 DragoCubed I wasn't asking for it to update every second. Simply remove the second hand from the icon and it'd have to update every minute. If that's too hard, tell that to Samsung. They've already done it. Captain_Invisible Nobody said that it would be hard to do, just that it would take up unnecessary resources. Dakoziol Who said every second? I was thinking more along the lines of every fifteen minutes. Berkay They should make all the icons animated somehow! Well, all the ones that could serve as a second function maybe? calmdownbro Meanwhile Timely is still there, millions still use it, and there have been no updates to it for two years now. :( Pete And on the Dev Preview my Timely countdowns disappear somewhere along the way... Lord Argyris "Curiously, the blue used for the accent is not the same as the blue used in the icon, but it's very similar (#468af5 and #5c94f1, respectively). Granted, this is impossible to tell without close inspection and entirely inconsequential, but it's enough to bug me now I know." I imagine if they hadn't done this, the design wouldn't have been inconsistent enough. Seriously, though, colors look different when viewed next to other colors, so maybe there's a legitimate, designed-oriented reason for making them different. Scott Scrivens Yeah, I would like to think that's the case. Dmitry Stepanushkin Safari colors on icon 😀 Anuj Oberoi You call that an update!!!!. No additional functionality added. Just some UI change. Yuck... Suicide_Note Changing the UI *is* an update. Araib Shafiq Next up, the clock hand moves as the time changes? Would love to see that.. and it only makes sense after what they did with calendar DragoCubed I'd love to see it too but you can tell as I made a comment two hours before yours :P Araib Shafiq Oh sorry, didn't notice, then again its not like it's copyrighted xD but in all honesty I just read the article went to comment section and posted it without reading any other comment so... my bad..? DragoCubed Nah nah mate. I wasn't serious. I had a :P Araib Shafiq Oh, cool :D Anantha Chaitanya Why don't they make it show current time with seconds hand moving live? You know. Like in the iOS. I say, that'd be pretty cool. Same with the calendar. Make it show today's date. DragoCubed Or like Samsung. The calendar already shows today's date on stock Тарас Мукин I like new icon a bit more, but still — out of all standard or Google apps this icon is the most strange. I keep thinking about all icons now being "something on a white circle" — and what's more natural than black (or blue, whatever) clock hands on a white circle? Why playing with this strangely colored background? Jamal Mitchell I'm glad they clock icon changed. With the shadow behind the second hand, all I could see before was a 3D rounded cube. Jerry This is great news to me! I've installed the new clock apk and I love it! Shades of KitKat (my all time favorite android os) with the black and holo blue. Very nice indeed imo. Android Developer I've noticed the icons of Chrome, Phone, and Contacts apps changed to be rectangles . How come? Chris It's a clock.. hardly the kind to write about. I guess there will be articles on the fonts as well for the next OS beecause there simply is nothing interesting to write about. AbdulB1 Android is becoming more and more like an iOS...... Suicide_Note Actually, it's the other way around. Pratik Thakkar I expected Google to use lots of features and coolness from Timely that they purchased 2 years back. Disappointed :( Wesley Why did Google buy Timely and then ignore features like alarm sync? Also, I think it would be useful if the space under the clock had 3 or 4 cards that show the next calendar events, timers, alarms and reminders based on the nearest time of completion. Marty Google bought Timely?? Wow...didn't know. Timely has been my preferred clock for years. I didn't know it was on Google's radar. papernick A long time ago, actually. That's why Timely hasn't changed in years. Marty It's always been a really nice app. Maybe change would harm it. someone755 The thing is nobody can figure out why they bought the thing if they don't intend to implement Timely's features into Google's (and AOSP's) own Clock app. Nobody expected Timely to ever get updates again but I think it's safe to say everyone that knows about the acquisition has so far been baffled as to how it helped improve on the default Clock app. reggjoo Maybe they bought it because of some intellectual property the makers of the app had. In any case, the new clock seems to be a waste of "time". DragoCubed Timely was such a beautiful clock. I'm sad Google didn't do anything with it. An update here and there would've been okay but it's just dead. instinct Yeah, Timely was the better version of Google's clock. Google buys it, doesn't implement changes in their own clock and doesn't do anything with Timely. Sounds like a waste of money. Marty I just wish there was an Android clock with an active icon...like in iOS. DragoCubed Or like on Samsung phones Marty Only active in TouchWiz. And doesn't have a second hand. tim242 A second hand??? Marty Like in iOS. tim242 I just don't get the need for that. It just seems like something that you wouldn't long for. But whatever floats your boat : ) Marty It might help to know I don't use widgets on my Android devices. Strictly icons...like iOS. I like it that way. It's clean and orderly to my OCD...lol. Suicide_Note Why? Do you really think people should go into the app drawer to tell the time? You can just glance at the status bar. Or pull down the notification shade and the time is there. Or use a homescreen widget. Marty Because it's cool. Ads perceptual value to the system. And to head off any concerns, no, I don't hate Apple and because Apple is doing it is not a valid reason to not want it. Pcmanrules I still disable my clock app and use timely, despite the fact Google had owned it for years but done nothing. My name is…. Android Police with the real news, as always. A whole article for making a few fonts bold and an icon change. And 56 comments already!! smh Suicide_Note And here you are commenting on the article. AP wins! iKon AP wins what? Franco Rossel The ad money, of course. .w Especially with ad-blocker :P My name is…. this guy knows whats up vyktorjonas finally an android O redesign I can get behind I like it jcopernicus dark mode? really? Jason Farrell Still no multi-device cloud sync? Meh. I'll continue using Timely. Alessandro Johnny Why they still didn't put the seconds? :( Nicolás Bahamondes Abarca A good-bye to that wink from that OS... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0ae8d60bc25bb96f402c66ae5a746490bfa6f4286c61756f562c620f700fd74c.jpg Đức Thành Cylinder is probably the worst shape ever since squircle. Adrianus AJ Nadeak And I'm still using Timely because it still syncs alarms. Papa Georgio looks like iOS safari tbh mauswe Nice. But the icon didn't change for me. Why?

x Search for: June 12, 2017 |   NEWS ARTS LIFE & STYLE OPINIONS SPORTS HUMOUR FEATURE LETTITOR Facebook Twitter Instagram Main menu Skip to content HOME STAFF ABOUT SUBMISSIONS CONTACT Posted on September 8, 2014 by The Other Press Celebrities’ nude photo leak arouses many questions Why I still lack sympathy for leaked nude photos By Elliot Chan, Opinions Editor There was a time when sharing intimate images through digital devices was a big no-no. Sure, it might have been a passionate gesture, but such exchanges have always opened the door for betrayal, whether the subject of the picture wanted to be a pornographic exhibit or not. The scandal earlier this month surrounding Jennifer Lawrence, Scarlett Johansson, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and other female celebrities was a clear example that the cultural paradigm has changed. The onus is no longer placed on those taking the pictures, rather on those eager to hack networks and go through extreme measures to uncover them—and those who view the pictures afterward. The plea now is for the whole Internet community to restrain from clicking on any link that showcases pornographic images that were posted without consent. While some might choose to boycott those click-baits and smutty online channels, most have already entered keywords into the search engine in hopes of discovering those leaked images. The same way society has deemed it okay to take exposed pictures of oneself or another with little to no consequence, people are also allowed to Google something with little to no consequence. The line—although drawn—is still faint and often-ignored. Having nude pictures of yourself floating around on the Internet is humiliating, no doubt. And hacking into personal accounts is a breach of privacy, which is a crime. Not wanting to victim-blame or anything like that, but if you don’t want naked pictures of yourself on the Internet, perhaps it’s best to just refrain from sending those images initially. Don’t post naked pictures of yourself; that was what I was taught at the dawn of the computer age. What has changed? Why are we lowering the bar for ourselves? Why are we placing the blame on technology such as iCloud and people such as hackers? After all, hackers have always been around, just like muggers, thieves, and other criminals. The Internet is more than a public place to visit now. The Internet is our photo albums, our personal documents, and even our safety deposit boxes. The Internet is how we communicate to our employers, our families, and our loved ones. But we must remember, no matter how zealous we become and how tender the moment is, the Internet is still a public place. Telling hackers to stay out of our personal account is like telling the mugger with a knife aimed at my gut to not rob me. We cannot convince those people. The fact that they have gone to such extreme lengths to uncover private, and sometimes deleted, pictures of celebrities is proof that they are out for more than a casual tug. No angry tweet or Facebook post will convince them that what they are doing is wrong. So what are we share-happy people going to do? Live in constant fear that our private images will end up on a Tumblr feed? Well, at the moment is sure seems like it. All it takes is one share, one drag and drop, or one forwarded message and your intimate image is some stranger’s desktop wallpaper. We know the boundaries of the Internet, yet we still dare to cross them. That is why I have no sympathy for those who take nude pictures of themselves. I also don’t have any sympathy for hackers either, because if you take risks, you’d better handle the consequences yourself.

Developers, take note: Alarm.com's latest update is the best example of app shortcut configuration we've ever seen Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/10 3:55pm PDTJun 10, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 94 Share on Facebook 28 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Applications News If you are into home security as well as technology, Alarm.com is a popular choice to fill that niche. It is a smart home solution that, as you would expect, allows you to control your security system as well as things like cameras, lights, doors, and thermostats. It even supports Google Home and Amazon Alexa. Think home automation with a security slant, and you've basically got what Alarm.com is about. Initially, this post only set out to talk about the new features in the most recent update, but one of the changes was so incredibly well done that we couldn't help but diverge in our discussion of it. Alarm.com's method of configuring app shortcuts is fantastic. WHAT'S NEW • Pinch to digitally zoom in or out of a particular area of interest on video (feature screen only). • Download and share saved video clips and images directly from the app. • The push notification sent to the app when someone rings the doorbell is now accompanied by a doorbell sound, letting you know that someone is at the door. • Added support for Shortcuts (for devices with Android 7.1 and up). For supported devices, this feature can be configured by going to App Settings > Shortcuts. Don't get us wrong, the new features in the update are great. They've added a digital pinch to zoom for videos so you can take a look at what's going on back at home in even more detail — assuming the feed resolution is high enough. You can also download video clips and images and share them directly inside the app. It's even got a new literal doorbell sound for doorbell notifications.  But, the most interesting of these new features is the app shortcut configuration.   It's nothing flashy, but it does everything it needs to, and it does it well. Developers should take note, something like this is the right way to handle customizing app shortcuts on Android. It's quick and easy to add the items you want to your list, and reorganizing them is just as simple. You get what you want, in the order you want, with a minimum of fuss. No dragging items up or down long lists, no unintuitive swipes or long presses to add or remove them, just a straightforward and obvious set of icons for adding and removing items, and easy rearranging by grabbing items by the list indicator to the side and moving them up and down the list. This isn't game-changing stuff, it's just perfectly done. The method is simple, it looks good, and it's not hard to figure out or use. One of the reasons a lot of companies tend to exclude customization features is precisely because of how awkward and technical they can end up being. If you add a dozen ways of doing something, you can end up with a dozen steps to configure things. But this is customization done right, and even the least technically savvy could look at the screen above and deduce the correct steps to set things up. Alarm.com should be pleased by how easy they have made things, and we hope that other developers use this design as inspiration for their own. When I worked at a classic car garage in my youth, my boss used to have a saying, "Simple is elegant, and elegant is timeless." Well, this is a pretty simple way to handle app shortcuts. If your interest is piqued, check it out over on Google Play or APK Mirror. Unfortunately, you need an Alarm.com setup to use the app, but that's a small price to pay for something so well done.

I've long used their widget shortcuts, which are highly customizable. Bummer I'm unable to see the shortcuts on my 7.0 device...I'm using Nova and other apps show shortcuts, they must be doing some specific version checking. :( Kawshik Ahmed 3rd Party launcher can't show dynamic launcher short cuts in Android 7.1 below. Nova and other can only show predefined short cut which are written in the XML files on older Android. You will new Android 7.1+ to view this. Thomas Hunsaker Ahhh, that makes total sense. The Nest app added shortcuts a while back and I couldn't use those either. I'm holding on to my S6 until the Pixel 2 comes out.

Oliver Cervera ✔ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ #customromlife Kostas 💪🎩 An 1x1 widget with a popup of all the shortcuts would make more sense imho Lachlan Harris It could be very long, I guess the developers just think there would be 3 or actions that you'd be doing most frequently. Personally, I like app shortcuts as becoming a replacement for 1x1 widgets, Shortcuts can be dragged out into their own 1x1 widgets, in case you didn't know. For what you want, I'm sure you could temporarily make each item an app shortcut, then drag all the widget/shortcuts into their own folder. Then your "popup" would be the folder :) Jordan 1x1 widgets are one of the things app shortcuts are supposed to get rid of. It's completely redundant. WOLF LΔMBERT Exactly. WOLF LΔMBERT What year is it, 2012? Oft Hated Alarm.com actually already has this functionality. I like this version better because it means I can put it in the dock and only need one icon instead of three or four. Marcel Mayer bah the icon doenst looks good... Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ You hear 'em folks, icon doesn't look good so therefore the app is terrible.

The Indian IT industry generates $150 billion in revenue but is facing an existential crisis largely of its own making because it became complacent and overconfident even as technologies and markets changed. It can survive only if it exits the business that brought it success and reinvents itself. India's outsourcing boomed during the Y2K crisis of the late '90s because there was an urgency in repairing corporate IT systems. Once chief information officers (CIOs) became comfortable with having their systems maintained across the globe, they started outsourcing large-scale projects to Indian companies, and billion-dollar contracts were announced almost every week. But with the advent of tablets and smartphones and their applications in the 2010s, users gained access to better technology than the companies' IT departments could provide. They could download cheap, elegant and powerful apps on their tablets that made their corporate systems look primitive. Via cloud computing, companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google began to take over the functions of data centres. So CIOs lost power, and the importance of outsourcers declined. The billion-dollar outsourcing contracts evaporated. Modern-day applications also don't require large teams of software engineers. They are user-customisable and can be built by anyone with basic programming skills. To offer more value, outsourcers worked to reduce costs by improving backend processes. They offered low-cost offshore development and cheap labour in the US, and this fomented a backlash by displaced workers. The same tech advances that decimated the Indian advantage offer a new opportunity that could allow Indian IT to reinvent itself and even gain the support of Americans who have been rallying against it: to help the US modernise its aging infrastructure and bring manufacturing back from China. Technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence and sensors enable development of smart cities and automated factories and a wholesale upgrading of national infrastructure. Robots, for example, have advanced so far that they can now do the work of humans in manufacturing. With computing advances and dramatic price drops of hardware components, robots have acquired the dexterity to assemble circuit boards and build cars. They now cost less to operate than the wages of workers in China. And connected devices and sensors in the Industrial Internet of Things enable monitoring of every aspect of a manufacturing plant's operations. China is well aware of the threat and is taking the lead in building zero-labour manufacturing plants, with robots doing practically all the work. But its robots have no advantage over American robots; all work equally hard and consume nothing more than energy. Manufacturing can now return to US shores without raising costs. However, American businesses aren't geared to take advantage of manufacturing robots because they simply don't have the know-how. This is where India's outsourcers could help. They could master the new technologies and help American firms design new factory floors and program and install robots. They could provide management consulting in optimising supply chains and inventory management. And they could manage manufacturing plant operations remotely. This is a higher-margin business than the old IT services. And Americans would cheer India for bringing manufacturing back to their shores rather than protest its taking their jobs away. No, there won't be as many jobs in each manufacturing plant as there were before. But many new high-paying jobs would be created to build and manage factories. It is also possible to build smart cities, where sensors monitor every aspect of a city's functioning. Their design and installation require managerial and analytical skills; their monitoring functions are no different from those of managing data centres. And then there are opportunities to create applications that can revolutionise fields such as healthcare and education and to build technologies for the underprivileged — something that Silicon Valley's entrepreneurs don't focus on because they don't understand the dire needs. These are all things that Indian IT firms can do. It is not that Indian companies don't realise the threat. Tech Mahindra's chief executive C P Gurnani told my class at Carnegie Mellon's College of Engineering on May 1 that he was working hard to change the focus of his company from services to technology products and to solve problems outside IT. He talked about rapidly changing markets and the urgent need for his company to build offerings in areas such as healthcare, manufacturing, retail and managed services. Will India's IT sector finally wake up and smell the opportunity? It remains to be seen. One thing is for sure: the backlash will build if it doesn't — and Indian IT will accelerate its decline into oblivion.

Android O feature spotlight: Gboard gets an incognito mode for Chrome 2017/06/11 6:23pm PDTJun 11, 2017 View All 65 Articles In This Series With each new version of Android, Google tends to make small tweaks to some of its default apps. Such changes are often nothing more than superficial, a way of giving the new OS release a fresh feel. We're now on the third Android O Developer Preview, and the official clock app has been treated to a visual refresh, its first meaningful update since February. The first noticeable change in version 5.1 is an update to the app's icon. The primary purple color has been replaced by a vibrant blue. The bottom right third is no longer shaded, and the shadows on the clock hands have been removed. The second hand now stands out in bright red. Not sweeping changes, by any means, but I think I prefer the flatter, more striking design.   Left: Out with the old (v5.0).  Right: And in with the new (v5.1). After clicking the icon you would expect to be greeted by bold purple with red accents, but not any longer. The main color has been changed to a blue-ish shade of very dark gray, almost black. And the accent is now blue (cornflower blue, apparently). Curiously, the blue used for the accent is not the same as the blue used in the icon, but it's very similar (#468af5 and #5c94f1, respectively). Granted, this is impossible to tell without close inspection and entirely inconsequential, but it's enough to bug me now I know. Serves me right for taking the time to compare them. Another incredibly minor tweak can be seen in the size of the secondary local clock; it's ever so slightly bigger. There's another tweak relating to the time for a secondary location, but this time as part of the digital clock widget. As you can see below, the font weight of the secondary 'Los Angeles' clock has been increased. Again, only a subtle change. But it does make the time slightly easier to read at a glance, which is no bad thing.   Left: Light.  Right: Heavy. Finally, as well as the new color scheme and flatter design, the app icon now implements the new adaptive icons feature, so it will change shape depending on which setting you choose in your launcher. Here you can see the squircle and cylinder varieties: So this isn't exactly groundbreaking stuff, but it's typical of the incremental changes Google makes to its apps all the time. In my opinion, the clock is a little bit more attractive with the new lick of paint. Even if you're not running DP3, you can still download this latest version from APKMirror and install it manually.

Patrick Kemp Probably. I'm on DP3 and I got the changes. Artem Russakovskii No, you don't need to be on O. Artem Russakovskii I'm on 7.1.2 Pixel, and I see it. Just make sure you install the right apk. caerestapermitido Got it! Thanks Lord Ravenor Holy Holo, Batman! (RIP Adam West). I prefer the older one since the background color changed shade depending on the time of the day. It's also similar to the default iOS clock app, which has deep gray background - though it isn't quite as dark. Garry Does yours still change shade? Mine hasn't been changing for the past few months. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Mine either but I really liked when it did. Lorenarperkins Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Lord Ravenor Oh. I probably should have been less ambiguous. When I wrote the ' older one,' I meant the one that changed color since the 'current one' that's a shade of blue and doesn't do that anymore is the current official release. The version 5.1 that we have on APKMirror is still only a preview extracted from the Android O beta -- i.e. it's the 'future one.' Alicecjones Google is paying 97$ per hour!

TedPhillips Yes. Came here to say this. Dynamic background color!!!! Though I admit I prefer the cm/aosp clock build, because I need me some 'shake to snooze'. (Edit, the cm build still changes color too) TANGA FROXA You're welcome, Scott ! -_-' Carson Saldanha Which one do we sideload? 5.1 (3926467) or 5.1 (4015683) Artem Russakovskii The newer one is from DP3. The other from DP2. Carson Saldanha Thanks. Maurício Ugly as hell. Where is that material thing? So, the regression of visual. Android design is completely a mess. James Betti It's a beta. Not the final version. This is likely the first of a few app icon updates. Daniel I don't think that a redesign of the icon and a color change exactly qualify it as hideous. ShadyBrady I also notice that when screen saver is on it rotates now. Not sure if it's the clock app, or just dp3. vmxr tiny makeover why every new update for android feels like a tiny improvement only Suicide_Note Because this is just the clock app. If you seriously think that the difference between Nougat and O is tiny, well, you're very mistaken. brownjames I prefer the old style personally. But the new is not terrible. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Uhh..these new icons, especially with that shade of blue looks like a high resolution render of a wall clock out of one of those old DOS games like Maniac Mansion. caerestapermitido I guess I was hoping the color would change across the day, I thought that black would be only in the evening-night, like it less now :/ Edit: also, I find the icon inconsistent with the app design. Should be black with the hands in that blue.... Stu I see the extra nav bar buttons are still available in the preview but have they added the ability to switch back and recents? YouNex Why is this an android o spotlight feature You receive me, android police The APK will rollout from play store and everybody can already install it manually on their non O devices Funny Funny Funny OMG such important changes, this will change our lives forever... It truly deserved this text! Jean-Mouloud I concur, this is a REVOLUUUUUUUTION ! DragoCubed Have they made the clock icon like the calendar icon and change as time goes by? I'd love to see that in stock Chandan Kumar That'd be stupid. Because the icon will have to change every second, even in background, otherwise it would take some time to update when you switch to app drawer/home screen. Marty Hmmm...iOS can do it but not Android. Interesting. 😋 DragoCubed I wasn't asking for it to update every second. Simply remove the second hand from the icon and it'd have to update every minute. If that's too hard, tell that to Samsung. They've already done it. Captain_Invisible Nobody said that it would be hard to do, just that it would take up unnecessary resources. Dakoziol Who said every second? I was thinking more along the lines of every fifteen minutes. Berkay They should make all the icons animated somehow! Well, all the ones that could serve as a second function maybe? calmdownbro Meanwhile Timely is still there, millions still use it, and there have been no updates to it for two years now. :( Pete And on the Dev Preview my Timely countdowns disappear somewhere along the way... Lord Argyris "Curiously, the blue used for the accent is not the same as the blue used in the icon, but it's very similar (#468af5 and #5c94f1, respectively). Granted, this is impossible to tell without close inspection and entirely inconsequential, but it's enough to bug me now I know." I imagine if they hadn't done this, the design wouldn't have been inconsistent enough. Seriously, though, colors look different when viewed next to other colors, so maybe there's a legitimate, designed-oriented reason for making them different. Scott Scrivens Yeah, I would like to think that's the case. Dmitry Stepanushkin Safari colors on icon 😀 Anuj Oberoi You call that an update!!!!. No additional functionality added. Just some UI change. Yuck... Suicide_Note Changing the UI *is* an update. Araib Shafiq Next up, the clock hand moves as the time changes? Would love to see that.. and it only makes sense after what they did with calendar DragoCubed I'd love to see it too but you can tell as I made a comment two hours before yours :P Araib Shafiq Oh sorry, didn't notice, then again its not like it's copyrighted xD but in all honesty I just read the article went to comment section and posted it without reading any other comment so... my bad..? DragoCubed Nah nah mate. I wasn't serious. I had a :P Araib Shafiq Oh, cool :D Anantha Chaitanya Why don't they make it show current time with seconds hand moving live? You know. Like in the iOS. I say, that'd be pretty cool. Same with the calendar. Make it show today's date. DragoCubed Or like Samsung. The calendar already shows today's date on stock Тарас Мукин I like new icon a bit more, but still — out of all standard or Google apps this icon is the most strange. I keep thinking about all icons now being "something on a white circle" — and what's more natural than black (or blue, whatever) clock hands on a white circle? Why playing with this strangely colored background? Jamal Mitchell I'm glad they clock icon changed. With the shadow behind the second hand, all I could see before was a 3D rounded cube. Jerry This is great news to me! I've installed the new clock apk and I love it! Shades of KitKat (my all time favorite android os) with the black and holo blue. Very nice indeed imo. Android Developer I've noticed the icons of Chrome, Phone, and Contacts apps changed to be rectangles . How come? Chris It's a clock.. hardly the kind to write about. I guess there will be articles on the fonts as well for the next OS beecause there simply is nothing interesting to write about. AbdulB1 Android is becoming more and more like an iOS...... Suicide_Note Actually, it's the other way around. Pratik Thakkar I expected Google to use lots of features and coolness from Timely that they purchased 2 years back. Disappointed :( Wesley Why did Google buy Timely and then ignore features like alarm sync? Also, I think it would be useful if the space under the clock had 3 or 4 cards that show the next calendar events, timers, alarms and reminders based on the nearest time of completion. Marty Google bought Timely?? Wow...didn't know. Timely has been my preferred clock for years. I didn't know it was on Google's radar. papernick A long time ago, actually. That's why Timely hasn't changed in years. Marty It's always been a really nice app. Maybe change would harm it. someone755 The thing is nobody can figure out why they bought the thing if they don't intend to implement Timely's features into Google's (and AOSP's) own Clock app. Nobody expected Timely to ever get updates again but I think it's safe to say everyone that knows about the acquisition has so far been baffled as to how it helped improve on the default Clock app. reggjoo Maybe they bought it because of some intellectual property the makers of the app had. In any case, the new clock seems to be a waste of "time". DragoCubed Timely was such a beautiful clock. I'm sad Google didn't do anything with it. An update here and there would've been okay but it's just dead. instinct Yeah, Timely was the better version of Google's clock. Google buys it, doesn't implement changes in their own clock and doesn't do anything with Timely. Sounds like a waste of money. Marty I just wish there was an Android clock with an active icon...like in iOS. DragoCubed Or like on Samsung phones Marty Only active in TouchWiz. And doesn't have a second hand. tim242 A second hand??? Marty Like in iOS. tim242 I just don't get the need for that. It just seems like something that you wouldn't long for. But whatever floats your boat : ) Marty It might help to know I don't use widgets on my Android devices. Strictly icons...like iOS. I like it that way. It's clean and orderly to my OCD...lol. Suicide_Note Why? Do you really think people should go into the app drawer to tell the time? You can just glance at the status bar. Or pull down the notification shade and the time is there. Or use a homescreen widget. Marty Because it's cool. Ads perceptual value to the system. And to head off any concerns, no, I don't hate Apple and because Apple is doing it is not a valid reason to not want it. Pcmanrules I still disable my clock app and use timely, despite the fact Google had owned it for years but done nothing. My name is…. Android Police with the real news, as always. A whole article for making a few fonts bold and an icon change. And 56 comments already!! smh Suicide_Note And here you are commenting on the article. AP wins! iKon AP wins what? Franco Rossel The ad money, of course. .w Especially with ad-blocker :P My name is…. this guy knows whats up vyktorjonas finally an android O redesign I can get behind I like it jcopernicus dark mode? really? Jason Farrell Still no multi-device cloud sync? Meh. I'll continue using Timely. Alessandro Johnny Why they still didn't put the seconds? :( Nicolás Bahamondes Abarca A good-bye to that wink from that OS... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0ae8d60bc25bb96f402c66ae5a746490bfa6f4286c61756f562c620f700fd74c.jpg Đức Thành Cylinder is probably the worst shape ever since squircle. Adrianus AJ Nadeak And I'm still using Timely because it still syncs alarms. Papa Georgio looks like iOS safari tbh mauswe Nice. But the icon didn't change for me. Why?

President Trump's relationship with Silicon Valley may have reached a crossroads following his decision to leave the Paris Agreement, as giants of the technology industry prepare to gather at the White House while bucking the administration's position on the deal. Trump announced he will withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement in a speech in the Rose Garden in early June. In exiting the climate accord, the president followed through on a campaign promise and rallied his base. The decision was swiftly praised by Republican lawmakers and conservative groups. But Democrats and tech giants quickly admonished Trump's move, and some worried the administration's decision could sour the already fragile relationships the White House is attempting to forge with Silicon Valley. "It's become increasingly clear that this administration's continued retreat from the global community will hurt its relationship with the technology industry, which understood the tremendous opportunity the Paris climate agreement created for our economy," Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. "This was a chance for the U.S. to lead the clean energy revolution, and President Trump walked away." Connolly, co-chairman of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, backed the climate accord and is a key player on efforts to modernize the government's technology systems. Along with Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, Connolly co-authored a bill to improve the federal government's IT systems. The legislation passed the House last month and has earned the backing of the technology industry. Like Congress, the White House is looking to Silicon Valley to assist in its efforts to make government more effective. The technology industry is expected to play a major role in the Trump administration's efforts to modernize its technology systems, and the president will huddle with the heads of leading technology companies at the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council this month. The group, which is under the umbrella of Jared Kushner's Office of American Innovation, is expected to meet June 19 and will reportedly include executives from Apple, Facebook, IBM and Google, among others. According to a copy of the meeting agenda obtained by Recode, the White House believes the "American people should be able to interact with the government the way that they do with the best private sector companies — through intuitive digital experiences that effectively solve problems." But the president's decision regarding the nation's exit from the Paris Agreement has cast a shadow of uncertainty over the meeting. Already, Trump's Rose Garden announcement caused at least two CEOs to resign from the White House's various advisory boards. "Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said on his Twitter account. Disney CEO Bob Iger followed suit. Others expressed their discontent with Trump's decision, but have yet to announce any decisions about their future participation in White House gatherings. The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group based in Washington, called the exit from the climate agreement a "setback for America's leadership in the world." The trade group counts tech giants such as Amazon, Apple and Google among its members and reiterated its commitment to combating climate change in spite of Trump's move. "Despite this, the tech industry's determination to innovate and problem-solve for the threats posed by climate change and generate clean energy opportunities that create jobs and grow our economy remains unchanged," Dean Garfield, ITI's president, said in a statement. Many of ITI's members echoed that sentiment. Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Intel, among others, all pledged to meet the terms of the Paris Agreement despite Trump's exit. "In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities, businesses and investors, representing a sizeable percentage of the U.S. economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions," the tech companies, along with businesses, elected officials and higher-education institutions, said in an open letter. The White House has yet to announce details on the gathering, but a White House official said the meeting is moving forward. Still, despite opposition to the president's decision on the climate agreement, the technology industry stands to benefit from the Trump administration's commitment to modernizing the federal government. The White House is looking to improve how it buys products, including those related to the $80 billion spent on IT systems, and wants to use its private-sector relationships to improve government technology. So far, at least one industry leader is pledging to remain engaged. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration — as we do with governments around the world," an IBM spokesperson said.

Is being popular making us miserable? Yes, argues Polly Vernon – at least, when it comes to our social-media profiles Credit: David Yeo Polly Vernon 11 June 2017 • 6:00am Am I popular? It’s so hard to know! I mean, I’ve got 26,000 followers on Twitter, and 8,600 on Instagram, which is pretty good in the normal scale of things, but then again, absolute peanuts to a Kardashian. I average probably 20 retweets on a tweet and 150 likes on an Insta pic, but that last thing I put up on Instagram (the vaguely rude graffiti that I thought hilarious) only mustered 32 likes and three comments, so… am I losing it?  Does having a few people follow you on social media equate to popularity anyway? Isn’t popularity walking into a bar and having the bar staff and at least four of the regulars greet you by name, demand you join them? Is it swaggering up to the school gates knowing all the other mothers yearn for  your good opinion? Is it politicians scoring high approval ratings, or professional contrarians monetising Twitter storms? Popularity is certainly a bigger preoccupation than we adults like to acknowledge. It’s the kind of hang-up we associate with teenagers, with our trickier school days, the central dynamic of Mean Girls and Clueless and Netflix’s Riverdale; certainly the kind of thing we should grow out of. Yet do we, actually?  Are you obsessed with being liked? Take our quiz to find out A new book, Popular: Why Being Liked is the Secret to Greater Success and Happiness, claims otherwise. In it, psychologist Mitch Prinstein proposes we never get over the desire to be popular and that, furthermore, we have never been more fixated by popularity than we are right now, having collectively grabbed hold of the opportunities social media offers us.  Prinstein points to a study by Google, which showed that more than pay rises, promotions or perks, two things predicted happiness in the workplace. One had to do with frequency of constructive feedback from managers. The second was simply how much people felt they had someone – anyone – who liked them. Similarly, adults who were popular in childhood are the most likely to report that their marriages are happy, according to Prinstein. People who recall childhood experiences of unpopularity report the opposite, and those experiences can even alter our DNA: an experience of feeling popular over a period of a few months can trigger a ‘molecular remodelling’ of the body as the cells are gradually replaced by those containing DNA that’s hyper-sensitive to social rejection. Who’d be daft enough to be honest, when you can be popular? I have a chequered relationship with popularity. Oh, I wanted it as a child. Desperately! I didn’t like being a kid. I felt lonely. Other. I was mildly bullied, teased on account of – who knows what? Sticky-out teeth, awkward hair, too many opinions for someone who was also very shy, parents who carried with them the faint suspicion  of a boho, hippy past? Something like that.  While I didn’t languish rock bottom of  the social food chain in the Devonshire  town in which I grew up, I was pretty close. Although perhaps I just thought I was. Last year, when I returned to my childhood home for a funeral, I bumped into a man I recognised as having been in the same school year as me. We chatted, and  he referred to me and my two or three friends from that time as ‘the cool crowd’. I was gobsmacked. So, damn straight, I wanted  to be popular. Or rather, I wanted to be accepted, considered enough; considered adequately well-dressed by the right girls, fancied by the right boys, guaranteed invites to the right parties, to be better at sport than I was and to feel just a little less self-conscious all the freaking time.  A teenage Polly (front left) with schoolmates By my mid-teens, I’d learnt to fake it until I’d not ‘made it’ exactly, but could at least pass in impolite teenage society. I was the girl with a boyfriend, never loads of them; the girl who had someone to hang with in breaks from class, though I never marshalled a large court of devoted followers. At 16, in sixth-form college, I learnt all about the glory of being glamorously unpopular – the outsider dressed in grandad shirts and shapeless knitwear – courtesy of The Smiths. And then, at 18, I went to university, and found myself suddenly living the glorious, glittering, popular-girl fantasy – for real. I have no idea how it happened. I ditched my Devon accent, fell in with some good – fun, smart, silly – people, lost some baby fat and gained some new clothes, got a hot new boyfriend from the local art college (he was northern, wore vintage leather and listened to the Pixies) and somehow got mistaken for everything I’d always wanted to be.  I went out every night of the week. If I didn’t, mates – so many mates! – would swing by my halls and bang on my dorm-room door till I joined them. I could walk alone into lecture halls, common rooms, the library or student-union Prince nights and know I’d be swept up by groups of people who wanted nothing more than a few quality hours in my company, people who would make me laugh and who I could make laugh, until we could… not… breathe. Oh, it felt brilliant. It felt like being accepted.  A post shared by Polly Vernon (@pollyvernon) on Apr 12, 2017 at 12:14am PDT The only time I remember experiencing ‘it’ – this new confidence, this assuredness, this feeling I could now totally handle myself – as anything as dark and questionable as power, was when I returned to my home town for the summer break after my first year of university. I swaggered down old, familiar roads and passed a group of boys who’d once bullied me, and I felt them shrivel. They saw me and they knew, as I knew, that I was the bigger deal now. That status had irrevocably shifted. That I was to be feared, revered, maybe even fancied; but certainly not bullied. Never that, never again. That, I would say, is popularity at its sweetest. A validation, an acceptance, a reversal of some of the sadness and damage that being not-popular can bring. That  is popularity at its most legitimate. The popularity that comes, really, from finding your people (my friends from university  are my friends today), from being seen, understood and loved – and seeing, understanding and loving in return.  But popularity as Mitch Prinstein considers it? Popularity as a currency, a weapon, the ultimate measure of self-worth? Popularity calibrated in Twitter follows? In online pseudo-friends responding to your every last, nakedly compliment-fishing selfie with the fire emoji (because they know that’s what’s expected of them)? In broadcasting carefully curated, deeply flattering, utterly dishonest edited highlights of your life, all designed to make other people feel less good, relatively, about their own? That sort of popularity is a different kettle of fish. Twitter ripped me apart: it lampooned me, reduced me, renounced me Social media has made popularity tarts of us. We chase followers and likes as if they were oxygen, because this is how we’ve come to value ourselves, and others. We are cloyingly solicitous to tweeters with bigger followings, in the hope they’ll (oh, make it so!) retweet one of our comments, thereby drawing us to the attention of their myriad followers. ‘Show-ships’ I call them: online friendships pursued only to generate cyber payoff. We monitor our timelines for the official talking point of the moment and then dive in with our 140-characters’ worth, which, of course, we first ensure is in line with the world view of everyone else we follow. Because, step away from the social-media script of the hour, say something slightly different, question that one-note take on life, and you risk becoming a target for Twitter’s collective wrath. Who’d be daft enough to be honest, when they could be popular? I feel profoundly uncomfortable with this version of popularity. I think it’s restrictive, weirdly controlling, horribly cynical. I can’t do show-ships. Any time I’ve tried, I’ve immediately felt too compromised to persist. This is at least partly because I consider the idea of being ‘well-connected’ horrifically vulgar. The idea that people might solicit your company or attention, not because you’re kind, smart or funny, but because you just know some other people? That’s gross.  Hardly surprising, then, that I’ve endured as much online notoriety as I have popularity. Two years ago I published a book called Hot Feminist, which considered, among other things, social media’s adoption of, and treatment of, feminist politics. In the book I asked if perhaps it was making a schoolyard popularity contest of it, and criticised the way it creates un-nuanced,  and therefore easily retweeted, ideas around it, propagating simplistic notions of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ feminism and feminists. As a consequence of this, Twitter declared me very unpopular indeed. It turned against me for a week or three, ripped me apart in all the ways social media can: lampooned me, reduced me, renounced me. A post shared by Polly Vernon (@pollyvernon) on Mar 2, 2017 at 1:01am PST A different sort of tweeter might have enjoyed the furore. I watch others master social-media controversies, deliberately provoke them even, revel in them. Piers Morgan, for example, has found currency in being actively unpopular on Twitter. I know it’s a controversial (unpopular, even) thing to admit, but I admire him for it; for riding the waves so defiantly, for finding it all energising and thrilling. I couldn’t. It very nearly broke me. If the social-media version of popularity makes me feel uncomfortable, its version of notoriety made me feel awful: highly anxious, mildly depressed, twitchy, not great at leaving the house for a couple of months in 2015.  Where does this leave me, and my evolving relationship with popularity? Pretty cagey. Still a little traumatised from that Twitter roasting, I view any online popularity I now have with suspicion. Partly because it’s got a dark flipside: all those people who seem to like you today might well start screaming at you in unedited  caps tomorrow. But also because it seems  to me that this popularity is, at its core, exploitative. It’s about people wanting your time, energy, attention, because they think, ultimately, you can do something for  them. Having a lot of Twitter followers is like having a lot of money; you can never be entirely sure why people are talking to you. Save me from that sort of popularity, for heaven’s sake. And then save yourself.  Share this article Follow The Telegraph Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Editor's Choice 09 Jun 2017, 12:00pm 10 things you only know... if you're a single woman in midlife Gallery 06 Jun 2017, 9:53am Gallery: Sir David Attenborough's 10 best quotes about women  04 Jun 2017, 6:00am ‘My daughter gave birth to my baby’  29 May 2017, 7:52am Celebrity maternity nurse: Modern mothers have 'lost the plot'  Gallery 10 May 2017, 2:04pm Gallery: The 10 worst body-shaming and sexist adverts you're likely to see Follow The Telegraph Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest Related Topics Piers Morgan Students Social media Instagram Feminism Twitter Love & Friendship Happiness Anxiety Show more Galleries Gallery 07 Jun 2017, 1:54pm Gallery: When Harry met Daphne: The Prince's most heartwarming meetings with fans Gallery 06 Jun 2017, 9:53am Gallery: Sir David Attenborough's 10 best quotes about women  Gallery 01 Jun 2017, 1:25pm Gallery: 'Covfefe': Hillary Clinton's 7 best put downs Women latest 12 Jun 2017, 7:00am The new childbirth: one woman's experience of the 'natural caesarean'  11 Jun 2017, 12:00pm Like Charlie Gard's parents, I had to watch my son slip away 11 Jun 2017, 7:00am Downton's Siobhan Finneran on new show The Loch and why being middle-aged has worked for, not against her 11 Jun 2017, 7:00am The rise of pottery and why we all need some soulcraft in our lives - even Brad Pitt  11 Jun 2017, 6:00am Are you obsessed with being liked?

"It's become increasingly clear that this administration's continued retreat from the global community will hurt its relationship with the technology industry, which understood the tremendous opportunity the Paris climate agreement created for our economy," Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. "This was a chance for the U.S. to lead the clean energy revolution, and President Trump walked away." Connolly, co-chairman of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, backed the climate accord and is a key player on efforts to modernize the government's technology systems. Along with Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, Connolly co-authored a bill to improve the federal government's IT systems. The legislation passed the House last month and has earned the backing of the technology industry. Like Congress, the White House is looking to Silicon Valley to assist in its efforts to make government more effective. The technology industry is expected to play a major role in the Trump administration's efforts to modernize its technology systems, and the president will huddle with the heads of leading technology companies at the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council this month. The group, which is under the umbrella of Jared Kushner's Office of American Innovation, is expected to meet June 19 and will reportedly include executives from Apple, Facebook, IBM and Google, among others. According to a copy of the meeting agenda obtained by Recode, the White House believes the "American people should be able to interact with the government the way that they do with the best private sector companies — through intuitive digital experiences that effectively solve problems." But the president's decision regarding the nation's exit from the Paris Agreement has cast a shadow of uncertainty over the meeting. Already, Trump's Rose Garden announcement caused at least two CEOs to resign from the White House's various advisory boards. "Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said on his Twitter account. Disney CEO Bob Iger followed suit. Others expressed their discontent with Trump's decision, but have yet to announce any decisions about their future participation in White House gatherings. The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group based in Washington, called the exit from the climate agreement a "setback for America's leadership in the world." The trade group counts tech giants such as Amazon, Apple and Google among its members and reiterated its commitment to combating climate change in spite of Trump's move. "Despite this, the tech industry's determination to innovate and problem-solve for the threats posed by climate change and generate clean energy opportunities that create jobs and grow our economy remains unchanged," Dean Garfield, ITI's president, said in a statement. Many of ITI's members echoed that sentiment. Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Intel, among others, all pledged to meet the terms of the Paris Agreement despite Trump's exit. "In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities, businesses and investors, representing a sizeable percentage of the U.S. economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions," the tech companies, along with businesses, elected officials and higher-education institutions, said in an open letter. The White House has yet to announce details on the gathering, but a White House official said the meeting is moving forward. Still, despite opposition to the president's decision on the climate agreement, the technology industry stands to benefit from the Trump administration's commitment to modernizing the federal government. The White House is looking to improve how it buys products, including those related to the $80 billion spent on IT systems, and wants to use its private-sector relationships to improve government technology. So far, at least one industry leader is pledging to remain engaged. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration — as we do with governments around the world," an IBM spokesperson said.

It's incurable and it causes infertility," is not a statement you want to hear from your doctor. Like many teenagers, I have had problematic skin and have suffered acne since high school. I have also struggled with obesity, especially after high school, which was a shocker to me since all through high school, I was small-bodied and even acquired a nickname, 'Anne Small'. In 2009, I missed my menstrual period for three consecutive months. I however was not alarmed but knew I needed to go to the hospital and get checked. I did, and after listening keenly, the doctor sent me for an ultrasound scan. The doctor read through it and explained that I had many cysts in my ovaries. "You have so many cysts in your ovaries, do you have a child? If not, you need to try for a baby, but in the meantime, I will give you a pill to regulate your period." He wrote down some drug name and sent me to the pharmacy. That is how it all began. I had been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Symptoms include irregular periods, acne, facial hair, obesity and the big one - infertility. Here I was, diagnosed with this condition (I thought I was the only one in the world who had it), single and two years into dating my then boyfriend; Jackson Kamau, popularly known as DJ Soxxy. Despite all what was going on and the uncertainty that lay ahead, Soxxy asked for my hand in marriage in 2010. I know! I too thought he was crazy! I reminded him countless times that I have PCOS and I made him Google countless times about PCOS. I told him I might never give him children, according to the doctor's report and he always answered, "children come from God." After a year – well around 10 months in marriage – we started trying for a baby. Soxxy would have wanted us to take at least two years before having children but I had become that nagging woman, driven by both internal and external pressures. Luckily, I had a very good gynae and when we told him we were ready, he reminded me of my condition and timelines we had to try getting a baby on our own before he introduced any medical interventions. Five months later, there was no baby. I started panicking, but my doctor kept reassuring me that we had to keep trying for at least a year before he could intervene. When we clocked a year, I ran back. At this point, Soxxy would know that my periods had come when he came home to find me crying. My doctor got to work and he told me he would put me on fertility pills (and I thought this is what my body was waiting for) I went from the lowest dose of the fertility pills to the highest dose and even trying two different types at the same time. When I was not having a headache, I was nauseated most of the time. Standing at the altar, we often mumble these words "for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health". This was our worse, poorer and sickness all at the same time, our relationship became very strained. No one ever prepares you for 'not having children' and especially in our African culture. At times, I wished I got pregnant and then miscarried just for people to see I can actually get pregnant. I felt my husband wasn't "looking" for a baby as seriously as I was. He felt I was worrying for no reason. I felt I had disappointed many, since getting pregnant was such an easy thing, or so I thought. Soxxy on the other hand felt I was giving him unnecessary pressure when he wanted to just come home, put his legs up and watch TV. I was busy counting when my ovulation day was. He once told me he felt like a sperm donor rather than my lover and friend. Our home was cold because I was always crying. I remember one day my friend called and they were expecting an 'oops' baby number three and instead of being happy for them, I cried. I just couldn't understand this God, It's like he was out to show me He was blessing other people with kids other than myself. So I fell out with God. It got to a point I started telling my husband that the problem must be him because the doctor had done everything possible and I wasn't getting pregnant (all my trust was in the doctor). Things were so bad between Soxxy and I that it took the intervention of our best couple to keep us from falling apart. As if I was not going through enough, I also developed high blood pressure and this complicated the whole process as I couldn't take any fertility drugs anymore since it would put me at other health risks. Finally, my gynaecologist gave us two options – wait out the High blood pressure and try IVF or go for surgery 'Ovarian drilling' – even with all these options, there was just a 50 per cent chance of conceiving. In 2013, I remember my new year's post read 'This is my year'. I got a new job in July and I resolved to 'stop looking' for this baby who did not want to come. I called a meeting with my husband and told him we would not look for a baby anymore or buy any more pregnancy test kits (I would buy the expensive ones which claim to detect a pregnancy in its early stage). I also pointed out that we would wait for two years then adopt. I resolved to going back to my life as I felt I had 'left' myself somewhere when all this 'baby searching' began. Life went back to normal. We went back to us and started enjoying our Friday dates – we used to make nice dinner, watch a nice movie and just enjoy each other's company. I started trying to "befriend" God again; I would go to church and pray but never bring up children in my prayer, that's an area I had fully surrendered to Him. My focus was back to myself and my marriage. December 27, 2013 remains a very special day in my life. I had gone to the office, and left at 3pm feeling very hungry. Being a firm believer that eating is a social habit, it's hard to find me eating alone. So when I found myself driving into Galitos all by myself I knew something was wrong. As I ate that chicken like my life depended on it I started wondering when I last had my period. I had stopped being so keen. So I walked across the pharmacy and bought two of the cheapest pregnancy test kits. I got home, made dinner and thought to myself I couldn't wait till morning...the first test turned positive very fast that I doubted it myself so I took the second test, which also turned positive. I just thought this must be a bad joke... I took the test to Soxxy. At first he looked at me and I could tell he felt "not this tests again. We were doing just fine." Then he asked "Whose tests are these?" That's how our little Nimu sneaked into our lives, we named her Eliana – Hebrew for 'my God answered' because He sure answered us when we least expected It. feature Get the top stories delivered to your inbox every day Start your morning well-informed with the top stories of the day. subscribe ​ ​ ​ ADVERTISEMENT LATEST STORIES A veteran investor's guide on investing in the stock market Jacqueline MahuguMon 12 Jun 2017 A day out with the cop's wife Charles ChanchoriMon 12 Jun 2017 My daughter's battle with down syndrome Lavinia WanjauMon 12 Jun 2017 How you kill the nutrients in your greens Faith Kariuki BiongoMon 12 Jun 2017 How village girls get into clubs in gumboots, smelling of cow dung Wandia WadearMon 12 Jun 2017 How to avoid nagging sex pests on the prowl when online Anne MuiruriMon 12 Jun 2017 Preying on the guy your bestie has a major crush on: How easy?

Rohit KVN   June 11, 2017 09:33 IST Nokia 6, 5, 3 series tipped to hit stores on June 20 in India; price, pre-order details revealedIBTimes India/Sami Khan Nokia's official brand licensee, HMD Global Oy, earlier in the month, confirmed to launch the first-ever fully fledged Android-powered Nokia 6, 5, 3 series phones in India on June 13. Now, the price and pre-order details of the mobiles have surfaced online. Tech blog BSU has reportedly got hold of the company's document containing the cost structure and availability information of Nokia 6, 5, 3 series. As per the listing, all the three phones will be put up for pre-order on June 13 for Rs 15,990, Rs 12,990 and Rs 9,990, respectively. The shipment of the devices is slated to kick off a week later on June 20. Also read: Moto Z2 Play launched: India price, pre-order offers, availability details; here's everything you need to know The pricing of the Nokia mobiles are in line with the previous reports. Earlier in month, company insiders had confirmed to International Business Times India that Nokia 6 and 5 would be priced under Rs 17,000 and Rs 13,000, respectively. Whereas, the entry-level Nokia 3 would come with sub-Rs10,000 price-tag. It has to be noted that leaked (most likely to turn true) prices of Nokia phones are less compared to Chinese and global markets. The primary reason for the price gap is attributed to company's initiative of manufacturing them locally in India. It is said to have signed a contract with Foxconn to assemble the phones at its Chennai factory.
