Related 'Google Pixel XL' review: A fresh take on Android 'OnePlus 3' review: Value-for-price flagship device with a fingerprint scanner This year, we’ve seen camera phones improve a great deal, thanks to larger sensors with larger pixels, wider apertures, dual lens systems, hybrid autofocus and even detachable camera mods. Karan Bajaj & Hitesh Raj Bhagat rank the top camera phones to help you choose the best one: Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 Edge While it’s hard to pick an absolute winner when you’re comparing these flagships, the Galaxy S7 has a lot going for it because of the reduced prices. You can snag a new S7 for about `43,000 at the time of writing which is great value for the kind of performance it delivers. The S7 camera is so good that the company left it as is, even in the ill-fated Note 7, which was supposed to be this year’s flagship. The f1.7 aperture combined with Samsung’s dual pixel autofocus delivers fantastic results irrespective of the scenario and lighting conditions. Moreover, the camera UI is loaded with tweaks and shooting modes. The f1.7 aperture combined with Samsung’s dual pixel autofocus in the Galaxy S7 delivers fantastic results. (Image: AFP) Apple iPhone 7 Plus/Google Pixel/Pixel XL We could not decide on a winner between these two phones for the second position. The iPhone 7 Plus is certainly one of the best in every aspect and has the best implementation of a dual lens system we have seen so far (that Portrait mode with super-shallow depth of field will blow you away every time). The issue is Apple still does not offer as much control over the camera as compared to Android. Google’s Pixel delivers fantastic details, the fastest autofocus around (beating even the mighty iPhone 7 Plus), super-stable 4K video and amazing low light capability thanks to some software magic. However, the pixel loses a point because it skips OIS — this is a vital spec in flagships now. The super-stable 4K video and amazing low light capability of the Google Pixel are a dream come true for any photographer. (Image: Reuters) LG G5/HTC 10/ Apple iPhone 7 The LG and HTC cameras deliver great results on their own, but in comparison to the phones on the top, they lose out. Both LG and HTC suffer from more visible noise when compared to our first and second position winners. Moreover, the dynamic range, colours and details in low light images are the common areas where both these phones loose out in comparison. The iPhone 7 has OIS compared to its predecessor and works as a great all-rounder phone like the LG and HTC. However, in a head-to-head comparison the Samsung, iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel, these phones feel lacking in results. OnePlus 3/Moto Z Both these phones tied for the fourth position for all-round performance. Both deliver fantastic images in day light but lost the top three ranks due to performance in low light. OnePlus 3 proved it mettle with great results in auto HDR mode and fantastic image stabilization (optical + electronic). Moto Z delivered better results with its f1.8 lens in low light compared to OnePlus but still was not up to the mark in comparison to the winners. What sets it apart is the option of the Hasselblad MotoMod. Using this snap on Moto Mod tuned by Hasselblad (a `20k option), you get a 10x optical zoom, support for RAW image capture and a xenon flash. Moto Z delivers great results with its f1.8 lens in low light. (Image: ​ www.motorola.in) Sony Xperia XZ/ Honor 8 The XZ has a 5-axis stabilization system for video recording and the phone manages to deliver top-notch stabilized 4k video. Its focusing system is fantastic with the combination of phase detection, contrast detection and laser autofocus. However, still photos are where it skips a beat — the lack of OIS leads to poor performance in low light images. The Honor 8 stands neck and neck with the Xperia XZ with its dual lens camera. While the shallow depth of field is not as good as the iPhone 7 plus, the Honor 8 captures good details. Low light images are great when viewed on the phone – look closely and you can see a lot of noise in darker areas. One letdown on Honor 8 is the lack of 4k video recording. Special Mentions Asus Zenfone 3 — Asus has focused a lot on camera quality with the Zenfone 3 range. It takes sharp images with minimal noise and has a great OIS system. The only reason it did not make it to the top 5 was that its performance indoors and in low light is lacking in comparison. Xiaomi Mi5 — Mi5 was amongst the best camera phones when it launched earlier this year. The 16MP camera combined with 4-axis OIS delivers good results in daylight but it’s not an all-rounder. In direct comparison, it fails to match up to the image quality delivered by our top 5 ranked phones. Nubia Z11 Mini — Nubia is still a less known brand when it comes to India (especially after separation from ZTE). However, the recently launched Z11 Mini’s camera shocked us with excellent dynamic range, natural colours and fast performance. If it included OIS and 4k video recording capability, it could have been in the top 5. Want stories like this in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly ET Panache newsletter.

Simply get on the internet, go to Google, type in a question and thousands of answers will appear. Google has become so popular and trusted that the term “Google” is synonymous with any kind of online searching. The website is constantly changing and improving to become more useful for users, and it seems like there would be no reason to ever use any other search engine; however, other alternatives still exist, like Microsoft’s search engine called Bing. While Google may seem like the greatest technology to have ever existed, it is important that people still use Bing and other smaller search engines, both because some search engines are superior in certain areas, and also in order to keep the massive entity that is Google on its virtual toes. According to Net Market Share, 73 percent of all searches globally are done through Google, with Bing coming in second place at just over 9 percent. Nearly everybody in the world prefers Google, but there are still some who use Bing. While it may seem as though Google is the obvious choice when it comes to search engines, there are actually many reasons why a person might opt to use Bing over Google. One large reason is that anybody with a Windows computer begins with Microsoft Edge — which used to be called Internet Explorer — as the default web browser, and Microsoft Edge uses Bing by default. Therefore, unless a person with a Windows computer changes the computer’s default settings, he or she will likely use Bing instead of Google. Additionally, Bing does have many traits that differ from Google, some of which convince people to utilize it instead of Google. Microsoft claims the word Bing is an onomatopoeia meant to emulate the sound of an epiphany, but a running joke is that Bing stands for “Because it’s not Google.” Besides the few perks Bing has to offer over Google, perhaps the most important reason to use Bing is just that — because it’s not Google. Competition keeps Google constantly striving to improve its service, ensuring that it never ceases implementing next level innovations and impressive technologies. As Google loses users to smaller search engines like Bing, the company is encouraged to strive toward bigger and better things. Supporting smaller companies doesn’t just encourage Google to be better, it also helps the smaller companies make innovations that could change the way search engines operate forever. That being said, Microsoft is anything but a small company, which means Bing can be put in largely the same category as Google. Therefore, in order to truly encourage growth through competition, it is necessary that even smaller companies be utilized in place of both Google and Bing. Luckily, the internet is an immense place where anybody can make amazing websites, and the same holds true for search engines. For instance, the search engine Quora does more than simply provide links to websites that may contain the answers — it has an enormous community of people who each share their expertise with one another. With the personalized answers that can be provided within such a community, deep and abstract questions that would not produce results within Google can be answered. For instance, a question on Quora asks, “What is the most interesting fact that you know and I don’t, but I should?” to which have been made thousands of replies, each more interesting than the last. The greatest aspect of Quora is that it enables users to find answers to questions they didn’t even know they had. Wolfram Alpha is a different type of search engine that compiles computed facts and statistics to answer nearly any knowledge-based question. DuckDuckGo, a search engine that records no data about those who use it, is perfect for those who are made uncomfortable by how much information Google knows about its users. There are many alternatives to Google, each with its own advantages, and it is important to support these alternatives. While Google often seems like the perfect search engine, it is only that way due to the fact that it has always had competition from other search engines like Bing, forcing the company to continue releasing better and more accurate results in order to maintain its position on top. Google does not quite have a monopoly on online searches, but it is dangerously close. The only way to combat Google’s power is to seek, find and utilize other search engines that can both better serve certain functions, as well as provide useful competition for Google.

With a fast processor, great battery life, and an equally great camera, it's hard to argue with the sentiment that this phone is one of the best (if not the best) Android phones out there. I love it. But then I kind of hate it. It's complicated. I'm an old hand at Android, on board full time since the Nexus 5 in 2013. So when Google made a bold departure-it's first real, first-party "Google Phone" 11 years after Android's official release-I was excited to see what grand vision had finally made the search giant take the plunge into hardware. For nigh on a decade, Apple has been the uber-premium, super-simple smartphone for the masses. Apple is, by design, a high-caliber hardware company. Meanwhile Google and the Android partners that traditionally made the actual phones offered dozens and dozens of options. Even the phones that Google has previous tapped as its flagships-its Nexus line-were made by other companies. Surely the first Google phone would have a good reason to break from that tradition. It does, and this is where the love comes in. Swooning for software The Google Pixel has some of the best software out there, and I have used a lot of phones. A lot of this is thanks to the newest version of Android 7.1, which plenty of other phones will get (eventually, in theory) but the Pixel gets some handy, tweaked design elements and features that make it feel custom made. And at the center of the whole shebang is Google Assistant, the next step in Android's AI capabilities after Google Now. At times, the Pixel almost feels like an aluminum-and-glass vessel whose sole purpose is to get Google's AI into people's hands. One of Google's other new bits of hardware-Alexa-like Google Home-is literally, exactly that. In introducing and advertising the new Pixel, Google has focused extensively on Assistant, and in the process, maybe kind of oversold on the promise. Don't get me wrong. Google Assistant is much better than Siri. Google Assistant is much better than Siri. After just a few days of using the Pixel XL, I've found myself more confident in the inherently silly act of asking my phone stuff out loud. That's partly because the feature is so accessible-all you have to say is "Ok, Google"-and partly because I quickly gained confidence the voice inside the machine would give me a decent answer on the first try. Although it's not quite the digital miracle Google was making it out to be, I can see its potential, and it's exciting. Google also makes big gains in one other hugely important area-the camera. Simply put, it's incredible and easily rivals not just the iPhone but also Samsung's Galaxy S7 (and technically the Note 7 but those explode.) The camera is obviously an important part of any smartphone, so a good one is crucial, but this is an especially nice surprise because cameras have always been a weak point of Google's previous Nexus phones. Here are a few shots for reference: Read More And then, holding down the fort behind the scenes is the battery life. It's simply amazing on the bigger Pixel XL that I've been using. I'd even say it borders on two days of battery life and has a battery-saving feature if you need even more juice. Battery life degrades over time, sure, but this is a terrific place to start from. Half-measure hardware When it comes to smartphones, a great battery, camera, and software will satisfy most. But as great as the Pixel is, it is infected by one of the worst trends in Android design-trying to look like an iPhone. And it's not necessarily a conscious choice either. Ars Technica reports that the Pixel was likely built in only nine months, half-the time phone makers usually take to make a completely new device. Not only that, but the company responsible for the hardware-albeit in a more hands-off way than previous Nexus phones-has a long history of Android phone's the look like iPhones. The Pixel is no different. Big top and bottom bezels, rounded edges. Other than the headphone jack, it just screams "iPhone." It's like an iPhone, but worse. On the one hand, whatever. The iPhone looks fine, so that's fine. The problem comes when you hold it. It certainly doesn't feel like an iPhone. Apple has mastered the fit and finish of its smartphone over more than a decade, the Pixel just doesn't quite recreate that magic. Without a physical home buttons, its big bezels are pointless and an annoying barrier between your thumb and the on-screen buttons. It's chunky and thick in a way that feels accidental. It's got glass on the back with no real purpose other than collecting smudges. It's like an iPhone, but worse. And if you come at the king, you best not miss. Sure, that's admittedly cosmetic and subjective, but the Pixel is also missing some features that should come standard on any phone that costs north of $650, like optical image stabilization for low-light photography and waterproofing. Those shortfalls combined with the premium price sort of submarine the whole deal. But the Pixel also feels like an admission of defeat. Google's taken plenty of great or at least interesting chances by doing what Apple wouldn't. It made a super good phone also super cheap with the Nexus 5. It made a truly massive phone with no smaller counterpart with the Nexus 6. A premium phone with a design all its own-including a distinctive and weird camera bar-with last year's 6P. The Pixel strips away that inventiveness and leaves behind another iPhone(ish) device that runs Android. Maybe it could get away with not being the best if it was at least a little different (or cheaper). So should you buy the Pixel? My gut immediately says wait if you can. While I'm sure you'd be happy with your purchase, it feels like something much better and more thought out is just around the corner. With the Pixel, Google shows that it has great ideas when it comes to software, but apparently it needs some time for the hardware to catch up.

Unveiled at Google’s latest major conference, October 4, 2016, in San Francisco, this new virtual reality headset promises to plunge users into a whole world of virtual reality content via the Daydream platform.  To access this content, users will need a Daydream View headset as well as a compatible smartphone.  For the moment, the only compatible phones are Google’s new Pixel handsets. The headset will be available November 10 from the Google Store and retailers in the US (US$79 USA), Canada (C$99/RM309), the UK (£69/RM355), Germany (€69?RM309) and Australia (A$119/RM381). The system promises spectacular content, including 3D video from sites like YouTube, Google Play Movies and Hulu, as well as loads of games.  There’s even access to Street View for virtually visiting more than 70 countries. In a different genre, the platform also features news apps like The Guardian and The Wall Street Journal. The Daydream View headset is actually a fairly basic piece of kit. Like Google’s rudimentary Cardboard viewer, it’s designed for use with a smartphone, which slots into the device.  The Daydream View is, however, sturdier than the cardboard version and has a remote control with trackpad, gyroscope and accelerometer. This kind of 3D headset is a world away from more sophisticated models like the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive, for example.  Still, such devices seem to have a bright future ahead.  Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi recently launched a very similar device, the Mi VR Glasses, compatible with all of the brand’s smartphones and featuring a remote, selling for just US$38.  Microsoft recently announced the upcoming release of various virtual reality headsets from partner manufacturers like Acer, HP and Lenovo, all priced under US$300 and designed for use with Windows computers. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy The best action cams for winter sports Consumer drone business stumbles, but commercial markets beckon Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Malaysian gaming content exports soar 75pc to RM80m Most Watched Now Week 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities Reuters Video: Reflection ‘healthy’ for Democratic party, says Obama Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Google to name and shame the web’s worst malware offenders Google hawks hardware in real-world ‘showroom’ Google rolls out Chrome Canary experimental web browser to Android Google, automakers object to California rules for self-driving cars Intelligent personal assistants coming to the home (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Since the launch of the Pixel, a number of major third-party developers have changed their Android app icons to match, and when 7.1 makes its way to other Android smartphones, circular icons will be supported across the operating system. While less talked about, Google also changed the look of the search bar, redesigning it to feature a pill shape. It now appears Google is testing that look with non-Pixel users, indicating Android may soon abandon its iconic square search bar. While not an exact replica of the Pixel’s search bar, a number of Android Police readers have noticed that the Google app 4×1 search widget sports a new pill shape. So far, only a small number of users have been able to try out the new widget, which suggests Google is AB testing the new look to see how users take to it. What do you think of the new design? Tell us in the comment section. Image credit: Android Police SourceAndroid Police Orage42 Meanwhile, Nova Launcher 5.0 is on Beta8 and supports the new searchbar widget with weather. And app shortcuts And the new folder preview style. And the new swipe up for app drawer. I sound like an ad for Nova but seriously, these guys are unbelievable and the launcher is bringing everything 7.1 added, save for google assistant. Lion5 Nova Launcher has been the best for years. theycallmeWat? Totally agree. I’ve been using Google Now Launcher for years but when I saw that Nova beta had it’s new features I installed it and upgraded to Prime. My S7 edge is now looking very much like the Pixel after customizing Nova and applying some round icons. I also see that new rounded Google search bar in the widgets menu but prefer the pill style with date and weather that Nova beta offers. Mr_Smoosh 3rd party launchers is probably one the best features that android has over ios. Nova is certainly top of the the 3rd party list as well. Orage42 Yes. My number 1 wish though was to put the pull down menu/notifications also part of the launcher. I would rather have the stock pulldown over LG’s half assed version. It would effectively make any crappy manufacturer’s skin changeable and any phone consistent with simple software tweaks. RS I have a pixel xl and i bought nova prime years ago. It’s been hard to stick with the full google experience for even a few weeks to give it a valid shot. I don’t really care about the new features, I just want nova’s app drawer tabs again. TBH I don’t even want a home screen, if I could (without rooting), I’d replace the home button with the nova’s app drawer button. I will say that the pixel is quite fast and going home then to the app drawer isn’t as tedious as it was on my M8. Lion5 Round icons. Exciting. I can’t believe how much hype this small, insignificant feature has been getting. The search widget is cool. Who needs the full-width one? Then again it’s been a part of Android since day one. Still waiting for my Pixel to arrive. Checked one out at the store. Software seems bare-boned to me. Camera app is extremely basic. There are features in Samsung and LG camera apps that have simply not been replicated successfully via third-party apps.

Google is probably testing the Chrome browser it redesigned for Android smartphones. After the successful launch of Pixel and the Google Assistant, Google gears up for its next innovation. The new Google Chrome browser places the search bar at the bottom of the display. This design aims at enhancing the user experience with large smartphone screens. Now you can use Google Chrome with one hand. According to the report of Android Police, the trait is unfinished as the place where the search tab ideally resides i.e. top is currently empty. “A new flag in Chrome Dev and Canary only described as ‘Chrome Home.’ It moves Chrome’s address bar to the bottom of the screen when enabled,” the report suggests. In a screenshot that showed up on the site, one can witness controls at the bottom. These checks include a search tab, to add tags and also switch tabs. Google is on the verge of incorporating browser controls for mobile versions of Internet Explorer and Edge like what Microsoft did a couple of years ago. Also, Safari browser for iOS has included the browser controls at the bottom that include the switching tab, forward and backward. On the other hand, it gives the impression as if Google is only testing the feature for now. Also that it will roll out the entity eventually for mobile phone users. Google Chrome is now working 15 percent quicker on Windows. Google Chrome’s Sébastien Marchand, in a blog post, said Starting in Chrome 53, Chrome has begun using Microsoft’s Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) technology to make Chrome up to 15 percent faster on Windows. PGO uses data from runtime execution that track which functions are most familiar to guide optimization. For more information, visit this link.

Click Here To Apply Home Other shoemoney The Huge Opportunity With Local (Affiliate) Marketing The Huge Opportunity With Local (Affiliate) Marketing Jeremy Schoemaker November 4, 2008 This was originally the 4th volume of the ShoeMoney Newsletter.  I had some deliverability issues (aweber go figure) and had so many requests to resend that I thought I would just post it here (with some enhancements). Everyday people ask me how they can make money online.  In the past whenever I have found something lucrative, I have written a step-by-step guide on how to make money with it. The down side to having a massive reach, however, is that as soon as I write about something it becomes massively saturated. Right now, companies are tightening up their budgets.  Some of you may be out of work right now and trying to make ends meet.  Look on the bright side. Performance-based marketing thrives in this economy and right now, this is a great opportunity for you to take advantage of it. This following guide will show you how to setup local affiliate marketing, or commission sales deals. I’ll also give you real-life examples so you can see exactly how it works. Getting Setup With Local Affiliate Marketing Getting setup with local affiliate marketing is not easy, but once you get it down it’s like shooting fish in a barrel.  There are many different businesses that are great to market but the higher-end businesses include Lasik Eye Surgeons, Plastic Surgeons, Dentists, Car Dealerships and the list goes on.  Most local companies not only have no affiliate program but they will not understand the value of your efforts. The best way to get their attention is to lay it flat our for them. Tell them you’ll charge them nothing for the first month and see what happens.  (This method has not failed us yet.) We know what we bring to the table and we know that after one month of new business they will see a HUGE value to it (or be scared to death we start to work with their competitors).   It would be pretty silly for the business owner to not take advantage of this opportunity. Determining The Goal Most of these companies have already done research about their demographics and what a new client, buyer or phone call is worth to them.  Obviously the number one goal of these companies is to make more money. However, you need to ask them a lot of questions to help develop the best target market for them.  I am going to use a local dentist as my example throughout this guide. The local dentist I worked with explained to me that his goal was to get more clients.  I asked him more questions like if he knew any demographics or more information of that sort.  He revealed to me that he had done a lot of demographic research and knew that women age 30 to 45 schedule appointments for the whole family.  Boo-yah! Now we are talking.  So I pressed him to find out more information about the demographics’ interests. He already knew the answer. It was teeth whitening. I asked him what his markup on that was and he said that it cost them virtually nothing other than labor to perform this “teeth whitening” service (which they normally charge $600).  Now we know our target but how much is it worth to them?  I asked him if they have ever done metrics on what a new customer is worth versus a returning customer. That’s when he told me that a new customer to them is valued at over $250.  Boom! Tracking The Leads & Determining Value Per Lead Once you are ready to enter into an agreement with the local business, you’ll need to break down your compensation per lead.  You will probably be surprised to learn that most of these established local businesses have already done in-depth research analysis.  When we were working with one of the bigger car dealerships out of Omaha, Nebraska, they told us they knew every time their phone rang it was worth $14 to them. Depending on your trust level with them, there are several ways for you to get paid by sending Internet leads to local businesses. One thing I have always learned is that greedy people will never settle for just a little bit of greed.  If they are cheating you, eventually it will be so blatant that it’s time to move on to their competitor at which time you are MUCH better positioned because you are kicking ass in the space. You can just direct people to call a special number. – Most companies have a dedicated person or team of people who answer the phone.  Their job is conversion.  It’s all they do.  They have been doing this for years and they are much more knowledgeable about the products and services their business offers than you are.  They usually work on commission and this is all they do; they convert interested people into buyers.  The value to them is getting the phone to ring period. Car dealerships are perfect for this.  Above as we talked about, the car dealership determined that every time the phone rang it was worth $14.  I proposed a $10 per call rate and that is what we agreed upon.  In 2007 we averaged 4712 calls per month, which meant $47,120.00/month for us.  Our costs were about $6,000.00 per month in pay-per-click expenses and labor. That means a profit for us of about $1320.00/day (or roughly $41,000.00 per month). And with this one client, we spent less than 2 to 3 total hours per week running everything. They were so happy with the results in 2007 that in 2008 they cut their print media, radio, and TV budgets by 80% and gave us a much higher payout. They even offered to reimburse us to try some other online marketing tactics. Set up a special code that receptionists will ask for in order to take advantage of the deals. – In this instance, the local dentist I am working with does not have a team of sales people but instead has a receptionist who books the appointments.  She does not work on commission and has no incentive to get people signed up.  While he understands the value in marketing, his primary job is obviously dentistry and nobody in his office is specialized in conversion.  In order to cater to this situation, we developed an incentive program. For all new customers, they would be able to take advantage of plenty of offers, but only if they had a special promo code.  This promo code also helped us track which campaigns were doing the best and also which leads we should be credited for.  We negotiated a rate of $75 per new customer that was within the target demographic. In 2008, we have driven an average of 195 new customers per month.  After our expenses, we are profiting just shy of $14,000 per month from this deal. You can collect all the data yourself. (This includes name, phone number, email, age, demographics, etc., and then forward this on to the business and charge them per lead.) This method is ideal for businesses who have no online presence at all.   In this case, you will have to create a site for them along with landing page(s).  Basically, you’ll create a website along with a form to collect the user information that your business is seeking. I have used this method the most and it is usually a gateway to the previous two methods I mentioned. I have done this for such a wide range of local businesses, everything ranging from tanning salons, real estate agents, lawn services, and an in-ground pool company. You name it – I have probably tried it. Like I said before, most companies can be leery about paying for a new service off the bat and we understand that. That’s why we give them the leads for free for the first month or so.  You have to use some common sense with this.  If you rack up 20 leads in a day then that is probably enough to turn over to them and see what kind of feedback you get after they have contacted the leads.  If they come back and tell you they would like for you to continue it, then work out a price. Bonus Tip:  When you are working with someone and they have not done the research on what a new lead is worth to them, you might have to sit them down and walk them through it.  Keep in mind these companies might not see the big picture of the compounding value of a returning customer over time.  If you feel sour about the deal, walk at any time and go right to their competitor.  When negotiating a price, never be the first person to name a price per lead.  Let them give you a place to start.  If they keep saying they don’t know, then tell them to call you when they do know as you have other clients to deal with. You can charge them a flat rate above expenses to manage their campaigns. (boring) If you go with this approach, basically you’ll charge a flat fee to manage the Pay-Per- Click and other accounts for the company.  To me, this is unbelievably boring and I try to avoid it at all costs. Maybe it’s more up your alley?  For a performance-based marketer like me, I hate it. 😉 There are several different approaches you can take when generating local business leads.  The most important thing when looking where to spend money to promote these offers is demographics and obviously geo-targeting.  For those who don’t know, geo-targeting is when you target a user based on their geographic location.  For my campaigns, I am ONLY going to want to target the Lincoln, Nebraska, area.  Here are some of the various ways you can promote the offers: Promote the offers Via PPC. Search Engine Pay-Per-Click – There are many Pay-Per-Click search engines and I suggest you start with Google Adwords (the big dog).  Google Adwords is eons ahead of the other search engines in terms of volume, accuracy, and speed. Plus, by advertising with Google Adwords you are also advertising on all the properties they have deals with like Yahoo!,  AOL,  and ASK.com.   If you are new to pay-per-click advertising, I HIGHLY suggest going through all Google Adwords tutorials and even taking the test to get Adwords certified.  You get your certification after you have managed at least $1,000 in spending and have passed the test. (It will also help you get clients if you are certified.) The secret sauce in pay-per-click marketing is keywords and ad copy.  Your ad copy for the PPC engines needs to convey the incentive (covered later in this article). It also HAS to convey that it is a local business.  A lot of people do not know you can enter phone numbers into ad copy within Google.  This can be great because it might not cost you a click to get a lead.  Also, people can easily look at the ad and see the area code. If it’s the same as theirs, the ad appears to be a legitimate local offer. Get keywords. Keywords on a local level are a different ball-game than on a national level.  For instance, when we took over the local dentist’s website, we did some basic SEO. Within no time it was ranking #1 for Lincoln. Seems like the target keyword, eh?  Not so fast.  Over 65% of the PPC traffic coming was from bidding on his company name or his personal name. To us, the magic was in bidding on the dentist’s name and business name.  Also, much of the traffic was coming from people bidding on phrases surrounded by city/state/zip code names. Money Tip:  If the local business you are promoting keeps logs… GET THOSE!  They will contain valuable keyword data of what people are looking for and give you a great head start. All-in-all, keywords are going to be a trial and error process on the local level. Promote the offers via Social Marketing Websites. Websites like Facebook and Myspace are the best bang for the buck that we have found.  They already have each user’s exact location, age, and sex, so it’s very easy to target your demographic. Here are a few of the current ads we have running on Facebook for our local dentist: Failure Tip: One lesson we learned pretty fast is that you do not want to run multiple versions.  Run them long enough to figure out which one converts best, then only run that one.  From our experience, we determined that the same person who is likely to click on one ad out of curiosity to see the offer but does not convert is just as likely to click on another version of the ad – costing you more money for no lead.  With Facebook advertising, we have yet to see the same IP address for the same ad.  I am guessing that Facebook does not show the same ad to a person once they click on it but I am not 100% about that.  Anyway, just run them to get data. Then go with ONE ad. Promote via SEO. You should not discount the value of Search Engine Optimization, but just make sure that the site you are optimizing is owned by you and you can take it with you (the domain). Promote via Craigslist. Promotion done via Craigslist can be very lucrative if done properly.  You have to be very careful not to be “spammy.”  For instance, if you can find any way to promote your offer along with the current events or say a local concert, that would be a lot less spammy than if you were just to advertise the offer. In Lincoln, Nebraska, it is best for us to tailor some of the offers around the Nebraska Cornhusker football team. That means our ad may read, “Hey Husker fans! Limited time offer! The Husker special! Come in next week and get a free XXXXX.”   You also want to be careful to not get your postings consistently flagged for spam.  Try to come up with a creative way to promote the local business mixed with some value to the Craigslist user.  It’s quite an art! Landing Pages As I stated before, there are going to be some businesses for which you will create a landing page that contains contact information or a form for users to fill out. If that is your case, I have some very useful tips. 1) If the landing page is part of a larger site, then keep the landing page with the same look and feel as the rest of the site.  The user should get the impression that the site was tailored to them.  Whenever I create a landing page for a client, I do a ton of split testing on the page with heat-maps (more on that later) to find out what layout works best and provides the highest conversion rates. On some landing pages, I will use the title and context to let the user know the page was custom made for them, such as a Facebook user.  The bounce rate (length of time users stay on the page) show that this is a huge thing.  Also, the “promo code” is properly placed for ease of use.  At the bottom of the page I usually includ a ton of information about promotion details and other offers that the dental practice provides. Tools Of The Trade Crazyegg – Crazy Egg is a heat-map tracking utility that will show you where your users are clicking on your page.  It’s very useful when conducting split testing. Google Website Optimizer – I cannot say enough good things about the website optimizer.  It will rotate all of your different combinations and then show you the data on what the best possible combinations will be.  We have seen 20-45% improvements using it. ClickTale – ClickTale shows your mouse tracking.  It’s amazing to see what people do with their mouse movements.  It’s an absolute “must-have” for those who are using forms to collect leads.  It will show you where visitors stop to pay attention, where people stop to read more, and even where people quit and give up on your form. Other Things To Think About Integrity  – One of the key things to think about is the integrity of the business that you’re promoting. They have spent a lifetime building up their reputation and you single-handedly could destroy that.  Always keep that in mind. Legalities – Always have all contracts thoroughly looked at by your lawyer. You do not want to get caught up in some non-compete or nondisclosure agreement. By the same token, in certain cases, you will want the local business to sign a non-disclosure agreement in regards to your methods. Go with your gut. – If you talk to a local business and you just do not think it’s the right fit, walk out the door and find another one. I can’t tell you how many times I have worked with local businesses when I knew in my gut it was going to be a train wreck. Sure enough, it always ended up costing me more money, time and stress than it was worth. Right now, I can honestly say that I believe local pay-per-click marketing is the new gold rush. Actually, I think it’s even better than that. It’s really like shooting fish in a barrel. It’s really that easy.  I’m sure a bunch of people will post comments with all of their excuses as to why this will not work for them.  Do not be discouraged by them.  Find a local niche and try it.  Its going to take a little bit of hard work but it’s really the new frontier.  There is a HUGE dislocation in how cheap it is to advertise on these social networks – probably bigger than the ringtone market of years ago when I wrote about it.  Get after it!

November 6, 2008 Pingback: Affiliate Programs - Making Money With Local Affiliate Programs November 4, 2008 adrian I’m curious as to your (or anyone elses) thoughts on getting that first client. Do you do a cold call and lay things out for them? Direct mailing? Cold email, etc. I’d imagine after that first one it gets rolling pretty nicely because then you can just refer future clients to that person, having them provide a solid reference. November 4, 2008 Jeremy Schoemaker Actually in every case the relationship was already there. My dentist asked me what I do for a living I said internet marketing. He asked how we could proceed to set him up. Same with the auto dealership and other places. You probably already have relationships ;). Now we get so much business word of mouth that we really cherry pick locally. November 4, 2008 Melvin Now that is golden. What a great way to segway into your business while sitting at a hair salon and getting your hair styled by the owner. Another thought is to do this kind of promotion anyway and if you know that the company is seeing success in their business, then go in and show them your promotion success. Just a thought.

I see how they gave you a special number, but did you trust them to be honest on how many times the phone rang via your number?

I don’t think this is a good time to work with car dealers. November 4, 2008 Free myspace layouts I’d like to ask this question again: “1) How can we actually track this? This is my main concern with this business model – you are relying on the merchant being 100% honest. I think businesses would only report around half of their actual leads. How do you prevent this?” November 4, 2008 Tushar Dhoot Shoe answered this question just below yours: “Well if you decided to charge per click then you could just use a jumpscript and use your own analytics. As far as the trust issue… yes they could cheat you and this is one of those excuses you can use to not do this.” November 4, 2008 Dave How do you keep track of “physical clicks” in this case? You really rely on the vendor’s trust. They could easily cheat you. November 4, 2008 Jeremy Schoemaker Well if you decided to charge per click then you could just use a jumpscript and use your own analytics. As far as the trust issue… yes they could cheat you and this is one of those excuses you can use to not do this. November 4, 2008 Dave Nah… I love the idea and I will start working on it tonight. I just want to minimize my risks. I think gathering a list of people and charging per lead is probably the safest way… November 4, 2008 Ashley I don’t see trust as an issue at all – if you’re bringing in leads at a good cost why would they cheat you? That would be killing the golden goose. Of course some people might try scrub your numbers a bit, but any intellegent business person (which they should be if they have a business that’s worth working with) would realize they should pay you as much as possible or you could walk across the street to the competition. If you can bring in legit leads to a business you hold all the cards. And who cares if they scrub leads a bit – look at the margins Shoe is talking about.

November 4, 2008 Cameron there are services you can use that give you a special number and it will track all the calls…. and if you can’t figure out how to track web leads yet at this point, perhaps you should consider doing something else.

November 4, 2008 OnlineGodfather That is a great article Shoemoney, tnx 😀 November 4, 2008 Ad Hustler Do you charge these clients some sort of a retainer up front? Take a credit card? Local businesses are notorious for trying to stiff their vendors so I’m wondering how you ensure you will get paid. Also how do you deal with lead quality issues, such as if you say you delivered 4,760 calls to a dealership and they say, well most of those calls were crap. Ive dealt with this, thats why i ask. November 4, 2008 OurSalePrice I hate to bring the proverbial “wet blanket” to the party. But, after being a sales manager for a dealership, you would be spinning your wheels when it comes to marketing this product to auto dealerships. There is no such thing as “not the right time to go after the auto industry” or any niche. If you think that way you have already lost the battle. The reason being is that there are 20-30 businesses that supply “Good Credit” and Bad Credit Leads” to dealerships for pennies on the dollar. The idea is great, but you have to “qualify” these leads in order for them to be profitable to you. There are so many other variables involved within this “market” but there is a workaround. I do have some ideas that may assist you in getting in the door at the dealerships. So, if you are looking to get into this part of the market or would like some ideas please drop me a line. November 5, 2008 Ad Hustler How does this answer my question? November 5, 2008 National Water Council Not all leads are created equal. Sometimes a “lead” is just data. If all you know about someone is their credit rating, does that mean they’re interested in a car? I’d like to know where you’re getting “leads” for pennies each. July 14, 2009 Steve Shoe, Awesome job on the newsletter. I read the entire thing, and I was impressed by the simplicity of your explanation. You got me excited about local affiliate marketing now. I do have one question though. How do you contact new potential clients? Do they contact you first? Do you look through the yellow pages and find numbers to call? Thanks, Steve November 4, 2008 Leo Saraceni The idea in the beginning is for you to find the business you think would benefit the most from your services, approach the owner, and say: “I can increase your bottomline – the first month is free. Just answer a couple of questions” . Eventually, you’ll start receiving calls. The competition is pretty good at picking that up.

For instance, my friend tells me his business printing store revenues has been increasing since the downturn in the economy November 13, 2008 Gumbo You covered quite a few bases there Shoe.

Could you explain or show what you have them sign? Excellent article. Thank you – I’ll be signing up for your newsletter now. November 6, 2008 Ashley Shoe; I had a couple of questions – hopefully they won’t get lost here at the bottom of the comments. On the dentist campaign the promo page you showed us said free teeth whitneing. It wasn’t clear to me how the dentist made money by giving away free teeth whitening. Since you were targeting women, once they had the free teeth whitneing they then signed up their entire family for other services? Is that the angle? On the car campaign did you set up a website that you owned and created or did you just forward to their website with your 800 number on it. On Craigs List where do you place your ads? In the “Services” section? I guess I’m not clear what sort of value you can really add by placing an ad on Craigs List even making it fairly localized. In Los Angeles the services section is so filled with spam when I’ve placed ads in there in the past I’ve gotten zero repsonse. Maybe I just haven’t written the right ad yet, but I was hoping you could elborate a little on that. November 6, 2008 Matthew Larson Hey Ashley, teeth whitening isn’t permanent so you hope for a return customer. They may also switch for general dentistry. Also, teeth whitening is like the “introductory sell” for more cosmetic procedures. July 21, 2009 Chris Guthrie Great post Shoe. Are you concerned that the dentist will read this post and think, “Umm… I should do this myself?” Also – do you believe the best strategy for someone that is new to local affiliate marketing use the method of giving the leads for free at first (because it’s hard enough to probably convince some companies to try you out let alone if you don’t have an established presence.) November 6, 2008 Jack The same reason the dentist won’t start a phone book publishing business… They just pay for the ad to be in the book and work on providing dental services to those who contact the. Most businesses want to be get better at their core services – so should we! November 10, 2008 IamJustinM I’d imagine a really good place to get clients for this would be trade shows and conventions. Especially home and garden trade shows. Those shows are freakin dead these days and most of the companies already paid the non-refundable price for the booth setup. I’m sure they’ll be all ears.

Really helpful ones here. 🙂 July 22, 2009 Kevin This is great stuff. I have an appointment with an attorney in a couple hours to talk about doing this kind of work for her. There are definitely other businesses that I go into that will probably be interested. I know how I can track the web leads, but what about the phone leads? What if the attorney doesn’t want to get a separate 800 number? I love the idea of putting her local number right in the body of some PPC ads, because there is the potential of a call without a click, but how would I track that? Technically, that would be a lead that I provided. Is the honor system the only way? Anyway, despite my tracking questions, I still can’t wait to go to that appointment. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! July 28, 2009 Faceformers Kevin, I use Voipo for local and 800 numbers. It’s cheap and offers simple tracking. You can show your client the list of who called and length of call. A more detailed reporting call tracking service I also use is Ring Central. You can record all phone calls and determine which ones are worthy of being considered a lead. On a PPC campaign your lawyer should not object to you using a phone number to track leads especially if you are the one paying for the ads. You should be the “owner” of the lead list anyway. That’s what the big boys do. If you have a landing page with an opt-in offer, you will own these people and perhaps add them to an autoresponse sequence with legal related offering and useful tips, legal insurance, free consultation, etc. August 29, 2009 Vany Wow That is great Article Thank’s for sharing Shoe July 31, 2009 Stephen Thank goodness there is some sanity in this business.

August 13, 2009 Affiliit Review I think that’s why he says to really go with your guy when you are first talking to the business owners. If they sound like shady mofos, then don’t do it. If they sound extremely excited to move their business to the online world, then give it a go and trust that they’ll help you out. I would imagine that a local business owner getting twice as many customers in one month will do whatever to keep you on board.

Getting more traffic from free offers. September 4, 2009 steve warrington I don’t get it. Maybe this is obvious to everyone except me, but if the tooth whitening services cost money (as they obviously do if they’re paying $250 commissions, how can you run an ad that offers “free teeth whitening”? Especially if you have a concern for the integrity of the dentists’ local reputation. Seriously. Help me understand this. Especially considering you have experience in ringtone ads, which had to ban the word “free”. September 5, 2009 Affiliit Review I think it’s because the dentist said a returning customer is worth much more than a new customer. So, offer the new customer a free offer, get their information, have the dentist do a goodjob, and that customer will go and tell their friends, family, etc. It’s why businesses offer incentives 🙂 September 13, 2009 dale3318 After scouring the internet, I finally found a cheap way of tracking calls & recording them. $2 per month plus 8 cents per minute for a toll free number, or $1 per month plus 5 cents per minute for a local number.

The challenge is in the relationship, and market saturation. A lot of car dealerships are already dealing with automotive web design/online marketing firms. If you can find one that isn’t, pounce on it. Alternatively if you can convince them that you can do a better job than their current provider, then you can win them over, but people don’t like to change, so you’re better off looking for dealers who don’t have someone already. The example of the dental office I think is much more easy to pull off. They are far less likely to have a SEM company working for them. I think I read something in the comments about someone doing this for their electrician as well, that’s a great idea too. You need to find arbitrage opportunities, and those lie in places where people are ignorant to the possibilities. September 16, 2009 Oz Dan It doesn’t necessarily have to be a niche that people are ignorant to the possibilities – or even a business that isn’t using sem yet. If you’re good at copy and good at optimization, then you should be able to do a better job at conversion than what they are currently doing, so offer to set up subdomain on a different site promoting them, or one of their products with a Google Voice number to track calls. I find most local business in my city don’t really do much in the way of differentiating themselves from the next guy (also, all featues, no benefits). I have found that doing a bit of long copy on specific products can get much better results, even for businesses that have been using adwords for some time.

April 18, 2013 David G The problem with ppc is that it’s ALWAYS overpriced, but definition. Since you lose money on low click rates, the per click fee has to be overpriced. That doesn’t mean that it can’t be a good value; it just means that a good ad “could” be purchased for less if it were CPM. Some people just have unappealing products, and when you run an unappealing campaign, you lose money. So the appealing campaigns have to be overpriced to compensate.

Google reported zero-day vulnerabilities to Microsoft and Adobe on Oct. 21, and Adobe responded by pushing a fix out for its flaw in Adobe Flash on Oct. 26. Exploits in the wild were found chaining the Adobe and Windows zero-days where the Flash bug was used to escape the application sandbox and the Windows kernel flaw was then used to escalate to administrator privileges. Ordinarily, Google's policy is to wait 60 days from the time of disclosure to the software vendor before publicly reporting vulnerabilities, but when the vulnerability is being actively exploited Google may publish as soon as seven days after reporting it to the vendor. In this case, Google waited 10 days. "The Windows vulnerability is a local privilege escalation in the Windows kernel that can be used as a security sandbox escape," wrote Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard of Google's Threat Analysis Group, on the Google Security blog. "It can be triggered via the win32k.sys system call NtSetWindowLongPtr() for the index GWLP_ID on a window handle with GWL_STYLE set to WS_CHILD. Chrome's sandbox blocks win32k.sys system calls using the Win32k lockdown mitigation on Windows 10, which prevents exploitation of this sandbox escape vulnerability." Microsoft did not agree with Google's contention that public disclosure of the unpatched vulnerability was in its customers' best interests. "We believe in coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and yesterday's disclosure by Google could put customers at potential risk," a Microsoft spokesperson told SearchSecurity by email. "We disagree with Google's characterization of a local elevation of privilege as 'critical' and 'particularly serious,' since the attack scenario they describe is fully mitigated by the deployment of the Adobe Flash update released last week. Additionally, our analysis indicates that this specific attack was never effective in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update due to security enhancements previously implemented." Microsoft appeared to be calling foul over Google's disclosure because they believe the vulnerability in Windows is fully mitigated by the already-released Adobe Flash update -- and that the attack described by the Google researchers was not possible against a patched version of Flash. Although users of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update should be protected, Microsoft said it worked with both Google and Adobe to fix the vulnerability in older versions of Windows, and "patches for all versions of Windows are now being tested by many industry participants, and we plan to release them publicly on the next update, Tuesday, Nov. 8." John Bambenek, manager of threat systems at Fidelis Cybersecurity in Waltham, Mass., told SearchSecurity by email that the disclosure of an actively exploited vulnerability could indeed be an important step to protect users. "Once attackers start abusing vulnerabilities the risk shifts. The temptation to not discuss weaknesses is to avoid giving attackers ideas," he said. "In this case, they not only have the idea but a fully weaponized exploit. Now we need something to protect our constituencies." The vulnerability Google reported "is a local privilege escalation, which means that if a user is able to execute compromised code (for instance a Flash game or ad), that code could be used to run commands as the administrator and more deeply embed itself into a system," Bambenek said. "In a typical infection chain, privilege escalation is the second step beyond exploiting something with 'user' permissions.  Malware embedded with enhanced permissions is more dangerous as a rule." The Microsoft spokesperson offered this advice for Windows users: "We recommend customers use Windows 10 and the Microsoft Edge browser for the best protection." An Adobe spokesperson referred SearchSecurity to its own Security Bulletin and Microsoft's Security Bulletin. Google did not respond to requests for comment. Risk and attribution In a blog post, Terry Myerson, executive vice president at Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, wrote, "We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Google's decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk." While Microsoft said Adobe patch eliminates the attack scenario, Jerome Segura, lead malware intelligence analyst at Malwarebytes, said there is still risk in the Windows kernel vulnerability. "Indeed Adobe has patched the zero-day, so this exact delivery mechanism seems to be thwarted now (for those who have applied to fix), but there could be other ways to achieve the same result by exploiting flaws in other pieces of software (Internet Explorer, Reader, Silverlight, Office, etc.)," Segura told SearchSecurity by email. "Since many users and enterprises do not patch, an attacker could leverage the Windows zero-day with -- in theory -- any other browser plug-in or internet-facing application." Microsoft also updated the blog post to place blame for the Windows zero-day exploits on a Russian state hacker group, which Microsoft calls Strontium but is called APT28, Fancy Bear and other names by other security firms. Fancy Bear is widely considered the group behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee. "The activity group that Microsoft Threat Intelligence calls Strontium conducted a low-volume spear-phishing campaign. Customers using Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 Anniversary Update are known to be protected from versions of this attack observed in the wild," Myerson wrote. "This attack campaign, originally identified by Google's Threat Analysis Group, used two zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and the down-level Windows kernel to target a specific set of customers." Vishal Gupta, CEO of Seclore, said the involvement of Fancy Bear is "extremely troublesome, especially since a patch won't be available until Election Day." "Though Microsoft hasn't named the targets of the attacks, the fact that the group previously hit the DNC makes me wonder whether the latest hacks are also politically motivated. I expect that more light will be shed on the incident in the coming week, but this incident currently has the signs of a last ditch effort made by the Russians to seed unrest ahead of the election," Gupta told SearchSecurity. "Whether that turns out to be the case or not, the damage caused by this hack will ultimately depend on if the target had measures in place capable of securing data regardless of where it travels."

Robocars It’s not surprising there is huge debate about the fatal Tesla autopilot crash revealed to us last week. The big surprise to me is actually that Tesla and MobilEye stock seem entirely unaffected. For many years, one of the most common refrains I would hear in discussions about robocars was, “This is all great, but the first fatality and it’s all over.” I never believed it would all be over, but I didn’t think there would barely be a blip. There’s been lots of blips in the press and online, of course, but most of it has had some pretty wrong assumptions. Tesla’s autopilot is a distant cousin of a real robocar, and that would explain why the fatality is no big deal for the field, but the press shows that people don’t know that. Tesla’s autopilot is really a fancy cruise control. It combines several key features from the ADAS (Advance Driver Assist) world, such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping and forward collision avoidance, among others. All these features have been in cars for years, and they are also combined in similar products in other cars, both commercial offerings and demonstrated prototypes. In fact, Honda promoted such a function over 10 years ago! Tesla’s autopilot primarily uses the MobilEye EyeQ3 camera, combined with radars and some ultrasonic sensors. It doesn’t have a lidar (the gold standard in robocar sensors) and it doesn’t use a map to help it understand the road and environment. Most importantly, it is far from complete. There is tons of stuff it’s not able to handle. Some of those things it can’t do are known, some are unknown. Because of this, it is designed to only work under constant supervision by a driver. Tesla drivers get this explained in detail in their manual and when they turn on the autopilot. ADAS cars are declared not to be self-driving cars in many state laws This is nothing new — lots of cars have lots of features to help drive (including the components used like cruise controls, each available on their own) which are not good enough to drive the car, and only are supposed to augment an alert driver, not replace one. Because car companies have been selling things like this for years, when the first robocar laws were drafted, they made sure there was a carve-out in the laws so that their systems would not be subject to the robocar regulations companies like Google wanted. The Florida law, similar to other laws, says: The term [Autonomous Vehicle] excludes a motor vehicle enabled with active safety systems or driver assistance systems, including, without limitation, a system to provide electronic blind spot assistance, crash avoidance, emergency braking, parking assistance, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assistance, lane departure warning, or traffic jam and queuing assistant, unless any such system alone or in combination with other systems enables the vehicle on which the technology is installed to drive without the active control or monitoring by a human operator. The Tesla’s failure to see the truck was not surprising There’s been a lot of writing (and I did some of it) about the particulars of the failure of Tesla’s technology, and what might be done to fix it. That’s an interesting topic, but it misses a very key point. Tesla’s system did not fail. It operated within its design parameters, and according to the way Tesla describes it in its manuals and warnings. The Tesla system, not being a robocar system, has tons of stuff it does not properly detect. A truck crossing the road is just one of those things. It’s also poor on stopped vehicles and many other situations. Tesla could (and in time, will) fix the system’s problem with cross traffic. (MobilEye itself has that planned for its EyeQ4 chip coming out in 2018, and freely admits that the EyeQ3 Tesla uses does not detect cross traffic well.) But fixing that problem would not change what the system is, and not change the need for constant monitoring that Tesla has always declared it to have. People must understand that the state of the art in camera systems is not today anywhere near the level needed for a robocar. That’s why most advanced robocar research projects all use LIDAR. There are those (including Tesla and MobilEye) who hope that the day might come soon when a camera can do it, but that day is not yet here. As such, any camera based car is going to make mistakes like these. Fix this one and there will be another. While the Tesla autopilot failed to see the truck, that was an error, a tragic one, but not a failure of the autopilot. It was an expected limitation, one of many. The system performed as specified, and as described in the Tesla user manual and the warnings to drivers. I will say this again, the Tesla autopilot did not fail, it made an error expected under its design parameters. The problem of getting too good — and punishing that No, the big issue here is not what the Tesla autopilot can’t handle, but the opposite. The issue is that it’s gotten good enough that people are mistaking it for a self-driving car, and they are taking their eyes off the road. Many stories abound of people doing e-mail, and there is an allegation that Brown, the deceased driver of this Tesla, might have been watching a movie. Movie or not, Brown was not paying attention, as he could have easily seen and braked in time to avoid hitting that truck. Tesla warns pretty explicitly not to do that. Brown was a fairly skilled guy and he also should have known not to do that (if he did.) But as the Tesla has gotten better, there is no question that people are not heeding the warning and getting a bit reckless. And Tesla knows this of course. This brings up all sorts of issues. Does it matter that Tesla knows that people are ignoring the warnings so long as it gives them sternly? Is there a duty of care to warn people that there is a danger you will ignore the warnings? Is there a duty of care to make sure (with technology) that they don’t ignore them? Perhaps you see the problem here — the better the system gets, the more likely it is that it will make people complacent. People are stupid. They get away with something a few times and they imagine they will always get away with it. Older supervised products like cruise control needed your attention fairly often; there was no way you could watch a movie when using them. Cruise control needs your intervention to steer a few times a minute. Early autopilot like systems need your intervention every few minutes. But Tesla got good enough that on open highways, it might not need your intervention for hours, or the entire highway part of a trip. Eventually it will get to not needing it for days, or even a month. Who would not be tempted to look away for a little while, and then a lot, if it gets there — or gets to needing only one intervention a year? Our minds are bad at statistics. We human drivers have an tiny accident perhaps once every 10 years on average, and one that is reported to insurance about every 25 years. We have a fatal accident about every 8,000 years of average driving, closer to 20,000 years on the highway. a A rate of just one serious intervention every year sounds amazingly trustworthy. It seems like you took a bigger risk just getting on the road. But in fact, it’s very poor performance. Most people agree to be a true robocar, we’re going to need a car that makes an accident-causing mistake less often as a human, perhaps even twice as good or more. And the Tesla isn’t even remotely close. Even Google, which is much, much closer, isn’t there yet. The incremental method But we want systems to get better. It seems wrong to have to say that the better a system gets, the more dangerous it is. That a company should face extra liability for making the system better than the others. That’s not the direction we want to go. It’s definitely not the way that all the car companies want to go. They want to build their self-driving car in an evolutionary incremental way. They want to put supervised autopilots out on the road, and keep improving them until one day they wake up and say, “Hey, our system hasn’t needed an intervention on this class of roads for a million miles!” That day they can consider making it a real robocar for those roads. That’s different from companies like Google, Uber, Apple, Zoox and other non-car companies who want to aim directly for the final target, and are doing so with different development and testing methods. Other views on the complacency issue It should be noted that most other automakers who have made similar products have been much more keen on using tools to stop drivers from getting complacent and not being diligent in supervising. Some make you touch the wheel every few seconds. Some have experimented with cameras to watch the driver’s eyes. GM has announced a “super cruise” product for higher end Cadillacs for several years, but every year pulled back on shipping it, not feeling they have sufficient “countermeasures” to stop accidents like the Tesla one. Google famously did testing with their own employees of a car that was quite a bit superior to the Tesla back in 2012-2013. Even though Google was working on a car that would not need supervision on certain routes, they required their employees (regular employees, not those on the car team) to nonetheless pay attention. They found that in spite of their warnings, about a week into commuting, some of these employees would do things that made the car team uncomfortable. This is what led Google to decide to make a prototype with no steering wheel, setting the bar higher for the team, requiring the car to handle every situation and not depend on an unreliable human. Putting people at risk Tesla drivers are ignoring warnings and getting complacent, and putting themselves and others at risk. But cars are full of features that cause this. The Tesla, and many other sports cars, can accelerate like crazy. It can drive 150mph. And every car maker knows that people take their muscle cars and speed with them, sometimes excessively and recklessly. We don’t blame the car makers for making cars capable of this, or for knowing this will happen. Car makers put in radios, knowing folks will get distracted fiddling with them. Car makers know many of their customers will drive their cars drunk, and kill lots of people. Generally, the law and society does not want to blame car makers for not having a breath alcohol test. People drive sleepy, and half-blind from cataracts, and we always blame the driver for being reckless. There is some difference between enabling a driver to take risks, and encouraging complacency. Is that enough of a difference to change how we think about this? If we change how we think, how much will we slow down the development of technology that in the long term will prevent many accidents and save many lives? In an earlier post I have suggested Tesla might use more “countermeasures” to assure drivers are being diligent. Other automakers have deployed or experimented with such systems, or even held back on releasing their similar products because they want more countermeasures. At the same time, many of the countermeasures are annoying and people worry they might discourage use of the autopilots. Indeed, my proposal, which states that if you fail to pay attention, your autopilot is disabled for the rest of the day, and eventually permanently, would frighten customers. They love their autopilot and would value it less if they had to worry about losing it. But such people are also the sort of people who are making the mistake of thinking a car that needs intervention once a year is essentially the same as a robocar. The unwritten rules of the road I have often mused on the fact that real driving involves breaking the rules of the road all the time, and this accident might be such a situation. While the final details are not in, it seems this intersection might not be a very safe one. It is possible, by the math of some writers, that the truck began its turn unable to see the Tesla, because there is a small crest in the road 1200’ out. In addition, some allege the Tesla might have been speeding as fast as 90mph — which is not hard to believe since the driver had many speeding tickets. Normally, if you make an unprotected left turn, your duty is to yield right-of-way to oncoming traffic. Normally, the truck driver would be at fault. But perhaps the road was clear when he started turning, and the Tesla only appeared once he was in the turn? Perhaps the super wide median offers an opportunity the truck driver didn’t take, to pause after starting the turn to check again, and the truck driver remains at fault for not double checking with such a big rig. Ordinarily, if a truck did turn and not yield to oncoming traffic, no accident would happen. That’s because the oncoming vehicle would see the truck, and the road has a lot of space for that vehicle to brake. Sure, the truck is in the wrong, but the driver of an oncoming vehicle facing a truck would have to be insane to proudly assert their right-of-way and plow into the truck. No sane and sober human driver would ever do that. As such, the intersection is actually safe, even without sufficient sightlines for a slow truck and fast car. Because of that, real world driving involves stealing right-of-way all the time. People cut people off, nudge into lanes and get away with it because rational drivers yield the ROW that belongs to them. Sometimes this is even necessary to make the roads work. With the Tesla driver inattentive, the worst happened. The Tesla’s sensors were not good enough to detect the truck and brake for it, and the human wasn’t insane, but wasn’t looking at the road, so he didn’t do the job of compensating for the autopilot’s inadequacy. The result was death. Measuring the safety of the AutoPilot Tesla touted a misleading number, saying they had gone 130 million miles in autopilot before this first fatality. The reality is that on limited access freeways, the USA number for human drivers is one fataility per 180 million miles, not the 90 million they cited. The AutoPilot is used mostly on freeways where it functions best. Tesla will perhaps eventually publish numbers to help judge the performance of the autopilot. Companies participating in the California self-driving car registration program are required to publish their numbers. Tesla particpates but publishes “zero” all the time because the AutoPilot does not qualify as a self-driving car. Here are numbers we might like to see, perhaps broken down by classes or road, weather conditions, lighting conditions and more: Number of “safety” disengagements per mile, where a driver had to take the controls for a safety reason (as opposed to just coming to a traffic light or turn.) Number of safety disengagements which, after further analysis in simulator, would have resulted in an accident if the driver had not intervened. Number of “late” safety disengagements, or other indications of driver inattention. Number of disengagements triggered by the system rather than the driver. The problem is Tesla doesn’t really have a source for many of these numbers. Professional safety drivers always log why they disengage, and detailed car logs allow the building of more data. Tesla would need to record more data to report this. Tesla with LIDAR Folks in Silicon Valley have spotted what appear to be official Tesla test cars with LIDARs on them (one research LIDAR and one looking more like a production unit.) This would be a positive sign for them on the path to a full robocar. Tesla’s problem is that until about 2018, there is not a cost-effective LIDAR they can ship in a car, and so their method of gathering data by observing customers drive doesn’t work. They could equip a subset of special cars with LIDARs and offer them to a special exclusive set of customers — Tesla drivers are such rapid fans they might even pay for the privilege of getting the special test car and trying it out. They would still need to supervise though, and that means finding a way around the complacency issue. » brad's blog Stocks Submitted by Andrew Clough (not verified) on Fri, 2016-07-08 13:23. I'm not sure the lack of stock price movement is surprising. This was bound to happen sooner or later and it doesn't seem much worse happening now than 12 months down the rode. Stock markets aren't omniscient (they obviously couldn't tell which way the Brexit was going) but I expect them to have already priced in stuff as easy to predict as this. But anyways I think your post did a good job of putting the situation in perspective. » reply Thank you, and correction... Submitted by Alex "some writers" Roy (not verified) on Fri, 2016-07-08 16:20. Another excellent piece. Also, the crest is approx 600 feet west of the impact point. Thx, Alex Roy » reply Source? Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-07-08 16:26. Several articles have written that it’s 1200’ away. Also a truck driver is high off the ground, and a truck is also high. Even with 600’, an alert driver coming over the crest and seeing the truck would brake and even if they did not brake in time, they would slow down, giving the truck time to clear the intersection. At 600’ it certainly seems possible the truck driver could have begun his turn thinking the oncoming lane was empty. » reply too fast? Submitted by Stuart Lynne (not verified) on Sat, 2016-07-09 00:41. From the various reports the Tesla was travelling at 85mph... That would imply I think that the Tesla was perhaps 300-400 yards away from the intersection when then truck started turning. He may have thought he had time to get across (if he it the car he may have assumed it was travelling at the correct posted speed.) The initial distance when the truck started turning would also have made it that much harder for the Tesla's sensors to detect. Although if as reported no brakes where ever applied it would seem that it never saw (or recognised the truck.) Would it make sense for Tesla to limit the auto-pilot mode to a safer maximum speed? » reply Make sense Submitted by brad on Sat, 2016-07-09 08:45. Difficult question. Slower is always safer, but society has not required cruise controls to be speed limited because of that. The driver is in charge and sets the speed, and takes the tickets. The problem was not the speed. Had the driver been paying attention, he would have been able to stop for the truck even at a high speed. He does not seem to have been paying attention. That’s the cause of most accidents, actually, not paying attention. The only real issue caused by the autopilot is the concern that the autopilot, being too good, led him to not pay attention in a major way, possibly even watching a movie. » reply Still not buying it Submitted by James D (not verified) on Sat, 2016-07-09 17:04. I think we agree about a lot of things. Forgive me for only talking about the points where we disagree. So why is it surprising that stock effect was only a blip? Maybe it’s surprising because the robocar community has obsessed over this event for so long that it’s been magnified in their imaginations. I don’t find it surprising and the Tesla drivers I’ve talked to don’t find it surprising. The people who seem most surprised by it have all been Tesla critics and robot car pundits. Clearly there are various lines of thought on this topic. However, when you encounter a surprising fact it’s often a sign that your model of reality is broken. If critics are surprised then this is a nice chance to rethink their analysis of the public’s responses and improve their predictions. As for what this fatal accident says about autopilot - reasoning by anecdote is flawed. It is especially flawed when the most salient information about the anecdote is not available. Let me just point that out and move on. Tesla drivers get complacent. So do drivers of all other cars. So do airline pilots and train engineers and surgeons and bomb disposal experts. It’s human nature to become complacent and if you’re going to fight that you have to pick your battles carefully. Maybe this is a good place to plant that flag, but any argument that doesn’t include a lot of numbers is not going to make that case. Tesla is encouraging complacency? By being good? By not punishing people or restricting the feature? There are restrictions on the use of autopilot, which appear to me to be well considered. It restricts usability by road type and speed and by driving conditions. It demands occasional confirmation responses from the driver and will shut down if the driver appears inattentive for more than a short period of time. Those restrictions have been carefully tightened some since the feature was first introduced and I wouldn’t be surprised if they get tightened again. Autopilot notices if you don’ have your hands on the wheel for an extended period, and it will notice if you do not respond when it prompts you to take action via display messages or audible alerts. I drove 400 miles with it yesterday on a great highway with ideal driving conditions in relatively light traffic and, while it did 95% of the driving I still had to interact with it around a hundred times. The idea that you can leave it to it’s own devices for long periods of time is just wrong. To make the case that autopilot’s current restrictions are inadequate you need carefully thought out alternatives and data to show that your interventions result in increased safety. Half baked policies rarely work in the real world. Tesla probably has that data, and clearly they spend a lot of time thinking about this issue. I wish they would share that data and their thinking because I’m really interested. But I can also understand their reticence in a world of fervid clickbait headlines and gigantic, nervous competitors praying for their demise. And speaking of tight-lipped companies; I’m even more interested in what Google is up to, but they talk a lot less than Tesla does and they show much less than Tesla does. It’s possible that Tesla has become our barometer for these technologies because they are actually out there. Autopilot is not Level 4, but there’s no Level 4 out there anywhere that people other than the developers can see, so of course we extrapolate from what we can get access too because the developers certainly aren’t providing any detail. Google is MIA on this and I’m sure they are experiencing some of the downsides to that policy. By the way, I haven’t seen evidence that many people besides bloggers and media pundits are confusing autopilot for self-driving functionality. Certainly I’ve never personally encountered someone who was familiar with the difference between these two options who was confused about Tesla’s offering. But we see the two juxtaposed a lot because Tesla exists, and available Level 4 information is, so far, just hype, blog postings, and Ted Talks. As for measuring safety, Tesla is clearly doing that. They’ve said they do it and they’ve released small amounts of information that corroborate it. Additionally we know the cars are thoroughly instrumented and that they report a lot of data in real time and in response to unexpected events. Whether and how autopilot stacks up against human drivers is not known outside of Tesla for now. This recent accident affects that only minimally since a single event does not produce useful statistics. The assertion that their statement about going 130 million miles without a fatality is misleading is on weak ground. For one thing, it’s a simple fact. It’s also a fact that you get one fatality for 90 million miles of driving in the U.S. Various sources have pointed out that statistics vary for different roads, and that autopilot is intended for, and presumably mainly used on roads that have relatively low fatality rates. But it’s also true that many roads where autopilot is used have much higher fatality rates than the quoted death-per-90MM figure. Rural high speed roads have accident rates up to 10x higher than limited access highway fatality rates and autopilot can certainly be used on these kind of roads. Even if usage on these roads is only 10% or 20% of autopilot usage it will have a large impact on the fatality rates. Notably this recent accident was on just such a high speed rural road, where fatality rates can exceed one every 20 million miles. Tesla has that data. The rest of us don’t. What is publicly known is not sufficient to either support or refute Tesla’s statements. Finally, I can see why lidar is a very appealing sensor for these kind of applications, and why it used to be seen as nearly indispensable. It provides a kind of data that allows usefully independent corroboration of other sensor inputs in addition to providing data that is, until recently, very hard to extract from other sensors. But available lidar sensors also have a lot of limitations including cost, resolution, range, reliability, and maintainability. The advances in neural networks in the last few years when combined with the cost and quality of camera sensors is rapidly eroding lidar’s previous advantages. Personally I would welcome lidar, or even better, high frequency coherent radar which overcomes many of lidar’s deficiencies. But after studying the advances of the last few years I no longer believe it is a requirement. Recent advances in neural networking for perception, and for higher level situation analysis and decision making point to capabilities that change machine the equation radically. » reply Blips Submitted by brad on Sat, 2016-07-09 23:17. As I said, I was never one of those to say the first accidents would destroy the industry, but I never met anybody predicting the opposite until Elon told Fortune that they did not disclose the crash because it was not material. (Note that Tesla’s disclosures previously did warn that a serious crash could have a material result, but disclosures are full of all sorts of CYA warnings.) In spite of the reports, I know people who read their E-mail in their Teslas and otherwise disobey the warning, and there are many stories of people I don’t know who also do the same. Google isn’t that tight-lipped, actually. They just don’t have a product to ship, so you don’t see it. They give talks at conferences all the time and reveal quite a bit, and they also do their incident reports with more detail than Tesla or anybody else. I do agree it’s mostly media who we saw confuse the two — but how could we see anybody else but bloggers and pundits? You don’t see the writings of ordinary users much. The difference between cameras and LIDARs is that LIDAR works today, in terms of detecting obstacles with the reliability necessary. Cameras don’t. One can make guesses about when cameras will, and make a bet that it’s soon, but it’s a bet. There is no bet required to know that LIDAR does detect the obstacles nor much of a bet that it will be economical soon. Indeed, radar would be great, but that’s also a bet right now. » reply Blips Submitted by James D (not verified) on Tue, 2016-07-12 19:13. Sorry if my comment came across as suggesting that you believed it would be armageddon. I meant to suggest that seeing it unlikely to be only a blip was an error. In the world most of the public lives in car accidents are, sadly, a common tragedy. In that world car builders are generally considered to be diligent in their responsibilities and the likelihood that a fatal accident was caused by gross negligence on the part of a car maker is not high. Would you expect GM's stock price to take a dip due to a single accident? This is perhaps not obvious, but car accidents are frequently understood to happen during a confluence of unfortunate choices and circumstances. That an accident occurs is not a smoking gun for liability for any party and often causes are not well understood until after extensive analysis, and sometimes not even then. That Tesla would be presumed to be at fault, liable, and that such liability would be large enough to threaten their viability is just understood to be the unlikely situation, not the likely one. That one might presume otherwise is, I suggest, a symptom of having over-thought the feared scenario for too long. If you happen to have a good source of information on Google's technology I would appreciate it if you could share. I've been following this field closely for ten years and feel like I've not seen anything beyond superficial marketing and PR statements with regards to the functioning and actual capabilities of their system. Additionally they are reluctant bordering on compulsion to make any forward looking statements of any detail. And yes, lidar exists, but not in a state that is appropriate for deployment in very large fleets of cost sensitive daily use vehicles. That problem is being worked on. The camera problem is also being worked on. It used to be obvious that lidar would win that competition but I think that outcome is now in doubt. » reply Not like a GM accident Submitted by brad on Tue, 2016-07-12 21:49. The point is that you may know it was driver error, and I might know this, but the public — based on press and blog traffic — doesn’t. But more to the point, if GM had an accident and it was revealed that NHTSA and the NTSB were both investigating the accident looking for corporate responsibility (they don’t deal with driver error) and the SEC was investigating, then I would certainly expect a blip in their stock. Tesla continues up (though not as up today as the market, so possibly a minor blip.) Of course it’s also true that even if Tesla pays a big fine and cripples functionality in the autopilot, it’s still going to sell all the cars it makes. Most investors are worried if it can make enough, not if it can sell enough. For Google info, aside from what I have posted here, look for videos of talks by Chris Urmson, Nathaniel Fairfield, Dave Ferguson and others. » reply material Submitted by James D (not verified) on Tue, 2016-07-12 19:19. Also, since you seem to have not heard this: Musk did not comment that the accident was not disclosed because it was immaterial. Musk stated that it was not disclosed and that it was immaterial, not that it was not disclosed because it was immaterial. He later clarified that they could not have disclosed that the accident was autopilot related before the offering because they did not know that autopilot was engaged during the accident until after the offering. » reply Stock changes Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-07-10 11:26. I will also add that whatever opinion one might have on whether such a crash would affect the stock price, I am baffled that there is also no blip from the fact that Tesla is facing both a NHTSA and NTSB investigation over this crash. Everything tells me that the market would normally discount the stocks due to the uncertainty over these investigations — no matter how much you might think there is nothing that can happen, you can’t predict what the agencies will do. In fact, it makes me wonder if Tesla wasn’t on an upward trend for other reasons, and was kept flat by discounting around these events. Or if people, not seeing it drop, decided to pick some up because they had new confidence in it because of the lack of drop. » reply The problem is bad goals Submitted by cxed (not verified) on Sun, 2016-07-10 10:03. Thanks for your excellent analysis, Brad. I know I'm in the minority, but I've always said the right way to evolve to full autonomous isn't with supercruise which demands that people drive without driving. The cars know where they are and what the roads are like. On some roads the chance of an accident is infinitesimal. Let people do their email on those roads and only those roads. That would encourage people to demand roads designed and managed for autonomous driving (no nasty left turning trucks to confuse things). I'm thinking about something like a freeway HOV lane that is separate from other lanes. Once certified for hands off driving the dream could really be real right now. People say that accomodating true autonomous systems by infrastructure changes is cost-prohibitive. I say that wasting your life driving a car is way more cost prohibitive yet it's the norm. Also clearly we're capable of serious infrastructure improvements if the reward is great enough (e.g. railroads in the 19th century and paved roads and interstate freeways in the 20th). It's not like our road infrastructure couldn't use a complete overhaul anyway. On the topic of this accident (perhaps), if the speed is 90mph and the "driver" is watching a video, I'm not very sympathetic. One of the great promises of autonomous cars is that you can cut the normal travel speed in half and yet still massively increase your productive life. If I was given the chance to make all future car trips at 1/2 the speed I'd normally drive them, but I could read a book or whatever, I'd absolutely take that offer. Why someone would set the thing to 90 or 85mph and think to not pay attention is crazy. If he set it to 45mph, that'd be more understandable and he'd probably be alive to explain the crash. » reply (Yet another) opinion on the "why no share price blip" puzzle Submitted by Glenn Mercer (not verified) on Tue, 2016-07-12 14:24. I am no expert in what drives share prices (I wish I knew someone who was!), but if I step back from the share price to the general news coverage (sort of one degree of separation) I think a reason for no media explosion (no "Hindenburg Moment") around the Florida event is the nature of the crash. That is, "unfortunate driver on highway drives into truck, and is killed." That is tragic of course, but I think the "HM" comes when the car involved in the incident kills someone else (in another car, or worse, a pedestrian). That scenario invokes all sorts of Frankenstein/Frankencar, Our Robot Masters, death-by-AI SkyNet imagery. Throw in that a Tesla costs 3x as much as the average vehicle and we can get some class resentment as well. So while I do think a true HM would damage the autonomous-vehicle trajectory, and maybe the TSLA price, I think we haven't seen one yet, and with luck we won't. As long as the perception is "dumb rich guy kills himself in his expensive toy" (please don't flame me, I am not calling the driver dumb, or rich, or the Tesla a toy, I am commenting on the possible public perception!) then media outrage is muted, and to the extent that moves the share price, the share price bump is muted. Watch out, however (and I hate being this morbid) if the car hurtles off the road and nails an innocent bystander. » reply It would be worse Submitted by brad on Tue, 2016-07-12 15:30. While I agree, hurting a bystander would get more attention and criticism — and you could make it worse and have it be a child — the lack of blip here tells me that while there will be a blip in that situation, it seems less and less likely it would be a Hindenberg moment. Hindenberg moments do happen, but they are pretty rare. The worst I see now would be the destruction of a particular project, or a particular technological method. » reply Alternative to Hindenburg (sic) Submitted by Glenn Mercer (not verified) on Wed, 2016-07-13 10:04. I agree they are rare, and I agree the impact (my bad choice of words!) might just be on a project or a method. Perhaps more likely than a full HM is a slow near-death-by-liability-lawsuits, as happened to general aviation until the Feds gave it some immunity. See: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/General_Aviation_Revitalization_Act But again, I don't really know what I am talking about. Yet I am just concerned that putative "Silicon Valley over-confidence" (probably a meme as opposed to a reality) will, if it is not careful, stroll right into the American trial-lawyer meat grinder (a reality, not a meme!). I believe it is possibly counter-productive, in light of this, for Certain People to make statements that appear (sic) to "blame the victim" -- juries do NOT like that (even when the blame is accurately assigned). Remember that Toyota paid some $3 billion in recalls and fines for its sudden unintended acceleration problem, which in virtually every case could be averted by either shifting the car into neutral or holding down the power button long enough to turn off the engine. And Toyota didn't dare breathe a peep about this being the drivers' fault. Oh well, fretting ain't gonna make anything better, so I will stop fretting. » reply Yep Submitted by Isabel Draves (not verified) on Wed, 2016-07-13 05:17. As a bystander, I agree that a perception that "a car- obsessed You Tube show off with a history of testing his car's limits, killing himself by watching a movie while driving 85 mph" would not cause eager investors to worry about an investigation. Also I recall a somewhat similar accident where no autopilot was used, years ago on route two in Concord MA where a truck driver ignored his red light as a woman drove across the highway with the right of way, which is just to say crashes happen and people know that. The problem will occur when someone is using autopilot as prescribed and dies or kills someone else. But even that, people are already expecting. » reply That might be what it is Submitted by brad on Wed, 2016-07-13 12:41.

 Google Play Music requires all clients to provide a device ID. By default, Mopidy-GMusic will use your system’s MAC address as the device ID. As Google puts some limits on how many different devices you can associate with an account, you might want to control what device ID is used. You can set the gmusic/deviceid config to e.g. the device ID from your phone where you also use Google Play Music: [gmusic]
deviceid = 0123456789abcdef
 The Android device ID is a 16 character long string identifying the Android device registered for Google Play Music, excluding the 0x prefix. You can obtain this ID by dialing *#*#8255#*#* on your phone (see the aid) or using this app (see the Google Service Framework ID Key). On iOS the device ID is an UUID with the ios: prefix included. (TODO: Include instructions on how to retrieve this.) Usage The extension is enabled by default if all dependencies are available. You can simply browse through your library and search for tracks, albums, and artists. Google Play Music playlists are imported as well. You can even add songs from your All Access subscription to your library. Mopidy will able to play them.

The idea is to take advantage of free advertising on Google. Google offers ten thousand dollars in free ads to non-profit organizations. The Michigan Human Trafficking Commission and a state police task force are working on gathering as many non-profits as possible to apply for the advertising with one goal in mind: Deter people who search for paid sex from following through. The non-profits would use their advertisement allowance for anti-trafficking ads that would pop up when someone uses certain key words. Kathy Maitland is a member of the committee and the task force. She said some people, like those with sex addictions, might not realize the harm they are causing.  “That’s ultimately the desire is to help people get out of this and to you know see people transformed rather than just arresting bad people,” she said. Maitland says the idea behind the project is to work on whittling down the demand for paid for sex, which is a core cause of human trafficking. She says for some people, just realizing the ramifications of using escort services and paying for sex can be a deterrent. “Some people don’t understand what they’re doing,” she said. “That there’s victims behind what they’re doing. And for some people knowing that will make a difference.” Maitland says they are currently working on an informational website that viewers will go to if they click on the ad. They hope to have the website ready by early 2017.

The AT&T buyout of Time Warner is really about owning as much of our personal information as possible, whether it flows from our computer, our TV or — especially — from our mobile phones. It reveals the goal of the next generation of Big Media mergers: bringing together under a single entity massive broadband network connections and vast production and content capabilities, along with sophisticated data-mining operations that deliver micro-targeted ads. AT&T and other large corporations want to profit by knowing what we buy, where we go, what we view and who we interact with — and to use powerful data analytics to (in their words) “monetize” our personal information. AT&T believes that by harvesting all of the data delivered to it as we view and interact with HBO’s Game of Thrones, CNN, Looney Tunes and other Time Warner brands, it will generate revenues and better position itself to rival — or partner with — Google and Facebook. It has a sizeable advantage to potentially deliver that goal, recently claiming that the company “owns 150 million screens across TV and mobile.” Those “screens,” of course, are really us — their subscribers and customers. But potentially standing as an obstacle to the data-domination goals of this mega deal is last week’s decision by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requiring broadband internet service providers (ISPs) such as AT&T to begin protecting consumer privacy. The new ISP privacy rule, approved on a 3-2 partisan vote, is designed to help Americans escape from the explosion of commercial data-driven eavesdropping that is increasingly a feature of our online lives. Under the new policy (which will go into effect in about a year), ISPs will no longer be able to automatically use a significant amount of a person’s information on behalf of marketers and advertisers — unless they first secure the user’s informed consent (known as “opt-in”). The key safeguard adopted by the FCC last week says that data about one’s health, finances, precise geolocation, children and — critically — information culled by ISPs monitoring our use of mobile “apps” and “web browsing,” must now be classified as “sensitive.” This will force ISPs such as Comcast, Verizon and AT&T, the key gatekeepers to our wired and wireless internet connections, to treat this data differently. The customer will be empowered to decide how this sensitive information can be used, if at all, by advertisers and others. ISPs and data giants such as Google fought the FCC’s privacy plan, which was spearheaded by its chairman, Tom Wheeler. Until now, the digital media industry — which includes broadband companies, internet advertising-dependent giants and major marketers — had successfully blocked any law or regulation that would protect consumer privacy online. That’s because the ability to steal and sell other people’s data to fuel marketing and advertising has become one of the US’ most successful global businesses. Our companies — think especially Google and Facebook — have perfected the vast technological capabilities to do this well throughout the world. But privacy laws stand as a potential barrier to these plans, providing an all-too-rare opportunity for individuals and even governments to challenge what has become a core function of the internet. Nearly every moment of the day, corporations instantly harvest the abundance of information now available about consumers with their every click and search term request. So it’s no surprise that the country where much of the internet began, and which — through Silicon Valley — has helped shape its phenomenal growth, has been politically hostile to privacy advocates. The US lags behind the European Union, for example, where data protection is considered a fundamental human right. Proposals to regulate privacy in the US, including under President Obama, have largely been designed to protect the data industry. Working with its powerful allies (including former congressman-turned-lobbyist Henry Waxman), Comcast, AT&T, Google and their supporters were able to force FCC Chairman Wheeler to scale back his initial proposal. That original plan didn’t rely on what is now an outdated way to protect consumers, by identifying only some of their information as “sensitive.” That traditionally has meant bank-account numbers and medical records. But recent advances in “Big Data” processing now enable the cataloguing of information that, while on its surface may appear to be innocuous, can actually reveal our financial and health status. Privacy advocates had hoped the FCC would be able to move privacy in the US into the 21st century by abandoning the antiquated “is-it-sensitive-or-not-sensitive?” data distinction. But the final decision kept that false dichotomy, although it did manage to define much more data about us as sensitive (including information derived from our use of search and mobile apps). The FCC’s new privacy rules have triggered an outcry of alarm and opposition from opponents. The lobbying group representing Verizon, News Corp., Google and others charged that the FCC was “destabilizing the ad-supported internet economy.” The cable industry called the decision more “regulatory opportunism than reasoned policy… that abandons principles of fair competition.” USTelecom, which represents telephone companies, claimed that “classifying all web browsing as sensitive information… [is] a disservice” to consumers.” Not to be outdone, the trade group representing the most powerful US advertisers, the Association of National Advertisers, blasted the decision, calling it “unprecedented, misguided, counterproductive and potentially extremely harmful.” It promised to see the “rules undone,” whether by “court challenges or action on Capitol Hill to reverse this extreme overreach by the agency.” As someone who helped get the FCC rules passed, my reaction to these and other industry-funded criticisms is that we (ACLU, Consumers Union, Public Knowledge and many others) must have done something right! There will still be a lot of work to make these rules meaningful, including ensuring that phone and cable giants don’t mislead people into consenting to have all their personal information used for marketing. There are loopholes in these rules that will have to be closed. But the decision, as the trade publication Business Insider noted, is a “huge victory for privacy advocates.” It sets the stage to tackle those remaining powerful digital media companies left basically untouched by the decision — especially Google and Facebook. To rein in these Big Data corporate giants, Congress will need to act — something unlikely in the near term, to put it mildly. Still, we’ve taken a huge first step in this process. Critically, the new privacy decision places attention on how the unconstrained growth of data surveillance technologies — led by our digital media companies — is fueling an unprecedented intrusion of commercial forces into our daily lives. This apparatus, which uses the latest advances in data technology (such as IBM’s Watson or the Oracle Data Management Platform) to automate the process of how we are observed and treated online — and even offline — poses a serious privacy challenge. Big Data is influencing the basic operations of our media and journalistic institutions, political campaigns and other key parts of our society — including health, financial and retail — and how they relate to us as individuals. Whether the AT&T-Time Warner merger will be rejected by the Department of Justice antitrust division is uncertain. Despite a growing wave of opposition about the deal, it might pass muster by agreeing to a number of conditions, some of which should include how AT&T-Time Warner handles data (and can be based on, in part, the new FCC privacy rules). The next administration will have to show the public it understands what must be done to prevent greater media — and data — consolidation. Twenty-first century media mergers are creating a new chokehold on competition and diversity of viewpoints by controlling the broadband pipes, the content and how all the data gathered from our devices can be used. Programmers and online content providers (think independents, streaming video startups, minority-owned local media, etc.) that don’t have the same access to consumer data — what a person is interested in, for example, and where they go — won’t be nearly as competitive with AT&T once Ma Bell marries Bugs Bunny. That same data, however, exposes the public to a greater loss of privacy and more. As Big Media and Big Data further converge, state-of-the-art safeguards are required to ensure we are guaranteed both the robust flow of competing ideas and our personal privacy.

Comments By Sharon Gaudin Follow Computerworld | Nov 2, 2016 1:12 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Social Media Search Internet Comments Facebook, Twitter and Google are continuing their push to get Americans to the polls for next week's presidential election. Facebook, which has been credited with aiding in a surge of voter registrations this fall, is running a new feature that shows users what's on the ballot in their state. The information includes which candidates are running in federal, state and local races, ballot initiatives and where the candidates stand on issues? Facebook A sample of information provided to California voters from Facebook on a smartphone. "Voting is important and everyone deserves to have the tools to exercise this basic right," the company said in a recent blog post. "That's why, alongside other companies, we're encouraging civic participation. We want to make it easier for people who want to participate to do so, and to have a voice in the political process." While Facebook last month posted voter registration reminders, the social network now is trying to show voters what questions they'll be asked to decide on when placing ballots on Election Day. "Not all states in America mail out sample ballots ahead of an election," the company stated. "This can make it challenging to find comprehensive information about the questions you'll be expected to consider when you walk into the voting booth. Thanks to data gathered from election officials by the nonpartisan Center for Technology and Civic Life, we can present you with a preview of the ballot you'll receive on November 8." Google is taking a similar initiative. When users call up the Google search page on the election, for instance, they'll see a pop-up window that notes if there's early voting in their state.They also can click to find out the location of their their polling place and directions on how to get there. By entering their address, the service show users where to vote, as well as offer information on how to vote and register. By clicking on the ballot link, users are shown who is running in the presidential and state-level races. "Throughout the summer, we've helped voters find information about how to register and how to vote, in both English and Spanish," wrote Jacob Schonberg, Google product manager, and Kate Sokolov, Google's program manager for Politics and Elections, in a blog post last month. "Now, as you prepare to head to the polls, we want to make sure you know where to vote and who's on your ballot when you get there." Twitter also is getting in on the election action. The social network's @gov, or Twitter Election arm, gives users a countdown of reminders about how many days are left until Election Day. Twitter also has launched a service today that enables users to send a private Direct Message, or DM, to Twitter's @gov account to get information about their polling place, the candidates and ballot questions, along with information about state election rules and absentee voting. If you're able to vote, we want you to do so, and hope this tool helps make that happen. pic.twitter.com/n1ec7Ouv6o — Twitter Government (@gov) Nov. 2, 2016 Facebook and Google also played roles in the presidential debates between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. The Commission on Presidential Debates, which organized the three presidential debates, in September used information from Facebook and Google on what people were searching for and saying about the election, to help them put together questions for the candidates. Facebook also was on-site during the debates to help people live stream the events using Facebook Live.

The round design on the new widget looks interesting and unique, but the standard Google Search widget didn’t match up. Now, Google appears to be testing a new look for that widget which adopts a similar look (via Android Police)… The new 4×1 widget has rounded edges with the “G” logo on one end and the microphone on the other with an off white bar in between. So far it seems like this will only appear through widgets, so it won’t show up at the top of the Google Now Launcher — at least not yet.

And you can thank her for helping lead the way to a pretty hefty parental leave policy at the tech giant. “When we increased our maternity leave to 18 weeks, we saw the number of women who left Google cut by 50%,” Susan Wojcicki told CNNMoney in an interview at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit last month. That data was enough for Google to make the argument that paid leave is well worth the cost. “We wanted to retain women, we wanted to show them that Google cared, that they can be a mother and they could work at Google,” she said. As CEO of YouTube (now with over 1 billion users a month) Wojcicki has her eyes on changing TV as we know it — while advocating for more women in top roles at tech companies. Oh, and in the meantime raising her five children. Wojcicki was one of the first woman hired at Google — and now she’s the only female CEO under Google’s behemoth umbrella. In 1998, Wojcicki left her marketing job at Intel and became employee number 16 at Google. Larry Page and Sergey Brin had been running the fledgling company out of Wojcicki’s garage in Menlo Park, California at the time. She’d agreed to rent it to Brin and Page (then PhD students at Stanford) to bring in some extra dough. “It was truly because I needed help paying the mortgage.” Eventually, Page and Brin convinced her to join their team. Wojcicki was the first woman to take maternity leave in the nascent days of Google. “When I first started I don’t think we really had an HR department. So it wasn’t really clear.” She said, “‘Hey Larry, hey Sergey, I’m going to take a little time off … Nobody had ever done it before at the company.'” Fast Forward nearly two decades and she’s helped lead the charge on family leave at Google — for men and women — which now offers new mothers 18 weeks of paid leave and new fathers 12 weeks. Google certainly isn’t the only company in Silicon Valley offering lengthy periods of paid time off for new parents. Companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Netflix all generous new parental leave policies last year. Facebook now offers four months paid leave to new mothers and fathers. In making the announcement, Facebook’s VP of People, Lori Goler, posted: “Studies show that when working parents take time to be with their newborns, outcomes are better for the children and families.” So why have tech companies seemingly led the way on parental leave? “I think Silicon Valley has led on this because Silicon Valley, at the end of the day, is really focused on talent,” Wojcicki said. “It’s a talent business, getting the right engineers, the right leaders … And Silicon Valley is also focused on having more women, more diversity.” But there’s still a long way to go. Wojcicki is perturbed by the dearth of women in top technology jobs in Silicon Valley. Only 26% of all tech jobs in the U.S. are held by women. At Google, 31% of global employees are women. And just 24% of leadership positions and 19% of tech roles are held by women. “I see tech as … a force that is changing pretty much all parts of our society,” Wojcicki argues. “It’s really sad for me that we don’t have enough women that are part of that. I compare this to the revolution where people were able to read and write for the first time, and the printing press. I think it is that big, in terms of how much our society is being changed.” Last year, Time Magazine dubbed Wojcicki “the most powerful woman on the internet.” Like so many working parents, Wojcicki is juggling a big job — and a big family. And she says that being a mother has actually helped her do her job better. She credits her children with priceless user feedback on what YouTube is doing well — and where the platform could improve. “I try to watch my kids behavior, and I try to get insights from that, and understand how are they thinking about media, what are they watching. Then I try to marry that with quantitative data that we have in the office.” And she feels a responsibility to change the narrative, and the statistics, on girls and women in technology across the country. “One of the things that I’m trying to do is use the position that I’m in … to encourage the next generation of girls to think about the internet as a career opportunity.” Her gender has in no way held Wojcicki back from excelling — but she sees the path that she took as far too narrow for too many women. “You see a lot of powerful women on the internet,” Wojcicki said, “but I wish there were more. I think the internet really could use a lot more women.” And Wojcicki wants everyone to remember the contributions women have made to technology. “I think people have forgotten the role that early women played in computer science and [the first computer programmer] Ada Lovelace is a great example of that.” Fitbit stock tanks 30% on lousy sales Facebook nears 2 billion users Related Posts America’s favorite grocery store is… Play me baby one more time?

Sign up for updates. Our last SEJ Summit conference took place November 2, 2016 in New York City at the beautiful TimesCenter. Moderated by SEJ founder Loren Baker, Maile Ohye of Google kicked off the day, discussing mobile search and AMP. She announced that Google is requiring publishers and websites to have HTTPS to use most AMP functionality and PWAs. Bill Hunt After Maile, Bill Hunt joined the state to discuss Making SEO Lemonade: Moving the Needle on Missed Opportunities. He tackled indexability, clickability, and other methods to find all those tiny errors that together cause big issues. Bill shared real examples of clients that saw amazing results once basic SEO errors were fixed. Watching @billhunt do a great job of covering the root causes of most SEO problems at #SEJSummit NYC pic.twitter.com/hQoJjBmads — Mark Traphagen (@marktraphagen) November 2, 2016 Bill first discussed the importance of confirming index rates. Make it easy for Google to crawl your site. “If Google knocks on 3 “doors” [links], and they all don’t open, why would they knock on a 4th door?” Bill recommends maximizing XML site maps to offer a clear list of what you want Google to index. HREFLANG is Crucial For International Sites Bill gave a few examples of sites that didn’t have HREFLANG in place and faced deindexation and a huge loss in profiles. It’s important to align to the correct country using HREFLANG, which Bill spoke with us about in more detail at Pubcon [Watch the interview]. Don’t forget to map your HREFLANG tags. In many cases, the canonical tags are wrong, but these can be easily checked using a free tool like Bill’s HREFLANG validation checker. Don’t Forget to Check Your Snippets Optimize your snippets to get featured more in search and use the snippet optimization tool from Google. Bill encouraged us to ask, Does snippet match user intent? Is the ranking page the PLP?   Meta description is more important than you'd think! Great first two presentations #SEJSummit pic.twitter.com/J0smDrBWE3 — Audrey the Nerd (@audreyspizza) November 2, 2016 To bring it all together, Bill’s three takeaways were: Understand the importance of indexability Don’t forget about global opportunity Accept that searcher intent is critical to success You can view Bill’s slide on Slideshare as well: Making SEO Lemonade: Moving the Needle on Missed Opportunities by Bill Hunt – #SEJSummit NY from Search Engine Journal John Shehata John Shehata, VP of SEO at Condé Nast, spoke on AMP Tactics from the Condé Nast SEO Team.  John shares insights, advanced technical tips, and editorial tactics his team learned while implementing AMP for their major sites. The majority of mobile traffic is still coming from search, but John’s team has found that AMP accounts for 2x as much traffic to newly published pages. They also found that AMP queries get 15x visits, 7x impressions, 2x higher average rankings than sites that didn’t have AMP implemented. One of John’s specific examples was Wired, which translated its 20+ year history of articles from its website and magazine into AMP pages. Once found, they saw a 25% in CTR in search results, 63% increase in CTR on ads in AMP stories. Recommended AMP Tools John recommends the following websites to educate yourself on AMP: AMPproject.org AMPbyExample.com AMPproject.org/roadmap The best content types suited for AMP include: News Blogs Recipes Product listings Travel guides. He also suggested that eventually, homepage, category pages, tags, and landing hubs could be good to pass as AMP pages down the road. One of John’s most important points of the presentation was that if your pages don’t validate for AMP, they will not pass, period. Some of the validation tools you can use include: Google AMP CDN, [AMP-URL]#development=1, and Chrome devtools console, and more. .@JShehata shares his favorite AMP tools #SEJSummit pic.twitter.com/D0UhMbv1XW — SearchEngineJournal® (@sejournal) November 2, 2016 John’s team also uses a Slack bot to relay messages from CMS to engineering team when a newly-published page doesn’t validate, to fix it as quickly as possible.

Learn more by viewing John’s slides on Slideshare: AMP Tactics from the Condé Nast SEO Team by John Shehata – #SEJSummit NY from Search Engine Journal John Brown Our second Googler of the day spoke on Best Practices to Protect Ad Spend. John walked us through best practices for human traffic protect to ad spend and provide accurate traffic stats. John stated that he liked the mission of Google Trust and Safety Team as a mission for all of us as publishers that have ads: We keep Google’s ad network safe for advertisers, publishers, and users. John stated that, “we are fighting a war against false traffic. You must work with ad partners that respect users.” Strong Practices Build Trust John used the example of toothbrushing.net to show a “scary site” — buying traffic with bots and not really providing value to the user. He stressed that common language is essential. Use search to see what the results look like and what people are searching for.Focus on real conversions to drive success ad campaigns. Finally, practice on safe ad sourcing for ad partners. If they don’t provide real answers, dump them. It’s not worth the risk. When it comes down to it, identify real visitors. Learn more from John in his interview about AMP. Glenn Gabe Glenn’s presentation after lunch was What the Doctor Ordered: Your Yearly Google Algorithm Update Checkup (2016 Edition). Glenn gave us an overview of what is going on with Penguin, Panda, and Google’s Quality Updates (aka Phantom), as well as how they are impacting your SEO efforts now. Glenn showed us what each algorithm update is targeting, so you can avoid negative impact and increase rankings and traffic. According to Glenn, Google pushes between 500-1000 changes every year. They first had an object oriented approach: craft algos and rolled them out separately. However, this caused significant movement all on one day. Panda Glenn stated that in the first Panda update, sites would lose 60-70% of organic search traffic overnight. Google doesn’t usually say when a new Panda cycle begins, but Glenn mentioned that Gary Illyes doesn’t view Panda as a penalty. Google’s purpose for Panda is to make sure content ranking highly can fulfill user expectations. If you think you’ve been hit by Panda, Google gave 23 questions to answer questions if you were impacted on their Webmasters blog. Finally, Glenn recommends performing a crawl analysis and audit. Do a lens through the eyes of Panda looking for low-quality content. Phantom Glenn found and named the Phantom update, but mentioned that Google doesn’t like that name. There were five quality updates in Phantom since first discovered in Spring 2015. Some of the factors that go into Phantom include: Broken UI Deceptive ads Popups and interstitials Render issues Low-quality supplementary content Read Google’s quality rater guidelines to figure out what Google is looking for. Penguin First rolled out in April 2012, the Panda update targeted unnatural links and lead to a site-level demotion. With Penguin 4.0, there was a change from demotion to devaluing sites affected. Whereas Penguin 1.0 left the door open for negative SEO, 4.0 fixed that issue. However, questions still remain about using a disavow file. Glenn also stated that a high percentage of spammy links with exact brand name anchor text could be affected by Penguin. Finally, Glenn touched on the Google Mobile “popup algo” which was also mentioned by Maile at the beginning of the day. It is going to be rolled out on January 10, 2017.

In the future, there is a good chance all of Google’s algorithms will be powered by machine learning. Larry elaborated on what this could mean for SEO and how can brands prepare. Larry Kim, everyone. 🙌@larrykim #SEJSummit pic.twitter.com/LSpzPH5RR9 — Michelle Panzironi ♔ (@MichellePanziro) November 2, 2016 The future has a machine-learning base when it comes to search. Larry stated that Google is checking whether the intent of the user was satisfied or not. In his research, Larry has found that post titles with longtail search terms have a 3% increase in post engagement & show up higher in SERPs. Larry’s theory is this: High CTR listings and long tail keyword ranks get more attention from Rankbrain. That being said, Larry gave his tips on how SEOs can combat possible machine learning snafus. Look at Your Organic CTR Larry asked, What’s your organic CTR? To find it, go into search console, download query data under search analytics, download into excel, and then plot CTR versus average position plot. The middle line is expected CTR. Below the middle line, Larry calls them donkeys, above the middle line are unicorns. Larry has found that if you can convert donkeys to unicorns, you get 6x more engagement on average. To do this, you must improve your title tags. Avoid looking boring or spammy by making sure they aren’t basically dynamic keyword insertion for PPC. Larry recommends focusing on the format, content type, emotional hook, and topic to build viral content that gets a higher CTR. To create a unicorn title, create titles that are different from your content competitors. He recommended looking at broad match data. Broad match is the distant cousin of RankBrain learning. When writing titles, remember that the same emotions that make people share things are the same things that cause a higher CTR.

Mark’s session took a content marketing angle of SEO. He focused on three must-dos: Create content for listeners, sharers, and linkers Create 10x content for a 10x brand Create content with strategic links So excited to listen to @marktraphagen talk SEO content! #SEJSummit pic.twitter.com/47nUFuuvDH — Julia McCoy 📖 (@JuliaEMcCoy) November 2, 2016 Most content marketing strategies are sinking and traffic on a decline, but there’s no clear turnaround plan. No one knows what to do. Mark’s talk focused on actionable strategies to avoid this and to create a plan for progress. The best articles get a high read time and high social activity. However, Mark states that most content gets neither. One type of content Mark recommended was studies. Data-driven research studies WORK. Try creating studies as a content strategy to get links and exposure. He points out that creating studies that have results that go against expectations. This will generate more buzz, links, traffic. Create 10x Content Mark stated that very good content is not good enough anymore. Elite content is where you should focus. You must understand that your audience is likely early adopters and innovators. It’s important to create content for those who will listen, share, and link. To be successful, aim to be 10x better at your content than anyone else in your vertical. That being said, you must create content that makes people care about your brand. Know your brand identity and what uniqueness you bring to the content marketplace. Finally, Mark stresses that all your strategies must work together: SEO, content, and a unified brand message across all channels. Learn more from Mark in this Facebook Live video recap.

Keesa kicked off her presentation by stating, We desire association. People want to be part of a community. As people, we desire that others are aware of our needs. People want to know, Do you understand me and my needs today? Can you predict what I’ll need in the future? Keesa also stated that as people, we desire authenticity. To identify whether or not you are actually authentic with your customer, ask the following questions from their point of view: Do you want a relationship with me or just a sale? Do you spend time with me? Do you appreciate me? Are you ready to serve me? Consumers desire autheticity- can you deliver to this needier segment of your audience? Valuable content from @KeesaCamille #SEJSummit pic.twitter.com/YUALTpm5HV — Chris Boggs 🇺🇸 (@boggles) November 2, 2016 As marketers, we must go beyond the sale and understand who your customers are. By demonstrating your awareness of customers’ environment, future challenges, and victories, they will begin to feel connected to your brand. By authentically appreciating customers and your relationships with them, you can build loyalty and engagement. To close it out, Keesa called us all to think how can we serve, not how can we sell. Learn more about Keesa and how emotions play into SEO in this interview. Learn more from Keesa here on Slideshare: Inspired Marketing: How to Leverage Emotions in SEO by Keesa Schreane – #SEJSummit NY from Search Engine Journal Kristan Bauer Kristan Bauer is the Director of SEO for Zillow. She covered Grasping the “Why” Behind Local Search Search. Intent is elemental to local success. It’s important to understand how local communities search for your products can help sharpen your content creation and as a result drive your business forward. Kristan’s presentation focused on understanding your audience and to create meaningful content to enhance the search experience. She outlined the difference between local SEO and local search intent: Local SEO relies on local pack geo-location Local searcher intent is understanding how users search and means providing meaningful content about location-based search queries. Leverage user-generated content to best describe local products/businesses. Start With User Research Kristan urged us to develop a user-first approach. Consider your target audience and ask, What do people care about? Where are they present? What are their search patterns? Kristan stated that Google found that consumers conduct 88% of local searches on smartphone and 84% on a computer/tablet. When it comes to UGC, take topics and narrow them down to understand the search opportunities available. For instance, with Zillow, people are searching for schools in the areas they are considering buying a home in. Cash in on these opportunities by creating content that people are about, even though it’s not directly related to what you offer. (E.g. Zillow doesn’t show schools for sale or enrollment, but it knows that users are considering school districts when buying a home.) Local Content is so Much More than SEO There's more to local SEO than just regular content. #SEJSummit pic.twitter.com/sHR5SyfJ4A — SearchEngineJournal® (@sejournal) November 2, 2016 Is your content scaleable? Kristan told us there’s a difference between content that should be scaled and content that shouldn’t. Different content formats can complete different goals (conversion, education, etc).  Take a look at the above examples in the tweet to see what kind of content can be local content. Ensure That Your Content is Discoverable Consider the following to make sure your local content is as visible as possible: Internal linking XML sitemaps Crawlable Optimized SERP presence Performance and page speed Schema markup Consider mobile first Common mistakes in SEO when optimizing for local content: Slow content Not linked to Isn’t relevant Poor UX Not mobile friendly Content or links are loaded with client-side only No coordination with other marketing channels Once you have a strategy in place and launched, follow these steps to see if it made a difference: Monitor For Impact Benchmark pre-launch metrics Monitor User engagement Monitor traffic Understand search terms If we can provide users the best information along their search journey, this will lead to more brand engagement and traffic.

Very dishonest media!"  — Donald Trump on Sunday, October 30th, 2016 in a Tweet Trump says Twitter, Google, Facebook buried Clinton emails story By Lauren Carroll on Wednesday, November 2nd, 2016 at 5:08 p.m. Hillary Clinton is pushing her supporters to cast early ballots in key battleground states, as Donald Trump tries to make up ground with intensified attacks following the FBI's renewed examination of her email practices. (AP video, Nov. 1) Have you heard the news that the FBI is looking into new emails related to Hillary Clinton? If you haven’t, Donald Trump says it may be because social media companies are suppressing the news. "Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!" the Republican presidential candidate tweeted Oct. 30. Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2016 FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress Oct. 28 that said the FBI may have found new emails relevant to its probe into the private email server that Clinton used while secretary of state. The FBI plans to review these new emails to see if they contain classified information. There’s no evidence to support Trump’s claim that Twitter, Google and Facebook buried this story in the first couple days after it broke. We reached out to the Trump campaign for its evidence and received no response. Sure, the FBI story come out on a Friday, so it competed on social media with users’ upcoming Halloween plans, the World Series and other events. But the topic was certainly popular. Twitter Twitter doesn’t have an algorithm to highlight or suppress stories, said Jen Golbeck, a University of Maryland professor and social networks expert. In their feeds, users see everything posted by the people they follow. If Trump was referring to Twitter’s "moments" feature, the FBI story appears on an accessible archived screenshot of the "moments" homepage the evening before he tweeted his claim. The website Mashable took a screenshot of Twitter’s featured tweets, which Twitter displays when a logged-out user visits Twitter.com, around the time Trump tweeted. One of the top three featured tweets was about the FBI story. According to the Twitter trend-tracking website Hashtagify, #ClintonEmails, #Comey, and #FBI surged in popularity over the past week, especially since the story broke. Google Google can intentionally suppress topics by tweaking its algorithm, but the company denies that it does this in relation to the election. "It would have to be an intentional choice, and that's a big deal," Golbeck said. In any case, it does not appear Google is doing that in this case. For example, over the weekend of Oct. 28-30, the FBI was the top trending Google search topic.   And CNN’s Brian Stelter took a screenshot of Google News in the minutes after Trump tweeted his claim, and the FBI story was at the top of the list. Facebook Facebook is a bit harder to pin down. It does have the ability to suppress or highlight stories by altering its algorithm, though no one has produced evidence that this is something Facebook did with the FBI story. Further, Facebook tailors its trending topics based on the particular user’s interests. So the FBI story may not have appeared in one person’s trending topics bar, while appearing in another’s. While these companies probably don’t suppress certain stories, it’s hard to disprove a claim like Trump’s beyond a shadow of a doubt because there are so many ways social media sites could manipulate content visibility, said Kjerstin Thorson, a communications professor at Michigan State University.   "Did it appear on people’s trending box space on Facebook? How long was it there? Was it trending only for some people and not for others? Was the story made visible in people’s Facebook news feeds or Twitter streams or in Google search results, via each platform’s display algorithm?" Thorson said.  "Outside of internal company data, there is no source I know of who could check that." Our ruling Trump said, "Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!" Trump has not produced any evidence whatsoever to back up his claim, nor has anyone else. We found nothing to support the idea that the three tech and social media companies reduced the visibility of the latest developments in the Clinton email controversy. The burden is on Trump to produce information to support his statement. He’s offered none. Meanwhile, we’ve found plenty of evidence to contradict Trump’s claim. This claim rates False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/43b1a3fc-2ae2-4c51-9b6d-0f45b13d2d44 Advertisement About this statement: Published: Wednesday, November 2nd, 2016 at 5:08 p.m. Researched by: Lauren Carroll Edited by: Angie Drobnic Holan Subjects: Elections, Technology Sources: CNN, "Trump falsely says Google is 'burying' FBI news," Oct. 30, 2016 Hashtagify, search, conducted Oct. 31, 2016 Google Trends, explore feature, accessed Nov. 2, 2016 Mashable, "Donald Trump attacks Facebook, Google and Twitter as 'dishonest media'" Oct. 30, 2016 Zero Hedge, "Social Media Blackout?

Over half of our candidates make it to onsite. Navigation interviewing.io Blog Home Posts About Uncategorized You can’t fix diversity in tech without fixing the technical interview. Posted by Aline Lerner on November 2nd, 2016. In the last few months, several large players, including Google and Facebook, have released their latest and ultimately disappointing diversity numbers. Even with increased effort and resources poured into diversity hiring programs, Facebook’s headcount for women and people of color hasn’t really increased in the past 3 years. Google’s numbers have looked remarkably similar, and both players have yet to make significant impact in the space, despite a number of initiatives spanning everything from a points system rewarding recruiters for bringing in diverse candidates, to increased funding for tech education, to efforts to hire more diverse candidates in key leadership positions. Why have gains in diversity hiring been so lackluster across the board? Facebook justifies these disappointing numbers by citing the ubiquitous pipeline problem, namely that not enough people from underrepresented groups have access to the education and resources they need to be set up for success. And Google’s take appears to be similar, judging from what portion of their diversity-themed, forward-looking investments are focused on education. In addition to blaming the pipeline, since Facebook’s and Google’s announcements, a growing flurry of conversations have loudly waxed causal about the real reason diversity hiring efforts haven’t worked. These have included everything from how diversity training isn’t sticky enough, to how work environments remain exclusionary and thereby unappealing to diverse candidates, to improper calibration of performance reviews to not accounting for how marginalized groups actually respond to diversity-themed messaging. While we are excited that more resources are being allocated to education and inclusive workplaces, at interviewing.io, we posit another reason for why diversity hiring initiatives aren’t working. After drawing on data from thousands of technical interviews, it’s become clear to us that technical interviewing is a process whose results are nondeterministic and often arbitrary. We believe that technical interviewing is a broken process for everyone but that the flaws within the system hit underrepresented groups the hardest… because they haven’t had the chance to internalize just how much of technical interviewing is a numbers game. Getting a few interview invites here and there through increased diversity initiatives isn’t enough. It’s a beginning, but it’s not enough. It takes a lot of interviews to get used to the process and the format and to understand that the stuff you do in technical interviews isn’t actually the stuff you do at work every day. And it takes people in your social circle all going through the same experience, screwing up interviews here and there, and getting back on the horse to realize that poor performance in one interview isn’t predictive of whether you’ll be a good engineer. A brief history of technical interviewing A definitive work on the history of technical interviewing was surprisingly hard to find, but I was able to piece together a narrative by scouring books like How Would You Move Mount Fuji, Programming Interviews Exposed, and the bounty of the internets. The story goes something like this. Technical interviewing has its roots as far back as 1950s Palo Alto, at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories. Shockley’s interviewing methodology came out of a need to separate the innovative, rapidly moving, Cold War-fueled tech space from hiring approaches taken in more traditionally established, skills-based assembly-line based industry. And so, he relied on questions that could gauge analytical ability, intellect, and potential quickly. One canonical question in this category has to do with coins. You have 8 identical-looking coins, except one is lighter than the rest. Figure out which one it is with just two weighings on a pan balance. The techniques that Shockley developed were adapted by Microsoft during the 90s, as the first dot-com boom spurred an explosion in tech hiring. As with the constraints imposed by both the volume and the high analytical/adaptability bar imposed by Shockley, Microsoft, too, needed to vet people quickly for potential — as software engineering became increasingly complex over the course of the dot-com boom, it was no longer possible to have a few centralized “master programmers” manage the design and then delegate away the minutiae. Even rank and file developers needed to be able to produce under a variety of rapidly evolving conditions, where just mastery of specific skills wasn’t enough. The puzzle format, in particular, was easy to standardize because individual hiring managers didn’t have to come up with their own interview questions, and a company could quickly build up its own interchangeable question repository. This mentality also applied to the interview process itself — rather than having individual teams run their own processes and pipelines, it made much more sense to standardize things. This way, in addition to questions, you could effectively plug and play the interviewers themselves — any interviewer within your org could be quickly trained up and assigned to speak with any candidate, independent of prospective team. Puzzle questions were a good solution for this era for a different reason. Collaborative editing of documents didn’t become a thing until Google Docs’ launch in 2007. Without that capability, writing code in a phone interview was untenable — if you’ve ever tried to talk someone through how to code something up without at least a shared piece of paper in front of you, you know how painful it can be. In the absence of being able to write code in front of someone, the puzzle question was a decent proxy. Technology marched on, however, and its evolution made it possible to move from the proxy of puzzles to more concrete, coding-based interview questions. Around the same time, Google itself publicly overturned the efficacy of puzzle questions. So where does this leave us? Technical interviews are moving in the direction of more concreteness, but they are still very much a proxy for the day-to-day work that a software engineer actually does. The hope was that the proxy would be decent enough, but it was always understood that that’s what they were and that the cost-benefit of relying on a proxy worked out in cases where problem solving trumped specific skills and where the need for scale trumped everything else. As it happens, elevating problem-solving ability and the need for a scalable process are both eminently reasonable motivations. But here’s the unfortunate part: the second reason, namely the need for scalability, doesn’t apply in most cases. Very few companies are large enough to need plug and play interviewers. But coming up with interview questions and processes is really hard, so despite their differing needs, smaller companies often take their cues from the larger players, not realizing that companies like Google are successful at hiring because the work they do attracts an assembly line of smart, capable people… and that their success at hiring is often despite their hiring process and not because of it. So you end up with a de facto interviewing cargo cult, where smaller players blindly mimic the actions of their large counterparts and blindly hope for the same results. The worst part is that these results may not even be repeatable… for anyone. To show you what I mean, I’ll talk a bit about some data we collected at interviewing.io. Technical interviewing is broken for everybody Interview outcomes are kind of arbitrary interviewing.io is a platform where people can practice technical interviewing anonymously and, in the process, find jobs. Interviewers and interviewees meet in a collaborative coding environment and jump right into a technical interview question. After each interview, both sides rate one another, and interviewers rate interviewees on their technical ability. And the same interviewee can do multiple interviews, each of which is with a different interviewer and/or different company, and this opens the door for some interesting and somewhat controlled comparative analysis. We were curious to see how consistent the same interviewee’s performance was from interview to interview, so we dug into our data. After looking at thousands of interviews on the platform, we’ve discovered something alarming: interviewee performance from interview to interview varied quite a bit, even for people with a high average performance. In the graph below, every represents the mean technical score for an individual interviewee who has done 2 or more interviews on interviewing.io. The y-axis is standard deviation of performance, so the higher up you go, the more volatile interview performance becomes. As you can see, roughly 25% of interviewees are consistent in their performance, but the rest are all over the place. And over a third of people with a high mean (>=3) technical performance bombed at least one interview. Despite the noise, from the graph above, you can make some guesses about which people you’d want to interview. However, keep in mind that each person above represents a mean. Let’s pretend that, instead, you had to make a decision based on just one data point. That’s where things get dicey. Looking at this data, it’s not hard to see why technical interviewing is often perceived as a game. And, unfortunately, it’s a game where people often can’t tell how they’re doing. No one can tell how they’re doing I mentioned above that on interviewing.io, we collect post-interview feedback. In addition to asking interviewers how their candidates did, we also ask interviewees how they think they did. Comparing those numbers for each interview showed us something really surprising: people are terrible at gauging their own interview performance, and impostor syndrome is particularly prevalent. In fact, people underestimate their performance over twice as often as they overestimate it. Take a look at the graph below to see what I mean: Note that, in our data, impostor syndrome knows no gender or pedigree — it hits engineers on our platform across the board, regardless of who they are or where they come from. Now here’s the messed up part. During the feedback step that happens after each interview, we ask interviewees if they’d want to work with their interviewer. As it turns out, there’s a very strong relationship between whether people think they did well and whether they would indeed want to work with the interviewer — when people think they did poorly, even if they actually didn’t, they may be a lot less likely to want to work with you. And, by extension, it means that in every interview cycle, some portion of interviewees are losing interest in joining your company just because they didn’t think they did well, despite the fact that they actually did. As a result, companies are losing candidates from all walks of life because of a fundamental flaw in the process. Poor performances hit marginalized groups the hardest Though impostor syndrome appears to hit engineers from all walks of life, we’ve found that women get hit the hardest in the face of an actually poor performance. As we learned above, poor performances in technical interviewing happen to most people, even people who are generally very strong. However, when we looked at our data, we discovered that after a poor performance, women are 7 times more likely to stop practicing than men: A bevy of research appears to support confidence-based attrition as a very real cause for women departing from STEM fields, but I would expect that the implications of the attrition we witnessed extend beyond women to underrepresented groups, across the board. What the real problem is At the end of the day, because technical interviewing is indeed a game, like all games, it takes practice to improve. However, unless you’ve been socialized to expect and be prepared for the game-like aspect of the experience, it’s not something that you can necessarily intuit. And if you go into your interviews expecting them to be indicative of your aptitude at the job, which is, at the outset, not an unreasonable assumption, you will be crushed the first time you crash and burn. But the process isn’t a great or predictable indicator of your aptitude. And on top of that, you likely can’t tell how you’re doing even when you do well. These are issues that everyone who’s gone through the technical interviewing gauntlet has grappled with. But not everyone has the wherewithal or social support to realize that the process is imperfect and to stick with it. And the less people like you are involved, whether it’s because they’re not the same color as you or the same gender or because not a lot of people at your school study computer science or because you’re a dropout or for any number of other reasons, the less support or insider knowledge or 10,000 foot view of the situation you’ll have. Full stop. Inclusion and education isn’t enough To help remedy the lack of diversity in its headcount, Facebook has committed to three actionable steps on varying time frames. The first step revolves around creating a more inclusive interview/work environment for existing candidates. The other two are focused on addressing the perceived pipeline problem in tech: Short Term: Building a Diverse Slate of Candidates and an Inclusive Working Environment Medium Term: Supporting Students with an Interest in Tech Long Term: Creating Opportunity and Access Indeed, efforts to promote inclusiveness and increased funding for education are extremely noble, especially in the face of potentially not being able to see results for years in the case of the latter. However, both take a narrow view of the problem and both continue to funnel candidates into a broken system. Erica Baker really cuts to the heart of it in her blog post about Twitter hiring a head of D&I: “What irks me the most about this is that no company, Twitter or otherwise, should have a VP of Diversity and Inclusion. When the VP of Engineering… is thinking about hiring goals for the year, they are not going to concern themselves with the goals of the VP of Diversity and Inclusion. They are going to say ‘hiring more engineers is my job, worrying about the diversity of who I hire is the job of the VP of Diversity and Inclusion.’ When the VP of Diversity and Inclusion says ‘your org is looking a little homogenous, do something about it,’ the VP of Engineering won’t prioritize that because the VP of Engineering doesn’t report to the VP of Diversity and Inclusion, so knows there usually isn’t shit the VP of Diversity and Inclusion can do if the Eng org doesn’t see some improvement in diversity.” Indeed, this is sad, but true. When faced with a high-visibility conundrum like diversity hiring, a pragmatic and even reasonable reaction on any company’s part is to make a few high-profile hires and throw money at the problem. Then, it looks like you’re doing something, and spinning up a task force or a department or new set of titles is a lot easier than attempting to uproot the entire status quo. As such, we end up with a newly minted, well-funded department pumping a ton of resources into feeding people who’ve not yet learned about the interviewing being a game into a broken, nondeterministic machine of a process made further worse by the fact that said process favors confidence and persistence over bona fide ability… and where the link between success in navigating said process and subsequent on-the-job performance is tenuous at best. How to fix things In the evolution of the technical interview, we saw a gradual reduction in the need for proxies as companies as the technology to write code together remotely emerged; with its advent, abstract, largely arbitrary puzzle questions could start to be phased out. What’s the next step? Technology has the power to free us from relying on proxies, so that we can look at each individual as an indicative, unique bundle of performance-based data points. At interviewing.io, we make it possible to move away from proxies by looking at each interviewee as a collection of data points that tell a story, rather than one arbitrary glimpse of something they did once. But that’s not enough either. Interviews themselves need to continue to evolve. The process itself needs to be repeatable, predictive of aptitude at the actual job, and not a system to be gamed, where a huge benefit is incurred by knowing the rules. And the larger organizations whose processes act as a template for everyone else need to lead the charge. Only then can we really be welcoming to a truly diverse group of candidates.

Reply Define a set of minimum requirements for applicants. Take all applications that meet the minimum requirements, and roll a die to select the winner. AUTHOR kevino Posted on 7:16 am November 3, 2016. Reply Interesting article. One solution would be to have real programming problems that the applicant would solve on site. Each applicant will come to solve a small number of programming problems using a laptop that they bring with their favorite tools installed. The test would be done in a room with no internet access and would be monitored by someone that isn’t part of the interview team. It is a level playing field in the same way that candidates for a symphony orchestra are asked to play music behind a screen: those listening cannot see the candidate but hear what they can do. You still need face-to-face interviews to see if the person is a good fit for the group. I’d rather have a grade B programmer on the team who is a team player than have an A+ programmer who can’t get along with others.

Now, hire the most qualified person. Done. Tech is now fixed, again. I love all the millennials that think “tech” is a charity or some kind of make-work. I come from a time where the best person was hired, period. All employees respected each other because their skillset was respected and understood for time and effort it takes. I await the replies of non-developers to tell me how *-ist and *-phobic I am, as if the opinion of people who should never be in this profession matter to me. AUTHOR Stephanie Posted on 10:01 am November 4, 2016. Reply The entire article was about how the current process does not result in hiring the best candidate. Let all the resumes and coding challenges be anonymous – the hiring demographics would change. If you think you have no bias, you’re lying to yourself. AUTHOR Nicholas Bailey Posted on 9:11 pm November 2, 2016. Reply This is an excellent article and one I intend to route to everyone at my organization who participates I hiring. But… Processes that involve judging people based on limited information will always be gameable systems. Because we will always use proxies. More information and better approaches may mean better proxies, but proxies are as inevitable in interviews as they are in dating, voting, or any other choice. The key is to analyze our proxies and remove those that have a (intentional or accidental) racial or gender bias. No evaluation will be in gameable. The best we can hope for is to design an evaluation where it’s easier to win by getting good than by leaning the test AUTHOR ian douglas Posted on 2:02 pm November 2, 2016. Reply I really enjoyed this article and much of it resonates with me. As someone who has worked diligently to shape my interviewing and hiring practices over the years, my concern (regardless of D&I) is more around making an interview as stress-free as possible, than finding the perfect puzzle question to find only the smartest of the smart. This usually means having the candidate bring their own laptop to the interview and work on some of their own code, or pair programming so the candidate isn’t the only one writing code, as this is far more indicative of a typical work day. I’m curious how companies strike a balance, though: diversity and inclusion are certainly appropriate goals… however, many of the companies I’ve been fortunate to work within as a technical hiring manager or interview lead have not been large enough to “afford” a lesser candidate because of D&I numbers simply to boost numbers. Isn’t my responsibility to the company to hire the best engineers I can find to solve the problems we have to meet deadlines or customer/shareholder expectations? I don’t often have the luxury of taking several months to find some combination of smarts/diversity just to meet a D&I goal to bump a statistic. That said, I’ve hired plenty of people from widely diverse backgrounds, genders, nationalities, to fill a role who were also smart enough or had the exact hands-on skills required, but this feels far from the norm.

Google Engineer Says the Pixel Phone Is as Secure as the iPhone GO He also forecasts that Android will soon be better Nov 2, 2016 20:33 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  No electronic device is secure enough these days, even though companies invest quite a lot of money in security solutions meant to make their products impregnable to hacking. Security is also the main topic that Android and iOS fans usually like to debate. Many security experts claim Android OS is a mess when it comes to security, but Google took huge steps towards improving privacy and security on devices that run its mobile platform. The search giant now provides handset makers with monthly security updates that patch discovered bugs and issues that could be exploited if not addressed. On the other hand, the iOS ecosystem is more secure, but less customizable and open for developers. The bottom line is you can't have the best of both worlds yet, though Google claims that Android will soon have much more to offer than Apple's iOS. During an interview after a talk at a security conference, Adrian Ludwig, director of security at Android, said that “for sure” a Google Pixel and an iPhone are about the same when it comes to security. He went on to say that Android will soon be better, though: “In the long term, the open ecosystem of Android is going to put it in a much better place.” Safety Net limits the number of infected Android devices to less than 1% According to Ludwig, Android's built-in security solution called “Safety Net” is now scanning 400 million devices per day. Moreover, the product can check no less than 6 billion apps per day, which is quite an achievement. Thanks to “Safety Net,” the number of Android devices that have malware is very small nowadays, Ludwig claims. According to him, less than 1% of Android smartphones are affected by PHA (Potentially Harmful Applications), which is hard to believe though. One other piece of good news that Ludwig was kind to share is that Android is now secure enough that it's close to impossible for someone to target a large number of people with malware at the same time. #Android patch#Android OS security#iOS security#Apple iOS#Android malware subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Bootloader on Google Pixel Phone Sold Through Verizon Has Been Unlocked Pixel and Pixel XL Sold Through Google Store Will Be Rootable Pixel Phones Bought from Verizon and Google to Get Updates Simultaneously Verizon to Handle System Updates on Pixel Phones, While Google Security Updates OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE Salix Xfce 14.2 Live Edition Released, It's Based on Xfce 4.12 & Slackware 14.2    Android rain new android apps Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   LG G5 Starts Receiving Android 7.0 Nougat Update more on: LG G5 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Tech giant, Google, has unveiled a smart messaging application to take on WhatsApp and Telegram. SHARE THIS STORY Tweet The new app comes with a myriad of features that include the Google Assistant-preview edition, stickers and emojis that can be enlarged. Allo borrows from Snapchat with its incognito mode that sends a chat with an end-to-end encryption. Incognito chat helps the user to keep conversation with friends more discreet as chats comes with an expiry period. The app aims to distinguish itself from others by employing smart features. For instance, its smart reply uses the user’s personality to keep conversations going by suggesting text and emoji responses. Smart messaging “Allo app is the future of smart messaging, it brings so many features in one platform something that makes conversations fun,” said Dorothy Ooko, Google’s communications and public affairs manager for East and Francophone Africa. The app also makes it possible for users to adjust the size of their text especially when they are emphasizing a point without using capital letters. It also allows users to get creative with photographs where they can add text on them, draw a smiley face, turn friends into meme or just add colour. The stickers’ option is meant to make conversations fun or expressive especially when words are not enough. Google Assistant on the other hand will help out when the Allo user is trying to find about restaurants nearby, or when getting directions right in the conversation. “Find videos to share, get directions, and seek answers together with your friends. Just add @google, and your Assistant is ready to help.” The app also allows Allo users to chat with Google assistant where one can find out about personal itinerary. For instance, how far one is from the airport and regarding when the flight leaves. The Allo app is a closed shop, meaning that it can only be used between users who have installed it. The tech firm previously unveiled Google Hangouts and Messenger app which have so far failed to impress the market.

The group, which was previously tied to Russia’s best intelligence agency by other cybersecurity firms, were exploiting a bug recently discovered by Google, Microsoft said. Google revealed on Monday a critical bug in Microsoft Windows software that could give hackers full control of your computer. Microsoft has since announced plans to release a fix on Tuesday, November 8. Google’s security team said it first discovered “zero day” bugs in Adobe and Microsoft software on October 21. “Zero day” is the term for unique, never-before-seen vulnerabilities that are dangerous because they’re live. Adobe addressed the bug with an update to its Adobe Flash Player on October 26, five days after it was first notified by Google. Microsoft, however, had yet to issue a fix, so Google went public with the bug on Monday. Microsoft contested the seriousness of the bug on Tuesday morning, saying Adobe’s fix is sufficient. “We disagree with Google’s characterization … as ‘critical’ and ‘particularly serious,’ since the attack scenario they describe is fully mitigated by the deployment of the Adobe Flash update released last week,” according to a Microsoft statement sent to CNNMoney. But some experts believe the bug could still be exploited while users wait for a Microsoft update. “The bug could be used as part of a larger attack to take control of the entire system,” security researcher Katie Moussouris, CEO of Luta Security, told CNNMoney. Microsoft has criticized Google’s public reporting of the bug. “Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” reads a blog post from Terry Myerson, EVP of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices Group. Google’s security team is set up to search for exploits quietly lurking on the internet. It typically recommends companies fix security issues within 60 days, but in 2013, it announced a more aggressive, expedited disclosure policy for urgent requests. That gave Microsoft just seven days to come up with a fix. Microsoft said the bug was never effective in its Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which launched in August, due to security enhancements. The company unveiled its next-generation Windows software, called Windows 10 Creator Update, less than a week ago. For now, Microsoft users should ensure auto updates are turned on for Flash, Windows and Antivirus software. It’s also recommended to run Google’s Chrome browser, which prevents the bug from being exploited, according to Moussouris.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps BREAKING NEWS Live updates: Yesterday, you couldn't come to town, today you can't leave. Chaos in capital ... read more Hovering aircraft raises suspicion that it's Google co-founder's flying car ETHAN BARON Last updated 08:56, November 3 2016 Reuters Zee.Aero is one of two reportedly funded by Google co-founder Larry Page to develop revolutionary forms of transportation. Even from a few hundred metres away, the aircraft made a noise strikingly different from the roar of a typical plane. "It sounded like an electric motor running, just a high-pitched whine," said Steve Eggleston, assistant manager at an airplane-parts company with offices bordering the Hollister Municipal Airport. But it wasn't only the sound that caught the attention of Eggleston and his co-workers at DK Turbines. It was what the aircraft was doing. "What the heck's that?" saleswoman Brittany Rodriguez thought to herself. "It's just hovering." That, apparently, was a flying car, or perhaps a prototype of another sort of aircraft under development by a mysterious startup called Zee.Aero. The company, one of two reportedly funded by Google co-founder Larry Page to develop revolutionary forms of transportation, has set up shop in rural Hollister, far from its headquarters and the prying eyes of tech-obsessed Silicon Valley. The secretive company, in its quest for privacy, has found allies in the small San Benito County town. "Can I help you?" a woman from the airport's administration office said, after popping out to investigate when a reporter and photographer came looking for staff at the Zee.Aero building next door. "They're not here," she said curtly. Asked when they were typically around, she snapped, "That's private." In Hollister, population 40,000, the first rule about Zee.Aero is you don't talk about Zee.Aero. Ad Feedback "It was known they wanted their privacy," said Hollister mayor Ignacio Velazquez, who declined to provide much information about Zee.Aero and its plans. "I just believe in people's privacy." For a while, staff at one airport business said, a guard was posted outside the Zee.Aero building, telling people who approached too closely to back off. The company has issued no public statements about its work. Bloomberg in June reported that Page had invested more than US$100 million in the startup but had tried to keep his involvement secret. Zee.Aero's sparse website refers to "a revolutionary new form of transportation".  In a May letter to the US Department of Transportation, the firm said it was building "an entirely new aircraft that will change personal aviation". A Zee.Aero patent issued in 2013 describes in some detail an aircraft capable of the hovering seen by people working at the airport. And the drawings showcase a vision of the future in which flying cars park in lots just like their terrestrial, less-evolved cousins. Zee.Aero envisions our means of escape from the bounds of gravity as "safe, quiet, and efficient, as well as easy to control, (and) highly compact," according to the patent submission from Ilan Kroo, a Stanford University professor of aeronautics and Zee.Aero's founding chief executive and principal scientist. Kroo brought in more than 100 aerospace engineers to work on the flying cars, according to his LinkedIn profile. The patent depicts a car-sized aircraft, wings at the nose and tail, and along the top eight propellers, driven by eight motors, for vertical lift. Two other propellers on the rear wing would provide forward thrust. The aircraft seen at the Hollister airport appears to showcase a change in design but retains some features described and shown in the patent. Last week, an aircraft was spotted being towed down the runway on two consecutive days, although no hovering or flying was observed by witnesses. Dual propellers in the rear fit with the description and drawings from the patent, but the aircraft appeared to have a single main wing, with pod-like structures beneath it, rather than the smaller wings at the front and rear shown in the drawings. The means for vertical takeoff were not visible from a distance, but Eggleston and his colleagues said this was the same craft they'd seen hovering. During both Zee.Aero flights witnessed by DK Turbines staff from several hundred yards away in September and October, the aircraft hovered about 8m off the ground, and landed rapidly, straight down, according to the witnesses.  - MCT Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: The next iPhone could have these three features Technology Homepage technology headlines Consumer drone market slumps Review: Watch Dogs 2 Where did you go Kendall?

And there's a big product launch for Snap Inc. this fall. In fact, it could be worth billions of dollars. Here's what you need to know… Snapchat Spectacles Release On Sept. 23, Snap released its first hardware product, "Snapchat Spectacles." And this could end up being a major catalyst for Snapchat stock. According to The Wall Street Journal, the sunglasses will have a button you can tap to take 10-second videos. CEO Evan Spiegel believes the images recorded on Spectacles are fundamentally different than regular smartphone cameras, according to WSJ. He says Spectacles' camera uses a 115-degree-angle lens, which is wider than a typical smartphone camera. He also noted the video will appear more like direct human vision. Having a camera on the glasses will also free up users' hands, allowing them to capture a moment more easily. Users can shoot videos of more natural first-person viewpoints like when they are at concerts. The videos will sync wirelessly to a smartphone, which will be a huge selling point. The glasses will come in three different colors (black, teal, and coral) and will retail for $129.99. According to CNET, the glasses will charge in their case. There is no set release date for Spectacles, but they will launch in the fall, according to WSJ. While it's true other first-person camera products have struggled, like GoPro Inc. (Nasdaq: GPRO) and Google Glass from Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Snap seems to have learned from their mistakes. Unlike the original GoPros, Snapchat will make loading videos seamless. Spectacle owners will not have to have a memory card, put it in their computer, wait for the video to download, and then finally be able to post it. They can just click a button and upload the video to their Snapchat account. Don't Miss: A Special Profit Opportunity with Only Days Left to Get the Details And unlike Google Glass, Spectacles have a more appealing, every-day look. Google Glass was criticized for having a too futuristic design that wasn't enticing to wear on a daily basis. Google also doesn't have a social media outlet as in demand for sharing pictures and videos as Snapchat. But why exactly are $129 glasses an important Snapchat stock update? More importantly, how can Spectacles generate billions of dollars for Snapchat? You see, Snapchat could use Spectacles to enter two growing markets. And it allows Snap to become more than just a social media company. Here's everything you need to know about how Snapchat can make billions from these emerging sectors… Snapchat Stock Update: Why Spectacles Is a Billion-Dollar Idea Join the conversation.

Well, not exactly all of us, but certainly most of us. Although Hotmail was the first to introduce us to the concept of E-mail and it, along with veterans Yahoo! and AoL dominated the E-mail scene for quite some time. Then Google’s E-mail service debuted in 2004, and took the competition by storm. With innovative features like offering 1GB storage space (that has been expanding ever since, and has crossed 10GB), in built A/V chat, labels instead of filters and stuff like that, Gmail quickly started ascending to the top spot amongst free E-mail providers and a while back, took over the competition as the free E-mail service with the largest user base. But that was in the past. It might sound blunt, but in its current form, I find Gmail to be utterly ugly and slow as a snail. And it’s not just the interface. The reasons are practically unlimited. Google’s blatant intrusion of users’ privacy by reading their e-mails to serve targeted ads in the Webmail UI, constant redesigning of the interface (with the most recent being that horrid compose box), upgrading a perfectly nice chat to those worthless hangouts, pestering users to make a Google+ profile, I could go on and on. Sponsored Links Now, I understand that there are alternatives you could use. At least I never use Gmail for serious correspondences. It’s rather an account that I maintain for just meaningless signups and newsletters. And even though for the majority of users, alternatives like Yahoo!, AoL and the recently redesigned Outlook are more than sufficient, who doesn’t like to try something new. So beginning in this post, I’ll be introducing you to some of the lesser known but very good E-mail services that you might haven’t heard about. Some of them are non US based, and even have non US interfaces. But that can be easily got around with (ironically) Google Translate. So, ready to know about them and try something new instead of that ever boring G-mail? Read on!! Note: While this article just introduces some of those E-mail services, I’ll be reviewing some more in later articles of this series, as it’s not possible to detail all of them in a single article. I’ll also be reviewing some of them in detail at ILFS, some time later. 1.) Zoho Mail This is an amazing free webmail service that stands out with a distinct feature. It has absolutely no ads in the interface, not even in the FREE version. That’s right, no ads in the Free Version. Although there are three service levels with the free service offering 5 GB storage space, and the paid ones going from 10 GB to 15 GB, the free service level is going to serve majority of E-mail users just fine. What’s more, it features the highly acclaimed Zoho Docs online office suite, that beats Google Docs in every way fathomable. You can create Documents, Spreadsheets, Presentations and collaborate on them with other users. UNIQUE FEATURES: No ADS in the Webmail UI, not even in the free version Labels and Filters, just as in Gmail Full Zoho Docs Office Suite with Collaboration capabilities Tabbed view 2.) My Opera Mail A free E-mail service provided by Opera Software of Norway, My Opera Mail offers you 3 GB of storage space that is bound to expand in future. The standout feature of My Opera Mail is that it is “LIGHTNING FAST” and loads almost instantly. And just like Zoho Mail, it has no ads in the interface either. Basically, this My opera Mail is part of a My opera account that you have to create, which is something like a blogging platform, but you don’t have to blog anything. Just create a My opera account and enjoy blazing fast E-mail UNIQUE FEATURES: No ADS in the Webmail UI Ability to Pin Important Conversations at the top Supports Creation of Folders Multiple Account POP Fetcher 3.) Yandex Mail Now this is something unique. Yandex is a free E-mail service provided by Yandex.Ru, the Russian company that operates the largest search engine in Russia (Take that Google!!). Now you might be thinking, this might be a Russian language service, but no, Yandex Mail offers features like unlimited storage, labels, Mail Fetcher, 3 GB Cloud Storage (stretching up to 10 GB) and more, in good ol’ English language. And did I mention, just like the previous services, it has absolutely no ADS in the interface. UNIQUE FEATURES: No ADS in the Webmail UI Supports Labels & Filters Built in 3 GB Cloud storage (expandable up to 10 GB) Multiple Account POP Fetcher Audio Alerts for new E-mails Conclusion While it’s true that most E-mail users are content having one amongst the well known trio of Outlook, Yahoo and Gmail as their primary E-mailing service, there are very good alternatives that are existent now. And they offer truly amazing E-mail experience, you just need to be willing to give them a try. The above three E-mail services are just the beginning. In the subsequent parts of this article based series, I’ll be introducing to you a lot more great E-mail service providers. What do you think about these free E-mail service providers? Do you use any of them already? And if you haven’t yet had a chance to use them, do take a look at them now. Do let me know what you think in the comments.

Love to see your response. Hemal I use ZOHO from years,….. Its THE BEST . . Eastwind 7 While the Yandex format is attractive and seems functional, I have security concerns.

 Here’s how close AI is to beating humans in different games Gus Lubin Nov. 2, 2016, 2:57 PM 5,579 facebook linkedin twitter email print Humans can still win at "StarCraft" and games like it. AP Photo/David Goldman Two decades after Deep Blue conquered chess and a year after AlphaGo took down go, there are still games that artificial intelligence can’t beat. AI researchers like games because they offer complex, concrete, and exciting challenges, which can unlock broader applications. Take it from AlphaGo creator Demis Hassabis: Games "are useful as a testbed, a platform for trying to write our algorithmic ideas and testing out how far they scale and how well they do and it’s just a very efficient way of doing that. Ultimately we want to apply this to big real-world problems." How close is AI to beating different games? We asked a couple of experts for an update. "StarCraft" is the next big target After Google’s AlphaGo defeated grandmaster Lee Se-dol in go — that deceptively simple game of black and white stones with an immense number of possibilities — Hassabis called "Starcraft" "the next step up." Google engineer Jeff Dean, who leads the Google Brain project, went further: "'StarCraft' is our likely next target." "Starcraft," released in 1998 by Blizzard Entertainment, is a real-time strategy game where players build a military base, mine resources, and attack other bases. It has become a focus for AI researchers for a few reasons: it’s highly complex, with players making high-level strategic decisions while controlling hundreds of agents and making countless quick decisions. It’s popular, as the first major esports game and practically the national sport of South Korea in the 2000s. It also has a relatively big research community with annual AI competitions dating back to 2010, a publicly accessible programming interface, even support from Blizzard. Despite all this attention, the best "StarCraft" bots can easily be beaten by top humans. The bots tend to be good at low-level unit interactions but bad at high-level strategy, especially when it comes to adapting that strategy on the fly. They may also make dumb mistakes. "There is progress, but it’s maybe a little bit underwhelming," says Julian Togelius, the co-director of the NYU Game Innovation Lab.Human player Djem5 destroyed bot tscmoo in this 2015 match after finding an undefended base.AIIDE This has a lot to do with the type of people building "StarCraft" bots. Brilliant though they may be, they tend to be solo hobbiests who have nowhere near the resources of large companies. That could be changing. In addition to Google’s hinted interest, Facebook and Microsoft researchers have published papers involving "StarCraft." "With the increased attention that "StarCraft" AI is getting from large companies, if they do end up spending time and money on this problem, this will accelerate progress dramatically," says David Churchill, a professor of computer science at the Memorial University of Newfoundland who runs the "StarCraft" AI tournament. Even if big companies do get involved, beating "StarCraft" will require breakthroughs we haven’t seen before. Deep learning — the seemingly miraculous technique of feeding computers extremely large sets of data and letting them find patterns — was central to Google solving "Breakout" and other simple games; it helped Facebook understand "StarCraft" combat; and it played a significant role in cracking go. And yet … "I have a feeling this is not going to work so well for "StarCraft," Togelius says. "You need planning to play this complicated game, and these algorithms, deep nets, are not very suited to it." Some games are hard, some are easy While "StarCraft" is the white whale, plenty of videos games present their own AI challenge. Turn-based strategy games like "Civilization" require similar strategic decisions, often with more long-term planning, but less rapid unit control. "We don’t have very strong playing 'Civilization' agents but they haven’t done that much work into it," Togelius says. "In my opinion, a game like 'Civilization' would be strictly easier for AI to beat than a game like 'StarCraft,'" Churchill says. Can bots play "Civilization" better than humans? Ominous question. 2K Games/Firaxis What about "League of Legends," the popular game where players control single heroes in complex team battles? "I have talked to certain people who think that it would be really easy to make a 'League of Legends' AI that could beat the world champions, but I don’t necessarily agree," Churchill says. "It would be easier than 'StarCraft' in the sense that you don’t have so many different levels of control, but you’d still have the issue of teamwork, which is very complex," Togelius says. Can bots win at "League of Legends"? YouTube/Riot "FIFA" and other sports games could be difficult, too. As with "StarCraft," they require control of an extremely high number of variables. "You have 11 players, and if you say each player can do one of 4 different things, then your number of possible actions is four to the power of 11 — which is about 4 million," Togelius says. For comparison, he notes, chess players choose from around 35 possible moves every term, go players from around 300. For first-person shooters like "Call of Duty" and "Halo," being able to program a bot with perfect aim is a huge advantage. "Some people think if you have perfect aim, then AI will never lose," Churchill says. "But others say there are strategic elements of the game that can overcome perfect aim." Fighting games like "Street Fighter" are relatively easy for bots. "Unfortunately I think too much of the challenge is in having fast reactions, and you can have arbitrarily fast reactions if you are a computer," Togelius says. Platformers are relatively easy too. For instance: "’Super Mario Bros’ is essentially solved, at least for linear levels," Togelius wrote in an email. This 2009 AI was able to crush "Super Mario Bros" (red lines show paths being evaluated). Robin Baumgarten Role-playing games can be tricky. "Skyrim" requires "understanding narrative" and "a wide variety of cognitive skills," Togelius writes online. As for card games — remember those? — they still pose some interesting questions. Two-person limit Texas Hold’em has been solved, but group games and unlimited betting options are still a problem. In Bridge, bots haven’t mastered deceptive play, bidding, or reading opponents and still can’t beat the world champions. The playful linguistics of crossword puzzles are a challenge as well. And we’re not even getting into robotics (Cristiano Ronaldo is way better than robots at soccer). The ultimate challenge is general game AI A few years ago, Togelius noticed a problem with video game AI competitions. People inevitably start programming bots with extensive human-knowledge about how to beat a game, rather than focusing on true artificial intelligence. "People submit more and more domain-specific bots — in the car-racing competition you had people submitting bots that started hard-coding elements of tracks and cars and so on — and the actual AI part gets relegated to smaller and smaller roles," Togelius says. It was this frustration that led him to start the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) competition in 2014. In this competition, players submit bots that compete in an unknown set of ten simple games. To win, the bots have to be flexible and adaptable — something closer to humans. "General intelligence is not the capacity to do one thing, it’s the capacity to do almost anything you’re faced with," Togelius said. For now, the bots in GVGAI aren’t great. "On most games, [they are] not human-level," Togelius says. "On fairly simple shooters, such as 'Space Invaders, you have bots that are better than humans, but on things that require long-term planning, they are often considerably under human level." Give them time. Togelius says interest in the competition is growing fast. Notably, one of its sponsors is Deepmind, the Google subsidiary behind AlphaGo.  "Space Invaders" is easy for bots. Midway Human-machine teams could be the future As humans are surpassed in game after game, we can hold onto one reassuring fact: centaurs could do better than humans or computers. Centaurs, a term for human-machine pairings taken from the mythological creature that was half-human-half-horse, have already proven more effective than humans or computers at chess (at least when given enough time, at least for now). "The human uses his or her intuition and ideas about what to do and ideas about long-term strategies and uses the computer to verify the various things and to do simulations," Togelius says. A similar pattern might hold true in "StarCraft"— and beyond. "I could very much imagine a future where we have centaur teams in 'StarCraft,' where you have a human making high-level decisions and various AI agents at different levels executive them," Togelius says. "That is also how I imagine the place AI technologies will more and more take in our society." Other people have drawn similar conclusions. Togelius pointed to roboticist Rodney Brooks, who predicts in the classic book "Flesh and Machines" that future humans "will have the best that machineness has to offer, but we will also have our bioheritage to augment whatever level of machine technology we have so far developed."  SEE ALSO: This helpful charts reveals if a robot will take your job DON'T MISS: How Netflix will soon predict exactly what you want to watch NOW WATCH: How to choose the best cut of steak — according to Anthony Bourdain Loading video...

By Conner Forrest | November 2, 2016, 11:01 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Lenovo Google's Project Tango, the company's 3D mapping and augmented reality technology, will now be available to the public through the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. Google first announced the phone back in June 2016, but unveiled the availability of the device in a blog post on Tuesday. According to Google's post, the Lenovo Phab 2 uses the new tech to "give apps new augmented reality capabilities." The phone is available now on Lenovo's website, starting at $499. At the time of this writing, there are more than 35 Tango-supported apps, which can be found in the Tango app itself, or in the Google Play store. Currently, most of the options are for gaming or consumer applications. Project Tango made its debut in 2014, when Google showed off the technology on a smartphone. At the time, Google said that the purpose of the device was to "track the full 3D motion of the device, while simultaneously creating a map of the environment." SEE: Qualcomm expands support for Google's Tango AR platform to Snapdragon 820 (ZDNet) While the Tango phone began as a limited-release testing project, the technology eventually came to a tablet for developers in the summer of 2014. Roughly a year later the tablet's price was cut in half and the device was opened up for sale without an invite. In January, at the 2016 CES in Las Vegas, Google announced that it would be partnering with Lenovo to produce a commercially-available Tango smartphone. The company also announced the creation of an incubator program for submission of apps that use the technology. In June of that year, Google and Lenovo first unveiled the Phab 2 Pro.

Outside of the AR games it works with, there is also a tool to measure furniture, for example. The phone itself is available in Gunmetal Grey or Champagne Gold, and includes the multiple cameras needed to make an AR map of an environment. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor is optimized for the Tango technology, and the Phab 2 has 64GB of storage. It also has a 6.4-inch assertive display. Google has demonstrated that it plans to continue to invest in hardware, with the recent release of the Pixel phone as a prime example. The new Lenovo Phab 2 Pro shows that the company is still willing to experiment with smaller-scale moonshots as well. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro is available now. It's unclear whether or not Google will open up the Tango project to other vendors. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers The first Google Tango smartphone, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, is available to the public now. Despite its potential for useful tools and features, Google seems to be targeting the AR gaming market with Tango.

Spear phishing involves tricking people with personally crafted e-mail messages that get them to click on links or files booby-trapped with malicious code that infects machines, letting hackers steal information or take control. The vulnerability exposed this week let hackers slip into computers through Web browsing software, eventually installing “back doors” through which they could enter as they please. Strontium, given an array of names by cyber-security researchers, has been described as a sophisticated hacking operation with ties to Russia. The group has also been suspected of involvement in hacks of political parties in the US presidential race. In a threat report, Microsoft described Strontium as having the markings of being backed by a nation state, but did not conclude which one. However, the US technology titan did take aim at Google, saying that a “responsible” member of the industry would have put users first and waited for a patch to be ready before making the vulnerability public. “Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” Mr. Myerson said. Google countered that it gave Microsoft seven days to fix the flaw, as per its policy regarding critical flaws, before making it public on Monday. “This vulnerability is particularly serious because we know it is being actively exploited,” Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard of the Google threat analysis group said in an online post. Google said it told Microsoft and Adobe about the vulnerabilities on Oct. 21, and an update to Flash addressing the weakness was released five days later. Microsoft said people using the Edge browser on fully updated Windows 10 operating systems should be protected from the attack. “We have coordinated with Google and Adobe to investigate this malicious campaign and to create a patch for down-level versions of Windows,” Mr. Myerson said. Adobe Patches for Windows are being tested and Microsoft planned to released them on Nov. 8. A Microsoft threat report described Strontium as a group that usually targets government agencies, diplomatic institutions and military organizations, as well as affiliated private sector organizations such as defense contractors and public policy research institutes. -- AFP    MORE STORIES Making cities smarter in the Philippines using location-based data on cloud computing GoPro announces recall of 2,500 Karma drones Review: "Sony Xperia XZ Great camera, excellent display" Homegrown social app helps users meet people with similar interests Russia-linked hackers exploit flaw in Windows LG releases new phone Japan rocket with manga art takes off Instagram getting into shopping Opinion: "Shadows behind the Internet" Video review: Vivo Y55 © 2016 BusinessWorld Publishing Corporation.

SUBSCRIBE Uncover hidden potential in your paid search and shopping campaigns In this helpful how-to piece, columnist Andreas Reiffen explains how to find anomalies in your paid search campaigns and address them for improved performance. Andreas Reiffen on November 2, 2016 at 11:15 am More In search marketing, we’re always trying to get that little bit of extra performance out of our paid campaigns. But what do you do when you’ve optimized your bids, tested (and improved) your ad copy and refined your target URLs? To uncover the hidden potential in your campaigns, you need to identify and assess anomalies — those areas which perform well in general, but not in your paid search campaigns. For example, if a particular top-selling product category is doing poorly in your paid search campaign, something has probably gone wrong. Identifying and fixing these issues will help you get much better performance out of your paid search campaigns. In this article, we’ll walk you through the process of identifying anomalies in your search campaigns. You can also use a similar methodology to get more from your Google Shopping campaigns. How to find anomalies using search query analysis In order to find anomalies, you have to have a benchmark for how well you expect your search campaigns to perform. Since search (text ad) performance is driven by keywords, while shopping (product listing ad) is driven by products, and your overall e-commerce performance is driven by a multitude of marketing activities and ad formats, you need a common denominator to compare performance and gain actionable insights. We recommend that you use search queries to benchmark your search campaigns against Google Shopping, organic traffic and on-site search. Where to get the data Before doing any comparisons or analyses, you’ll need to pull all the search queries, including the related performance data, for each of the areas you want to compare. For search and shopping, use: the search query reports in AdWords; the organic queries you (partly) get through Google Analytics; and on-site keyword performance that is available through your preferred web analytics system. Preparing the data for analysis In order to get actionable insights out of your data, you’ll have to aggregate performance by something we call “semantic attributes.” Semantic attributes could be product category (e.g., shoes, sandals), designer (e.g., Nike, Adidas) gender (men, women, boys, girls), material (e.g., leather) or anything else that regularly occurs in keywords and is relevant to your business. A good place to start is usually “product category” and “brand.” As a preliminary result, you need a spreadsheet which looks like this: Next, you’ll need to drill down to a slightly more granular level. For example, if you’re looking at the “shoe” category, you’ll want to look at each of the relevant subcategories, such as boots, sandals, pumps and so forth. The outcome of this step will look like this: While doing this for some categories (such as “dresses”) is quite easy, filtering out all relevant subcategories for “shoes” is more complicated and can be time-consuming if you are not using a tool to support this analysis. To save time, we recommend choosing the five most important subcategories for each category you want to compare and looking at search terms containing those. This will give you a good indication of that category’s performance. Visualizing your data in a chart will also give you a nice visual representation of where the anomalies are hiding. This one shows the weekly revenue by category and channel in thousands ($): Finding and fixing the problem Once you have identified where the anomalies are, finding the problem and fixing it is quick and easy. There are only a few common reasons why you might see such a huge difference in performance between your shopping and text ads. Important keywords are missing If you notice that a particular Semantic Attribute of your products (designer, category, color, gender and so on) performs well in Google Shopping, but not in Search, it’s usually because you’re missing a few important keywords. Search traffic is obviously highly reliant on your keyword portfolio, so if you haven’t uploaded enough of the relevant keywords, you won’t see as much search traffic as you’d expect. To fix this, simply go into your spreadsheet, take all queries which are performing well anywhere else and add them to your search campaigns. Bids are too low If your keywords don’t work well during a certain time frame, most bid management tools will price them down until the bids are far too low for the keyword to receive any impressions. This is particularly problematic with seasonal keywords (e.g., winter- or summer-related terms). Reducing bids on these keywords can harm your performance once the season returns. To figure out whether too-low bids are responsible for the weak search performance, compare your costs per click between the search and shopping campaign for that semantic attribute. To fix the issue, all you have to do is raise the minimum bid for that keyword. Vague ad copy One ad can’t sell both laptops and leather bags. But if your ad groups are too large, that may be exactly what’s happening. If the same ad is trying to sell a wide range of products, it will have to be very generic. That kind of vague ad copy leads to weak Quality Scores and thus low positions. This problem is very easy, if time-consuming, to fix. You’ll need to export your ad groups and assign your keywords to smaller, more homogeneous groups. Then you’ll have to write more targeted ad copy that better reflects what the user is searching for. Broken links or no deep linking It can take Google quite awhile to get around to detecting changes in your URLs. So if your shop’s URL structure has changed but your links haven’t, Google might be coming up with a 404 and disapproving your ad. Another, rarer, reason for weak performance could be a lack of deep linking — meaning if someone searches for “mcqueen leather clutch,” you want him/her to land on a page that sells that clutch, not on a generic home page. Fixing these issues could be a matter of resolving any 404 errors. Once you’ve done that, take a closer look at each semantic attribute you identified and check the associated landing page to make sure it fits with those keywords — starting with the one that has the highest traffic volume. The hidden potential is worth the effort If you feel you’ve hit a performance wall with your search campaigns after following all the common optimization techniques, this methodology of finding and solving campaign anomalies will help you take your search campaigns to the next level. The process of finding these anomalies — if not automated — can be time-consuming, but the payoffs will be well worth it. Ideally, you should be checking for anomalies at least once a month, so it’s certainly worth investing the time to either build an Excel macro or choose a tool that can automate the job for you.

SUBSCRIBE Opinion: Google is biased toward reputation-damaging content Why does reputation-damaging content seem to appear so quickly in Google’s search results? Columnist Chris Silver Smith outlines his theory on why Google's algorithm can give negative content greater ranking ability than it deserves. Chris Silver Smith on November 1, 2016 at 12:13 pm More If you or your company have seen something that harms your reputation abruptly appear in Google’s search results, you may be wondering how and why something negative could appear so fast, and how it gained against longer-established materials. It’s pretty simple, though: Google’s algorithm likes it better. Let me explain. First of all, Google has worked very hard to interpret user intent when searches are conducted. It’s not easy to fathom what people may be seeking when they submit a keyword or a keyword phrase. When someone searches for “pizza,” for instance, Google may assume that most of the time people are seeking local pizza providers, so it provides Map Search results of local pizza restaurants, personalized to the locality of the searcher. But it also provides links to pages from nationwide pizza websites that deliver, as well as lists of top area pizza places, the Wikipedia article for pizza — and more. Since Google cannot always divine a specific intention when a user submits a search query, it’s evolved to using something of a scattergun approach — it tries to provide a variety of the most likely sorts of things that people are generally seeking when submitting those keywords. When this is the name of a business or a person, Google commonly returns things like the official website of the subject, resumes, directory pages, profiles, business reviews and social media profiles. Part of the search results variety Google tries to present includes fresh content — newly published things like news articles, videos, images, blog posts and so on. Another aspect of Google’s desire to present a search results page with a variety of content is the company’s effort to reduce duplicate content. As Google says in its help page about duplicate content, “Google tries hard to index and show pages with distinct information.” Google makes this all look easy, but for nearly any keyword query, there are typically many thousands of pages that are determined to be more or less relevant, and determining what comes up at the top on the first page of results is complex and difficult. Unfortunately, Google seems to have embedded a bias in the system (or a few biases), which in many instances gives negative content greater ranking ability than it deserves. New, negative content gaining prominence To determine where newly emerging material should fit, Google seems to test it. In my experience, when a new web page is introduced and Google spiders it, it’s not uncommon to find that new page appearing at various places in the search results over time — on page three, on two, and on one. Sometimes the new stuff rises in search results up onto page one and then subsides down lower in the results, where it stabilizes. Or, in other cases, it rises up to page one, and then it may stick there. Of course, Google has always used a number of relevance and prominence signals, such as the links pointing to a web page, to determine relative rankings. As a new web page is introduced, the various other signals may trickle in after, iteratively incorporating links to the count, and more. But another couple of dynamics appear to be at work as well. One of the additional factors is user engagement — starting at clicks when people begin encountering the new content in the search results.  (Note: I am aware that there’s controversy about how Google uses clicks in determining rankings, but, at SMX West in March, engineer Paul Haar’s presentation specifically mentioned that the engine conducts experiments that look for changes in click patterns.) This is where Google’s apparent automated content testing really comes into play, in my opinion. If the newly-introduced content shows up on page one, does it receive more clicks than the other items appearing with it? If it does, it may get promoted onto a first-page slot. But why might this newer content receive more clicks than other, better-established things that have already been present on page one, and which would naturally have more clicks than stuff that has never been there before? The answer to this is often in the title of the content appearing in the search results. I like to point out that on the information superhighway, when there’s an accident, people tend to be rubberneckers. It only makes sense that when you sees a link in search results that has a scandalous or highly negative headline, your attention is captured. It’s only human nature. If you’re searching for information about a person or a company, seeing such a headline makes you curious, and you want to find out about it. Combine an individual’s name with words like “arrest record,” “scandal” or “cheat,” and it draws clicks at a big rate compared with more staid content like “homepage,” “resume” or “phone records.” Similarly, combine a company’s name with words like “scam,” “lawsuit” or “rip-off,” and it gets clicked. From talking with Google engineers at various times, I know that they want search results to be pretty objective. In general, they want to make information about subjects available to everyone — regardless of whether the information is positive, negative or neutral. But these attention-getting negative headlines might be skewing the system. The negative bias dynamic Prior to the internet, a single individual could rarely acquire a voice as loud as that of a major corporation. But the internet — and Google — have effectively given people a bully pulpit. It doesn’t take much for an individual to create some content now that tears down a company (or another person), and to get it to rank well. Unfortunately, I’m fairly convinced there may be another dynamic in Google algorithms that is biased towards negative content, in addition to dramatically headlined links: the desire to deliver content with a variety of sentiments. Google has long had the ability to analyze content for sentiment. For instance, its patent for “Phrase-Based Snippet Generation” enables it to analyze a document for its various expressions of sentiment and bubble that up into the snippet displayed under the page’s link in search results. Since Google has dedicated a lot of effort to providing a variety of types of content in search result listings, it isn’t much of a stretch to consider that it also works to present a list of content with a combination of sentiments. Though I don’t have proof other than my own observations, it seems highly likely to me that this is happening. I’ve worked on a number of cases in which all my research indicates my clients’ names have extremely low volumes of searches.  The negative materials are likely to receive no more clicks than the positive materials, according to my information, and, in many cases, they have fewer links. Once you know the mechanisms at work — the ways people search, what draws people to click on one item versus another, and how to optimize content — then you can engineer content to fight down the negative stuff in the search results so that it won’t be as visible. For a great many things, Google’s efforts to produce variety will work effectively to provide very useful search results. But in many cases I’ve worked on, serving up a variety of information can be problematic — negative content that Google’s system raises into visibility doesn’t merit the level of prominence conveyed. Certainly, companies and individuals should be accountable for their actions. The internet has been a part of enabling that to happen, and many, if not most, people believe this to be a net positive. But there are also many instances of people and companies being harmed unfairly by untrue and malicious defamation. Should a single crank or crazy person with a bully pulpit be able to bring a company to its knees, figuratively speaking? These things affect the livelihood of companies’ employees and stockholders. Where Google can improve Google perhaps can’t be completely blamed for matching results to what their data indicates to be “searcher intent.” After all, the major news organizations have similarly done that for many years, and many have remarked upon the tendency toward reporting on sensationalist and salacious topics. But I’d argue that Google doesn’t have to gravitate toward being the equivalent of the National Enquirer of search — doing so is often simply not fair to those who are affected. Google could do better in this respect by finding additional signals that can be used to determine the veracity and merit of negative materials. There’s no question that a news story from a site like CNN, which tends to fact-check accusations and check sources, may merit ranking about a subject. But should a single blog post from a crazy person, an extortion artist or a disgruntled boyfriend be able to rank as easily? I wouldn’t be surprised if many disagree with me. If something bad and damning about a person or company comes out, there can be some degree of public interest in allowing that to come out and be findable (depending on who is involved and the context). But I think that Google ought to apply some of its sophistication to vetting content algorithmically. Simple gossip or hastily sketched-together defamation shouldn’t rise to the same level as professional reporting on a major class-action lawsuit. Until Google improves on this dynamic, you can use the standard tools of online reputation management to try to fight against the negative-biased search results that are impacting you. It goes beyond merely generating content that matches your name. You may need to craft in titles that are equally psychologically attractive to searchers to draw them away from the negative content.

Some say it’s an attempt to manipulate the outcome of next week’s US election by targeting political organizations. Google reported that an unpatched Windows zero-day vulnerability was being exploited in the wild—and Microsoft now says it is being used in a low-volume spear-phishing campaign by Fancy Bear (which it calls STRONTIUM). The flaw affects every version of Windows prior to Windows 10. “This attack campaign, originally identified by Google’s Threat Analysis Group, used two zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash [now patched] and the down-level Windows kernel to target a specific set of customers,” Microsoft noted in a threat bulletin. It also reiterated that the group, which also goes by APT 28, Pawn Storm or Sofancy, usually targets government agencies, diplomatic institutions, and military organizations, as well as affiliated private sector organizations such as defense contractors and public policy research institutes—and that it has attributed more 0-day exploits to Fancy Bear than any other tracked group in 2016. “STRONTIUM frequently uses compromised e-mail accounts from one victim to send malicious e-mails to a second victim and will persistently pursue specific targets for months until they are successful in compromising the victim's computer,” Microsoft noted. “Once inside, STRONTIUM moves laterally throughout the victim network, entrenches itself as deeply as possible to guarantee persistent access, and steals sensitive information.” The group has ties to the Kremlin, according to the US government and multiple security researchers, and has been suspected of hacking high-profile political targets like the DNC in order to sway the election in GOP candidate Donald Trump’s favor—Trump is known to have a cozier relationship to Russian President Vladimir Putin than rival Hillary Clinton. “Though Microsoft hasn’t named the targets of the attacks, the fact that the group previously hit the DNC makes me wonder whether the latest hacks are also politically motivated,” said Vishal Gupta, CEO of Seclore, via email. “I expect that more light will be shed on the incident in the coming week, but this incident currently has the signs of a last ditch effort made by the Russians to seed unrest ahead of the election.” Dimitri Sirota, CEO and co-founder at BigID, disagrees with that assessment. He told Infosecurity, “Russia’s cyberwar was not likely a one-time thing intended to influence the election. Rather, this is a deliberate and systematic attempt to exploit users for some advantage. This raises the specter that purloined information in future could be used for both intelligence, or more damagingly blackmail, to influence influencers.” Ironically, Microsoft said that it expects patches for all versions of Windows to be available on Election Day (Tuesday, Nov 8). Alex Heid, chief research officer at SecurityScorecard, notes that this timeline represents a big mistake, the byproduct of sloppy disclosure handling by those involved. “This particular vulnerability disclosure is interesting due to the miscommunication and lack of coordination between affected vendors,” he told Infosecurity. “It is reported that Google released technical details about the Flash vulnerability and issued a patch for Google Chrome, before Microsoft was able to address the exploitable conditions that reside within the WindowsOS. The time gap provides an extra week of exploitable conditions from the standpoint of an attacker, leaving Microsoft Windows users exposed to other potential attacks that may exploit the same kernel vulnerability through a different vector.” To prevent oneself from becoming a victim of the unpatched zero-day, there are browser extensions available that will prevent the automatic execution of embedded applets, such as Flash or HTML5. Heid suggests using: AdBlock Plus, an advertisement blocker for Firefox and Chrome; Flashblock, a Flash blocker for Firefox; Flashcontrol, a Flash blocker for Chrome; NoScript, a Javascript blocker for FireFox; or ScriptSafe, a Javascript blocker for Chrome. Windows 10 users are protected, so an update to the latest OS should do the trick as well.

For example, in light of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle Samsung was suffering through, it was obvious that Google's new phones would be the best option out there for Android enthusiasts seeking out the best premium smartphones money can buy. It was also obvious that deep Google Assistant integration was going to be a huge benefit over rival handsets. On the other hand, it was also obvious that in terms of design, the new Pixel and Pixel XL were so familiar that it was almost uncomfortable. In a nutshell, they looked exactly like iPhones, but with a peculiar glass panel slapped on the back. The explanation behind Google's decision reuse Apple's iPhone design has been something of a mystery ever since the phones debuted, but now we finally know exactly how it happened. DON'T MISS: This iPhone 7 video review from a hardcore Android fan is making Android users want to switch When Google unveiled its new Pixel phones, company executives repeatedly sought to make it clear that these phones were designed solely by Google, inside and out, with no input from the company's manufacturing partner HTC. This seemed odd, of course, because the Pixel looks suspiciously similar to HTC's recent iPhone copycats. But hey, Google said that the company did its own thing, so we took Google's word for it. As it turns out, HTC apparently wasn't involved in the design at all, just like Google said. A newly discovered video posted recently on YouTube by PeripateticPandas gives the world a behind the scenes look at how Google created the Pixel phone. We won't spoil the fun — the full video is embedded below.

Now Microsoft has given the hacking sources additional validity, claiming a group previously linked to the Russian government and U.S. political hacks is responsible for recent attacks that exploited a newly discovered Windows security flaw. Microsoft revealed on its website that “spear phishing” emails had been sent from the Strontium hacking group, also known as “Fancy Bear” and “APT 28.” Those emails were used to launch a small number of attacks by exploiting Windows vulnerabilities. Microsoft is releasing a patch on Election Day, November 8, to protect users against the threat. The timing of Microsoft’s announcement, as well as the patch release on Election Day, adds yet another element of chaos into what has proven to be a historically unusual and turbulent election cycle. And much in the spirit of the impending election, rivals Microsoft and Google were at each other’s throats over the timing of the vulnerability announcement. According to Microsoft, the attacks exploit a vulnerability in Adobe’s Flash software as well as the Windows OS. Adobe released a patch for its vulnerability on Monday, and Google promptly went public with details of the attacks – well before Microsoft’s patch was prepared and available. “Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” said Microsoft in a statement, while Google had no comment on the issue. According to John Bambenek, threat systems manager at Fidelis Cybersecurity, a company specializing in threat detection and security, early disclosure was the right move in this scenario, and will protect more enterprises in the long run. “There will always be a risk with acknowledging weakness,” said Bambenek. “Even releasing patches can give adversaries the very clues needed to weaponize and exploit. This was very much true with Microsoft patches years ago, which have been largely mitigated by automated patching and rebooting within 24 hours of release.” “While we don’t have solid data to talk about how widely it is being used, we do know that this vulnerability is dangerous,” added Bambenek. “It's a local privilege escalation, which means that if a user can execute compromised code, that code could be used to run commands as the administrator and more deeply embed itself into a system. At this point, my preference is to release mitigation strategies so that enterprises can protect their users while awaiting a patch.” The Fancy Bear hacking group has been primarily tied to GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency. The group has been widely blamed for the recent hacks of Democratic Party databases and emails.

By Jason Murdock November 2, 2016 18:24 GMT Schmidt included a detailed draft plan on how the Democratic candidate should structure their campaignReuters Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet and former Google chief executive, has been closely involved in the "strategic planning" of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential campaign for at least two years, emails released by whistleblowing outfit WikiLeaks suggest. A number of emails, which were directly highlighted by the WikiLeaks Twitter account, show how Google has previously loaned a company jet to the Democratic Party for an official trip to Africa and how Schmidt himself wanted to be "head outside advisor" to any future presidential candidate. In an email sent to Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills on 15 April 2014, Schmidt included a detailed draft plan on how the Democratic candidate should structure their campaign, where it should be based and how technology should be utilised for maximum effect. It was sent directly to Robby Mook, who now serves as Hillary Clinton's campaign chief, and was later sent to John Podesta, whose emails were leaked online by the Julian Assange-led anti-secrecy group. At the time of writing, over 30,000 messages have been published. "Here are some comments and observations based on what we saw in the 2012 campaign," Schmidt wrote, adding: "If we get started soon, we will be in a very strong position to execute well for 2016." Despite the assertions of WikiLeaks and some media reports, the email in question contains no direct reference to Hillary Clinton. It does, however, contain a point-by-point technology-driven plan to create voter profiles and cutting-edge election systems. "[The] key is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates all that is known about them," he wrote. The email continued: "In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify, meet, and update profiles on the voter. A dynamic volunteer can easily speak with a voter and, with their email or other digital handle, get the voter videos and other answers to areas they care about. "Quite a bit of software is to be developed to match digital identities with the actual voter file with high confidence. The key unit of the campaign is a 'voter', and each and every record is viewable and updatable by volunteers in search of more accurate information." The former Google businessman also suggested the Democratic Party should "build tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and rumours and model how it works and who has the biggest impact." Staffers, he said, could then "connect polling into this in some way." Pictured: Hacked Democratic Party aid John PodestaGetty Images On the location of the campaign, Schmidt said the headquarters should not be based in Washington as it is "full of distractions and interruptions" and that it's "important to have a very large hiring pool from which to choose enthusiastic, smart and low paid permanent employees." In a separate email, dated 2 April 2014 and again publicised by the WikiLeaks Twitter account, John Podesta tells Mook about a meeting he had with Schmidt. "He's ready to fund, advise, recruit talent, etc," the message stated. He continued: "He was more deferential on structure than I expected. Wasn't pushing to run through one of his existing firms. Clearly wants to be head outside advisor, but didn't seem like he wanted to push others out." According to Quartz, at the time when Podesta and Schmidt met, Clinton's close staffers were beginning to talk about "how her online infrastructure could seamlessly move from an exploratory committee to a full-fledged campaign." In the past, Schmidt has donated to both the Democrat and Republican parties and according to CBS gave $20,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in 2009 and 2010. Earlier this year, he was appointed chair of a US Department of Defense Innovation Advisory Board and has aided a start-up called The Groundwork that has been used to help fund Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Back in 2014, according to The Hill, Schmidt denied that he wanted to work in a Clinton administration. "We are better off trying to make America a better place from the private sector, from the education, in my opinion," he said at the time. Meanwhile, Julian Assange, the founder and face of WikiLeaks, previously claimed the relationship between the US government and Google had a nefarious side. "Google is heavily integrated with Washington power, at personal level and at business level," he said at a conference this year. "Google which has increasing control over the distribution channels [...] is intensely allying itself with the US exceptionalism," he claimed.

That leaves Microsoft as the only major browser holdout. Tens of thousands of desktops, laptops, servers, appliances and apps running in the cloud for businesses and government agencies trust WoSign and StartCom, certificate authorities (CAs) that up until recently played a key role in web security by issuing digital certificates to website operators. These certificates are trusted by browsers to authenticate secure connections to websites. But on August 17, Google was notified by GitHub's security team that WoSign had issued a certificate for one of GitHub's domains without its authorization. This prompted an investigation, conducted in public as a collaboration with Mozilla and the security community, which found a number of other cases of WoSign mis-issuance. The investigation concluded that WoSign knowingly and intentionally mis-issued certificates in order to circumvent browser restrictions and CA requirements. "WoSign and StartCom, their secretly acquired subsidiary, have made a mockery of the global system of trust that runs e-commerce and allows us to safely run downloaded apps on our computers,” said Kevin Bocek, vice president of Security Strategy and Threat Intelligence for Venafi, in an email. “It's encouraging to see Google join Apple and Mozilla in taking the right steps to obliterate WoSign and StartCom as being trusted in browsers. Microsoft must do the same. Inaction is unconscionable.” Further, StartCom, another CA, had been purchased by WoSign, and had replaced infrastructure, staff, policies and issuance systems with WoSign's. However, when pressed, neither company would be transparent about their relationship. “Google has determined that two CAs, WoSign and StartCom, have not maintained the high standards expected of CAs and will no longer be trusted by Google Chrome, in accordance with our Root Certificate Policy,” said Andrew Whalley of Chrome Security, in a post. “CAs who issue certificates outside the policies required by browsers and industry bodies can put the security and privacy of every web user at risk.” Google is taking a phased approach to distrust: Beginning with Chrome 56, certificates issued by WoSign and StartCom after October 21 will not be trusted. In subsequent Chrome releases, pre-existing certificates will be phased out, culminating in the full distrust of these CAs. Enterprises will need to take action too. Bocek added, “Organizations need to follow the guidance of NIST and others to automate their response to eliminate obliterate unneeded and unnecessary CAs from their systems. Most businesses and governments don’t know what certificates they use and what CAs they trust. The status quo leaves businesses with an unacceptable level of risk.” Photo © Denis Linine/Shutterstock.com Why Not Watch? 7 Jan 2016The ‘Dark’ Web Inside Your Enterprise – Shining a Light on the Hazards of Encrypted Traffic 4 Sep 2014Get Ready for the PCI DSS v3 Deadline 5 Feb 2015Encryption Under Attack: Government vs Privacy 2 Apr 2015Browsers, Certificates and Trust: What's Changing and What You Need to Know Related to This Story Symantec Tells Google to 'Distrust' Root Cert Google Voices Support for Apple, but what Does the FBI Actually Want?

Both have better adoption than last year’s phone according to mobile marketing firm Appboy, but rates could be higher if it were not for constrained supply. Appboy’s data comes from an analysis of 100+ million daily app devices from October 20-27. It shows the Pixel reaching 0.016% of market share and the Pixel XL 0.020% one week after release. In comparison, it took the Nexus 6P over two weeks to reach a similar level. Growth would likely be higher if not for limited Pixel stock from both Google and Verizon. With the largest increase in adoption rate typically being the day following release, the Pixel XL observed a smaller than expected increase. This is likely due to XL models being sold out first on the Google Store and Verizon. Instead, a surprising spike occurred on October 25, in line with when more preordered devices shipped and reached customers. In all, volume grew by 274% for the Pixel and 158% for the XL one week after launch. Compared to Samsung, Google’s first wholly made device has a better growth rate at the moment. The Galaxy S6 and S7 only saw 104% and 171% growth during the same weeklong period. While impressive, adoption pales in comparison to established manufacturers. Both of Samsung’s previous Galaxy flagships reached greater market share in the first day than the Pixel and Pixel XL did in a week.

 Google is building up its defense against fraudulent apps BI Intelligence Nov. 2, 2016, 12:44 PM 861 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Everything you wanted to know about chatbots but were afraid to ask This is how Taco Bell, Starbucks, and other fast-food chains are using mobile to boost order values Traditional banks may be in trouble due to digital banking This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Google launched a new system to identify fraudulent apps that plague the Play Store and to potentially declutter its discovery systems. The enhanced release, announced Monday, will target developers that attempt to manipulate the placement of their apps via fake reviews, fraudulent installs, and incentivized ratings. This can affect the way other apps are rated and discovered by users, impacting the overall experience for Android developers and end users alike. Keeping the Play Store fair and easy to use will be integral for both developers and end users: It lifts developers' chances of getting their apps seen. Apps that use nefarious methods to boost their positioning in the Play Store, such as through false reviews and installs, can hinder legitimate developers' chances of having their apps discovered. This will become an even bigger problem as more apps flood the smartphone market. Already, the Play Store has more than 2 million apps, up from 1.6 million apps in 2015.   It could boost the user experience. Developers that violate Google's store policies with fake reviews and download numbers could see their apps rated higher than legitimate apps. This could result in users downloading apps that don't live up to their reviews, install numbers, and ratings, negatively affecting the overall app experience.   This is just the latest enhancement Google has made to improve the Play Store experience.For example, as of March 2015, the company systematically reviews app submissions using algorithms and employs an internal team of reviewers to check for policy violations. Before that, Google took a lightweight approach to app reviews, allowing most apps to go live without any editorial oversight. The problem of app developers using fraudulent means to boost their chances of being downloaded is not a new phenomenon. Apple, too, suffers from this problem as its app developers attempt to get a piece of the multi-billion dollar app market. In 2016, the global app market is projected to generate around $52 billion. This is expected grow at an annualized rate of 18% through 2020 to reach $102 billion in revenue globally, according to App Annie. However, a number of issues, primarily driven by app discovery, mean that a massive chunk of this revenue goes to just a few large players; around 60% of developers make less than $500 each month, according to VisionMobile. To help mitigate the potential damage these fraudulent app developers risk, app vendors like Google and Apple need to create a more even playing field that provides developers the ability to generate meaningful revenue.  Cutting through the noise of an overcrowded app market is critical for any app developer looking to build a viable user base. There are now well over 3 million apps available across the world’s five largest app stores. Delivering the right product to the right audience at the right time in this environment is imperative to the success of any app. The challenge of marketing an app effectively has made app-install ads — an ad unit that directs users to download a mobile app — an essential tool for developers seeking to stand out in the Google Play and Apple app stores. This is why it's not surprising that more marketers are using paid channels to drive downloads than ever before. In fact, over 80% of respondents in a survey of the top 100 grossing mobile app developers noted they plan on increasing their spend on app-install ads in 2015. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile app-install ads that looks at the revenues from app-install ads and how they're expected to grow over the next five years. It also looks at the performance of app-install ads and how these metrics are expected to change over time. Furthermore, the report examines the top app-install ad products and pricing models offered by the leading advertising platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, and Google, as well as newer app-install formats from Instagram and Snapchat. Looking to the future, the report examines how companies are shifting their app-install ad spend to new formats, as well as the new tools they're using to improve optimization and ad effectiveness. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Mobile app-install ads — ad units that direct users to download a mobile app — are an essential tool for developers, and they account for a major share of mobile ad spend. We estimate 25% of total US mobile ad revenue was generated by app-install ads in 2015. A combination of new developers entering the space and rising ad budgets will drive increased spending in years to come. US app-install ad revenue will grow to over $7 billion by year-end 2020, according to BI Intelligence estimates. Mobile app install advertisers have traditionally invested heavily in display and interstitial ads, but are moving to mobile video and native install formats. 86% of developers currently use in-feed video app-install ads, and video ads are seen as the most effective app-install format. As formats like video rise in popularity, older formats are losing their appeal for install campaigns. Static nonnative ads are widely used but are not seen as effective. Free app networks and offer walls have also fallen out of favor. Ad platforms are now developing innovative new install formats to earn even more revenue from these lucrative ad units. New approaches, including deep linking and app streaming, are more contextualized and interactive than older ad formats. In full, the report: Forecasts app-install ad spending in the US through 2020.

It will be a hard sell as large global automakers devote more resources to coding their own. This week, Toyota and Renault-Nissan joined the growing chorus of “Google, no thanks.” “Many say carmakers have no future, and that they will become commodity producers, because Google, Apple, Microsoft or Tesla will take the lead in the automotive business in the future. We don’t want to give them the space to do that,” Toyota’s Executive Vice President Didier Leroy told a small group of reporters at the company’s Tokyo HQ yesterday. “Do you believe we will just open the door and say go ahead? No, we won’t let them come inside like that,” Leroy added. Read Article Most Viewed Photos on AutoSpies.com RIGHT NOW!

Have No Fear, Bacon Is Here Published on November 02, 2016. Most Popular The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. The Bacon Scented Virtual Reality Viewer Credit: Hormel Foods Corporation/BusinessWire Has a certain enticing aroma been missing from the virtual reality experience? Hormel is adding a bacon-scented feature to the Google Cardboard VR headset. While people can get a feel for Hormel's "The Black Market" just by visiting BlackLabelBacon.com on smartphones and placing the phones in front of their eyes, Hormel said it would give away a limited number of bacon-scented Google Cardboard to amplify the experience. The bacon peddler described The Black Market as "a multisensory bacon experience designed to launch consumers on a quest in a world of bacon, while providing them with the ability to purchase bacon in a previously unimaginable way; as the first-ever mobile virtual reality shopping experience available to consumers via a smartphone that does not require using an application or headset." Users can explore the dark woods, a volcano, a salty sea and outer space to unlock and buy certain Hormel Black Label products. BBDO Minneapolis worked on the project. Bevel gets into the school spirit in new campaign. Credit: Bevel Code Walker & Co.'s Bevel has launched a campaign around homecoming at historically black colleges and universities as part of a deal announced earlier this year making it the official grooming partner of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Bevel is the first shave system specifically developed to prevent irritation for African-American men and others with coarse, curly facial hair. Videos in the new campaign focus on Tuskegee University's renowned Crimson Piper Band. As we've long discussed here at Lowdown, there seems to be a National Day to celebrate pretty much everything. With National Sandwich Day falling on Nov. 3, Subway is once again tying itself to the day with a giveaway, and this time it is also tied to giving back. For the #GoodDeedFeed campaign, patrons on Nov. 3 who buy a sub and drink get another free sub of equal or lesser price. Plus, Subway will donate a meal to Feeding America for each sub that is purchased and aims to make it the largest meal donation day in Feeding America's history. Subway is promoting the campaign with a TV spot from MMB, a Mic.com content series and a Snapchat filter that can be unlocked at Subway locations only on Nov. 3. Subway's 2015 National Sandwich Day #SaveLunchBreak campaign had a free extra sub angle without the food donation. Last year's version was the chain's first work from BBDO. Just like champagne, tequila is named after a town -- Tequila, Mexico. Now Tres Agaves Tequila is celebrating that fact in a new campaign. The brand, which is marketed by Napa Valley-based Trinchero Family Estates, is plugging itself as "Tequila Made in Tequila" in digital videos that feature the scenes and personalities of people in the Tequila Valley. The tequila is made at what the brand describes as one of the oldest distilleries in Mexico in the town of Tequila. "When we traveled to the Tequila Valley, we found a magical place that had its own folklore and traditions that we realized provided the heartbeat for the Tres Agaves brand," said Keith Cartwright, executive creative director at Butler, Shine, Stern & Partners, which is behind the campaign. "Our campaign uses real people from the town and real events. In the spirit of Champagne in France, 'Tequila Made in Tequila' gives authenticity and relevance to the brand that now no one else can claim." The holiday beverage season unofficially kicked off Nov. 1, as coffee chains began promoting winter flavors rather than Pumpkin Spiced everything. The flavor rollouts come as the NPD Group reports U.S. consumers are drinking 72 fewer purchased beverages each year than they were a decade ago. "It's not that consumers are only drinking tap water; there are still about 1100 beverage occasions per person a year, which equates to about three non-tap water drinks a day," NPD said. Soft drinks are still the No. 1 beverage consumed at restaurants and foodservice locations, with some 18 billion servings ordered in the 12 months ended in February. Coffee ranks No. 1 in beverages consumed at home. Candy Cane Crunch Donut Square Credit: Dunkin' Donuts Dunkin' Donuts said its new items include Crème Brulée-flavored coffees, lattes and macchiatos. In the food category, rather than the drinks-meant-to-taste-like-food category, there is a new Candy Cane Crunch donut (yeast donut with vanilla flavored buttercreme filling, topped with white icing and crushed candy cane pieces) and a Boston Kreme Croissant donut (a glazed croissant donut filled with Bavarian creme, finished with a chocolate icing drizzle). Over at Starbucks, a new green cup featuring a mosaic design from artist Shogo Ota quickly rattled a few social media users who expected their seasonal Peppermint Mochas, Chestnut Praline Lattes and Caramel Brulée Lattes to appear in a red cup. "During a divisive time in our country, Starbucks wanted to create a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other," Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz said in a Nov. 1 statement discussing the new limited-time cup. As Business Insider , Mashable and others noted, the green cups are only meant to last a little while and many expect red cups to pop up on Nov. 10. Of course, last year Starbucks managed to annoy some people with its red cup, too. McDonald's 'World Series Fry Countdown' Credit: Cossette Chicago for the McDonald's Owners of Chicago and Northwest Indiana (MOCNI) McDonald's operators in the Chicago area have been having some out-of-home fun with the Cubs in the World Series. Their "fry countdown" began with billboards showing four of the famous fries with the words "more to go" next to them, to represent the number of games the Cubs needed to win in order to win their first World Series since 1908. Each time the Cubs have won, the number of fries has dropped on the 198 boards in the area. After Tuesday night's Game 6, the board was updated once again. If (when!) the Cubs win it all, local operators plan to charge $1.08 for a serving of 10 chicken nuggets one day later this week, in celebration of the number of years Chicago would have waited for a World Series win. Cossette Chicago is the agency behind the project for the McDonald's Owners of Chicago and Northwest Indiana. A day online wouldn't be complete for some without a cat video. What do cats have to do with laundry detergent? Well, not much, really. But cat videos long have been one of the biggest things on the internet. And it's a lot harder or riskier to integrate selfies, porn and annoying comments about the presidential election into a detergent ad. So cat videos were the obvious choice in this new offering from Henkel and TBWA/Chiat/Day for Persil. Come to think of it, this isn't just pure cat-video borrowed interest. Think of the name – Persil. You know, Purr-sil. In a statement, the brand says it's "shaking up the historically predictable laundry category with the release of their new #Purrsil Digital and Social Media campaign, celebrating the most discerning critics of clean laundry: cats." Lastly, a PR move to mention. Albertsons named Christine Wilcox as VP-communications and public affairs, filling a role left vacant when Brian Dowling retired from the grocer earlier this year. Ms. Wilcox, previously VP-corporate communications, has spent 18 years at Albertsons. Albertsons also said it has partnered with The Glover Park Group, a strategic communications firm, as it works on its new communications approach. Contributing: Jessica Wohl, Jack Neff, E.J.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeConsumerMicrosoft (MSFT) Cries Foul As Google Goes Public With Unpatched Windows Bug Microsoft (MSFT) Cries Foul As Google Goes Public With Unpatched Windows Bug “Actively exploited” Windows vulnerability continuing to bug users November 2, 2016 WSP On October 21, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) discovered a Windows bug that allows unauthorized access to Windows users accounts. The bug affects the Windows kernel– that part of the operating system which requires the highest privilege. This allows a hacker to bypass Windows’ security sandbox, giving him/her the power to execute any kind of program without the need for administrator access. Apart from the Windows bug, Google also discovered a flaw in Adobe Flash software. Both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) were alerted by Google as soon as the vulnerabilities were discovered. Adobe was able to resolve the issue in just 5 days. And Google itself has already done its own fix for Chrome users. As for Microsoft, almost 2 weeks have gone by and still the flaw remains. Google has an existing policy to inform the public about unpatched critical vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited, 7 days after notifying the software owner. According to them, 7 days should be enough time to work on a fix, especially for bugs that are too dangerous to be left unchecked. If a permanent solution isn’t possible within that period, the public should at least be informed so they can work on temporary solutions to protect themselves. Classifying the recently discovered Windows bug under this category, Google publicly announced its existence on October 31. And Microsoft has openly reacted against it. According to a statement issued by Terry Myerson, Executive Vice President of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices group, they are committed to safeguarding customer security and they take this responsibility seriously. Myerson says: “We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk.” He further gives the assurance that a solution for the problem is already being worked on, and that a system-wide patch will be released to the public by November 8. In the meantime, Microsoft recommends their users to upgrade to Windows 10 — ‘the most secure operating system we’ve ever built, complete with advanced protection for consumers and enterprises at every layer of the security stack’ – and make use of the Microsoft Edge browser. As for Google, the company is encouraging the public to protect themselves against the latest bug by updating their Adobe Flash Player, and applying the Windows patch as soon as it is deployed.

But it can be a challenge to get your organization on the competitive first page of results, and we all know that nobody goes past page one. From the typically right-brained perspective of PR, securing a high rank in search results can seem like an opaque process. While a comprehensive knowledge of search algorithms and web crawlers is handy, there’s more to SEO success than understanding the numbers. Mandy Menaker, head of PR and brand development, Shapr In fact, it’s possible to rank highly on Google with small teams and a tiny budget. Mandy Menaker, head of PR and brand development at Shapr, built a successful and highly ranked blog from the ground up with serious budgetary and personnel constraints. At PR News’ Google for Communicators Boot Camp, Menaker will walk attendees through creating SEO-friendly blogs from the ground up. Here are four tips from Menaker that’ll help communicators get started writing for SEO: Use Google AdWords Keyword Planner If you know what you want to write about, start by searching in Google AdWords Keyword Planner to see how your keyword (i.e. learn French) stacks up. “Learn French Online” has 22,000 searches a month while “French Lessons Online” has only 2,400. If you’re just getting started with your blog, choose to focus on keyword variations with less competition. Sure, fewer people will search for “French Lessons Online,” but you are more likely to appear on the first page rather than the sixth page of results. To get actionable tips and hear in-depth case studies about SEO, Google Analytics, YouTube and Google AdWords, join PR News on Nov. 17 in NYC for PR News' Boot Camp: Google for Communicators. Take advantage of free tools such as Yoast There are tons of easy to use, free plugins to help you analyze your posts as you write them. I prefer Yoast for WordPress, which will give you tips for improving your SEO based on factors such as the number of times you mention a keyword, the meta title and tags you have used on your blog, and the length of your post. No matter what blog posting service you use, don’t be shy about Googling around to find a free tool for helping check your SEO as you write. Compose lists Evergreen lists (i.e. Top 10 Places to Go On Vacation) do incredibly well in search results and people love them. If you’re writing a list, Google first to see who has already written a similar piece and which lists show up on the first page. Does “Top 9 Tips” already rank? Cool, write the “Top 11 Tips.” Studies have shown that people will click on articles with a larger number in the title, and that odd numbers also perform slightly better. Write for your customers, not a search engine Your goal is to convert clicks into customers, not just to show up in search results. Inauthentic posts will lose readers quickly, and potential buyers won’t trust your brand next time they see an ad or a blog post. Spend the time writing content that offers a fresh viewpoint, useful tips or personal stories. If you engage the readers who do click on your article, you will see them share the pieces and drive referral traffic, stay on your site to read more articles and eventually buy your product.

(Source: CNN) (CNN) – In anticipation of the newest film set in the Harry Potter universe, Google has enabled Android phones to cast spells. By using Google’s voice search commands on their mobile devices, fans can light up the world with Lumos or turn off all sound with Silencio. Saying “OK, Google” followed by “Lumos” causes the phone’s flashlight to turn on, just like in the Harry Potter world where Lumos makes a wizard’s wand light up. The spell’s counterpart, Nox, can be used to turn the flashlight off again. Silencio also works on Android phones. Saying “OK, Google” followed by “Silencio” will turn off the phone’s ringer and notifications, muting people as if using the real wizarding spell. The spells are expected to be around for a limited time only, coinciding with the release of “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” on Nov. 18. Copyright 2016 CNN, Google. All rights reserved.

As a quick refresher, Tango brings AR overlays, accurate 3D space measuring, motion tracking and many others to the table. Needless to say, that set of capabilities opens up a ton of new possibilities, including but not limited to raising virtual pets and getting a preview of how furniture or decorations would look like in a room. Now, Google highlighted a couple of these Tango apps in store, and here's a quick look at them. For Measuring With a straightforward name, Measure lets the user, well, measure objects with pinpoint accuracy, providing them with even the minutest details. For Visualizing Furniture And Appliances To get visual representations of furniture and appliances, there are four apps to choose from: WayfairView, Lowe's Vision, Homestyler Interior Design and iStaging. For An AR Gaming Experience Mobile gamers would be glad to know that there are a lot of AR titles that make use of Tango. That said, players can set up endless domino courses with Domino World, shoot invading zombies with blast after blast of colors in Crayola Color Blaster, take down a fearsome dragon with a trusty slingshot in Slingshot Island and bring up an adorable, magical little pet in Raise. More than those, users can also get a fix for their need for speed, as there's the Hot Wheel's Track Builder, Wild Wild Race and Car Racing. For Educational Purposes Phab 2 Pro owners can get to see prehistoric animals up close with Dinosaurs Among Us or the planets in the solar system with Solar Simulator. For Overlaying AR Objects More on the entertainment side of things, users can create AR environments with the sandbox game Woorld and start a business empire with Towers For Tango. For Video Editing With Spectra at hand, Phab 2 Pro users can turn videos into works of art thanks to a slew of 3D filters. Phab 2 Pro: The Tango Phone Announced at CES 2016, the Phab 2 Pro isn't exactly a powerhouse, and it falls somewhere in the midrange smartphone line. Of course, it's nevertheless a game changer because of Tango. Covering the core specs really quick, it sports a 6.4-inch 2.5D display with a 1,440 x 2,560 resolution, and to run things, it houses a Snapdragon 652 built for Tango and 4 GB of RAM.

The headset will be stocked by Verizon and Best Buy in the US for $79; EE and Carphone Warehouse in the UK for £69; and Telstra and JB Hi-Fi in Australia for AU$109.  A big step up from the Google Cardboard, the Daydream looks much less prone to accidental recycling incidents and promises to offer much more high quality experiences than its predecessor. An affordable addition Oh great, another VR headset, we hear you sigh. However, the Daydream View adds an affordable balance to a market that was slowly leaning towards more expensive options with the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and PlayStation VR. Being lower cost, it’s more accessible than the Vive and Oculus Rift as these aren’t only expensive in themselves, but also require expensive PCs to run.  However, Daydream isn’t necessarily more accessible than the PlayStation VR for anyone who already owns a PlayStation console, as the Daydream still requires an expensive mobile device to work.  As an entry-level mobile-focussed headset priced at under £100, the most direct competitor for Daydream is the Samsung Gear VR.  These are the best VR games for PC, consoles and mobile Mobile VR going head to head As far as comfort goes, the Daydream certainly looks more comfortable than the Gear VR. When you compare it with the hard plastic of the Gear VR, the Daydream's soft materials appears to have been designed with more with its wearable function in mind.  Another advantage the Daydream offers is that it comes with a dedicated external controller. The Gear VR only has  a directional pad on the side of the headset and though it does offer third-party controller support, the lack of a standard version means many VR experiences for the Gear VR don’t bother to include controller support as it’s difficult to configure so many.  Both headsets are limited in terms of which phones you can use with them. At the moment the only phones that work with the Daydream are the new Pixel and Pixel XL, whilst the Gear VR headset is more accessible with the wider Galaxy range.  However, Google promises that there are many Daydream compatible phones on the way from a variety of manufacturers such as Samsung, Alcatel, Asus, HTC, LG, Xiaomi. This is good news for anyone who would rather have not have their device choice limited by their VR accessory.  As a mobile VR headset, the Daydream won’t be able to compete with the Vive, Oculus Rift, or PlayStation VR in terms of gaming experiences.  It will, however, have its own section on the Google Play Store where you’ll be able to find a variety of games and experiences. Though Daydream’s software offering is fairly small at the moment, it will grow and Google plans to make its own apps compatible with the Daydream platform. It's including Play Movies, Photos, Maps and YouTube when the platform launches.  Before now the mobile VR market was almost entirely dominated by the Gear VR but that’s changing with the launch of the Daydream view. With more choice comes more competition and improvements. Whether you’re looking to purchase a VR headset or not, it’s positive to see the headset market growing so quickly as it bodes well for the future of the platform.   Google’s Daydream View headset and controller package is available to buy online now for $79 (£69, about AU$104) and will launch in stores on November 10.  What's the latest with Microsoft's HoloLens?

Back then, any number of music blogs featured download links to songs and albums, DJ mixes, sometimes an artist’s whole catalogue — but now, while the webpages are still active, the links to the music are not. I’d be inclined to suggest this music could be found on streaming sites — and might even try looking for it — yet I know it’s a waste of time. What I’m looking for, specifically, are bootleg tapes that in some cases survived for twenty, thirty, forty years, before some thoughtful person digitized them. Unless Spotify or Apple Music open themselves up to user-generated contented, these bootlegs will never be online ever again. Which is sad. You land on an abandoned music blog — all dead links, YouTube clips no longer available, low-res pictures snatched from Google Images — it’s enough to put a tear in your eye. But don’t tell the music business that. “The nearly 20-year depression in the music business is finally over,” says an article recently published in the Wall Street Journal. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, global music sales grew 3.2% last year. 3.2%! — shit, let’s break out the champagne. Look, all kidding aside, anyone who knows knows, the music industry has been “back” for a while now. It’s not exactly the 90s again, but the money is definitely flowing and flowing fast. In fact, the average mid-tier act is putting away more money in 2016 than they were twenty years ago. It’s just that money doesn’t go very far these days — in New York, a million dollars is basically… a dollar. So, the money is back, and yes, with streaming and YouTube — let’s not forget YouTube, which does more for music than probably anything else — there is a lot of energy in this space. Most importantly though, music seems to be in a good place creatively (although many of you, predictably, will say things were better “back in the day”). And yet — yet! — I can’t help but pine for the days of yore. I subscribe to three streaming services that, for better or worse, have the same exact music and do the same exact shit. So nobody can tell me I’m not supporting the business. But I still feel file-sharing has a purpose. For one, files are the go-to format for DJs; I don’t need to explain how important DJ’s are. Pulselocker, which you can use with Serato, allows DJs to mix with streaming files— but reviews have been mixed and I’ve never seen anyone use it. And files are the go-to format for people who share music that isn’t widely-available — records only in limited release; demos; bootlegs; live recordings. In short, anything not officially sanctioned by a record label. People always shared this stuff, but in the old days, it might have happened through cassettes or burned CDs, passed from one hand to the next. In the Napster era, you downloaded it. But then, when MP3-infested music blogs became popular, things really got interesting. Because now you had the music, but you also had commentary. You had content and context. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. I say this because, theoretically, nobody directly involved with the music itself was making any money from this stuff. What made things worse was that, eventually, many blogs began selling ads against this content. So, they were profiting at the expense of the people whose music they claimed to love so much. But when it was good, it was really good. Some of these blogs catered to very small niches, trafficking in music that wouldn’t make any money regardless of whether it was being sold or not. Putting it up for free was doing the artist a favor — through that, people discovered them. Now, I don’t know where that exists anymore. Maybe all these fans and file-sharers have migrated to Facebook or Reddit, and they’re trading in some closed ecosystem, where the long arm of internet law can no longer see them. Which would be smart. Until I can figure out where they are though, I will remain sad about a short-lived period when the internet was the wild west, and free music was everywhere. It was a music nerd’s paradise. A paradise lost. For more from Paul Cantor, sign up for his email list or contact him at paulcantor@gmail.com.

Google Might Have Falsely Advertised Pixel Phone's Charging Speed GO The Pixel phone can't charge at 18W, as Google suggested Nov 2, 2016 16:21 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Big companies like Apple, Google, Samsung and the like usually get away when they falsely advertise their products and highlight features that are not working as described. The last company to falsely claim one of its products operates within certain parameters is Google. The culprit is the Pixel phone, which has been confirmed to charge at 18W, just like its Pixel XL bigger brother. However, a reputable community tester of USB devices, Nathan K, performed some tests on both Pixel phones and came to the conclusion that the Pixel phone can't reach 18W during charging. Google has been quick to respond to these tests, which Nathan K made publicly known, and said that the fact that the Pixel phone was advertised as fully supporting 18W charging was a mistake the marketing department made when they listed the features on the ad materials. Also, the search giant updated the phone's specs on its website accordingly, so it now states that the Pixel phone charges at 15W - 18W, which is closer to what the device offers in reality. Pixel phone charging Nathan speculates that Google might have limited the charging capability of the Pixel phone. In fact, the phone could charge at 18W, but Google made an intentional decision not to allow the Pixel phone to charge at that value due to thermal concerns. The good news is this will not have any effect on your daily use, as the Pixel phone will charge just about as quickly as the Pixel XL, if it has a similar battery. Also, Nathan states that both the charger and the phone are safe to use, even though Google limited the charging values. Obviously, this is a minor mistake, which shouldn't weigh heavily on your decision to buy any of the two Pixel phones. Small mistakes like these are usually overlooked and aren't punished by country regulators, but what about major flaws?   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Pixel phone#Pixel XL#Nexus smartphone#Google phone#Google Pixel subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Considers Adding Fingerprint Recognition Gestures to Nexus 5X and 6P Some Google Pixel XL Owners Report Manufacturing Defects in Their Phones Google’s Next Daydream VR Headset Surfaces in Patent Filling Google Assistant Can Share Articles to Twitter and Google+ OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE Salix Xfce 14.2 Live Edition Released, It's Based on Xfce 4.12 & Slackware 14.2 2 photos    Pixel and Pixel XL New Android APKs Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   LG G5 Starts Receiving Android 7.0 Nougat Update more on: LG G5 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

So even Muggles can experience some magic Thanks to Google, Android phone users can all use a little Harry Potter magic. On Tuesday, the company announced three new “spells” for its Android devices. The spells—Lumos, Nox, and Silencio—are part of the new apps and features Google has created to go hand-in-hand with the new Warner Bros. film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the prequel to the Harry Potter series. All users have to do is talk to Android’s voice activated assistant and say “Okay Google, Lumos” to turn on the phone’s flashlight, and “Okay Google, Nox” to turn it off. You can also say “Okay Google, Silencio” to turn off the phone’s volume. Users can also explore the fictional world of Fantastic Beasts, set in 1926 New York, via Google’s four new sites in Street View. Popular places from the film to virtually visit are: MACUSA (Magical Congress of the USA), the underground speakeasy The Blind Pig; and the magical apartment of Tina and Queenie Goldstein, who are two of the film’s key characters. Google also announced that YouTube creators are going to feature Fantastic Beasts-related content, too. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them opens in theaters Nov. 18.

It’s the reason BlackBerry fell to its knees as governments and corporations began replacing their aging tech with iPhones, but the director of security at Google says Android is just as secure as iPhone, now. Adrian Ludwig says the platforms are “nearly identical in terms of their platform-level capabilities for almost all threat models.” Ludwig recently spoke at a security conference in Manhattan, stating that Google’s new Pixel devices are pretty much equal to the iPhone in terms of security, but Ludwig was quick to mention he believes Android will soon surpass the iPhone in terms of security. “In the long term, the open ecosystem of Android is going to put it in a much better place.” Ludwig attributes this to Android’s security checking method called Safety Net, which he says scans more than 400 million devices per day and scans more than 6 billion apps per day. Because of these security checks and exploit mitigation measures baked right into Android, Ludwig says the number of potentially harmful applications installed on devices in the wild is less than 1%. For this reason, Ludwig says he believes it’s nearly impossible for a large number of people to be targeted using an exploit like Stagefright that was revealed last year. In fact, Ludwig states that despite the media frenzy around covering the Stagefright exploit, they still don’t have any instances of the exploit being used in the wild. local_offer    Android   Google   iPhone   Pixel   Pixel XL   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (25) stars Further Reading Google Play Music gets smart redesign Project ARA Q&A The Verizon Pixel XL is delayed again The Play Store sees another update Verizon launches BOGO deal stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

The Pentagon is taking cues from tech executives about how to nurture a culture of innovation. The Defense Department will seek out a chief innovation officer to oversee programs designed to encourage employees to solve problems creatively, the Pentagon announced last week. The move comes at the recommendation of the Defense Innovation Board, chaired by Google Alphabet’s Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt and includes Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, LinkedIn Co-founder Reid Hoffman and celebrity astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. The chief innovation officer will advise Defense Secretary Ash Carter and will oversee efforts to spread a creative culture by using new technology, such as new software platforms.

Establishing a chief innovation officer position is one of several recommendations the Defense Innovation Board made.

Doing so would “help incentivize our people to come up with innovative ideas and approaches and be recognized for them.” The Pentagon also plans to help tech talent come into, and leave, the government after short stints of service, potentially through the Defense Digital Service or the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program. The DIB’s other recommendations included offering bonuses or awards for managers who encourage employees to think creatively, and investing more in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, according to a DOD release.

Close share panel × Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The hackers are thought to have Russian links, but it is not known where they are based Microsoft's Windows chief has accused a notorious group of hackers - previously linked to Russia - of making use of an unpatched flaw in its operating system. Terry Myerson said Strontium was exploiting the bug to infect PCs in order to get access to potentially sensitive data. Strontium is also known as APT28 and Fancy Bear, and has previously been blamed for attacking a French TV network and the US Democratic Party. Microsoft says it is working on a fix. It intends to release the patch next week. Other cybersecurity researchers say analysis of the hackers' previous activities suggests they are Russians, or at least citizens of a neighbouring country who can speak Russian, and appear to be acting in Moscow's interests rather than for personal profit. FireEye - a company whose clients include the US Department of Defense - has gone so far as to say the attackers are "most likely sponsored by the Russian government". But the link has never been conclusively proven, and the Kremlin has repeatedly denied its involvement. Why are we hearing about this now? Image copyright PA Image caption Google blogged about Microsoft's flaw at the start of the week It's unusual for the big tech companies to reveal a software flaw in their products before they have a fix, because it flags the problem to cybercriminals. Indeed, Microsoft had planned to stay quiet about this bug until it had a solution. But Google forced its hand when it published details of the issue on Monday. Microsoft was irked. But Google justified its move saying: "This vulnerability is particularly serious because we know it is being actively exploited." What is Microsoft telling us? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Terry Myerson wrote about the attack, following Google's blog about the matter Mr Myerson has confirmed the issue is with a system file, which Windows requires to display graphics. The company says customers using both the latest version of Windows 10 and Microsoft's own Edge web browser should be safe but acknowledges others remain at risk. However, it says the attack only works if a user also has Flash installed, and a newly released version of Adobe's media plug-in also provides protection. Regarding Strontium itself, Microsoft says the hackers have come up with more types of novel attack - known as zero-days - than any other tracked group this year. "Strontium frequently uses compromised email accounts from one victim to send malicious emails to a second victim and will persistently pursue specific targets for months until they are successful in compromising the victims' computers," Mr Myerson wrote. "Once inside, Strontium moves laterally throughout the victim network, entrenches itself as deeply as possible to guarantee persistent access, and steals sensitive information." How did Strontium compromise its initial targets? Image copyright Microsoft Image caption Strontium's past spearphishing campaigns have included emails that pretended to be from Microsoft itself The hackers are believed to have used spearphishing - a technique that involves targeting specific individuals with emails and other messages that seek to fool them into revealing their logins. The attackers have a reputation for being persistent. They have been known to repeatedly send messages to high-value individuals for more than a year, if necessary, until one succeeds. Who is being targeted? Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The hackers' phishing campaigns have been traced back to 2007 Neither Google nor Microsoft have said who received the latest batch of booby-trapped emails. But Microsoft has previously said of the hackers' typical prey: "Its primary institutional targets have included government bodies, diplomatic institutions, and military forces and installations in Nato member states and certain Eastern European countries. "Additional targets have included journalists, political advisers, and organisations associated with political activism in Central Asia." What else do we know about Strontium? Image copyright Fancy Bears The group has also been called Sofacy, Sednit and Pawn Storm, and has been linked to attacks dating back to 2007. It appears to operate its own website, where it calls itself Fancy Bears. It was used to leak confidential medical files about US Olympic athletes earlier this year, which had been stolen from the World Anti-Doping Agency. The site suggests the group is part of the wider Anonymous hacktivist collective, although this may be an attempt at misdirection. Months earlier, cybersecurity company Crowdstrike accused the hackers of breaching the US Democratic Party's governing body's network. It suggested they might be affiliated with the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service. "Their tradecraft is superb, operational security second to none, and the extensive usage of 'living-off-the-land' techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter," it said in a report. Other activities blamed on the team include: attacks on three YouTube bloggers who had interviewed President Obama in January 2016 a breach that nearly destroyed France's media company TV5Monde in April 2015. The company's TV network went off air, and its website was defaced with messages that initially appeared to have been created by so-called Islamic State sympathisers a hack of the Bundestag's computer network that was discovered in May 2015. About 20,000 accounts belonging to German politicians and officials were thought to have been compromised attempts in 2015 to steal data from safety investigators looking into the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine a year earlier at least two attempts to steal data from the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs around 2013, and a further attempt to target the country's Ministry of Defence Are only Windows computers at risk ? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Apple's devices have been targeted in the past, but are not vulnerable to the latest exploit No. Security company Trend Micro has previously linked the hackers to malware designed to infect jailbroken iPhones and iPads. Microsoft says it has also observed the group using web domains customised to compromise Mac and Linux computers in other campaigns. Is the Kremlin really to blame? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly denied that Russia is hacking other countries In the past, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has strenuously denied allegations that the hackers are directed or supported by the Russian government or its intelligence services. He has said the claims are "unfounded" and "do not contain anything tangible". "There's no smoking gun," says Alan Woodward, a security consultant who advises Europol and has worked with GCHQ in the past. "But the amount of circumstantial evidence is certainly mounting. "What most of the government agencies are saying is that the Russian government doesn't seem to be doing anything to stop them, which kind of tells a story in itself."

That’s exactly what a robot would say. by Ann Romano MEGYN KELLY Crushing Newt Gingrich like... well, you know... like a newt. Tweet MONDAY, OCTOBER 24 Quick question: Is the world’s worst election over yet, dears? No? It’s still going? Well, that’s bad news for our anxiety. But it’s even worse news for our liver, which is—sorry, liver!—just going to have to deal with the approximately 78 gallons of martinis we chug delicately sip, like a lady, every day we wake up to find ourselves still trapped in this nightmare hellscape. At least there are bursts of unexpected wonderfulness, though—like this week’s run-in between former Speaker of the House/current Donald Trump lickspittle Newt Gingrich and Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly... who is maybe our new fave TV personality? We know—we never thought we’d say that either! But she’s delightful, and for proof, look no further than her bizarre interview with Gingrich, who did not react well when Kelly brought up all of Trump’s sexual assault allegations. “You are fascinated with sex and you don’t care about public policy,” Gingrich ranted at Kelly, adding, “I just want to hear you use the words, ‘Bill Clinton, sexual predator.’ I dare you. Say, ‘Bill Clinton, sexual predator.’” “He’s not on the ticket,” Kelly replied, pointing out the excruciatingly obvious. “The polls also show the American public is less interested in the deeds of Hillary Clinton’s husband than they are in the deeds of the man who asks us to make him president, Donald Trump.” Kelly—who had to say “excuse me” four times as Gingrich rambled like a weirdo pervert—finally managed to shut the bloviating idiot down: “We’re going to have to leave it at that, and you can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them, Mr. Speaker. Thanks for being here.” Let’s raise this martini, dears, to the hope that this is the last we’ll ever hear of Newt Gingrich. (Hey, a girl can drunkenly dream.) TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25 “The press always asks me, don’t I wish I was debating him?” Vice President Joe Biden recently said of Donald Trump. “No, I wish we were in high school and I could take him behind the gym. That’s what I wish.” MEANWHILE... “I’d love that,” Trump snorted when told of Biden’s remarks. “Some things in life you could really love doing.” IN RELATED NEWS... Joe Biden is 73. Donald Trump is 70. This is America in 2016. IN EVEN MORE RELATED NEWS... Where’s Megyn Kelly? What’s she doing right now? Is there some way to block out any and all election news that doesn’t involve Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Elizabeth Warren, and Megyn Kelly? They’re all we need. Just them! Ladies, come over! Joe and Donald can go flail at each other behind a gym somewhere. We’ll make martinis! WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 26 According to the buzzkills at OPB, Google has halted plans to bring their eagerly awaited network Google Fiber to Portland—dashing the hopes of everyone who had hoped for blisteringly fast internet connections that would give a boost to Portland’s businesses, residents, and pornography addicts. (Sorry, Hubby Kip!) ON THE OTHER HAND... Now that we’re thinking about it, forget Google Fiber. In fact, forget the internet. Can we get rid of it? Just until the election is over? It’ll be tough to be without it (especially for Kip), but it’d give all our livers an extra decade or two. THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27 Today, in a verdict that made us want to return our justice system to the manufacturer, Ammon Bundy and his co-defendants in the Malheur Refuge standoff were, unbelievably, declared not guilty. Yes, even though everyone saw them take over a nature refuge at gunpoint and spread terror through the community. (They also chew tobacco—which is just gross.) So why were they let off scot-free? Certain jurors claim the prosecution was unable to prove the conspiracy charge: that Bundyâ€™s buddies had conspired to keep federal employees from coming to work. (Ummm... weâ€™re pretty sure weâ€™d call in sick too, if a bunch of gun-toting yahoos were trashing our office and spitting [ugh] tobacco everywhere.) Despite the prosecutorsâ€™ failings, weâ€™re also fairly certain this gullible jury wouldâ€™ve ruled differently if the Malheur Refuge terrorists were anything but lily white. â€œImagine just for a moment that heavily-armed Black Lives Matter activists took over a federal building,â€ wrote the New York Daily News’ Shaun King. â€œBy and large, unarmed, non-violent peaceful black protestors are arrested on sight when they even block the entrance to a federal building. Many are still facing charges for such simple acts of civil disobedience to this very day and they did nothing like what the Bundy clan did in Oregon.â€ NEED FURTHER PROOF? On this very same day, unarmed Native American protesters in North Dakota, who have been demonstrating against a $3.8 billion pipeline that will block access to water and defile sacred land, were blasted by law enforcement with sound cannons, Tasers, bean-bag rounds, pepper spray (as â€œa preventative measureâ€), and then arrested by the hundreds—simply for standing up for their beliefs. White privilege is real. The Bundy clan just provided more evidence. FRIDAY, OCTOBER 28 More info on the crime of the century: Kim Kardashian’s Parisian hotel robbery in which criminals made off with $5.6 million in jewels! As you recall, the thieves got into Kimâ€™s hotel room by dressing as cops and forcing the hotel concierge to let them in. Now the concierge is telling his side of the story to Entertainment Tonight, claiming the thieves weren’t actually after jewelry, because they kept asking for â€œl’argentâ€ (translated: MONEY). And because Kim doesnâ€™t speak French (and the robbers didnâ€™t speak English), she initially gave them her phone... then her ring... and finally her jewelry box, before they eventually gave up on communicating with her and left with the gems. (Which just goes to show that Kardashians are annoying in any language.) SATURDAY, OCTOBER 29 And if things weren’t already bad enough for Kim Kardashian, today’s news was a dagger through her heart. As it turns out, Queen of the Universe Beyoncé has “never genuinely liked” Kim very much! This OUCH of a story comes from Page Six, who used Kanye West’s recent onstage proclamation about Jay Z (“Our kids ain’t never even played together”) as a jumping-off point, quoting a source close to the family who says Jay and Kanye’s feud started with Queen Bey’s general distaste for Kim. “Beyoncé has never genuinely liked Kim,” the source said. “She’s only tolerated her because of their husbands’ friendship.... The last time they hung out, the minute Beyoncé could leave the conversation, she did.” This would also explain Bey and Jay’s conspicuous absence from Kim and Kanye’s 2014 wedding. “Beyoncé and Jay Z were invited,” the source continued, “and their names were engraved in the marble table for the wedding dinner, but they didn’t show up.” Again... OUCH. Perhaps this story will inspire those French thieves to return Kim’s stolen jewelry—because after all, if Beyoncé doesn’t like you, what else is left? SUNDAY, OCTOBER 30 Speaking of people that Beyoncé probably doesn’t like... Justin Bieber has issued a lengthy non-apology for trying to silence his screaming fans during a concert in Manchester, England, and when he couldn’t, storming off the stage in a huff. Here’s an extremely abridged version of his “apology”: “People tend to want to shut you down,” he wrote. “What I mean by that is... people try to twist things, some people don’t want to listen.” BLAH-BLAH-BLAH get to the non-apology already! “I don’t say the right thing all the time because if that was the case then I’d be a robot, and I’m just, I’m not a robot.” Yeah, because if that were the case, you’d be a pretty shitty robot. GET TO THE FRIKKIN’ POINT, JUSTIN! “All I was simply doing was wanting people to listen; to kind of hear me out a little bit.” We’re quiet! We’re listening! And yet? Still no apology! “I just appreciate you guys tonight, listening to me and understanding.” Sure, we understand... that this WAS NOT AN APOLOGY. Can someone please invent an actual Justin Biebot?

SUBSCRIBE Yandex launches new algorithm named Palekh to improve search results for long-tail queries Did Yandex's new algorithm Palekh just go head to head with Google's RankBrain? Barry Schwartz on November 2, 2016 at 9:46 am More Yandex announced on their Russian blog that they have launched a new algorithm aimed at improving how they handle long-tail queries. The new algorithm is named Palekh, which is the name of a world-famous Russian city that has a firebird on its coat of arms. The firebird has a long tail, and Yandex, the largest Russian search engine, used that as code name for long-tail queries. Long-tail queries are several words entered into the search box, more often seen in voice queries these days. Yandex says about 100 million queries per day fall under the “long-tail” classification within their search engine. The Palekh algorithm allows Yandex to understand the meaning behind every query, and not just look for similar words. Which reminds me of Google RankBrain. I asked Yandex if it is similar to Google’s RankBrain, and they said they “don’t know exactly what’s the technology behind Google’s RankBrain, although these technologies do look quite similar.” Yandex’s Palekh algorithm has started to use neural networks as one of 1,500 factors of ranking. A Yandex spokesperson told us they have “managed to teach our neural networks to see the connections between a query and a document even if they don’t contain common words.” They did this by “converting the words from billions of search queries into numbers (with groups of 300 each) and putting them in 300-dimensional space — now every document has its own vector in that space,” they told us. “If the numbers of a query and numbers of a document are near each other in that space, then the result is relevant,” they added. When I asked if they are using machine learning, Yandex said they do use machine learning and explained that they teach their “neural network based on these queries will lead to some advancements in answering conversational based queries in the future.” Adding that they “also have many targets (long click prediction, CTR, “click or not click” models and so on) that are teaching our neural network — our research has showed that using more targets is more effective.” About The Author Barry Schwartz Barry Schwartz is Search Engine Land's News Editor and owns RustyBrick, a NY based web consulting firm.

SUBSCRIBE Day of the Dead Google doodle marks Mexico’s holiday honoring life & death In addition to the Doodle, Google has included a link pointing to a page about the holiday on its Arts and Culture website . Amy Gesenhues on November 2, 2016 at 9:30 am More Google is following its Halloween Magic Cat Academy doodle by marking Mexico’s Día de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead holiday honoring, as Google puts it, “… the mysteries of life and death.” The two-day holiday, which starts the first of November, began in Mexico as a way to celebrate deceased loved ones. The day is now celebrated around the world. “Every year from November 1–2, both Mexicans and people around the world honor their loved ones with offerings or ofrendas displayed on colorful altars decorated with pictures, bright flowers, candles, and their favorite foods and beverages,” says Google on the Google Doodle Blog. Google’s Day of the Dead image replicates the tissue-paper cutouts often used as decorations for the day. As Google explains, “… the delicate paper banners indicate that life is fragile and fleeting, but it’s also full of beauty and delight.” The doodle leads to a search for “Day of the Dead” and includes the usual sharing icon. Google is displaying the doodle on its US, Mexico and Cuba home pages, as well as its home pages in most South American countries, Portugal and Belarus. In addition to the Doodle, Google included a “Discover the Day of the Dead” link on the home page that points to a page about the holiday on Google’s Arts and Culture site.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US Election World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Here are the 3 Kickstarter crowd-funded gadgets you must check out Bonjour AI-alarm clock, Flip smart stylus and Vue glasses have the potential to make it big in the technology world. Rohit KVN   November 2, 2016 20:00 IST 2 Shares 2 Shares Three promising Kickstarter crowd-funded gadgets to look out forKickstarter Remember the Pebble smartwatch that was pledged from a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in 2012? Since then, it has turned into a huge brand in niche smart wearables segment and has been able to roll out new generation smartwatches with innovative features in the market. Like Pebble, there are several other tech startups across the world, which need funding to bring their new products to the market. Why advertise with us? Related Apple iOS 10.1.1 update released to iPhones, iPads and iPods Digital India: Railways commence use of drones to monitor rail-laying projects Also read: Google Project Tango AR-phone Lenovo Phab 2 Pro finally goes on sale; here's everything you need to know We dug deeper within the Kickstarter website and found some gadgets that should make it big in the tech world: Bonjour AI-alarm clock: Most alarms clocks in the market have become generic these days, as they come with the same features such as radio FM support and customised ring-tones. But these features can be replicated in a smartphone, thus making alarm clocks almost obsolete. Well, France-based company Holi has got a new Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based alarm clock dubbed as Bonjour that can do much more than beeping high-pitched sounds to get you off the bed. With Bonjour, you can wake up to a pleasant voice and interact with it like you converse with another person. In the morning, you don't have to make the effort to press the snooze button, you can just tell it wake you up after five minutes. Bonjour AI-based smart alarm clockKickstarter official page (screen-shot) Another notable feature of this Wi-Fi-based Bonjour clock is that it can connect to the internet and learn your travel routes and also the meetings for the day. And if you forget to the predate the alarm timing, it will intuitively wake you up early to warn you of congestion on the preferred traffic route. It also gathers details of real-time weather forecasts and news updates. You can pledge a minimum of $99 or more to get yourself a Bonjour alarm clock. By doing this, you will also be funding the project. There are several other price tags, which offer more features.  Bonjour smart alarm clock demo video: Holi's Bonjour smart alarm clockHoli via YouTube Flip smart stylus: Flip, the intuitive smart stylus.Kickstarter official page (screenshot) Though stylus has been there for a long time, we haven't seen much development in terms of innovation in the electronic pen sector. For instance, Apple Pencil, which was introduced with the iPad Pro, offers a few functions, such as taking notes and sketching pictures. But it has to be charged if used for long hours, and at $99, it doesn't come cheap. If you are not interested in Apple Pencil, there is an affordable alternative — the Flip, made by the startup, Lynktec. Flip uses a simple and unique method of communication with any iOS device, and includes features like 'flip to erase' and palm rejection. So you can do stuff on the iPhone or iPad just like you would with a pen and paper. And guess what, Flip is powered by just magnets, and you don't have to charge it. The company claims that Flip's patented software algorithms, developed by their software partner Widevantage, use the hardware already in the device (iPhones and iPads) to sense and detect Flip's magnetic field and determine the precise location and orientation of the stylus, so that palm rejection, flip to erase and other features work perfectly without ever needing Bluetooth or batteries. It comes at a starting price of $60 and depending on bundle offers, goes up to $275. Watch the Flip stylus in action here: Flip, the intuitive smart stylusLynktec via YouTube Vue: Remember Google's ambitious pet project Glass, which looked promising at the beginning, but for reasons unknown, was dumped abruptly in February 2016. Google has resumed working on the new eye-mounted device under its 'Project Aura'. While the Google device is still in the development stage, a fully-working and affordable model built by Vue is ready and in need of funds for mass production. In terms of features and design language, Vue smart glasses is several notches above the awkward Google Glass. The latter houses a mini display uncomfortably close to the eye and its usability is very limited. Also, if you get any notification, you have to tilt your head to view it, which may distract you while driving.  The Vue smart glasses, on the other hand, may come across as a normal pair of spectacles from the outside, but they come incorporated with cutting edge technology. Its frame comes with embedded technology, including touch sensors to connect phone call wirelessly, and with the help of 'Bone Conduction' audio speakers it transfers stereo sound right into your inner ear without the use of earbuds. Your ears remain unplugged, so you can listen to music, answer calls, and hear notifications from your glasses while still being able to hear the world around you. It can also track your fitness by calculating your movements and suggest workouts for you to burn more calories. It also comes with a 'Find my glass' option, so you can locate your lost Vue glasses via your smartphone. It has several other value-added features, including wireless charging, navigation assistance and a long battery life of close to seven days.  Vue smart glasses come incorporated with cutting edge technology.Kickstarter official page (screen-shot) If interested, you can pledge a minimum of $5 or more to fund the project, and get yourself a pair of Vue smart glasses for $159 (prescription glasses will cost more).

News and Press Release Distribution, Since 1995 Deliver Your News to the World Sign In Create a Free Account Home News How We Work Compare Services FAQ All WebPost WebPost PPC WebRelease Targeted Media Wire Service Netflix, Apple, Google, Microsoft, YouTube Are Most-Loved Brands, Reveals The Love Index 2016 From Accenture Interactive First-Ever Research Identifies Which Brands People Love Most, and What Companies Can Do to Heighten Love for Their Brands New York, NY – WEBWIRE – Wednesday, November 2, 2016 Netflix, Apple, Google, Microsoft and YouTube are the most-loved brands overall, according to a multi-country study published today by Accenture Interactive and Fjord, its design and innovation unit.   The top three most-loved brands by country include: US: Apple, Microsoft, Netflix UK: Netflix, Google, Apple Brazil: Netflix, YouTube, Google The Love Index 2016 also reveals that Netflix, Fitbit, Amazon, Apple and Facebook are setting the pace in the U.S. for brand experience across industries. Peoples interactions with these brands are raising their expectations for other products and services they use  a digitally-driven phenomenon that Accenture Interactive and Fjord call liquid expectations. The award-winning Love Index, 18 months in the making, is a proprietary, first-of-its kind methodology that identified the characteristics that determine Brand Love, derived through extensive qualitative research and quantitative surveys. For its 2016 benchmark, more than 26,000 people in the U.S., U.K. and Brazil rated more than 70 brands in the auto, banking, hospitality and retail industries. Respondents also named their favorite top of mind brands, on an unaided basis.   The Love Index is a repeatable and measurable system for evaluating brand performance in any sector and in any market. It complements prevailing brand health tools such as the Net Promoter Score, which asks respondents about their likelihood to recommend a particular product or service. The Love Index takes it a step further by identifying five algorithmically-derived dimensions by which to measure customers attitudes toward their physical and digital brand experiences, resulting in a brand love score. The framework and findings can be used as a diagnostic tool to help brands design for brand love.   Our research tells us people use five characteristics  Fun, Relevant Engaging, Social and Helpful  to describe and rate their experiences with brands, says Nan Nayak, Fjords managing director of design strategy and head researcher. Weve found that many of the traits people seek in their human relationships also apply to their relationships with brands. The Love Index reveals why people love brands, and what companies can do to increase and sustain that love.   FRESH PERSPECTIVE    The shape of love is plotted in a five-dimensional space, with one point for each of the FRESH dimensions: Fun  Holds my attention in an entertaining way Relevant  Gives me clear and customized information I want, when I want it Engaging  Identifies with my individual needs and wants Social  Helps me connect with others Helpful  Is efficient, easy and adapts over time The index identified which companies set the pace for each dimension. In the U.S., Netflix is the experience leader for Fun; Fitbit for Relevant; Amazon for Helpful; Apple for Engaging; and Facebook for Social.   THE NETFLIX EFFECT Netflix is the most-loved brand across all three markets, the research reveals. Americans, Brits and Brazilians all ranked the streaming service #1 for Fun and in the top three across other dimensions. Whether they like it or not, other brands  independent of their industry  will be measured against the experience Netflix provides its customers, says Baiju Shah, global co-lead, Fjord and managing director, Accenture Interactive. This is liquid expectations fully at play.   THE SHAPE OF OPPORTUNITY   The Love Index shows that each industry, as measured by six brands (five traditional, one disrupter), has its own distinct shape reflecting what people love most.   For instance, retail brands are most loved for being Relevant, Engaging and Helpful. But the shape these scores create is informed by decades of peoples shopping experiences. A brick-and-mortar brand or start-up looking to differentiate itself could redefine the shopping experience by introducing new ways for people to connect with each other (Social) in an engaging and sustained way (Fun) -- online or in-store.   In an era of digital disruption, we expect to see brands stretch themselves across one or more dimensions to differentiate and keep pace with experience leaders, Nayak adds. These investments will lead to rising scores, creating a new shape altogether  for the individual brands or for their industry as a whole. We call the driving force behind this business revolution the shape of opportunity.   Please visit accenture.com/loveindex2016 for additional findings, methodology, or to learn how Accenture Interactive and Fjord can help companies increase their brand affinity.   About Accenture Accenture (NYSE: ACN) is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.

Casey Laptop MagNovember 2, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share By now, you know not to click on suspicious-looking links, but did you know there's malicious software lurking behind Google's AdWords links? A newly discovered malware campaign targeted Mac users looking to download the Chrome web browser, but instead gave them a ton of adware that peppered their screens with spam. shutterstock 281147924More Image: Mon's Images / Shutterstock.com This scam was discovered by researchers at Cylance, an Irvine, CA-based antivirus firm, which disclosed the feature to Google on October 25 and published the news yesterday (Nov. 1). Google removed the malicious ads, but it's important to know how the scam works, because there is serious potential for others to use this attack vector to spread more dangerous malware. MORE: 12 Computer Security Mistakes You’re Probably Making Users who used Google.com to search for 'google chrome' received a legitimate link to download the browser in their results, but the AdWords result at the top of the page didn't direct users to the "www.google.com/chrome/" address it displayed. Instead, it redirects macOS users through a series of websites before opening the page "googlechromelive[.]com" which offers a free download of Google Chrome. fakeMore Do not click 'Free Download' on googlechromelive[.]com Clicking on that download button sent Mac users through another series of web pages before their browser automatically downloaded a malware file named 'FLVPlayer.dmg.' Running the application inside of that DMG package opened a webpage for MacPurifier, a 'scareware' program that tells users their system is riddled with viruses and that they need to download more programs, that are likely also scams. Running the FLCPlayer.dmg file also downloads an installer for FastPlayer, a media player program that fills your screen with ads. What should you do? First of all, always pay attention to the addresses of the sites you open. Just because a link or ad looked safe doesn't mean the content it sends you to is legitimate. Hovering your mouse over the link should reveal the destination. If your Mac's screen is filled with ads and you're concerned that you've accidentally downloaded malware onto your system, download Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac, (or for PC), which is trustworthy and should eradicate those evil apps. Any decent antivirus program should also fight off these malware threats, so here are our favorite options for Mac antivirus software.

Close share panel × Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The hackers are thought to have Russian links, but it is not known where they are based Microsoft's Windows chief has accused a notorious group of hackers - previously linked to Russia - of making use of an unpatched flaw in its operating system. Terry Myerson said Strontium was exploiting the bug to infect PCs in order to get access to potentially sensitive data. Strontium is also known as APT28 and Fancy Bear, and has previously been blamed for attacking a French TV network and the US Democratic Party. Microsoft says it is working on a fix. It intends to release the patch next week. Other cybersecurity researchers say analysis of the hackers' previous activities suggests they are Russians, or at least citizens of a neighbouring country who can speak Russian, and appear to be acting in Moscow's interests rather than for personal profit. FireEye - a company whose clients include the US Department of Defense - has gone so far as to say the attackers are "most likely sponsored by the Russian government". But the link has never been conclusively proven, and the Kremlin has repeatedly denied its involvement. Why are we hearing about this now? Image copyright PA Image caption Google blogged about Microsoft's flaw at the start of the week It's unusual for the big tech companies to reveal a software flaw in their products before they have a fix, because it flags the problem to cybercriminals. Indeed, Microsoft had planned to stay quiet about this bug until it had a solution. But Google forced its hand when it published details of the issue on Monday. Microsoft was irked. But Google justified its move saying: "This vulnerability is particularly serious because we know it is being actively exploited." What is Microsoft telling us? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Terry Myerson wrote about the attack, following Google's blog about the matter Mr Myerson has confirmed the issue is with a system file, which Windows requires to display graphics. The company says customers using both the latest version of Windows 10 and Microsoft's own Edge web browser should be safe but acknowledges others remain at risk. However, it says the attack only works if a user also has Flash installed, and a newly released version of Adobe's media plug-in also provides protection. Regarding Strontium itself, Microsoft says the hackers have come up with more types of novel attack - known as zero-days - than any other tracked group this year. "Strontium frequently uses compromised email accounts from one victim to send malicious emails to a second victim and will persistently pursue specific targets for months until they are successful in compromising the victims' computers," Mr Myerson wrote. "Once inside, Strontium moves laterally throughout the victim network, entrenches itself as deeply as possible to guarantee persistent access, and steals sensitive information." How did Strontium compromise its initial targets? Image copyright Microsoft Image caption Strontium's past spearphishing campaigns have included emails that pretended to be from Microsoft itself The hackers are believed to have used spearphishing - a technique that involves targeting specific individuals with emails and other messages that seek to fool them into revealing their logins. The attackers have a reputation for being persistent. They have been known to repeatedly send messages to high-value individuals for more than a year, if necessary, until one succeeds. Who is being targeted? Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The hackers' phishing campaigns have been traced back to 2007 Neither Google nor Microsoft have said who received the latest batch of booby-trapped emails. But Microsoft has previously said of the hackers' typical prey: "Its primary institutional targets have included government bodies, diplomatic institutions, and military forces and installations in Nato member states and certain Eastern European countries. "Additional targets have included journalists, political advisers, and organisations associated with political activism in Central Asia." What else do we know about Strontium? Image copyright Fancy Bears The group has also been called Sofacy, Sednit and Pawn Storm, and has been linked to attacks dating back to 2007. It appears to operate its own website, where it calls itself Fancy Bears. It was used to leak confidential medical files about US Olympic athletes earlier this year, which had been stolen from the World Anti-Doping Agency. The site suggests the group is part of the wider Anonymous hacktivist collective, although this may be an attempt at misdirection. Months earlier, cybersecurity company Crowdstrike accused the hackers of breaching the US Democratic Party's governing body's network. It suggested they might be affiliated with the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service. "Their tradecraft is superb, operational security second to none, and the extensive usage of 'living-off-the-land' techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter," it said in a report. Other activities blamed on the team include: attacks on three YouTube bloggers who had interviewed President Obama in January 2016 a breach that nearly destroyed France's media company TV5Monde in April 2015. The company's TV network went off air, and its website was defaced with messages that initially appeared to have been created by so-called Islamic State sympathisers a hack of the Bundestag's computer network that was discovered in May 2015. About 20,000 accounts belonging to German politicians and officials were thought to have been compromised attempts in 2015 to steal data from safety investigators looking into the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine a year earlier at least two attempts to steal data from the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs around 2013, and a further attempt to target the country's Ministry of Defence Are only Windows computers at risk ? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Apple's devices have been targeted in the past, but are not vulnerable to the latest exploit No. Security company Trend Micro has previously linked the hackers to malware designed to infect jailbroken iPhones and iPads. Microsoft says it has also observed the group using web domains customised to compromise Mac and Linux computers in other campaigns. Is the Kremlin really to blame? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly denied that Russia is hacking other countries In the past, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has strenuously denied allegations that the hackers are directed or supported by the Russian government or its intelligence services. He has said the claims are "unfounded" and "do not contain anything tangible". "There's no smoking gun," says Alan Woodward, a security consultant who advises Europol and has worked with GCHQ in the past. "But the amount of circumstantial evidence is certainly mounting. "What most of the government agencies are saying is that the Russian government doesn't seem to be doing anything to stop them, which kind of tells a story in itself."

Surface, is seen as he unveils the new Microsoft Surface Book laptop during the Windows 10 Devices event in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2015. The company isn't releasing a patch until Nov. 8 Microsoft said that a hacker group linked to Russia as well as recent breaches of U.S. political parties and campaigns is using a previously unknown flaw in Windows software to conduct computer network intrusions. Google security engineers revealed the existence of the computer bug in a blog post on Monday after warning Microsoft of the finding, but before the company had issued a patch. Google said it had a responsibility “to protect users,” since the vulnerability was actively being used to compromise people’s systems. Microsoft posted more details about the attacks the next day and said that it would release a patch on Nov. 8, its next software update day and election day in the U.S. Microsoft noted that the attackers using the flaw had been sending spear-phishing emails, or targeted messages intended to deceive recipients into disclosing personal information or into installing malware on their machines. Microsoft’s threat intelligence team called the attacker group “Strontium,” but many people know the group by other names, including “APT28,” “Sofacy,” or “Fancy Bear. Cybersecurity experts have previously linked this group to the Russian government and, more specifically, to its foreign intelligence agency the GRU. The cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike made waves earlier this year when it attributed an attack on the Democratic National Committee to the same group—an attribution that has since been backed publicly by the U.S. intelligence community. “This attack campaign, originally identified by Google’s Threat Analysis Group, used two zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and the down-level Windows kernel to target a specific set of customers,” wrote Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Windows and devices at Microsoft, analyzing the attacks. He added that group tended to leapfrog from one compromised email account to the next, ensnaring victims by sending booby-trapped messages to their contacts. Myerson added that Microsoft “has attributed more 0-day exploits to STRONTIUM than any other tracked group in 2016.” Here’s how the Russia-linked hacker group worked. First, the team would gain a foothold in victims’ machines by commandeering their web browsers. It would do this by exploiting an unknown flaw (also known as a zero-day vulnerability) in Adobe Flash software—a bug that Adobe patched in an update on Oct. 26. Next the group would break out of the victim’s browser, escalating privileges (in the industry parlance), through the Windows vulnerability. Microsoft noted that users of its Windows 10 Anniversary Update “are known to be protected from versions of this attack observed in the wild.” Finally, the hacker group would install a backdoor, or security-bypassing control program, to take over the target’s machine. Microsoft said it was disappointed by Google’s disclosure before the release of a fix. “Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” Myserson said. Google, on the other hand, maintained that disclosing known and “actively exploited” vulnerabilities is in the interest of people seeking to secure their systems.

What is it and how can you put it to use for your website? There are many ways to let Google and other search engines know what your page is about. Next to writing awesome content, which should always be your starting point, we have also written about schema.org before. JSON-LD is a (relatively) new way to present schema.org data about your content to search engines. It comes with a few major benefits, so let’s dive in. What is JSON-LD? First, let’s look into what JSON-LD stands for, so we can really understand what it does. JSON-LD, or JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data, is a method of encoding Linked Data using JSON. (Wikipedia) Optimize your site for search & social media and keep it optimized with Yoast SEO Premium »Buy now » Info Let’s dissect that: JSON JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format, which is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. LD Linked Data is about using the internet to connect related data. JSON-LD is a combination of both. So it’s a code snippet that tells you what price belongs to what product, or what zip code belongs to what company. Basically, instead of adding schema.org attributes to individual elements on a page, you’re providing a small block of JavaScript code that has all that info. Why use Schema.org? What we are talking about here, is structured data for your website. Schema.org provide ways to present your information to Google in a machine readable way. With that structured data you create the option for Google to show your content in two Google Search categories: Rich results, which means your added content, like the price of your product, its rating and / or its availability, is literally shown in the search results as additional information in your snippet. Site links search boxes, if your site is eligible, a feature already supported by our Yoast SEO plugin. Knowledge Graph cards. This one is a bit harder, as you’ll have to prove first that you are the authority for certain content. After you have done so, Google might include your data into the Knowledge Graph. As you can see, it’s really interesting to optimize your site using Schema.org. Why JSON-LD? The methods that were used to implement schema.org before JSON-LD was available, were cumbersome. You had to add schema.org attributes to pieces of code in your markup. The markup might have to change from page to page, even though you were including the same header everywhere, for instance. This made schema.org a pain to implement. For us as plugin (and thus back-end) developers, it pushed it entirely into the realm of front-end development. JSON-LD allows you (and us) to collect all the data about your product and show them in one, small, piece of JavaScript code, that can just be pushed anywhere into the page. This allows you to work on a schema.org implementation using JSON-LD, independently of your theme development. You can add basically any schema to your JSON-LD block, even breadcrumbs: @seerl We support JSON-LD breadcrumbs. The docs should be updated at some point too :) — John Mueller (@JohnMu) August 12, 2016 In fact, in its own documentation, Google often states JSON-LD is the easiest way to add metadata to sites. It’s the option that is least likely to break when you make other changes to your site. Adding the script to your website Luckily, JSON+LD is set up in a standardized format. Here’s an example of that format for a random product: <script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org/",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "Yoast SEO for WordPress",
  "image": "https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2010/10/Yoast_SEO_WP_plugin_FB.png",
  "description": "Yoast SEO is the most complete WordPress SEO plugin. It handles the technical optimization of your site & assists with optimizing your content.",

  },
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "price": "69.00"
  }
}
</script> You can use any schema.org schema in JSON-LD. After adding a new JSON-LD script to your website, be sure to validate your code using the Google’s structured data test tool. As you can see, this can easily be templated in your theme. There are generators like this one, which can be useful in setting up a template for that. If you are using WordPress, there are obviously plugins that can help you out as well. Yoast SEO already uses JSON-LD to add information about your site search, your site name, your logo and your social profiles to your web pages.

Many bloggers want to be using JSON-LD for their recipe markup but don’t want to lose their rich pins since Pinterest does not yet support JSON-LD. Some bloggers are getting around this by using both schema.org and JSON-LD markup. Do you see any issue with this setup as it creates duplicate content? Is it safer to stick with scheme.org until Pinterest adds the support needed for rich pins? Reply By Michiel Heijmans on 3 November, 2016 I would for sure add both, to be honest. Bing still doesn’t mention JSON-LD in its webmaster tools, for instance, so Pinterest isn’t the only one that’s not (fully) using it. Reply By Rich Owings on 3 November, 2016 Shay, Michiel is right. Check this out: http://www.thesempost.com/marking-content-json-ld-microdata-not-risk-google/ Reply By Vincenzo Coppolecchia on 3 November, 2016 Hey there, hi and thank you! I’m working on a website that shows dairy products with WooCommerce and I’d like to extend the basic schema.org available with the informations I have in the nutritional tables. available in the single product page. This seems not strictly appropriate: https://schema.org/NutritionInformation Which schema should I use? Thanks! Reply By Michiel Heijmans on 4 November, 2016 The nice thing about schema is that you really don’t have to include all the elements of a schema. It’s not that strict in terms of validation. You can easily use the elements that apply and leave the rest out. Just be sure to add the right itemtype everytime you add another. Reply By SEO Lady Nina on 3 November, 2016 I came to the comments to ask about a WordPress plugin recommendation then I spotted your link at the end of the article. Perfectly explained thank you. Reply By Zach Jenkins on 4 November, 2016 Do you know of any plugins or something that works with Yoast that can help automate JSON-LD? At least adding article schema so you don’t have to construct the markup for every single page? Reply By Michiel Heijmans on 4 November, 2016 You can find a number of plugins in WordPress.org’s plugin repo that you could test, like this one. Disclaimer: haven’t tested that one, it’s just one I can across. But using functions, you could also construct a code snippet yourself and add that to your single.php file? Reply By Zach Jenkins on 4 November, 2016 Thanks Michiel, I’ll take a look at both options and give them a shot. I can’t wait for more of this to be integrated into things going forward.

As MT readers know, the usual complaints about Capitol Hill are that it moves too slowly for, or that lawmakers simply don’t understand, the needs of the country’s tech heartland. This often means that long-standing disputes over immigration, surveillance and patent reform go unresolved. Story Continued Below — But four potential new faces — two tech-savvy Democrats in California, a merger critic in New York and a former FCC top gun in New Jersey — could help change the tide if they’re victorious — and perhaps use their new congressional posts to shine a light on some of the Valley’s most pressing policy needs. Read our analysis on moves that might (or might not) be taken by the foursome: Ro Khanna, running in California’s 17th congressional District; Zephyr Teachout, in NY-19; California Attorney General Kamala Harris, running for Senate; and Josh Gottheimer, bidding for the House seat from NJ-05. More, here. WIKILEAKS: DICKERSON WAS EYED FOR ‘ERIC SCHMIDT PROJECT’ — A new email released by WikiLeaks from the hack of Clinton campaign chief John Podesta details how, in the summer of 2014, the campaign was eager to recruit Mikey Dickerson — the Google manager who’d made a name for himself in helping to rescue HealthCare.gov — to head up The Groundwork. That’s the startup founded by Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman, to develop digital organizing tools for the campaign. “We are desperately trying to get him to oversee the Eric Schmidt project,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook emailed Podesta, adding: “He’s apparently open to doing it but a little worried about how legit it is and what it means for later on.” — Podesta said he’d make a call, but no matter: Dickerson ultimately didn’t bite. Six weeks later, President Barack Obama would name him administrator of the newly launched U.S. Digital Service.

ACTIVISTS ASK REGULATORS TO HALT AT&T/TIME WARNER MERGER — Grassroots advocacy groups including Demand Progress, CREDO Action and Free Press are touting petitions signed by 115,000 people calling on regulators to block the AT&T/Time Warner deal. “It’s clear that this merger would be a disaster for consumer choice and an open internet,” said Kate Kizer, a campaigner at Demand Progress, whose online petition is headlined: “Do you want another Comcast? We don’t either.” An AT&T spokesman, asked for comment, told MT: “This is a vertical transaction. Time Warner is a content company. We distribute video content. We are combining so that we can bring customers better products and more choices.” GOOGLE EARLY VOTING TRENDS — At the one-week-to-go mark, Clinton had 54 percent of Google search interest, while Trump had 46 percent. Additionally, searches for “Where do I vote early?” spiked 3,200 percent in October, according to a Google spokeswoman, with Maryland, Georgia and North Carolina dominating early voting searches between Monday and Tuesday afternoon. FBI NEVER ASKED FOR DEVICES FROM TOP CLINTON STAFFERS — The recent furor over the FBI’s handling of its probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server has centered on what was done — namely, FBI chief James Comey’s decision to tell Congress in vague terms 11 days before Election Day that an unrelated probe had unearthed new, potentially relevant emails. But there’s also heat on the FBI for what it didn’t do — investigators never requested or demanded all equipment her top aides used for work purposes during Clinton’s four years running State, a source familiar with the investigation told POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein. — The FBI did make a concerted effort to get its hands on all the computers that were used as Clinton’s private server, Josh writes, and ultimately asked two Clinton lawyers for laptops used to review her email. But the new email cache was found on a laptop belonging to disgraced former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top HRC aide Huma Abedin. — The GOP portrayed the newest revelation as evidence that FBI probers paid too much deference to Clinton. “The decision,” Josh writes, “left the FBI at least partially dependent on the aides’ attorneys’ decisions about which messages were work-related and therefore might have contained classified information the agents were looking for.” HOW TO HELP FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS — More than 80 leaders from tech companies, including Dell, Box and TaskRabbit, are offering policy recommendations for the presidential candidates on how best to promote and nurture female entrepreneurs in the U.S. “If women and men participated equally in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, the United States’ GDP could rise by $30 billion,” they write. The letter emphasizes the need to increase access to venture capital; create incentives for firms to invest in women; hire more female-run businesses as government contractors; and continue to maintain small-business lending programs. THE STATE OF OPEN DATA — The Data Foundation and Grant Thornton have a report out this morning that looks at the progress various government agencies have made in increasing the transparency of their data sets — and the challenges they still face. It finds a lack of standardization in how data is uploaded and categorized. “Currently, open data practices are appallingly crude,” writes 18F’S Waldo Jaquith, one of the more than 40 data experts and lawmakers interviewed for the study. Most of those surveyed did agree that the release of government data relating to their field had improved over the last few years. SUNLIGHT SHIFTS — The Sunlight Foundation has found a new home for data tools it can no longer afford to preserve, reports POLITICO’s Kelsey Sutton. ProPublica will now run five federal legislative tools from Sunlight Labs, including Politwoops, the site that tracks deleted tweets from politicians. The Marshall Project is set to take on the Hall of Justice, which includes data and research about criminal justice. And the Center for Responsive Politics, the Commerce Department and Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute will be absorbing two campaign finance tools. Sunlight announced in September plans to cut its staff and suspend its reporting tools and projects. PALANTIR CASE’S IMPACT ON ARMY CONTRACTING — Palantir Technologies’ court victory over the Army's stubborn and bureaucratic acquisition practices could propel the Pentagon’s acceptance of commercial alternatives — a potential development that could benefit tech companies in the future, Pro Defense’s Ellen Mitchell writes. In the case, a judge held Monday that the Army ignored a 1994 law that requires government agencies to explore commercial options before setting out to build capabilities from scratch. So Palantir is now eligible for a $200 million contract related to an Army battlefield data intelligence system. But several experts, including a lead litigator for Palantir in the case — expressed doubt the ruling would open the floodgates on similar legal challenges of Army acquisitions decisions. — Hunter on the hunt: Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican and Palantir backer, is among those doubting that floodgates would open, but said he’s looking for other cases where the Pentagon is stiffing commercial firms: “How many other dozens if not hundreds of cases are like this within the Army, where you have companies that do what the Army needs but they refuse to use it and they refuse to buy it, just because internally, the program managers or the bureaucrats within the Army, don’t like it personally?" He added that getting at the info is hard unless whistleblowers come forward. TRANSITIONS MCDOWELL JOINS COOLEY — Robert McDowell, a Republican FCC Commissioner under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, has jumped to Cooley, a law firm specializing in tech issues, after a stint at Wiley Rein. He’ll focus on issues that affect venture capitalists and startups. “The market is driving a lot of public policy issues around the Internet of Things, including the need for more spectrum, privacy and cybersecurity,” McDowell told MT. He also offered his take on the AT&T/Time-Warner deal: “I can’t think of the last time a vertical merger was shot down.” OBAMA VETERANS HEAD TO GOOGLE — The search giant has snagged two more administration officials. A.J. Bhadelia, a special adviser for tax and budget in legislative affairs at the Treasury Department, has joined the company as a manager for public policy and government affairs. Smita Satiani, deputy director of the White House’s Presidential Innovation Fellows, is heading to the Google X policy team, where she’ll work on efforts including the self-driving car, Project Loon, and Project Wing. QUICK DOWNLOADS DraftKings and FanDuel weighing a merger: The biggest players in online fantasy sports are holding “serious conversations” about joining forces, reports Recode. Insta-commerce: Instagram will let “certain retail partners” tag images so users can purchase the items via a simple click on the tag — mirroring efforts explored by its parent company, Facebook, as well as Pinterest and Twitter, Wired reports. Uber and GM’s Maven partner on car rental program: The ride-sharing company will work with GM’s Maven rental offering on a 90-day pilot in San Francisco, according to Recode. That’s unexpected, given that GM has invested $500 million in Uber’s competitor, Lyft. Airbnb avoids possible class-action suit over discrimination complaints: A federal judge ruled on Tuesday, per the NYT, that the company’s arbitration policy, which is included in its user agreement, prevents users from being able to sue the company in court over allegedly discriminatory treatment from hosts. The Trump bots have it: In the third presidential debate, there were seven times the number of bots tweeting pro-Trump messages than there were ones tweeting Pro-Clinton stuff, based on a paper from Oxford University’s Project on Computational Propaganda. Honda wiggles around ban on taxpayer-funded mailers near Election Day: Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.) is one of at least three incumbent lawmakers in tight races who have sent out mailers paid for by taxpayers and used “a loophole to avoid a pre-election ban on the practice,” report Campaign Pro’s Maggie Severns and Elena Schneider.

The letter, led by the National Association of Manufacturers, stressed the “urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions and to bolster the promise of America.” To #BeTheSolution, let’s start with infrastructure, a bipartisan priority. Let’s rebuild not just our transportation infrastructure but also modernize our energy infrastructure, and pipelines, and broadband infrastructure—to boost America’s quality of life. Less than 1/2 of households in the bottom quintile of the economy have high-speed broadband. With “Building To Win,” we can build a stronger, more inclusive economy.

Google Working On Open-Source TPM 2.0 Implementation Written by Michael Larabel in Google on 2 November 2016 at 10:03 AM EDT. 7 Comments For future Chromebooks/Chromeboxes, Google appears to be building an open-source TPM 2.0 implementation that's possibly backed by open hardware. Their own TPM (Trusted Platform Module) 2.0 implementation can be found in their Git code and here plus more code here. The TPM 2.0 implementation uses a Cortex-M3 core and there's also an FPGA version. It will be interesting to see where this TPM2 work by Google leads. Google has used (closed) TPM modules on Chromebooks as part of their security apparatus. Seeing more Google TPM2 open-source references come as we are still looking to learn more about Google's "Eve" Kabylake Chromebook.

(Photo: The Motley Fool) SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft says it will release a patch next week to address vulnerabilities in its Windows operating system exploited by a group reportedly tied to the Russian government and linked to the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee. The group, called Strontium by Microsoft but Fancy Bear or APT 28 by other security researchers, has been tied to Russian state-sponsored hacking. U.S. government intelligence agencies have said Russian groups were behind attempts to interfere with this year's U.S. presidential election. USA TODAY U.S. formally points finger at Russians over hacking Strontium has targeted government agencies, diplomatic institutions, military organizations, plus defense contractors and public policy research institutes, Microsoft's executive vice president of Windows and devices group Terry Myerson said in a blog post on Wednesday. "Strontium frequently uses compromised e-mail accounts from one victim to send malicious e-mails to a second victim and will persistently pursue specific targets for months until they are successful in compromising the victims’ computer," said Myerson. Myerson did not directly link Strontium to Russia, only that it has been used "to target a specific set of customers." Strontium is Fancy Bear However, according to CrowdStrike, an Irvine, Calif.-based computer security company  that published a detailed analysis of the attack on the Democratic National Committee intrusion in June, Strontium is simply another name for the group called Fancy Bear, a Russian intelligence-affiliated adversary. The exploits used by Strontium involve versions of Windows going back to Vista as well as Adobe's Flash, according to Myserson. Microsoft says the group launched a campaign involving spear phishing, where users will receive a malicious email disguised as a message from a friendly individual or business. If successful, hackers using the exploits could gain access to a victim's computer. A patch is expected by November 8. "Patches for all versions of Windows are now being tested by many industry participants," said Myerson. The patch doesn't mean that Strontium will no longer be able to launch attacks, merely that it will need to find new vulnerabilities. FancyBear/Strontium has a history of using so-called “zero day vulnerabilities.” That means security holes in software that are unknown and therefore have not been patched, ones companies do not realize they must protect against. “At this point, they’ve probably got others that they could deploy if they’ve got a target that’s sufficiently important,” said Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at Crowdstrike. Google's disclosure: 'disappointing' The exploits were first discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group, and shared publicly on Monday. Myerson called Google's decision to share details of the vulnerabilities "disappointing," adding it puts customers at risk. "We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure," said Myerson. In Google's statement detailing the exploit, threat analysis group members Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard say they first reported the vulnerabilities privately on October 21. Google says Adobe addressed the exploit five days later. "After 7 days, per our published policy for actively exploited critical vulnerabilities, we are today disclosing the existence of a remaining critical vulnerability in Windows for which no advisory or fix has yet been released," says Mehta and Leonard. "This vulnerability is particularly serious because we know it is being actively exploited." Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.

At the same time, a single photo on the iPhone takes up a lot more space as compared to other smartphones. Apple's iCloud services too are quite expensive for an average iPhone-user to afford. And even though you can backup your photos through iTunes on a Mac or a Windows PC, it's not always that we have access to our PCs when we are running out of storage and desperate to free up a few gigabytes. Android users have it easy. First, they get a good 100GB storage space with their Google Drive account. And then, Android phones come with USB On-The-Go support that allows Android phones to be compatible with most plug-and-play USB devices including a mouse, keyboard and most importantly, a flash drive or an external hard disk. 1. If you happen to have an iPhone and you naturally happen to click a lot of photos on it which eats up all the space, there is a solution for your woes. 2. All you need is an USB thumb drive with a Lightning connector to transfer the photos directly to the flash drive from your iPhone's Camera Roll. 3. The Sandisk iXpand flash drive is the perfect fit for the job. It comes with in 16GB, 32GB, 64GB and 128GB variants and has an additional Lightning connector along with the standard USB port to connect to a PC. The 16GB variant comes for Rs 2,598 on Amazon India and goes all the way up to Rs 7,480 for the 128GB variant. 4. For short term storage, long enough for you to transfer them to your PC when you have the time, the 16GB variant will work. 5. The flash drive comes with the Sandisk iXpand sync app for iOS that will sync your Camera Roll with the thumb drive, so that the moment you plug in the flash drive, your iPhone will automatically start to backup all the photos and videos. 6. What's more, if you happen to be a privacy freak, you can encrypt the photos that you backup on the flash drive with a flash drive which can then be unlocked either using the password or TouchID.

Despite patches deployed directly by Google every month, the slowness of intermediaries such as carriers and OEMs has put the whole platform in a position of uncertainty, especially when compared with the more vertically integrated iOS. Of course, however, Android’s director of security Adrian Ludwig disagrees… Speaking to Vice’s Motherboard following a security conference in Manhattan yesterday, Ludwig remarked Google’s advancements in securing its mobile platform, and putting it in direct comparison with its rival. “For almost all threat models, they are nearly identical in terms of their platform-level capabilities,” he said. Among the other questions raised was a more direct face-off of the iPhone with Google’s new Pixel, and when asked whether the two are equal when it comes to security, Ludwig replied saying “for sure”, not mincing his words. And actually, according to the report, he also added that Android will soon “be better”. Apparently, “In the long term, the open ecosystem of Android is going to put it in a much better place,” as per Ludwig, without however giving any further explanation. He did touch on Android’s built-in security product called “Safety Net”, though, stating that the service scans about 400 million devices and over 6 billion apps every single day. The results of these checks matched with the security measures already built into the OS make sure that a very small number of devices is left out and thus potentially subject of malware — or, in Google’s terms, PHAs, Potentially Harmful Applications. In a graph Ludwig showed at the conference, in fact, less than 1% of Android devices resulted affected. To expand on the point, he brought last year’s much-discussed Stagefright security breach into the conversation, stating that despite the discovery of several critical bugs, a real-life hack on an Android device is yet to be seen. “At this point we still don’t have any confirmed instances of exploitation in the wild,” he said. This obviously doesn’t mean that there isn’t much left to do, from both Google’s side as well as the carriers’ and the manufacturers’. “We got quite a bit of work left to do to get to a point where that actually happens on a regular basis across the whole the ecosystem,” Ludwig said. But as far as big, platform-wise harmful exploitations, we should be tranquil, as targeting a large number of people simultaneously is “almost impossible”.

To make it easier to find things, Seattle-based Atlas Informatics launched Atlas Recall, which lets you search for anything you’ve ever looked at on your computer. Atlas Informatics founder and CEO Jordan Ritter calls the software “a photographic memory for your digital life.” In a demonstration to CNNMoney, that proved to be a fairly accurate assessment. Once installed, Atlas Recall displays personalized search results from the app, desktop search, or Google search. This includes web pages, emails, Slack chats, Netflix films, Spotify songs, or anything else that’s appeared in front of your eyes on your screen. Let’s say you’re planning a wedding. You can search for “wedding,” and Atlas Recall will pull up calendar appointments, emails from your wedding party, websites of flower companies, photos of wedding dresses, the Spotify playlist you listened to when emailing your fiancé, and the Facebook wedding planning group you’re a part of. You can search by keyword, content type or time, and it displays all related information based on relevancy. For instance, if two documents were open at the same time and you toggled between them, they will both appear whether or not they contain a keyword. Once installed on your hard drive and browser, Atlas Recall runs in the background and begins collecting your activity. The company captures all the content you’ve looked at and stores it on its servers. So how does it work? Computers have built-in features for people with disabilities to use hardware and software. These features — like Apple’s VoiceOver — use accessibility APIs, the programming tools that pass information between the computer and the user. Atlas Recall taps into these tools and indexes all the data shared on-screen. Though Atlas Recall is a unique product, it’s similar to Google’s ecosystem that saves and tracks everything you do. When you’re logged in to Google services, it collects and saves your activity, from where you go via Google Maps, to appointments you make with Google Calendar. You can search these services to find personal data. But Atlas Recall takes that behavior and applies it to literally everything you do with your computer. “The platform wars are over, nobody won, and no one will ever win them again,” Ritter told CNNMoney. “We now have diverse sets of apps and platforms and services, and we move fluidly between all of them. What we want is something that works the way we use our devices and data.” The tool understandably raises privacy concerns. Ritter, cofounder of Napster and no stranger to controversial file-sharing, said all the data is encrypted while it’s transferred to Atlas Cloud and stored in its servers. You can block Atlas from reading and indexing links, files, and apps — say, block it from reading your Gmail — remove stored data, or pause Atlas Recall so it’s not running in the background indefinitely. Atlas Recall is launching in beta on Wednesday for Apple devices running macOS Sierra or OS X El Capitan. It also has a compatible iPhone app that lets you search for items, but does not index content from your phone. Ritter said an app for Windows 10 is coming soon. The search engine is the first product from Atlas Informatics, and it’s free for people to try out while in beta. The company plans to charge for premium features in the future. The Emerald City startup has raised $20.7 million from investors including Microsoft, Nathan Myhrvold and Aspect Ventures.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Monday, November 14, 2016 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 7204 63 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

The Indian team, backed by Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani, is among the three top contenders for the Google's Lunar XPRIZE competition, looking to win $30 million cheque for the first mission to land on the moon. In addition, the lunar rover has to travel 500 metres on the moon's surface while transmitting high resolution images to earth. Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) will build an extended version of its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) to carry the lunar rover and lander to the moon. Antrix Corp, the commercial arm of Isro signed the deal with Team Indus, an Antrix official confirmed the development. Team Indus declined comment. Isro had used the workhorse PSLV on its Chandrayaan-1 mission, when it sent a satellite that orbited the moon, besides crashing on its the earth's satellite to discover abundant water. For the Team Indus mission, Isro plans to replicate the sling shot approach it took for Chandrayaan-1 to hurl the lunar lander and rover away from the earth's gravity and land on the moon's surface. Team Indus has identified Mare Imbrium, latin for Sea of Showers, a vast dusty area on the Moon to land the spacecraft just at the just at the break of the lunar dawn, to help make the most of the lunar day. "We will hopefully be the first privately funded spacecraft to land on any extraterrestrial body. We are extremely proud because this entire design has been done indigenously. We've had a lot of consultants from international countries, we're also sourcing a lot of components internationally, but this is 100 per cent indigenously designed," said Rahul Narayan, co-founder at TeamIndus in June.. TeamIndus is in a race to beat Israeli team SpaceIL which has scheduled its launch for the second half of 2017. SpaceIL has secured its ticket to the moon aboard US-based private space firm SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. In order to win the $30 million XPRIZE competition, a team has to land on the moon's surface and travel a distance of 500 metres whilst transmitting high-resolution images.

The cool part, it is in pink and in the form of tissue-paper cutouts. Google said today's "Doodle captures the intricate tissue-paper cutouts that have been used in Mexican celebrations since the 18th century." Adding that "on Día de los Muertos, the bright, delicate paper banners indicate that life is fragile and fleeting, but it's also full of beauty and delight." Day of the Dead is a Mexican holiday celebrated in many regions Google is displaying the logo, as described above. It is a holiday that "focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and help support their spiritual journey," according to Wikipedia. It happens over multiple days. Forum discussion at Google+.

We discussed the concept of the real time algorithms when Penguin 4.0 launched. In short, you make a change to your site, Google's crawlers pick up on the change and then your rankings should automatically adjust soon after. I asked John Mueller of Google this in yesterday's hangout at the 48 minute mark. I asked: John, is that algorithm -- you have to run it manually and it checks the website? Or it's constant like real time? So when you remove ads that might be causing the algorithm to penalize the website or downgrade the website, if you remove the ads, will it-- once Google reprocesses or reindexes the page-- will it automatically bump up? Or it has to be run manually? John replied: That's pretty much automatic in the sense that it's probably not live, one-to-one. We just would recalled this, therefore, we know exactly what it looks like. But it is something that's updated automatically. And it is something where when you change those pages, you don't have to wait for any manual update on our side for that to be taken into account. He did not say the words "real time" but he said it is automated and implied no algorithm needs to rerun. Here is the video embed: Forum discussion at Google+.

Juan Liam Leonardo 11/02/2016 04:30 pm Forbes have some kind of manual whitelist shit going on, no way should Google rank them that hight. But at the same time Google's rules are bs since their own site goes against almost every tip they give to webmasters. Put content before ads -- my Chromebook's sceen first page is filled with ads when I'm not using adblock. They shoult penalize their own sites that live on google.com/* domain. Speaking of, Adsense devs have some hardcore SEO's working for them since they have changed the title (not long ago) "Make Money Online through Website Monetization – Google AdSense" -- it sounds just like they hired someone from blackhatforums, haha. Simon 11/02/2016 04:39 pm It's unclear why Forbes ranks at all. Full screen interstitials, massively ad-heavy and content that is largely Panda-fodder. Michael Martinez 11/03/2016 03:07 pm That's not what I said.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Mobile World FLASH SALE: VDownloader      50% OFF! Google Considers Adding Fingerprint Recognition Gestures to Nexus 5X and 6P GO The solution might be provided via a software update Nov 2, 2016 12:50 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Android fans who bought the Pixel/Pixel XL have access to some exclusive features that aren't available on any other smartphone, not even in Google's Nexus lineup. For example, Google included a fingerprint sensor gesture where Pixel/Pixel XL users can “swipe” it to access the notification shade. However, this feature hasn't been provided on the Nexus devices yet. Although many Nexus owners claimed that their phones' hardware should support this specific gesture, things aren't as simple as we might think at first glance. The good news is Google might have taken all this feedback into consideration and there's a slight chance that it will make the fingerprint scanner gesture available on at least two other Nexus devices. According to AndroidPolice, Google's PR has confirmed that the search giant is “evaluating” a firmware update for the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, which is supposed to add support for the fingerprint scanner gesture that's now exclusively available on the Pixel phones. Obviously, this isn't a confirmation that Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P owners should expect to get the fingerprint scanner gesture very soon, but at least there's hope that another feature that's been provided to Pixel users will be available for a larger audience. Nexus 6P This isn't the only feature that Google hasn't enable on its Nexus phones, though, which suggests that the search giant really wants as many as Nexus users to switch to its new Pixel phones in order to benefit from all the functionalities they have to offer. For example, the Pixel Launcher is currently exclusive to Pixel phones, even though, to some extent, the development scene has found a way to include it on other smartphones as well. No additional details on the possible firmware update for the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P have been provided by Google, but they did say that we should “stay tuned” for more information on the matter, so fingers crossed.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Pixel phone#Nexus 5X#fingerprint sensor gesture#Nexus 6P#Pixel XL phone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Some Google Pixel XL Owners Report Manufacturing Defects in Their Phones Google Assistant Can Share Articles to Twitter and Google+ Google's Pixel Phone Is 50% Off at T-Mobile Google Posts Video on Switching from an iPhone to a Pixel OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE Salix Xfce 14.2 Live Edition Released, It's Based on Xfce 4.12 & Slackware 14.2 2 photos    Google Pixel family New Android APKs Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments Samsung Already Capable of Mass Producing Foldable Smartphones but It's Cautious more on: Samsung foldable phone i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Google's cloud archive becomes a place for low-access rate objects that can't be deleted, while higher access rate objects remain in Cloudian's on-premises object store. The resulting two-tier object store is managed as a single resource. Cloudian CEO and co-founder Michael Tso said that although objects could go to Coldline, their metadata stayed on-premises in the Cloudian array for faster data discovery. In effect an object "stub", the metadata, remains behind when the object is moved, analogous to the old file virtualisation products. That means object search speeds are not affected by tiering off to the cloud. Policies can be set up to automatically migrate qualifying objects to Coldline. Cloudian's HyperStore product has had a a Coldline API added to it. Unlike Amazon's Glacier, which takes three to five hours before data retrieval starts, Coldline has a relatively low latency retrieval profile, with data transfer to your site starting in less than a second. El Reg expects other on-premises object stores to add Google Cloudline back-end support in the coming weeks and months. Cloudian doesn't want us to forget that, while cuddling up to Goog, it guarantees full interoperability with all Amazon S3-enabled applications offered by vendors such as Adobe, Computer Associates, Commvault, Citrix, IBM, Veritas, Red Hat, and others. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 1 Comment Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Google has now integrated a series of "spells" into the assistant, meaning that users are able to say "Ok Google," followed by a spell from the magical world of J.K. Rowling's imagination. For instance, uttering "Lumos" turns on the phone's flashlight, while "Silencio" turns off the ringer and any incoming notifications. As well as promoting the newest Harry Potter spinoff, these interactions with Google Now provide a fun introduction to the kinds of commands that can be carried out by the smart assistant ordinarily and will perhaps introduce Android users with new ways to execute commands.

Comments Computerworld | Nov 2, 2016 4:18 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Smartphones Android Emerging Technology Comments Reality is all the craze these days. Augmented reality, that is. Which is why it is a pretty big deal that Lenovo has released the Phab 2 Pro, the first augmented reality smartphone to work with Google Tango, the tech giant's AR software. So what is the phone like to use? In IT Blogwatch, we get back to reality. So what's up with this phone? Andrei Vlad has some background: Beginning this week, the Phab 2 Pro is available for...$499.99...Lenovo only offers the Phab 2 Pro in Gunmetal Grey color...the phone ships with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. ... Since this is a “special” phone, it comes with a set of four cameras that work in conjunction with...the...specially-developed software that...enable[s] AR experiences...the rear cameras consist of a 16 MP RGB camera, depth camera, and fisheye camera for ultra-wide angle panoramics...in the front, an 8 MP camera is perfect for selfies and groupfies...the Phab 2 Pro only works with AT&T and T-Mobile. But what is so special about the Phab 2 Pro and Google Tango? Mike Wehner is in the know: Google Tango [is] the augmented reality platform that provides a layer of interactivity to anything you point your smartphone camera at...The idea...is that you can point your smartphone camera at your surroundings and see additional information, 3D virtual objects, or other interactive elements...So, for example, apps can allow you to deck out your living room in virtual furniture so you can see how it looks, or you can raise a virtual pet that follows you around your home, but exists only through your smartphone lens. What about specs? What does this phone have going on besides some cameras? Todd Haselton fills us in: The Phab 2 Pro...packs a large 6.4-inch 1440 x 2560-pixel display. Under the hood, you’ll find a Snapdragon 652 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a large 4,050mAh battery. This is all well and good, but what we really want to know is what the Phab 2 Pro is like to use. Sean Hollister has some details: As cool as it can be, the Tango technology...still feels a little rough around the edges...Last week, I spent a couple hours playing with the phone...Some of the time, it worked great...But it didn't take a heck of a lot to confuse Tango's sensors...Reflective surfaces...could sometimes throw off the virtual world's position...And sometimes (no, more like all the time) it took a long while to load each Tango app. ... Google Tango boss Johnny Lee...says we should think of Tango as a feature like GPS, not something that's technically necessary for a phone, but a feature that becomes hard to imagine living without....if Google's right that more Tango phones are coming -- in a variety of shapes, sizes and prices, says Lee -- it really seems like you might want to wait. There's not a lot of software right now, there are still some weird glitches and limitations, and there are more phones on the way. So what can you actually do with the Phab 2 Pro? Nathaniel Mott can tell you: The launch apps range from Measure, a tool that allows you to use your phone to measure anything in your homes, to an AR game called Domino World that lets you play dominoes without having to...pick all the pieces up...The debut lineup also includes Lowe's interior decorating tool, an at-scale simulator of the solar system, and a paint-shooting game called Crayola Color Blaster, among others...Google explained...that these apps are just the beginning of its ambitions for Tango. And those are just a few of the apps -- there are more than 30 already, and we can expect that number to grow. So where you can you get one? Stephen Hall has that info: The Phab 2 Pro...[is] available right now at Lenovo’s website. You should also soon be able to pick one up at Lowe’s and other retail locations sometime soon.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise 3 Ways to Take Advantage of Google Maps Ads Local Search October 28, 2016 Local Search Jason HawkinsOctober 28, 2016 672SHARES 2.5KREADS 672SHARES 2.5KREADS Jason Hawkins 672SHARES 2.5KREADS Local advertising and marketing through Google Maps is absolutely going to be the next big thing for business owners. There are several updates in the works that are going to change user experience and optimize local Google Maps searches so local businesses can be discovered and visited more easily. Put simply, the reason that this series of updates is incredibly valuable is because it improves the experience of Google Maps for both the user and the business owner. The business owner is going to be able to advertise and market more directly to local customers, and users are going to have a much easier time finding the businesses and deals in a given area. In this way, both physical and website traffic is bound to increase at your storefront, but only if you take note of these updates and make the necessary strides to get involved with the updates ASAP. In response to the increase in local searches, there are three updates that are going to be making a big impact on user/business experience with Google Maps. Consequently, there are also three ways that you can take advantage of these updates to best serve your business. #1 Utilize Promoted Pins to Advertise Location & Rank First One of the newest features for local search advertisement is the promoted pin. Promoted pins are advertisements tied to your pin location and are intended to increase store business. Google developed these features in response to the increase of local searches, which have grown 50% more than any other kind of mobile searches. Promoted pins utilize a company’s logo to mark it on the map. The company’s logo will only occur if the business decides to buy ad space, but will occur on the physical location as soon as the user does a search. These promoted pins are meant to blend well with the existing regular pins and be streamlined with the existing platform (Google doesn’t want them to be an eyesore). Another bonus of promoted pins is they are marked by a purple pin, instead of a red pin. They will also be the first spot in the organic search results on the app. You might be wondering what happens if there is a lot of competition for this spot, but Google has made it so that only two can actually rank in this position in a local search. This means it will not only be a highly prized position, but it will also gain more user attention. To get started with Promoted Pins, you have to be eligible and you can check to make sure you meet Google criteria by doing the following: Enable location extensions for AdWords Update your Google My Business listing Target a location / address and increase bids for locations near your business Target keywords that relate to your location and what people look up in your area Once you meet Google’s eligibility criteria, you can start thinking about ad payment. Payment is ultimately the same principle behind standard AdWords PPC. If someone interacts with your ad, you pay for it. #2 Create a Business Page to Show What You Have to Offer Promoted pin advertisers will have the opportunity to create and develop customizable business pages. This will give you the chance to provide even more information about store inventory, specials you are running, or other details that are intended to drive business to your store front. These pages will, of course, feature the standard information such as business contact information, but they will also be a way for customers to do things like search store inventory. This is super convenient for users, who can avoid a wasted trip if you don’t have the item in stock. You can think of a business page as a sort of landing page. You should test the page to make sure it is optimized (learn more here), and link back to this page in your writing. It isn’t something you just have in case someone clicks on it when searching for a business on Google–you want to drive people to this page! With the way mobile is growing, this could become one of your most important web pages. Learn more about business page optimization here. #3 Local Search Ads for the Win Local extensions in AdWords currently allow advertisers to target local populations most likely to be interested in their business. The positive thing about these local search ads is they are apparent on both mobile and desktop. In fact, the actual Google Maps app has over 1 billion downloads—meaning that this is by-far one of the most (if not THE most) significant platform for local advertising. This is huge success for an app and many people use Google Maps daily to get directions and to find local businesses. Keep in mind, by being a local advertiser; you have a good chance of ranking within the first two results on a relevant search. This makes local advertising extremely effective, if for nothing else to be one of the highest ranking results on a relevant local search. The Takeaway Google local searches are not fully implemented yet, but these three aspects are something to have on your radar. Get started setting yourself up on Google My Business so you are optimized for local searches so you can begin to advertise just as soon as the feature is released in full. I definitely think since this is a PPC platform, you can feel confident that these local search features are going to be beneficial for advertising and driving business to your doorstep. What do you think about all of the Google Local Search updates? Are you excited for the promoted pins to be released?

Lenovo launches the first phone featuring Google's Tango design, offering Google an important test of whether consumers really want the technology. By Liam Tung | November 2, 2016 -- 11:37 GMT (04:37 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro launches with 35 apps that utilize its motion-tracking, depth-sensing, and measuring capabilities. Image: Google/​Lenovo Google has announced Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro, the first Android phone using its Project Tango augmented-reality tech. The Phab 2 Pro arrives more than two years after Google unveiled a first prototype from its Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) team. Tango's 3D sensors enable motion tracking, depth sensing, and the ability to measure areas. The Tango phone, which Lenovo announced in June, launches with 35 apps that utilize these capabilities. The 6.4-inch QHD display Phab 2 Pro features three rear cameras, including a 16-megapixel main shooter sandwiched between a fingerprint scanner below, and the paired depth sensor and motion-tracking fish-eye camera above. Lenovo unveils Phab 2 Pro, a Tango device, for just $499 unlocked With the world's first smartphone compatible with Google's sensory awareness platform, Lenovo aims to court more businesses to use augmented reality. Read More The front-facing camera has an eight-megapixel sensor. Inside, the device has 64GB storage, 4GB RAM, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, a 4,050mAh battery, and runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Currently the phone is only available in grey, but Lenovo says it will deliver a gold version soon. Tango apps can be installed via the Tango app or Google Play and there are more than 35 of them available today, Justin Quimby, senior Tango product manager says in a blogpost. While many are games, they do offer a glimpse at the potential for more immersive phone apps that don't require strapping on a headset. Whether consumers find value in AR phone apps remains to be seen, but the concept at least benefits by arriving in the wake of the Pokemon Go craze. There are also utilities, such as Google's ruler-replacing Measure app, and educational apps, such as Dinosaurs Among Us. The first set of Tango apps showcase the potential for marketers via a handful of brand-affiliated apps that offer an augmented-reality take on physical toys and experiences, such as a furniture visualizer from department store Lowes, the Crayola Color Blaster that lets you chase zombies in the real-world and blast them with paint, and the Hot Wheel's Track Builder from toy maker Mattel. Other early Tango apps include Autodesk's Homestyler Interior Design, Ghostly Mansions, Domino World, Slingshot Island, Raise, Solar Simulator, Dinosaurs Among Us, Woorld, Towers for Tango, Wild Race, Car Racing, and a 3D video filter app, Spectra. Google sees potential for the Tango design as a platform for all phones in future, and according to Quimby, the Phab 2 Pro will be joined by more Tango-enabled phones in early 2017. "In the same way you wouldn't consider buying a phone today without a camera or GPS, Tango will be a ubiquitous capability to help your phone better understand space and the world around you. There will be more Tango-enabled phones coming in the new year and we can't wait for you to explore, learn and play," Quimby said.

Home Industry Tech Google Daydream VR teams up with ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them’; to be launched on November 10 Google Daydream VR teams up with ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them’; to be launched on November 10 Google on Tuesday announced that the Daydream View VR headset would go for sales on the Google Store from November 10. By: FE Online | Published: November 2, 2016 5:29 PM The Daydream View VR is a massive upgrade from the pre-historic Cardboard headsets. (Reuters) Google on Tuesday announced that the Daydream View VR headset would go for sales on the Google Store from November 10. Google said that from November 10, the device would be available in 5 different countries, namely, USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. The Daydream View VR will require a phone with minimum specifications to run the device, like the Google Pixel smartphones. Google had launched the Daydream along with the Google Pixel smartphones. The Daydream View VR is a massive upgrade from the pre-historic Cardboard headsets. Well, at least they were an affordable bunch. The Daydream View was launched with the motive to compete with the likes of Oculus Rift and HoloLens, Samsung’s Gear VR and even Xiaomi’s new VR headset. Google has plans of dominating the VR market by offering a huge range of VR related content. The content providers for the Google Daydream View VR headsets range from various news publications to hi-resolution games to its own Street View. Among the news publications, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Guardian are to provide content. The NYT is to provide 3 films in the Daydream app. Both Youtube and Hulu are to bring their entire collection of videos, movies and TV shows to a virtual platform. Invasion, an award-winning VR animated film will also be made available in the Google Play Movies in VR. Google’s Star Chart is also to be made available in the headset, giving viewers an opportunity to explore cosmic objects; for instance, the moons of Saturn or the far lands of Pluto. The Street View is also to be made available for the headset, where viewers would be able to visit 70 different countries over 150 tours. The multi-billion company has also partnered with Warner Bros. for the promotion of Fantastic Beasts and Where to find Them; a prequel to the Harry Potter franchise. The Daydream View Headset is to be priced at $79 ib the United States, which roughly sums up to Rs 5,000 in Indian currency. Please Wait while comments are loading...

 Google's big bet on virtual reality is launching on November 10 Rob Price Nov. 2, 2016, 7:32 AM 2,967 facebook linkedin twitter email print A journalist uses Google's Daydream VR headset during an event to introduce Google hardware products on October 4, 2016 in San Francisco, California. Google unveils new products including the Google Pixel Phone making a jump into the mobile device market.Ramin Talaie/Getty Images Google's new virtual reality headset is hitting stores on November 10. The Daydream View will be available to purchase next week in the US, the UK, Canada, Germany, and Australia, the Californian technology giant announced on Tuesday. It'll go on sale in the US at Verizon and Best Buy for $79, while in the UK it will sell for £69 at EE and Carphone Warehouse. The Daydream View is Google's next big bet on virtual reality, and a successor to its dirt-cheap DIY Cardboard headset. Like Cardboard, Daydream is powered by your Android smartphone — but you need a phone classified as "Daydream-ready" to ensure that it all runs smoothly. Right now, the only phone on the market that qualifies is the Google-made Pixel smartphone. Manufacturers are working on more, however, and it will likely come as standard in future premium Android smartphones. It's a totally different approach to virtual reality to some of the other major players. Facebook-owned Oculus, Sony, and HTC all sell headsets that retail for hundreds of dollars, and which are reliant high-end computers or gaming consoles to run. Daydream headsets, in contrast, are basically just a case that you slot your smartphone into and a motion-sensitive remote control. As you might expect, the experience is much more basic than some of the competitors — but Google is betting that this is the best way to introduce people cheaply and easily to virtual reality. Google On launch, there will be a range of apps available for Daydream, including VR versions of YouTube and Hulu, apps from The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, Google Street View, and a number of games. "With Daydream View and a Daydream-ready phone like Pixel, you’ll be able to kick back in your personal cinema, explore new worlds and get in the game like never before," Google VR director of product management Mike Jazayeri wrote in a blog post. Here's the full list of prices and retailers: United States: Verizon, Best Buy; $79 (USD) Canada: Bell, Rogers, Telus, Best Buy; $99 (CAD) United Kingdom: EE, Carphone Warehouse; £69 (GBP) Germany: Deutsche Telekom; €69 (EUR) Australia: Telstra, JB Hi-Fi; $119 (AUD) NOW WATCH: How the ‘perfect body’ for men has changed over the last 150 years Loading video...

Think again Written by Nevin Thompson November 02, 2016 Seeya later, suckers. (Reuters/Todd Korol) Share Written by Nevin Thompson November 02, 2016 A Donald Trump presidency suddenly doesn’t seem so unlikely anymore—there now seems to be the possibility that Trump, rising from the dead like a villain from a seventies slasher movie, might win the US national election yet. This simple, terrifying thought has some very nervous Americans searching for ways to escape the country. Indeed, ever since Trump alarmed the nation during the Republican primaries by racking up seven wins on Super Tuesday, there has been a spike in Google searches for “how can I move to Canada.” Searches for "Move to Canada" are higher than at any time in Google history #SuperTuesday pic.twitter.com/0KBJPrHdEO — GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) March 2, 2016 Americans love Canada, and why not? There’s free health care, no guns, and Justin Trudeau. Apart from these improvements, Canada is basically the same as the US, right? Wrong. Before you make plans to escape to the Great White North on Nov. 9, there are some important things you need to know about Canada. Netflix sucks Netflix has admitted that Canadians have access to only half the movie and television titles available to American subscribers. What’s worse, Netflix aggressively blocks the VPN services and web proxies Canadians have long used to access the wider variety of content available to Americans. And it’s not just Netflix. From computers to cars, there is generally less consumer choice in Canada. Which leads us to another import point: There’s no Target in Canada Need we say more? There aren’t a lot of jobs right now, either Even if there was more consumer choice in Canada, if you move here, you may not have the cash to buy stuff anyway—because you might not have a job. Canada’s unemployment rate is stuck at around 7% (compared to 4.9% in the US). Just as in the US, most of the good jobs in Canada can be found in just a few large cities, such as Toronto and Vancouver. Vancouver, with its ocean, soaring mountains, and easy access to some of the best skiing in the world may sound like a great place to escape from Donald Trump. But there is one big problem: It’s really expensive. Relatively low wages, sky-high real estate prices, and a rental vacancy rate of close to 0% makes it tough to get a fresh start in Vancouver and many other major Canadian cities (unless you have the cash to reside in someplace like Vancouver’s Trump Tower). Canada is going to be major carbon polluter for a long time Recently tanking price of oil and the collapse of the commodities have contributed to the high unemployment in Canada. So this means Canada is doing everything it can, from pushing for more pipelines to giving the green light on polluting energy projects, in order to create jobs—something right out of Donald Trump’s economic playbook. This means Canada, which already has among the highest per-capita greenhouse-gas emissions in the world, and which uses more energy than all of the 760 million inhabitants of Africa, will never seriously try to meet its emissions targets to combat climate change. Canada needs to wean itself off of oil, first. When it comes to minorities, Canada has its own challenges Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign has shone a spotlight on racism in the United States. Moving to Canada is no escape. The Toronto police practice racial profiling, while indigenous people make up a quarter of Canada’s prison population, despite being just 4.3% of the total Canadian population. On the plus side, Canada has embarked on the long and painful process of reconciliation with indigenous people—something unimaginable in a country governed by Donald Trump. While textbooks in some parts of the United States are going backwards and glossing over topics such as slavery, Canadian children are now being taught about our country’s racist roots. Canada sells weapons to human-rights abusers One of the first things the Trudeau government did after being elected in October 2015 was approve the sale of armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia. While the deal provides jobs for a struggling manufacturing town in Ontario, Saudi Arabia is leading a war against its neighbor Yemen that has so far left nearly 4,000 civilians dead. Armored personnel carriers also came in handy when the House of Saud decided to help crush neighboring Bahrain’s pro-democracy protests in 2011. So by leaving America for Canada in November, you’ll have to live with being part of the military industrial complex. But is Canada really that bad? Well, no. Compared to the United States, Canada has a lot going for it. We have ketchup-flavored potato chips, kelp-based beer, and a donut chain named after a hockey player. That’s enough entice anyone to move up here and escape Trump, isn’t it? Of course, we Canadians love our single-payer public health care. While it’s not free, it covers everyone, so you’re not going to go bankrupt if you get hospitalized. Canada is a haven from guns as well. Canada’s firearms-related homicide rate is seven times lower than that of the United States, and mass shootings are extremely rare. So that’s one big anxiety you can leave behind when you cross the border. And there’s Trudeau. While he has been called out by some Canadians as a coldly calculating viral PM with more style than substance, Justin Trudeau’s “sunny ways” have changed the tone of Canadian politics. Just a year ago, Stephen Harper, Trudeau’s predecessor, was campaigning on banning the niqab. Harper lost the election, and the very next day, Trudeau was taking selfies with anyone and everyone in a subway station in Montreal. Notre prochain PM @JustinTrudeau dit merci à ses électeurs au métro Jarry #montreal #Elxn42 pic.twitter.com/HMz2Ip6PaJ — Adam Scotti (@AdamScotti) October 20, 2015 So while Canada is no paradise, maybe it’s not such a bad country to run away to after all.

But early adoption is rife with negative consequences, one of which is public embarrassment. I was reminded of this over the weekend when I saw the newest ad for the Google Pixel phone, this time from Verizon. Check it out below: Two things stood out for me. First the guy says "OK Google" a little too smugly, as if he had just spent the previous few minutes off-camera trying to convince his iPhone-using friends how great the Google Assistant is. Then the woman dons a Daydream View VR headset unapologetically on a train full of strangers. I’m not saying I wouldn’t do the same. I would. But that’s because this is a group of four friends together in public. How many of you would speak to your digital assistant or play a game in VR if you were alone on the very same train? I wouldn’t. I’m no Adi Robertson: I’m more like Kwame and Mat: But also, saying "okay Google" is about the dumbest, most embarrassing thing I say on a regular basis. That I'm aware of, I mean. — mat (@mat) November 1, 2016 In June the big minds at Creative Strategies published a study focused on the usage of virtual digital assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and what’s now known as Google Assistant. It found that of those people that use voice assistants, most would only do so when alone. Specifically, 39 percent use them at home while 51 percent use them in the car; compared to just 6 percent of users who’ll use a digital assistant in public. Notably, 20 percent of those who said they never used a voice assistant attributed their reluctance to feeling "uncomfortable talking to their technology, especially in public." What used to be embarrassing is now a nuisance I’ve lived through a couple of trends like this already. I remember being embarrassed by my work-issued cellphone in the '90s, given to me because I was the "weekend support guy." When the call inevitably came late one Saturday night, I quickly skulked out of the Haight Street bar to take the call. I then slumped over in an alley in order to avoid drawing attention to myself on the phone. I had a similar repulsion to using laptops in East Village cafes during the early noughts. Now, what used to be embarrassing is so common that it’s become a nuisance. Remember the time you first saw some crazed person walking down the street talking to themselves only to realize they were wearing a Bluetooth headset? Insanity has since been down-ranked to our second assumption. Even comically large, over-the-ear headphones have become a statement of fashion. I can’t exactly pinpoint when this embarrassment-to-source-of-pride inflection point occurs but it’s somewhere along the right-hand side of this curve from that Rogers guy: Diffusion of Innovation | Everett M. Rogers Or the "Entering the plateau" phase on my all-time favorite chart from Gartner: Gartner Hype Cycle Us early adopters take pride in helping define societal norms for technology usage. Sure, we get burned by the occasional Google Glass, Segway, or Lytro camera, but ultimately we pave the way for the luddites to follow. Casey Neistat is single-handedly working to make electric skateboards seem cool. And I have no doubt that saying things like "OK Google" or "Hey Siri" or "Alexa something something" in public will someday soon be the norm. Farther out, it’ll probably even become second nature to talk into our AR headsets just as it’s become okay — revered even — to suck nicotine steam from overheated USB sticks. That’s just how the tech lifecycle plays out. Perhaps I too can muster up the courage of a teenage boy in time for Google’s VR headset to ship on the 10th. Can you?

Klint Finley Business Date of Publication: 11.02.16. 11.02.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am The World’s Telecoms Are Under Threat From All Sides Getty Images America’s TV and telecommunications companies are on a buying spree. This summer, Verizon agreed to buy Yahoo, a year after snapping up AOL. Last month, AT&T signed a $85.4 billion deal to acquire the media giant Time Warner. And now, CenturyLink, the third largest telecom in the US, has agreed to buy Level 3 Communications, a company dedicated to running the backbone of the Internet. What this shows is that these old-school communications companies are under threat—from all sides. Companies like Amazon and Facebook and Netflix are challenging traditional television with their streaming Internet video services. Smartphone makers like Google and Apple are eating into the power once wielded by the country’s cellular services, with Google even offering its own mobile service. And some Internet companies, including Amazon and Google, are even pushing into home Internet services. So, the old-school companies are looking for ways of fighting back. Mostly, these telecoms are moving into media. That’s been the trend since cable TV giant Comcast purchased NBC Universal back in 2011. As the power shifts out of the communications networks, telecoms are buying up the media that traveling across these networks: TV shows, entire TV channels, movie studies, web empires. But in acquiring Level 3, CenturyLink is doing something rather different. CenturyLink is losing its consumer home Internet subscribers. Cord cutting threatens to cannibalize its pay TV customers. And 5G wireless is poised to lure away even more of its customers. So, the company is focusing on business services, where it already makes most of its money. Recently, it has made a move into cloud computing—trying to challenge the Googles and the Amazons in another area. And now, it’s up Level 3, whose Internet-related services are aimed directly at businesses. On one level, it makes a lot of sense. But while the $34 billion deal may help CenturyLink in the short term, the reality is that businesses don’t need a company like Level 3 as much as they once did—and that’s also because of Google and Amazon and Facebook. In so many ways, the deal shows how the telecom world is changing. What the Hell is Level 3? What exactly is Level 3? To understand that, you must first understand how the Internet works. In the 1990s, politicians and media described the Internet as an “Information Superhighway.” But really, the Internet is more like a highway system than a single highway Imagine you want to send data from a computer connected to the Internet through Verizon in New York to a computer connected to the Internet through Comcast in San Francisco. The series of virtual roads connecting the two cities are what are known as “backbone” Internet services. The difference between the Internet and the interstate highway system, however, is that telcos own these highways. Verizon, Comcast, CenturyLink, and other Internet access providers own many of the virtual highways that connect different cities together, but not all of them. Some of them are owned by companies like Level 3, which make much of their money connecting different Internet providers together. This business is called “transit.” And it’s slowly going away. Bypass Roads In a lengthy essay, Geoff Huston, the founder of Australia’s first Internet access provider, explains why. Instead of building or renting space in a single data center, more and more companies are opting to host their data with content delivery networks like Akamai and Cloudflare. These companies run servers in data centers spread across the world—data centers that connect directors to Internet access providers, bypassing transit providers like Level 3. Some companies, like Facebook and Google, are going even further. They’re building their own data centers, buying up unused fiber optic infrastructure, and funding the creation of new undersea cables—to connect these data centers together. Facebook and Google are then able to bypass traditional telcos almost completely: they only need to deal with the Internet provider who sells access to the end user. It’s as if Amazon had not only built a network of distribution centers to deliver goods around the country, but had also bought-up abandoned highways—or perhaps railroad tracks—to deliver products from its warehouses to your town without ever touching the interstate highway system at all. As Huston explains, this has led to transit service being less important and less lucrative as content companies turn to CDNs. Meanwhile, telcos, including both CenturyLink and Level3, are now providing their own CDN services, along with other business networking services, such as cloud hosting and fixed connections between business equipment such as ATMs and banks. They see where the wind the blowing. “What exactly is the residual need for long distance transit?” Huston ponders. “Do transit service providers even have a future?” New Money Even CDN providers like Akamai are now under threat from the Internet giants. Amazon offers its own CDN service, and according to a report from Datanyze, it’s used by more than half of the top 1 million sites on the web. All other CDN providers trail Amazon by a wide margin. And Google’s AMP and Facebook’s Instant Articles programs threaten to undercut CDNs as well. Publishers who use those services host content not on their own servers or CDNs, but on Google and Facebook’s CDNs, rendering telcos even less relevant. Yes, CenturyLink and Level 3 are solid, profitable companies. They netted about $152 million and $143 million respectively last quarter. And fortunately for them, both offer more than just transit and Internet access services. But the merger is like two old money families marrying their fortunes together in an effort to stave off death at the hands of new money interests. Unless something changes, they’re on the wrong side of history. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Broadband centurylink Facebook google telcos Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Released Wednesday, users who visit Google's homepage will notice purple artwork that pays homage to the tissue-paper cutouts that have been used to celebrate the Day of the Dead since the 18th century. According to Google, the "bright, delicate paper banners indicate that life is fragile and fleeting, but it's also full of beauty and delight." Day of the Dead or Dia de los Muertos, Google writes, "honors the mysteries of life and death, through both celebration and reverence." "Every year from November 1-2, both Mexicans and people around the world honor their loved ones with offerings or ofrendas displayed on colorful altars decorated with pictures, bright flowers, candles, and their favorite foods and beverages," the internet giant continues. Google has also released a collection of photos, videos and articles on the Day of Dead on their Google Arts and Culture page. Notably this year, Mexico held its first Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City that was attended by more than 100,000 people according to People magazine. The parade was inspired by the latest James Bond film Spectre from 2015 which began with star Daniel Craig navigating through a Day of the Dead parade to chase down a villain.

The case was launched after a complaint by Google’s local rival Yandex. The antitrust watchdog has accused the US giant of using delaying tactics but failing to comply as well as failing to pay its multibillion-dollar fine. "FAS has found Google Inc. and Google Ireland Limited to be guilty of an administrative offense over the failure to fulfill a ruling. The department has fined both companies 500,000 rubles. Earlier, the regulator rejected Google's request to postpone the deadline of compliance with the ruling," the service said in a statement. Each company has been fined separately, with the total fine thus coming to almost $16,000, according to FAS. Google has yet to pay the $6.9-million fine for its malpractices. The violations included pre-installing a number of its apps along with Google Play, as well as precluding the installation of apps made by other companies. The FAS ruling has been confirmed by two arbitration courts. The service ordered Google to stop the violations by December 18, 2015. The final deadline expired in late August. Google has filed three lawsuits against FAS as of early September and asked FAS to extend the terms of implementing the ruling, a request turned down by the service. The first hearing will be held by the Moscow City Arbitration Court on December 1 while the main hearing is due on December 8. ...

By Oliver Cragg November 2, 2016 10:27 GMT Daydream View is set to hit shelves in the UK on 11 NovemberGoogle Google's Daydream View virtual reality headset has been confirmed for a 11 November release date in selected regions. The visually striking fabric-covered device will cost £69 in the UK. Powered by Google's Daydream VR technology for Android, the mobile HMD is compatible with Daydream-ready smartphones such as the recently released Google Pixel and Pixel XL. Bundled with a bespoke motion controller and promising a greater field of view, accurate head tracking, Daydream represents a huge step up from Google's previous forays into virtual reality with the cheap and cheerful Cardboard VR project. In the UK, Daydream View will be available from high-street smartphone retailers Carphone Warehouse and EE as well as Google's online store. At the time of writing orders placed are scheduled to dispatch "by 10 November". Other worldwide pricing and retailers are as follows: United States: Verizon, Best Buy; $79 Canada: Bell, Rogers, Telus, Best Buy; $99 (CAD) Germany: Deutsche Telekom; €69 Australia: Telstra, JB Hi-Fi; $119 (AUD) Google is confident that the Daydream View has an edge over competing mobile VR headsets when it comes to design and comfort. The Alphabet company claims the fabric material used in construction makes the device up to 30% lighter than rival mobile virtual reality sets such as Samsung's Gear VR. In theory this could eliminate some of the discomfort caused by prolonged virtual excursions. At launch, Daydream View will support select Android apps, with Google's big hitters such as YouTube, Photos, Google Play Movies and Street View all receiving a VR makeover. Also promised for the weeks following Daydream View's launch are several "experiences" that utilise the motion controller. These include the Daydream-exclusive mini-golf game Wonderglade, Gunjack 2 from the makers of Oculus Rift and PSVR space shooter Eve: Valkyrie, and virtual wind-waving action in a tie-in app promoting the upcoming Harry Potter spin-off movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. IBTimes UK will be getting hands-on with Daydream View in the near future so be sure to check back soon for our impressions of Google's marquee VR peripheral.

Here's why Facebook has won over IT partners via an open source approach. By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | November 2, 2016 -- 10:00 GMT (03:00 PDT) | Topic: Cloud Facebook is increasingly wielding influence on the infrastructure design that stretches from the fiber optic cables to the datacenter to the last mile of your home. And it's using an open source approach to rally a vast ecosystem that'll follow its lead. Photos: Zuckerberg offers glimpse inside... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 10 NEXT PREV In the future, it's highly likely that Facebook will influence the behind-the-scenes network designs as well as datacenter architecture that'll run your business. And, presumably, Facebook's open source and white-box approach will drive costs down. The progress of the Open Compute Project is fairly well known. Facebook has outlined how it approaches its datacenters and designs its servers and infrastructure. Sure, these designs revolve around Facebook's use cases, but they increasingly apply to more enterprises that have to operate at web scale. And now Facebook is taking its Open Compute Project mojo into the Telecom Infrastructure Project. The Open Compute Project took years to land key cloud partners such as Microsoft and Google. The Telecom Infra Project has hit the ground running with partners such as Accenture, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Broadcom, Cisco, Juniper, and a host of others. special feature Integrating the Hybrid Cloud As far and fast as cloud computing is embedding itself into the enterprise, there remain many cloud-resistant applications and services. Read More Consider: Facebook contributes telecom designs, plans to Telecom Infra Project, adds partners Open Compute Project: Gauging its influence in datacenter, cloud computing infrastructure Facebook wants to do to 5G what it has already done to the datacenter Open Compute Project enlists AT&T, Verizon while growing telco support Microsoft to release version 2 of its Open Compute Project server design Microsoft submits new open-sourced networking components to Open Compute Project Google joins Open Compute Project, contributes 48V rack Google, Facebook pause rivalries: Here's their 48V power-saving rack spec for Open Compute Project Add it up and it's clear Facebook's approach has given it a lot of voice in how cloud datacenters are designed. It's also worth noting that Facebook's capital spending relative to hyperscale cloud providers is sizable, but the social network's influence is still punching above its wallet (not that $1 billion or so in capital expenses a quarter is chump change). According to Stifel, Facebook will spend $4.5 billion on capital expenditures in 2016, up from $2.5 billion in 2015. TechRepublic: Enterprise IT's top 4 favorite tech companies | Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud | Photos: A look inside Google's, Microsoft's and Facebook's datacenters So how did Facebook grow this influence? Here are a few reasons: Facebook has leveraged open source well largely because it is a customer and not a vendor. Facebook has a core competency in running its own infrastructure, but isn't trying to sell you a cloud service or hardware. Facebook is looking to squeeze costs via commodity hardware and automation just like enterprises are. Facebook and enterprise customer interests are aligned. The inclination to throw designs, intellectual property, and architectural models in open source projects have won Facebook a lot of credibility in datacenter circles. Facebook spends a ton on infrastructure. Why would a vendor play along with Facebook? Perhaps a technical partner will sell Facebook servers, routers, and switches under a white box arrangement. Even with squeezed margins, the volume may make up the profit difference with Facebook as a customer. The other reason vendors play well with Facebook: they can learn new approaches from the ecosystem and then add their value-added intellectual property to it. Now we all know what's in it for Facebook. By collaborating with the major datacenter and telecom players, Facebook can influence the next-generation infrastructure to enable everything from artificial intelligence and machine learning (yes, the company open sources a lot of that too) to Oculus virtual reality advertising. However, the argument is easy to make that Facebook's approach to influencing enterprise infrastructure will have far more pros than cons.

For now, it will be available across five countries- the US, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. The Daydream View VR headset requires a Daydream ready phone like Google’s new Pixel smartphones. Google launched the headset along with the Pixel phones itself and it was a significant upgrade from the affordable Google Cardboard headsets. Google collaborated with clothing makers to make the headset out of soft microfiber. Google also launched a precision-grade controller that comes with a bunch of sensors. The Daydream View was launched to take on the likes of the Oculus Rift and Microsoft's HoloLens. It also competes with a plethora of VR headsets like Samsung’s Gear VR and even Xiaomi’s new VR headset. And Google plans to take over the VR space by offering a massive range of VR content. In it blog post on Tuesday, Google announced a host of VR content providers for the Daydream ecosystem. The content providers range from news publications to streaming services to hi-res games to its iconic Street View. Among the publications, Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Guardian will provide VR content. NYT will premiere three exclusive films in the Daydream app. WSJ will present analytics and infographics in a whole new way with real-time interactive market data visualizations and 360-degree videos. The Guardian will explore London's hidden Underworld labyrinth, which is a web of subterranean Victorian sewers and decommissioned waterways that lie actively beneath the city, in a full VR experience. Both YouTube and Hulu is bringing their entire library of videos, movies and TV shows on a virtual platform in the Daydream apps store. Hulu's VR app will be available only in the US and it will feature two exclusive shows specially made for the virtual screen. Google Play Movies will also be available in VR with INVASION!, an award-winning VR animation film narrated by Ethan Hawke coming on the platform. Apart from this, Google's Star Chart will be available in VR that will give viewers a chance to explore deep space and cosmic objects like the moons of Saturn or the farthest reaches of Pluto on virtual reality. Google's Street View will also be made available on the Daydream app. You will be able to visit 70 countries over 150 tours of the world's most amazing places. Google has also teamed up with Warner Bros. to promote Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the newest film in the Harry Potter franchise. Explore the magical world in VR, cast spells and solve puzzles to experience the magic. Heavy duty gaming titles like Need for Speed: No Limits and Home Run Derby, among other titles like Wonderglade, Danger Goat, Hunters Gate, Gunjack 2: End of Shift and Mekorama are all coming to the Daydream VR platform, ready to be played using the Daydream View headset. In the US, the Daydream View headset will be priced at $79 (roughly Rs 5000). Google didn't announce when the Daydream View will go on sale in India.

Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images Supported by About this content Joanna Goodman Wednesday 2 November 2016 06.04 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 2 November 2016 06.29 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger “Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they aren’t after you,” wrote Joseph Heller in the novel Catch 22. But it is doubtful he envisaged that algorithms used by search engines, social media platforms and websites would be after you to ‘personalise your experience’. Consequently, perhaps, personalisation and privacy have taken a new direction with the shift to messaging as the go-to communication platform. Search and social media platforms derive their income from advertising, so it makes sense for them to tailor what users see. Facebook’s presentation at the AI Summit in San Francisco explained how artificial intelligence (AI) is used to personalise the pages of each of its 1.7 billion users. How accurate – or intrusive – this is will be determined by our online activity. Connected devices and location data add context; Google’s DoubleClick (which develops internet ad serving systems) take this further by combining personally identifiable information from Gmail with browsing data. Slaves to the algorithm Machine learning: why we mustn’t be slaves to the algorithm Read more We have little or no control over the multiplicity of algorithms using our data, particularly as more devices become connected. Gartner predicts that by 2021, 20% of all activities an individual engages in will involve at least one of the top seven digital giants – defined by revenue and market capitalisation as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Algorithms are skewing our perceptions and narrowing our perspective. Tailoring content to user preferences potentially compromises online research. Search engines and ad networks are fingerprinting devices in real time, so it is impossible to know how neutral your search results are. And because search results are based on browsing history, we are less likely to see something new. Added to this is the platforms’ own bias. The past few weeks have seen reports of Facebook’s selective news curation and Google’s perceived political bias towards Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy. Josh Sutton, global head of data and AI at Publicis Sapient, believes that transparency is the key as it enables people to make a well-informed judgement call. “Trust is enabled by transparency” he explains. “There has been an implicit bias in our communications since the invention of the printing press, and we accepted this because we could assess the people who were creating and curating content. I believe that a similar opportunity must be provided in the age of machine learning by enabling people to understand the sources of the algorithms and the training data that powers them.” But we cannot blame the personalisation phenomenon entirely on algorithms. It is also a conscious choice. As social media has matured – and perhaps peaked – we have become adept at blocking what we don’t want to see – or don’t agree with. Elections and referendums have seen social media users divide into tribes rather than engage in political debate. A new kind of privacy While voice is the obvious interface for human-machine conversation, with chatbots on many websites and virtual assistants on multiple devices – human-to-human conversation has shifted to messaging platforms. Snapchat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger etc allow us to have rapid, private interactions with selected parties. This is a new kind of privacy because we don’t know the extent to which the platform can read or understand our messages. WhatsApp, a secure messaging system with end-to-end encryption, still includes in its terms the option of sharing our account information with Facebook to improve ads and product experiences. In 2015 mobile messaging platforms overtook social networking platforms in terms of monthly active users (MAU). This has not been lost on investors – or advertisers. eMarketer forecasts that Snapchat will generate $367m (£300m) in advertising revenue this year, rising 155% to $936m in 2017. A large part of the appeal of messaging is that it’s “friction free” – WhatsApp’s brand promise is “no ads, no games and no gimmicks”. So how do brands join the conversation? “The responsibility of brands is changing,” says Sutton. “Historically, the goal of advertising was to make people aware of a product and its merits. Today that is shifting to providing people with hyper-personalised information about products that might be useful to them at a specific time.” Brands join the conversation The iMessage App Store is a case in point, offering apps and extensions which perform actions within a conversation. Jason Alan Snyder, CTO at Momentum Worldwide, underlines the experiential nature of bringing brands to messaging. “Machine intelligence makes conversational commerce possible even in a ‘private’ conversation,” he says. “It is all about timing, so it makes sense to use data around location, weather and sentiment to determine the right opportunity to engage.” Crucially, personalisation must be subtle and appropriate. “For example, it is not awkward to use an iMessage app to call an Uber or book a restaurant within the context of a conversation.” And messages increasingly include emojis and stickers, which represent a massive opportunity for brands. “Messaging is peer to peer,” observes Vivian Rosenthal, founder of Snaps, which creates chatbots, emojis, GIFs and stickers for brands. “There’s an immediacy that just isn’t there in social.” What does artificial intelligence mean for the creative mind? Read more It’s all about opting in. “Traditional pop-ups and banner ads are annoying,” she adds. “They get in the way of something else you want to do. You’re actually choosing to send an emoji or a sticker to your friend. That presents a seismic shift for advertising in terms of opt-in behaviour.” Global brands recognise the power of emojis to use consumers to spread their message and are shifting their advertising budgets to messaging. . Bonin Bough, former chief media and e-commerce officer at Mondelez International, predicts that whatever existed in email will soon exist in messaging. “If a brand is sending me an email, that brand is going to one day send me a message … every single media company will become a messaging company.” Joanna Goodman is a writer and editor.

You'll have to go directly to the Google Store or to Carphone Warehouse to buy it. It's also being stocked by EE.

The Pixel and Pixel XL don't have many significant differences; however the Pixel XL is bigger, has a better display resolution, and a larger battery. Now, thanks to tester Nathan K, a new difference has cropped up between the two Google smartphones. Nathan posted on his Google Plus page that in his tests, he found out that the Google Pixel does not reach the 18W charging wattage the tech giant had advertised, and it maxes out at 15W. The larger Google Pixel XL goes up to the mentioned 18W, but the base variant doesn't. Google clarified to Android Police saying that this was a marketing mistake, and that the Google Pixel and Pixel XL support USB-PD charging from 15-18W, and not just 18W. The company has even rectified the error on its specification site which now reads "USB Type-C 18W adaptor with USB-PD" for both the phones.Nathan says that this 15W limit is because of thermal concerns. This difference of 3W of power accounts for 20 percent speed boost in charging. However, the Pixel XL has a larger 3450mAh battery, so it will anyway take longer to charge. In real-world use, this difference won't be much and smartphones generally don't charge at peak speed at all times anyway. As mentioned, the Pixel smartphone sports a full-HD display, while the Pixel XL smartphone sports a QHD display. The Pixel sports a 2770mAh battery, while the Pixel XL sports a 3450mAh battery.

Update: The best phones in the US are always changing, and the latest proof is the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL. These two new smartphones shake up our November list. Here's our newly minted rankings. Knowing the best smartphone you can buy in the second half of 2016 is more than just a hunch for us. We test out the latest and - sometimes - greatest phones in comprehensive mobile phone reviews. To drill down to a list of our 10 favorites in the US this year, we based today's updated rankings on a lot of geeked-out factors: design, performance, battery life, camera quality and software updates. Sure, your personal preference among iOS 10, Android 7.1 Nougat and Windows Mobile 10 could sway you to another device besides our top-ranked phone. Likewise, your contract with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or T-Mobile is a personal preference. The best phone for AT&T may not be available on-contract on Verizon, and vice-versa. But that's why we have more than just a No. 1 pick, which, spoiler alert, isn't Apple's iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. We're not that predictable. Before you lock into a binding contract or spring for an expensive unlocked, SIM-free smartphone, consult our best phone guide, updated regularly. Find a good deal with TechRadar: mobile phone deals 10. OnePlus 3 A genuine flagship killer Weight: 158g | Dimensions: 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 820 | RAM: 6GB | Storage: 64GB | Battery: 3000mAh | Rear camera: 16MP | Front camera: 8MP Premium design Affordable price No microSD slot Camera could be better The Chinese firm has improved on a number of issues fans had with its predecessor, wrapping the OnePlus 3 in a new premium suit and managed to keep the price low enough to worry the established names in the market. We love the new design, the AMOLED display is bright and vibrant and the fingerprint scanner is much improved and lightning fast. The lack of a microSD card, and a battery which doesn't last more than a day may put some off, but considering the price you're paying the OnePlus is fantastic value for money. If you're desperate for a high-end phone, but don't have the money to stetch that far the OnePlus 3 will make you very, very happy.

Home Industry Tech Google Chrome redesigned to be faster on Windows and easier to use on Android Google Chrome redesigned to be faster on Windows and easier to use on Android Global tech giant Google is making concerted efforts to keep at the top and stay relevant by redesigning its Chrome browser for Android smartphones. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Published: November 2, 2016 2:32 PM Google Chrome browser for Android will now be faster and leaner, also making it comfortable for one handed use, especially on devices with big screens. Global tech giant Google is making concerted efforts to keep at the top and stay relevant by redesigning its Chrome browser for Android smartphones. The Chrome browser for Android will now be faster and leaner, also making it comfortable for one handed use, especially on devices with big screens. Recently Google, also announced bringing down the data usage in the app, apart from a few more optimisations in the app. One of the biggest problems, faced by users using phones with big screens is the double handed use, which makes it less efficient. Google said that it is testing a new Chrome browser update where the search bar will be at the bottom, allowing users to work on Chrome on their Android smartphones using one hand. Additionally, Google Chrome will now be relatively much faster, almost 15 percent, using Microsoft’s Profile Guided Optimisation (PGO), to make it faster for Windows. Google in its blog wrote, “Chrome is a huge software project with more than a million functions in its source code. Not all functions are equal – some are called frequently, while others are rarely used. PGO uses data from runtime execution that track which functions are most common to guide optimisation.” According to reports, the Android update to put the search bar at the bottom is still in its testing phase and is incomplete as, at the top where it was earlier positioned, is still empty. Users can see the feature in making by enabling it in Chrome Dev and Canary by putting this – “chrome://flags/#enable-chrome-home” into Chrome. Then click on the highlighted select menu, and then click ‘Enabled’. Now restart Chrome. However, Google is not the first one to think about this feature. Microsoft has had its Windows 10 Mobile’s Edge browser where the navigation bar is also placed at the bottom of the screen. Even Apple Safari has many browser controls at the bottom of the screen. And when it comes to the Windows feature, the PGO speeds up the startup time by almost 17 percent, new tab page load time by almost 15 percent, and overall page load time by 6 percent in Chrome browser. PGO optimises output files by taking data from test runs which represent how programs perform in a production environment. Please Wait while comments are loading...

It's a modular smartphone done right. It's something that LG tried and failed. The G5, although a fantastic smartphone, was modularly all over the place. It's something that Google has been trying to achieve for quite a while now with Project Ara. But, that Ara take on the modular phone concept is yet to see a consumer release. All the three companies share the same vision: aspire for a future where one smartphone fits them all would mean the end of buying a new one every year. It's a fantastic concept, the kind you always read about in Sci-Fi, and yet here we are. The modular smartphone is not a distant dream any more. It's out there and looking at the Moto Z, well, the future sure looks glorious indeed. The Moto Z is the spiritual successor to the original Moto X (more precisely, the Moto X Style) of last year. Lenovo might have killed the iconic Moto X, but there's a method to its madness. These are desperate times, and desperate times call for desperate measures. The Moto X was in dire need of evolution more than ever now. Better now than later. Also Read: Forget smartphones, the future belongs to modular phones The Moto Z is therefore a different smartphone. Different from anything Lenovo has ever built. It's a new-age Moto phone replete with top of the line hardware and top of the line premium looks. It's dreamy and yet so real. Amid the Galaxies and the iPhones and the Pixels, the Moto Z is without a doubt the most underrated phone of 2016. Design and build quality The Moto Z is undeniably the most premium Moto phone ever. It's an all-metal phone with 16 magnetic connector pins on the rear. The phone supports several modules that Lenovo calls Moto Mods which snap on to its back via these connector pins... without a tussle. The LG G5, in comparison, is downright intimidating in this regard. The entire lower strip of metal in the G5 pops out with the help of a small button. But it's not that simple. The button sits rather flush which means it wants your unflinching attention always and pulling out the module takes some time and effort. Popping it out and swapping it with a different module seemed way cooler on paper. Not so much in reality though. Also Read: Lenovo launches Moto Z Play & Moto Z in India, price starts at Rs 24,999 The Moto Z on the other hand looks cool -- as a modular phone -- and snapping those modules on to it seems even cooler. The phone doesn't end up looking like a laboratory experiment gone wrong. Google's Project Ara phone may have more modular options -- which is good -- but the whole thing still looks, for the lack of a better word, like a sophisticated toy. The biggest positive of Moto's approach, over LG's is that you don't have to turn off the Moto Z every time you feel the need to swap a new module. The G5 must be turned off every time you do that. Folks who made this phone knew from the very beginning what they were getting into. The Moto Z was supposed to be a phone and a modular one at that. The way the company was shaping it meant the phone would take a beating had it been as thick and chunky as previous Moto Xs. The Moto Z is razor thin -- 5.2mm to be precise - to the extent that it's ridiculous. Moto phones have always been huge and chunky blocks of plastic. They've been curvy, in a very Moto-esque kind of way. They've had this very characteristic dimple on the rear, which one would imagine could house a fingerprint scanner one day. The Moto Z, on the other hand, is flatter than a pancake and sharper than a Sony Xperia. It also has a very prominent camera bulge on the back that sticks out like a sore thumb. If that wasn't enough, the 16 magnetic connector pins on the rear look odd to the extent of looking ugly. This is a phone that literally shouts out to be shell-shocked always. Thankfully, Lenovo has a whole stack of swappable skin modules that you can buy separately and it includes one in the box. After all, a Moto Z without a style shell cover back plate is hard to imagine. It does come off quite easily when you accidentally drop it though, so you better be careful. The Moto Z looks cool -- as a modular phone -- and snapping those modules on to it seems even cooler. The phone doesn't end up looking like a laboratory experiment gone wrong The front, meanwhile, is very reminiscent of the Moto G4 Plus. The bezels have been well executed and screen-to-body ratio is also good. The phone comes with on-screen navigation keys and a fingerprint scanner below. The existence (and the positioning) of the odd square-shaped fingerprint scanner is questionable, much like it was in the Moto G4 Plus, but at least Lenovo can argue "where else would we place it, you know?" All of that is fine, but I still don't buy the idea of having soft keys and a fingerprint reader below that does nothing else but lock and unlock the phone. Maybe a Samsung approach (have a home button that doubles as fingerprint sensor flanked by capacitive keys) would have been better. There have been countless times when I hit the fingerprint reader expecting that it would take me home. But alas, it did not, because obviously! The Moto Z also does not have a 3.5mm audio jack and ships with a dongle in the box to connect your regular 3.5mm headphones. Display The 5.5-inch quad-HD (2560x1440 pixels) AMOLED display is one of the headlining features of the Moto Z. It's that good. The Moto Z has a stunning display for the price it commands, bringing it in line with top-of-the-line phones in this regard. It is sufficiently bright (but, could have been a little brighter) with mostly good colours (deep blacks, and often oversaturated colours) and excellent viewing angles. The phone gives users two built-in colour modes, should you like to tinker with settings. The Vibrant mode deserves a mention here as it does an excellent job of deepening the colours. The Moto Z gets substantially bright at peak brightness so outdoor legibility isn't much of a problem. More importantly, it maintains excellent viewing angles in outdoor environment so that reading text and watching videos is a pleasurable experience. Software The Moto Z runs an almost stock version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. You know that thing about Motorola phones? They stand only next to Nexus... err Pixel phones (which are straight out of house Google) in getting latest Android updates, and the Moto Z is no different. We hear Nougat is coming to it soon, so that's another reason to be excited about. But that's not the only thing I love about Moto phones. The Moto Z -- running vanilla Android -- is a treat to work with. There is bloatware or unwanted apps. The ones that are there, are in fact, quite useful. I am talking about Moto Z's Active Display and Touchless Control functions. These are part of Motorola's now well-known X8 Mobile Computing System. It is basically a Qualcomm chip (Snapdragon 820 in case of Moto Z) that comes packed with two additional low-power co-processors. It is these co-processors that are responsible for Active Display and Touchless Control functions. The Moto Z is therefore always on and listening and the main SoC doesn't have to sweat it out for this to happen. Active Display essentially gives you a quick look at your notifications, as well as system clock when you approach your phone. Simply dragging the notification up shows more detail, while dragging it down unlocks the phone and takes you straight inside the required app for further action. You can also choose which app notifications should appear on the lock screen from settings as well as turn it off if you want to. Meanwhile, Voice is Motorola's tailor-made Google Now which works even when the screen is off. Basically, you train the phone to answer to your voice, and next time all you do is say out the launch phrase (like Hey, Moto Z) to make the phone do what you want, like making a call to order a pizza or something. On the Moto Z, this feature works very well once you are past the "training phase." The phone also comes with Moto Assist and Actions. Assist allows a user to deal with different notifications at different times while with Actions, the phone reacts to motion gestures. In addition, every time you snap a new Moto Mod on to the Moto Z, the phone is smart enough to recognise the module and changes accordingly. This is because the company has incorporated modularity down to the software level. Performance and battery life In line with other top-tier flagship phones of the year, the Moto Z comes with a 2.15GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor clubbed with 4GB RAM and 64GB internal memory which is expandable by up to 256GB via microSD card. The dualSIM phone comes with a hybrid card slot, supports 4G LTE (VoLTE-ready), USB Type-C, OTG and NFC connectivity option. In line with other top-tier phones of the year, the Moto Z is an excellent all-round performer. It is in fact faster than the Samsung Galaxy S7, the LG G5 and to an extent even the OnePlus 3. Phones like the HTC 10 and the Google Nexus 6P give a similar experience. A lot of this must be attributed to the Moto Z's software. Owing to near stock Android and top-in-class hardware, the Moto Z is a pleasure to work around with. But, there's a catch. All that horsepower crammed inside a 5.2 mm frame means the Moto Z isn't so good at heat dissipation. It gets hot, at times uncomfortably, at almost all the times. In fact, the heat generated sometimes reaches levels where you can feel it even atop the style shell. It is quick to cool down, but Motorola should have thought about a solution and incorporated one inside the phone beforehand. The phone has heat management issues, something that can be a deal breaker in the longer run. Take the Mods away, and the Moto Z is still a very capable smartphone, a flagship smartphone The front-firing mono speaker on-board the Moto Z is downright disappointing. It gets loud, but not loud enough. There are better options in the market if you're looking for better audio. Phone calls made with the phone are of excellent quality and we did not encounter any odd call drop issues with our review unit. The 2,600 mAh battery inside the Moto Z is a big step down from the Moto X Style. Maybe it's another tradeoff to achieve that ridiculously thin frame, but you must understand that all that horsepower (processor + display) inside a phone would also need sufficient juice to work. Sadly, the company did not think this through. Battery life is an Achilles heel here. You must charge the Moto Z at least twice a day if you're a moderate to heavy user. Getting one day battery life out of it would need you to tone it down significantly. The phone supports Motorola's proprietary TurboCharging technology that charges the phone by up to 50 per cent in just 30 minutes, which is nice. Camera The Moto Z's 13-megapixel rear camera with f/1.8 aperture, laser autofocus, Optical Image Stabilisation and dual-LED (dual tone) flash is a mixed bag. While its focus and shutter speed are, quick and spot on in good light, these tend to go for a swing in tricky and low light situations. The phone takes a tad bit longer to focus, shoot and even longer still to process low light images. The camera app conveniently asks you hold the phone steadily in such situations and that can make a lot of difference should you be looking to capture a quick shot. Also, even though the phone's shutter speed is good, it often fails to effectively capture moving objects, in a way that phones like the Huawei P9, the Nexus 6P or even the Galaxy S7 can. X PreviousNextThe phone, however, captures good photos in good lighting and adequate ones in low lighting provided the subject is still and not moving. But then, lot many flagship phones tend to do that anyways. Some of them can do it even better. The Moto Z in such a case ends up looking like a mere mediocre camera phone in a sea of good camera phones in the market. The front 5-megapixel camera on-board the device however clicks good selfies even in tricky light and for low light it comes with an LED flash. The flash often results in washed out photos but at least you know you have the option when the lighting is bad. Should you buy it? The Moto Z succeeds as a modular smartphone in more ways than one. Lenovo's take on modularity is different from a certain Google or LG in that it sticks to the basics. It doesn't bite off more than it can chew, at least for now. Remember, it still doesn't have a solution for point-by-point customisation, but hey, even Google had to cut short its ambitions with Project Ara. Also Read: Google's modular Project Ara phone to launch in 2017 Lenovo has a total of four modules for the Moto Z: one that turns the phone into a Pico projector, one that acts as a portable power pack, and one that adds an extra JBL stereo speaker to it and a true zoom mod, made by Hasselblad that allows for up to 10 X optical zoom on the Moto Z. In addition, Lenovo has a whole batch of custom rear skin modules for the Moto Z. Price for the Moto Mods starts at Rs 6,999 and goes all the way to Rs 19,999. The phone itself costs Rs 39,999. The company has an accessible solution for almost every possibility than one can fathom on a smartphone. Hopefully, more will come. The Moto Z is a phone full of possibilities. Most importantly, Motorola has got it right in the first attempt. It can of course build on it I future. Take the Mods away, and the Moto Z is still a very capable smartphone, a flagship smartphone. It could have done with a better camera and a bigger battery, but hey, you win some and you lose some. Overall, we will call it a success. The Moto Z is not the best smartphone in the market but it does everything that it sets out to do well enough.

(Waze) Google Maps is the king of the online mapping industry, but that doesn't mean that the Google Maps app is the best navigation app for your Android phone. There are plenty of other navigation apps on the market, and most of them are just as speedy and accurate as Google Maps (some are more so). Google Maps is a good general maps app, but if you commute all day long or you primarily use public transit, it may not be the best app for you. Here are five other Android navigation apps you might want to check out: Waze Waze is technically owned by Google, but this "social" navigation app is completely separate from Google Maps. While Google Maps is a general navigation app, Waze is driving-focused, which means it offers some cool features like user-reported gas prices and turn-by-turn directions to parking lots near your destination. The app also has a robust community of users, and it uses this community to gather real-time traffic data and user-reported incidents, such as accidents, road closures, speed cameras and police traps. If you're looking for a friendly driving community that's committed to keeping the public informed about upcoming speed traps, Waze is the app for you. This app is all about social networking, so you can also plan trips with friends, sync events from your phone's calendar as well as your Facebook account and see the ETAs of friends who are traveling to the same place as you are. Here WeGo Here WeGo (which was originally developed for the Windows Phone platform by Nokia) is a free app that offers turn-by-turn directions for drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and public transit riders. The app also features real-time traffic information, nearby points of interest, the ability to share your location (or the location of a point of interest) with friends and family members and offline map downloads for when you don't have a data connection. Here WeGo offers just about everything Google Maps does, and a little more. The cycling directions and the public transportation overlays are useful, and the app's points of interest system is also pretty strong (the app pulls info from places like Wikipedia, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Expedia, Car2go and GetYourGuide). Moovit If you take public transportation frequently, you've probably noticed that Google Maps' directions are very basic. Moovit is a free, dedicated transit app that offers several features you won't find in Google Maps, such as step-by-step directions that will tell you how many stops you have left and alert you when it's time to get off the bus, train or ferry you're riding. Moovit also features an entire section dedicated to information about delays, maintenance and service interruptions. It also links you to the local transit agencies' Twitter accounts, so you can really feel like a local. Google Maps' public transit directions will work in a pinch, but Moovit -- which is available in 1,200 cities around the world (including over 100 cities in the US) -- is the app you need to really understand the local metro system. The app has even started integrating information about local bike shares in select cities. BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS If Moovit is for urban city-dwellers, BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS -- which costs $12 (roughly converting to £10 in the UK and AU$15 in Australia) but offers a 21-day free trial -- is for the opposite. BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS is an offline navigation app designed for people who are trekking through the wilderness. This app offers a variety of maps available for users to download, including topographic maps, marine maps and aviation maps. The app also has street maps (through OpenStreetMap and Bing World Street Maps) available, though its primary purpose is for navigating non-street areas. Other navigation apps (including Google Maps) understand the value of downloadable, offline maps, but most of those apps do not pay much attention to topography or navigation outside of cities and suburban areas. BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS is the app you'll need for those ultra-outdoorsy activities, though. Maps.me Maps.me is a free navigation app that focuses on offline navigation. This app lets you download entire cities (or, well, parts of cities) at a time for when you need to save data or you do not have internet access. Maps.me uses OpenStreetMap for its offline maps (but, unlike BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS, Maps.Me is completely free). The app offers turn-by-turn directions and a comprehensive list of points of interest -- including overlays for nearby places with Wi-Fi and toilets -- but does not offer real-time traffic information since it is, after all, an offline app. Maps.me is a handy app when you don't have internet, and, unlike some of the other apps that offers offline maps as an afterthought, Maps.me makes downloading apps quick and easy.   Join Albawaba Business Follow Albawaba Business Advertisement ©2016 Fars News Agency.

The URL bar, or address bar, is one of the core components of the browser. It is an interactive field that users can type in to search or load sites directly, and it also reveals the address of the current page on top of that. Since it is such an essential piece of any browser, it comes as no surprise that developers have not experimented a whole lot with placements for the URL bar. The majority of browsers display the URL bar at the top. Bottom URL Bar in Chrome Google runs an experiment currently on Google Chrome for Android -- only available in Chrome Canary and Dev currently -- that moves the address bar of the browser to the bottom when enabled. The feature is hidden behind a flag currently. These flags are used by Google to test not-yet-ready for public release features, or to test features to see how users find them. To enable the bottom URL Bar in Chrome for Android, do the following: Open Chrome Canary or Dev on Android. Load chrome://flags in the browser's address bar. Or, load chrome://flags/#enable-chrome-home directly to jump to the right flag on the page. Tap on the menu icon, select "find on page" and enter home. This should jump to the Chrome Home flag right away. Tap on the pulldown menu and switch the state to enabled. Restart Google Chrome. The URL bar is at the bottom of the browser screen after the restart. It works exactly like before but with the difference that menus and such open towards the top and not the bottom of the screen. Google has not revealed its plans for the URL bar. It is unclear therefore whether the company considers moving the main bar of the browser to the bottom in the future, or whether this is just an experiment to see how users react to the change. Microsoft did move the URL bar of its Edge mobile browser to the bottom bar as well. The main advantage of this is that it is easier to reach the address field and menu of the browser. (via Caschy) Now You: What's your take on this? Do you prefer the URL bar at the top or bottom?

While I like the idea, I find it not convenient for phones with on-screen buttons. The lower part becomes too crowded and difficult to use, always having to be careful for accidental presses.

The US has formally accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on US bodies. Image: Canon Boy/Shutterstock Microsoft says the attack on Windows is the handiwork of Russian hacker group Fancy Bear, which normally targets political parties. It kicked off yesterday when Google revealed the existence of a zero-day flaw, or security hole, that makes it possible to take control of a user’s computer. Microsoft has attributed the attack to Russian hacker group Strontium, otherwise know in the media as Fancy Bear. The latter have previously spearheaded attacks on political sites such as the Democrats in the US, as well as the World Anti-Doping Agency. Microsoft said that as well as the vulnerability in Windows pointed out by Google, the tech giant is also enduring a low-volume spear-phishing campaign orchestrated by the Russian hacker group. Google has some patching up to do with Microsoft Microsoft said that a patch to protect Windows users against the new threat will be released on 8 November, which is election day in the US. The US government last month formally blamed the Russian government for the hacks of the Democratic Party emails and their disclosure to Wikileaks. Microsoft said that it is coordinating with Google and Adobe to investigate the attacks by Fancy Bear. “Windows is the only platform with a customer commitment to investigate reported security issues and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible,” said Terry Myerson, vice president for Windows and Devices at Microsoft. “And we take this responsibility very seriously. “Recently, the activity group that Microsoft Threat Intelligence calls Strontium conducted a low-volume spear-phishing campaign. “Customers using Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 Anniversary Update are known to be protected from versions of this attack observed in the wild. “This attack campaign, originally identified by Google’s threat analysis group, used two zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and the down-level Windows kernel to target a specific set of customers.” Myerson did not hide Microsoft’s displeasure at Google’s decision to reveal the threat. “Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” he said. “To address these types of sophisticated attacks, Microsoft recommends that all customers upgrade to Windows 10, the most secure operating system we’ve ever built, complete with advanced protection for consumers and enterprises at every layer of the security stack. “Customers who have enabled Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) will detect Strontium’s attempted attacks, thanks to ATP’s generic behaviour detection analytics and up-to-date threat intelligence,” Myerson said.

Yahoo! announced the state released its proposal for regulations that govern the testing of autonomous vehicles. But industry leaders, including representatives from Google’s Self-Driving Car Project, are raising fears that these regulations will significantly bog down development of self-driving cars in California. The proposed rules have raised the hackles of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, whose members include Ford, Uber, Google, Lyft and Volvo. Coalition leader David Strickland said California’s regulations “could greatly delay the benefits that self-driving vehicles can bring to safety and mobility for individuals.” The proposed rules are based on National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) guidelines issued in September. However, where the NHTSA opted for voluntary adherence to these guidelines, California has proposed mandatory compliance, which has spooked industry. Corporate players were also upset by California’s proposed stipulation that autonomous vehicle testers must obtain approval from every town and city they seek to trial cars in. As well, California has proposed that before even applying for a permit to operate autonomous vehicles in the state, makers of self-driving cars must gather test data for a year. This last caveat went over like a lead balloon, sparking objections from such industry heavyweights as Ford, Honda, Google, General Motors and Volkswagen. California market size means outsized influence Many industry watchers see California as having an out-sized influence on self-driving car development in America, often setting the pace for other U.S. states. This is largely because California is a major tech hub for the development of autonomous vehicles, with 18 companies currently testing self-driving technology in the state. In a recent article, Santa Fe Institute professor Luís Bettencourt said locations that are open to autonomous vehicles will see a dramatic transformation. “If this transformation is to take place, driverless vehicle manufacturers will need to find welcoming locations to test their products,” he says. Bettencourt predicts that driverless automobiles will transform congested cities by dramatically reducing cars on the road. As well, robot cars acting as taxis will free up large tracts of land currently used for parking and gas stations.

The statement comments that ”the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen” while adding the word “some” to the line that it wants to “wait for SOME further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives”. This all suggests that things are moving in the right direction, but the Presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting. Assuming Clinton wins, markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity. This, coupled with the reasonably firm growth, rising employment and a gradual pick-up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a December rate hike. Should Trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power. It is hard to imagine the Fed hiking in this environment. We also have plenty more data to come ahead of the December 14 FOMC meeting, including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution. The Fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar, and US markets have struggled for direction after the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 33 points, compared to around 70 ahead of the statement. The US dollar index has lost 0.3% to 97.38. On that note, it’s time to close for the evening.

Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: With just days to go before election fever sweeps America, Janet Yellen’s Federal Interest Rate statement held no shocks with rates remaining the same. However, it’s becoming ever more likely that Yellen will implement a raise early next month following signs that the American economy is gradually picking up steam. She made clear in September that a rise before the end of 2016 was more than likely and with employment and inflation continuing to strengthen the central bank may get its wish. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.07pm EDT 14:07 The Fed has dropped a reference to inflation remaining low in the near term. In September it said: Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. This now reads: Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.04pm EDT 14:04 The Fed said in its statement: The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.

While most commentators expect there to be no change - not this close to the presidential election - the prospect of a rate rise in December is thought to be reasonably likely, given the recent reassuring US economic data. There is likely to be a focus - as usual - on the exact wording of the Fed statement and whether it shows any changes from the September comments. At that meeting seven of the Fed members voted for no change, with three, Esther George, Loretta Mester, and Eric Rosengren, backing an increase. Any variance here could also give a clue to the likely outcome in December. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.59pm EDT 12:59 European markets hit by US election fears Investors have been unnerved by suggestions that Donald Trump is gaining ground in the US presidential race, with one poll this week even showing him in the lead over Hillary Clinton. Combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in US crude stocks, this has pushed markets in Europe sharply lower. But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 100 points or so on Tuesday, has not been hit as badly (so far), and is currently down just 20 points ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Meanwhile the Vix index of volatility, seen as a gauge of investor fears, is up 3% to 19. When Clinton looked a shoo-in to win, the index was hovering around 13. But despite this recent rise, it is still well below the 25 level it reached after the Brexit vote in June. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Less than a week out from the US election and markets are demonstrating both complacency and a palpable fear at the same time. A surge in the VIX index shows volatility is on the rise and investors are hedging equity exposure with safe havens like gold and government bonds. But at the same time equity benchmarks are only modestly down, showing an overriding comfort in owning stocks. The VIX is up over 40% in the last seven days, reaching above 18, a level in which many investors sit up and pay attention to signs of heightened risk in the market. Over that same period the FTSE 100 and S&P 500 are down 2-3%. There is still a general perception that Hillary Clinton will take the White House, but the surprise Brexit result is fresh in minds of investors and they are buying gold and VIX index tracking products to hedge their bets. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 71.72 points or 1.04% to 6845.42, its lowest level since 27 September Germany’s Dax dropped 1.47% to 10,370.93 France’s Cac closed down 1.24% at 4414.67 Italy’s FTSE MIB finished 2.51% lower at 16,474.52 Spain’s Ibex ended down 1.85% at 8873.4 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 581.56.

Jitters about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the White House have sent the US currency lower, to the benefit of sterling which is now up 0.57% at $1.2313, a three week high. The pound is not faring so well against the euro but nor is it losing ground, being pretty much unchanged at €1.1078.

The FTSE 100 is currently down 0.9%, Germany’s Dax has dropped 1.2% and France’s Cac has lost 1.1%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has not been so badly hit and is currently 0.2% lower. That could mean that investors are not necessarily convinced by polls showing Trump in the lead. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: The markets are not in full on panic mode right now, suggesting that they still think Clinton could clinch a win next week. This is reflected in the Vix volatility index, which is considered a fear gauge for Wall Street. Even though it has risen in recent days it is still below 20%, to put this in context, after the Brexit vote in June volatility spiked above 25%. Global stock markets are generally lower on Wednesday, but US markets have outperformed their European counterparts even with 6 days to go before the US election. Interestingly, the Dow Jones Transport Index, considered a lead indicator for Wall Street, is higher today. Considering a Trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the US economy, the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the Clinton camp, suggests that the US equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility spikes further, or until the actual result is confirmed. But the other potentially market moving event is the US Federal Reserve interest rate announcement later. Brooks said: The market is expecting a 14% chance of a hike tonight. If the Fed does hike, that would throw the cat among the pigeons, and we could see a steeper sell off in equities, a rally in bond yields and a broad-based recovery in the dollar. However, in our view the bigger risk from today’s meeting could be a dovish slant from the Federal Reserve, who may not want to commit to a rate hike until the election result is confirmed. Although the Fed is expected to be politically neutral, a potential market sell-off on the back of a win for Trump next week could put the prospect of a December rate hike to bed for the Fed. Added to this, the Fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent weeks, so a sell-off in the dollar on Wednesday could be in advance of a dovish “shock” from the Fed later on today.

Earlier with Wikimedia Foundation's India Program and currently at the Centre for Internet and Society's Access To Knowledge program. Articles written here are in » More about me Learn how you can contribute 6 ways to use open tools to better support Indian languages Posted 01 Nov 2016 Subhashish PanigrahiFeed 19up Image by :  opensource.com India is a large and a populated country that makes up a large base of Google consumers. So in recent years, Google's widened support of world languages for its various products has been a blessing. It has specifically helped Indian people grow their use of and participation on the Internet. For one, Google Summer of Code helps students experiment with and build prototypes that enhance language-based software. Another way is through Google Translate, a web and app-based platform that provides machine translation from one language to another. It is predominantly maintained and serviced by volunteer contributions. Yet, there are more ways Google can support great inclusivity through the support of world languages; particularly people speaking South Asian-languages. This article is a collection of ideas expressed by some Wikimedia contributors. 1. Update Google search Google's Indian homepage currently has options for changing the interface and for searching in a few Indian languages, but as many as 13 Indian languages that are part of the 8th schedule of Indian constitution are missing. 2. Openly license Google Translate More people could help improve Google Translate if it were available under a free license. Volunteers and many organizations have made their own sources available under open licenses, so it seems fair for Google to open their source under a free license for others to use. 3. Use Wikidata for Google Translate Odia is an example of a largely used Indian language that is not supported on Google Translate. The reason could be that there are a lower number of translated strings on the Google platform for translators to contribute words and phrases. One way to improve the translation to many English words, and other languages, is to use existing translations on free knowledge platforms like Wikidata. Wikidata is a sister project of Wikipedia and a free knowledge base that contains over 23,906,929 entries (at the moment) in multiple languages. The entries are structured and related, so this would be a great source. For instance, the entry about artificial intelligence on Wikidata not only has the commonly used word for AI in the native language but it also connects various other entries that are related to AI.  Note: Google Translate is now improved by Google Machine Neural Translation, so errors are expected to reduce by 80%, and the Spanish-English translation has scored 5.0 out of 6, where human translators score about 5.1. 4. Use Wikitionary for Google Translate Google Translate currently provides pronunciation for both web and mobile devices for some of the languages—let's expand. The Indian language community is currently adding the meaning of words and their pronunciation to Wiktionary, a Wikimedia project and a free online multilingual dictionary. 5. Place a common forum on Google Translate If outside contributions were allowed, a forum would allow them to discuss and gain consensus on language standards and grammar. 6. Use Wikisource to improve Optical Character Recognition Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a tool used for Google Drive to support scripts. Some use OCR to digitize freely-licensed (public domain, CC-BY, and CC-BY-SA licensed) books on Wikisource, which serves as a free library to digitize and preserve books. After digitization, these books are proofread to ensure that the resulting text is correct. The output of this process can be used by Google to improve their records and the OCR tool, which is not very effective for old, printed texts in Indian languages.

There are plenty of other navigation apps on the market, and most of them are just as speedy and accurate as Google Maps (some are more so). Google Maps is a good general maps app, but if you commute all day long or you primarily use public transit, it may not be the best app for you. Here are five other Android navigation apps you might want to check out: Waze Waze is technically owned by Google, but this "social" navigation app is completely separate from Google Maps. While Google Maps is a general navigation app, Waze is driving-focused, which means it offers some cool features like user-reported gas prices and turn-by-turn directions to parking lots near your destination. The app also has a robust community of users, and it uses this community to gather real-time traffic data and user-reported incidents, such as accidents, road closures, speed cameras and police traps. If you're looking for a friendly driving community that's committed to keeping the public informed about upcoming speed traps, Waze is the app for you. This app is all about social networking, so you can also plan trips with friends, sync events from your phone's calendar as well as your Facebook account and see the ETAs of friends who are traveling to the same place as you are. Here WeGo Here WeGo (which was originally developed for the Windows Phone platform by Nokia) is a free app that offers turn-by-turn directions for drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and public transit riders. The app also features real-time traffic information, nearby points of interest, the ability to share your location (or the location of a point of interest) with friends and family members and offline map downloads for when you don't have a data connection. Here WeGo offers just about everything Google Maps does, and a little more. The cycling directions and the public transportation overlays are useful, and the app's points of interest system is also pretty strong (the app pulls info from places like Wikipedia, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Expedia, Car2go and GetYourGuide). Moovit If you take public transportation frequently, you've probably noticed that Google Maps' directions are very basic. Moovit is a free, dedicated transit app that offers several features you won't find in Google Maps, such as step-by-step directions that will tell you how many stops you have left and alert you when it's time to get off the bus, train or ferry you're riding. Moovit also features an entire section dedicated to information about delays, maintenance and service interruptions. It also links you to the local transit agencies' Twitter accounts, so you can really feel like a local. Google Maps' public transit directions will work in a pinch, but Moovit -- which is available in 1,200 cities around the world (including over 100 cities in the US) -- is the app you need to really understand the local metro system. The app has even started integrating information about local bike shares in select cities. BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS If Moovit is for urban city-dwellers, BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS -- which costs $12 (roughly converting to £10 in the UK and AU$15 in Australia) but offers a 21-day free trial -- is for the opposite. BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS is an offline navigation app designed for people who are trekking through the wilderness. This app offers a variety of maps available for users to download, including topographic maps, marine maps and aviation maps. The app also has street maps (through OpenStreetMap and Bing World Street Maps) available, though its primary purpose is for navigating non-street areas. Other navigation apps (including Google Maps) understand the value of downloadable, offline maps, but most of those apps do not pay much attention to topography or navigation outside of cities and suburban areas. BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS is the app you'll need for those ultra-outdoorsy activities, though. Maps.me Maps.me is a free navigation app that focuses on offline navigation. This app lets you download entire cities (or, well, parts of cities) at a time for when you need to save data or you do not have internet access. Maps.me uses OpenStreetMap for its offline maps (but, unlike BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS, Maps.Me is completely free). The app offers turn-by-turn directions and a comprehensive list of points of interest -- including overlays for nearby places with Wi-Fi and toilets -- but does not offer real-time traffic information since it is, after all, an offline app. Maps.me is a handy app when you don't have internet, and, unlike some of the other apps that offers offline maps as an afterthought, Maps.me makes downloading apps quick and easy.         LATEST STORIES (4) Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus Syrian Army Missile Hits Militants' Gathering in Southern Aleppo Hashd Al-Shaabi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Military Operations West of Mosul Anti-Trump Protests Continue across US Cities Spokesman: Iran's Missile Power Not Negotiable Tasting Justice: ISIL Being Driven Away in Iraq and Syria Iran, Russia Stress Boosting Mutual Cooperation Spokesman: AEOI Not Concerned About Trump Aides' Remarks Hashd Al-Shaabi Rescues 300 Sunni Families Battle for Mosul Day 28: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Mosul Operation Russia, Iran Plan $10bln Arms Deal Report: Russian Strategic Bombers Prepare to Strike Terrorists in Syria Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syria: Jeish Al-Fatah Declares State of Emergency in Aleppo Iran Urges Unity Among Muslim Nations Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army troops continued to hit the terrorist groups' defense lines and gatherings and seized back new regions in Western Ghouta, tightening the siege of the militant-held town of Khan al-Sheih.

Microsoft Disappointed with Google, Says It Puts Windows Users at Increased Risk GO Terry Myerson discusses Google’s decision to make a Windows vulnerability public when no patch was available Nov 2, 2016 07:02 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Google publicly disclosed a zero-day flaw in Windows that is not yet patched by Microsoft and this made the software giant very unhappy with its rival, and now Terry Myerson, Executive Vice President, Windows and Devices Group, turns to the company’s TechNet blog to explain that with this decision, the search firm puts Windows users “at increased risk.” Myerson explains in his post that the security flaw is exploited by the group called STRONTIUM who launched a spear-phishing campaign that’s specifically aimed at computers vulnerable to two different zero-day holes in Adobe Flash. The Microsoft executive adds that the campaign was detected by Google’s Threat Analysis Group, and the company is now working with all involved parties, including Google and Adobe, to develop a patch and release it to Windows systems in order to make everyone secure. The patch will be rolled out next week on November 8 when Microsoft issues this month’s Patch Tuesday cycle. “Windows is the only platform with a customer commitment to investigate reported security issues and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible. And we take this responsibility very seriously,” Myerson points out. “Google puts our users at risk” At the same time, the Microsoft executive also criticized Google for making this security vulnerability public, explaining that the search company put Windows users at increased risk. The vulnerability disclosure took place as a result of Google’s policy which gives software companies 10 days to release patches for security flaws that are flagged as critical. “We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” Myerson explained. Adobe has already patched the Flash Player vulnerabilities that are being exploited by attackers, and both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are already secure, so if you’re running any of the two browsers, you’re on the safe side. Additionally, customers with Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) are also secure, and all attacks are automatically blocked. #Microsoft#Windows#Google#Windows security#zero-day flaw subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Windows Phone Reinvented: VR-Ready Alcatel IDOL 4S Officially Launched End of an Era: Microsoft Stops Selling Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 to PC Makers Microsoft Confirms It Removed Windows Store Apps, Says Focus Is on Quality - Exclusive Microsoft’s Really Having a Hard Time Moving Users from Chrome to Edge Browser OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE Salix Xfce 14.2 Live Edition Released, It's Based on Xfce 4.12 & Slackware 14.2    Microsoft says it's already working with Google and Adobe to patch the flaw New Apps OutlookStatView: Small-sized and portable tool that displays general statistics of your Outlook emails, featuring many useful configuration settings VidePub: Cut certain parts of video streams, remove logos and store them by using this lightweight application with an accessible interface IMVU: Accessible and useful communication application that enables you to create 3D animated characters and chat with all your friends QtlMovie: A video and audio transcoding application that bundles all the necessary tools for handling video files, adding them subtitles and creating DVDs MP4 Downloader: A lightweight and efficient software solution that allows you to download videos from popular websites, convert them to several formats and play them on portable devices ProgDVB Professional: Watch TV channels from around the world, listen to radio station from the comfort of your computer, and record your favorite shows to watch them later ProcessKO: Terminate active processes or schedule them for later termination, as well as create a favorites list for fast access using this portable tool Reader comments Load old comments   Russia Starts Microsoft Antivirus Investigation After Kaspersky Complaint more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechCyber Security Hacking group targets Windows, Adobe Flash 2016-11-02 08:42 - Dina Bass Post a comment 0 share: RELATED ARTICLES French candidates wary after US election hacks Millions of car remotes susceptible to hacking - study Hacked bitcoin exchange users lose 36% of deposits Seattle - Microsoft Corp. said a computer-hacking group that has previously targeted government agencies attacked its Windows software and Adobe Systems Inc.’s Flash program. The company will release a security patch for its operating system on Novomber 8, Windows chief Terry Myerson said on Tuesday in a blog post on Microsoft’s website. Users of Microsoft’s Edge browser on the latest update to Windows 10 are protected from the flaw, the company said. The security exploit, by a group Microsoft calls Strontium, was discovered by Google’s Threat Analysis Group and announced on Monday. The attacks, which sought to take control of a user’s computer, took advantage of so-called zero-day flaws, or security holes that are unknown to the product’s vendor and therefore no patch has yet been developed. "Strontium is an activity group that usually targets government agencies, diplomatic institutions, and military organizations, as well as affiliated private sector organizations such as defense contractors and public policy research institutes," according to the Microsoft blog. "Microsoft has attributed more 0-day exploits to Strontium than any other tracked group in 2016." The group is also known as Fancy Bear and APT 28 and has been previously linked to the Russian government and U.S. political hacks, Reuters reported. Google’s Disclosure In a blog post on Monday, Google said it reported the issue to Adobe and Microsoft on Oct. 21, and Adobe updated Flash five days later. The internet-search giant, a unit of Alphabet Inc., said its policy is to disclose actively exploited security vulnerabilities after seven days. Still, Microsoft expressed displeasure with Google for announcing the hack before a patch for Windows was available. "Responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure," Myerson wrote in the blog. "Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk."

The disclosure was made after a 7 day period that Google gives to vendors to patch or advise users on a critical, actively used zero day exploit. Microsoft responded with a post in its Threat Research & Response Blog that called the public disclosure by Google, “disappointing.” The vulnerability was apparently being used by a Russian government sponsored threat actor that is widely known as “Fancy Bear”. Microsoft refers to the group as “Strontium”. The disclosure by Google and the Microsoft response comes in the backdrop of the US Government accusing Russia of sponsoring a hacking campaign aimed at sabotaging the 2016 US Presidential Elections. It is unknown if the particular vulnerability disclosed by Google was used by Russian hackers. However, both Google and Microsoft acknowledge that the vulnerability is being actively used. Microsoft has plans to release a patch to fix the vulnerability by November 8, which is election day. Google and Microsoft are on opposite sides of a long running information security debate. The question is whether to publicly disclose an actively used zero day exploit. Publicly unknown critical vulnerabilities are often used by state sponsored threat actors, and such hacks can potentially affect a lot of people. Strontium for example is known to target government agencies, diplomatic institutions, the military and private defence contractors. Google believes that publicly revealing a vulnerability puts pressure on the vendor to quickly patch the update. Every day a zero day exploit is unknown to the public, increases the incidences of the vulnerability being used to compromise critical systems. Microsoft holds that publicly disclosing a vulnerability only increases the incidences of the exploit being used by malicious entities. Since vulnerabilities involve multiple companies, the disclosure mechanism should focus on Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD), giving vendors enough time to comprehensively patch the affected products. This is not the first time Google has publicly disclosed a Microsoft vulnerability before Microsoft patched the issue. In January 2015, Google publicly disclosed critical vulnerabilities just two days before Microsoft released a scheduled security update. The public disclosures by Google ultimately harm the consumers according to Microsoft. It puts unnecessary pressure on the process of patching the vulnerability. Even issuing a fix could provoke attacks on unpatched systems, so public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability is that much more dangerous. Chris Betz, senior director of the Microsoft Security Response Center, had called for Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure at that time, and had posted “Although following through keeps to Google’s announced timeline for disclosure, the decision feels less like principles and more like a “gotcha”, with customers the ones who may suffer as a result. What’s right for Google is not always right for customers. We urge Google to make protection of customers our collective primary goal.” It is not as if Google is known for its high standards of security, considering the abysmal state of Android security. There are a steady stream of Android vulnerabilities including Quadrooter, Stagefright 2, Audio Effect and others. There are several problems with Google’s approach. Google has decided the appropriate response time that vendors have to fix critical issues. Microsoft competes and cooperates with Google in various areas, and such disclosures could easily derail an otherwise healthy relationship. Microsoft is a major vendor or technological products, and it seems petty for Google to call out Microsoft over security holes. Google should respect the approach by Microsoft here, pre-empting the official moves by the vendor to fix their own security issues by a few days does not seem to be achieving anything. Google does not need to play the champion of information security here, an unwanted third party interference could easily jeopardise a process as critical as patching a zero day exploit. Google directly informing the affected vendors of previously unknown vulnerabilities is heroic enough.

The company is having trouble meeting demand for the Pixel phone. The company has sold out the new smartphone's many versions at the Google Store since launch. However, customers who have ordered shortly after the launch are still waiting past their expected shipping date to get the phone. The company promises the credit once the phone arrives. Reddit users reportedly got an email, which said, 'It's going to take a little longer for you to receive your package than we expected....We're going to send you a $50 Google Play credit via email soon after your package is delivered.' It was on October 4 that Google unveiled its two newest flagship phones the Pixel and the Pixel XL at an event in San Francisco, California. Pre-orders for the Pixel phones started with prices starting at $649 for the Pixel and $769 for the Pixel XL. The Pixel and Pixel XL are Google's first phones with full control of the development process, even though the devices are being manufactured by HTC. The devices will come with 'phone by Google' branding. The previous Google flagship phones were under the Nexus brands. Google Pixel features a 5-inch full HD display while Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch Quad HD screen. The smartphones will be available in black and silver colors. Both the devices are built using aerospace-grade aluminum unibody.

Join For Free What Exactly Are Android Instant Apps? Ever since Google announced its Instant Apps, the tech world has been caught up in this fascinating new topic. So what is this new discovery? According to Google, “Android Instant Apps enables Android apps to run instantly, without requiring installation. Instant Apps let you experience what you love about apps — fast and beautiful user interfaces, high performance, and great capabilities — with just a tap.” How convenient would it be to be able to search on Google for specific pages, and then having suggested applications mixed in as a result as well? To be able to have applications that run on an only-as-you-need it basis is quite revolutionary. Search for what you want, click the app and start using a version of it for what you need right then and there. There will be no need to wait for downloads or to take up unnecessary space on your smartphone. We don’t always know what we want when it comes to apps and we don’t always know if we will use it as much as we plan to. With Android Instant Apps, you will have the ability to try and test your app before purchasing it. You can compare the features of Android Instant Apps with this available option to get a real taste of what you want to download before actually downloading or purchasing it. The idea is pretty simple. Instead of choosing the “download” option for an app you want to try out, you can simply click on a URL link that will allow you to have a preview of the app with limited capabilities. This only works if the app has an instant app version. It’s important to keep in mind that for the full benefits and features, you will still have to download it. But it’s great to have access to the functionalities and idea of the app without having to actually download it. We are in a world of convenience and Android Instant Apps are paving the way for all apps in the upcoming years. Google VP Dave Burke mentioned that the idea behind Instant Apps is to make the app experience as convenient as surfing to a website. What Is the Potential Development for Instant Apps? We can begin to expect a lot of growth in the area of applications. Big changes are being made and it’s only a matter of time until they are in the hands and pockets of the public. Instant Apps are also already suggesting interesting practical ideas to build upon. For example, Google demonstrated a situation where Google Instant Apps can be used to pay for parking. Rather than downloading an app in the parking lot, users can place their phone against a wireless chip on the parking meter. With this, the user will be able to quickly pay for the parking with Android Pay, and the app would disappear when it is no longer in use or needed. In today’s fast world, more people have smartphones yet less people are downloading apps. Why? Limited phone storage space is always a problem. Google recognizes this and tends to this matter by offering us this solution of Instant Apps, where we can use app like features when we need it. It makes sense. No one wants to download an app, use up storage space, and use it only once every few months. Instant Apps can also help developers bypass the difficulties of the app store. Nowadays, the app world is a very competitive place, so it takes a lot of hard work to get people to install new versions or to climb the rankings. Instead of going through this torture, developers can now just simply copy, paste, and share the direct Instant App link to social media sites such as Twitter. What Are the Benefits? More Downloads: With Android Instant Apps, it will be much easier for users to find out whether they like an app or not right away. It seems that one of the biggest challenges in app marketing is getting users to commit to purchasing and downloading an app. No more waiting for downloading and installing. They will be able to get the app and experience it has to offer before deciding whether or not they really want it in the long run. Being Discovered: Instant Apps are going to bridge the gap between web searches and getting users to the app store. The Instant Apps are functioning like both a web page and an app combined. It works similar to web pages in a way that it can be launched from anywhere. Improving discovery always was one of the main challenges in app promotion. Simple for Developers: Google promises that developers will be able to adapt easily to Instant Apps since the existing app will just need an Instant Apps layer. The app can be packaged as one download or it can be bundled into chunks. However, the idea is not for developers to create entirely new apps. Developers will need to create two builds: the normal app version and the instant version. According to Google, skilled developers can finish the process for many apps in a day or less, but it largely depends on the complexity of the app itself. What Are the Potential Disadvantages? Adoption problems for large enterprises: Large enterprises may face difficulties with maintaining Instant Apps because the team responsible for the native app is often fragmented from the rest of the company. The amount of stress to integrate the team may be a hassle in itself. In general, it seems large companies may not be too keen on the new life of Instant Apps since they already have to maintain a mobile website and a full native app. In relation to this, some companies are able to avoid these issues altogether. Some clients will never face this problem if they don’t have to integrate their team of developers. Their developer team will already be remote and will be able to get technical support if needed and at any time. This is another advantage of outsourcing. Reduced user engagement: For the time being, Google also shares that Instant Apps are limited in space (4mb). Because of this, users can only use the application partially and it won’t give them the full user experience that the original version of the app can provide. However, this may encourage the user to download the app if they like their initial experiences.Android Instant Apps may potentially reduce the engagement of users since most situations only require users to have the app for a short period of time to get what they need. However, the reduced engagement can be balanced by better discovery and user awareness of your brand.

It seems that there are great opportunities for users and for app developers. Google Instant Apps is still a pretty fresh concept and it will slowly make its way out on the market as well as to the public. We can expect significant growth of this innovation technology in future, but at the moment we just wait for new announces from Google.

Google has a policy of disclosing critical zero day vulnerabilities if the affected companies do not issue an advisory or path the vulnerability within seven days of Google privately reporting its discoveries to the affected parties. The vulnerability was publicly disclosed by the Google Threat Analysis Group. The Microsoft Malware Protection Center has responded with a post on the Threat Research & Response Blog, outlining the specifics of the vulnerability. The attacker sends a spoofed email to the target. The email exploits the adobe flash player to gain control of the browser. The privileges are escalated at this time for the malware to escape the browser sandbox. Finally, a backdoor is installed on the system of the target, that allows the hackers to remotely control the machine, and execute further attacks through the compromised computer. “We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk.” Terry Myerson, Executive Vice President, Windows and Devices Group noted in the blog post. The exploit was apparently used by a government sponsored hacking group known as Strontium. Strontium has used the most zero day vulnerabilities among all the threats that Microsoft has tracked over time. These are highly targeted attacks against government agencies, diplomatic institutions, the military, and private defence contractors. Strontium is known to have exploited the vulnerability in a spear phishing campaign. This kind of attack compromises targets by sending emails that appear to be from known sources. Strontium is known to doggedly stay on a target for months, persistently spreading from one compromised system to another. Microsoft promised a security patch by November 8. The latest version of Windows 10 is not affected by the vulnerability. Microsoft is working with Adobe to path the previous versions. All versions from Windows Vista onward, except Windows 10 are affected by this zero day exploit. Microsoft recommends users switch to the latest operating system for the most secure usage experience.

After a well-respected tester of the Android Community recorded data from the Google Pixel, it turned out the 5-inch HTC-built Google phone was not charging at the advertised 18W of peak power that the charger is rated for. After Android Poilice (perfect context for the publications title) reached out to Google for clarification of the testers findings, Google admitted an oversight in the description of the phones specification pages when it listed both phones capable of charging at 18W. Google Pixel (top) Google Pixel XL (bottom) Google has fixed the detail on the website which now reads: 15W  18W charging where It previously read: 18W charging. While its not known exactly why Google decided to limit the peak charging wattage on the smaller Pixel, Google has admitted a minor oversight of the detail since its discovery. Know that this should make no difference to your Google Pixels normal operation. Since the 18W charger is included in both models, only one of them will be able to utilize the full wattage, the Pixel XL. If youre interested, you can check out Nathans scientific findings of the Google Pixels charging speeds, temperatures, and rates.

Microsoft rebuked Google for releasing details of a security flaw in the Windows kernel for which a patch is not yet available. Microsoft officials said that Google's disclosure potentially endangers customers and that they believe in coordinated vulnerability disclosures. In an Oct. 31 blog post, Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard, security researchers with Google's Threat Analysis Group, said a local privilege escalation bug exists in the Windows kernel. Attackers can take advantage of the flaw to escape a security sandbox, the researchers warned. The vulnerability is especially serious because attackers are already exploiting it in the wild, the two Google researchers said. However, in an statement emailed to eWEEK, Microsoft challenged Google's description of the issue. "We disagree with Google's characterization of a local elevation of privilege as 'critical' and 'particularly serious,'" the statement said. In a Nov. 1 blog post, Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices group, said the attack identified by Google's Threat Analysis Group used two-zero days, one in the Windows kernel and the other in Adobe Flash. Adobe has already patched the flaw, so the attack scenario that the Google researchers described has already been fully mitigated. Patches for all affected Windows versions are being tested and will be released Nov. 8, Myerson wrote. "We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure," Myerson wrote. "Google's decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk." The Google researchers claimed to have notified Microsoft of the issue on Oct. 21 and then disclosed the flaw publicly after seven days, in keeping with Google's vulnerability disclosure policy for zero-day bugs that are being actively exploited. Typically, Google gives software developers 60 days to address critical vulnerabilities that are reported in their product before going public with the data. For companies that are unable for some reason to get a fix out in that time frame—especially flaws that are being exploited—Google has recommended they at least issue within seven days some sort of a mitigation procedure for working around the issue. Google has admitted that seven days is an aggressive timeline, but insists it is enough to at least publish advice about potential mitigations. Google's decision to release details of the vulnerability before Microsoft had a chance to get out a fix has surfaced a long-standing debate over responsible disclosure. Many security researchers have long held that vendors should be given a reasonable shot at fixing reported flaws in their products before details of the vulnerability are publicly disclosed. Others, especially bug hunters, have said the only way to get some vendors to address security issues quickly is to give them a tight deadline for fixing the issues and to threaten them with public disclosure if they don't. The latest incident shows why some sort of regulatory requirement is implemented to guide disclosure practices, said Udi Yavo, chief technology officer and co-founder at security vendor enSilo. "The Google-Microsoft disclosure dispute is yet another example of why the 90-day window for vulnerability disclosure that has been industry practice for some time should be an actual regulatory requirement," he said in an emailed statement. The legislation should spell out the grace time that is available for vendors that are not able to meet the 90-day window and the consequences for violating these rules. Releasing vulnerability information prematurely before a vendor has fixed a zero-day flaw, as Google did in this instance, serves no one, except the small community of researchers who know how to take advantage of it, Yavo said. "We have been here before," said Cris Thomas, strategist at Tenable Network Security. "Vendors need to remember that when it comes to releasing bugs the researcher has all the power. They can do whatever they want with their information, including completely ignoring their carefully crafted disclosure policies." In this instance, it appears that the Google researchers did not feel that Microsoft's policy for addressing actively exploited bugs was reasonable, Thomas said in a statement.           LATEST SECURITY ARTICLES   Linux Foundation Back Reproducible Builds Effort for Secure Software Network Worm Could Infect 'Smart' Home Devices, Researchers Show SEC Filing Indicates Yahoo Might Have Known About Data Breach in 2014 Ixia's ATIP Security Processor Accelerates Threat Detection RiskIQ Raises $30.5 Million in Series C Funding To Support Future Growth                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...
