It’s perhaps no coincidence Google also inexplicably stopped manufacturing 7-inch Nexuses back in 2013, focusing on larger, far less popular form factors. The 2014-released HTC-produced N9 was practically forgotten before 2013’s second-gen Asus Nexus 7, which we still remember fondly of to this day, while the all-Google-developed-and-marketed Pixel C from last year could never properly take off. The signs pointed to an inevitable end of vanilla Android-powered slates, but out of nowhere, an extremely credible rumor has just surfaced, calling for “Google’s Huawei-built 7-inch tablet” to be commercially rolled out “before the end of the year.” Is that you, Nexus 7P? Highly unlikely, given the prospective death of Nexus-branded phones, and the looming birth of the Pixel and Pixel XL. Instead, it makes way more sense for a third Pixel-labeled gadget to also see daylight on October 4, with 4GB RAM apparently on deck, and all other specs currently under wraps. If Huawei helps design the long overdue 2013 Nexus 7 sequel, you have to assume the recently unveiled MediaPad M3 8.4, or maybe the slightly older MediaPad T2 7.0 Pro, will lend it some aesthetic or hardware components. A high-res screen, metal construction, capable cameras, possibly even a Kirin 950 processor. Source: Twitter Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Sounds confusing? Well in its most simple form, SEO relates to trying to get your website listed as high up in the Google or Bing search results page as possible. In theory, the higher up your site appears in the search results, the more likely you are to gaining additional traffic to your event website. Simple stuff right? Let’s get started on some basic tips so you can get started. SEO Audit Before you start on your SEO journey, it is important to understand where you currently stand in terms of SEO and your site. To do this, we recommend carrying out an SEO audit. There are great free resources available out there that will help you analyse your site, along with helping your efforts in terms of keyword research and competitor analysis. Try SEMrush Site Audit to get started. Create a sitemap Building a sitemap for your website ensures that you can be found when a topic or search term is inputted into the Google search engine. Sometimes you might want to hide a certain page or blog article from your website if it’s no longer timely, but you can still index this page by adding it to your sitemap. The more URLs you index with Google, the better chance you have of appearing in their search rankings. A clear sitemap allows Google to understand your website and the happier Google is with your site, the higher you show in their rankings. For more information on building a sitemap click here. Keywords throughout website When writing content for your website you want to think about the search terms that a user would use if they were searching for information about a given topic. This does not mean using the keywords in every sentence, as search engines will recognise this spamming technique and you could ultimately be disadvantaged in the search results rankings. Place the keywords within the title and near the top of your content for best results. Using long-tail keywords (3-4 word phrases specific to your offering) can also be very effective in increasing relevance. If you have an idea of a phrase that a user is likely to search for that’s specific to your content, then use this long-tailed keyword to improve your chances of gaining a higher ranking. Start a blog! By adding a blog to your website and ensuring you update it regularly, with relevant information, is a great way of improving SEO and gaining more traffic to your site. Every new blog is essentially another URL that can be added to your sitemap and gives you more content to plug-in keywords. The more content and keywords you can include in your website, the more likely Google will be able to find relevant information on your site to suggest to users in the search results. Pretty simple huh? Just remember, although producing more content is going to, in theory, help with SEO, there is no point in creating content for content’s sake. Ensure you balance the ‘quality vs quantity’ spectrum and adhere to producing blog entries that are likely to benefit your target audience. Inbound link building Utilising social media is a great way to promote that blog content you’ve just created and provide another platform for users to reach your website. You can also gain additional traffic through referrals from external websites that post links back to your site. How? Well, there are plenty of ways to achieve this. Try to build partnerships with relevant publishers who will find your original content relevant and are able to post this content to their own site (with links back to the original source, i.e. your website). Are you sending press releases to relevant industry websites? By having these published on various sites you’ll experience additional inbound traffic from external sources. Ensure you review inbound links from time to time so you know that the sources referring traffic are those you want to be associated with (i.e. completely relevant to your event/site). So there you have it! A very basic introduction to SEO. It’s a subject that can get quite complex and requires a certain level of experience to really capitalise on gaining the most from SEO. But even some very simple steps can be taken immediately that will boost your site traffic and help to bring in some additional ticket sales for your event.

Eddins Jr. 6 September 2016 The evolution of the internet has begun transforming society from a planet of nations and individuals to a global interconnected digital culture. Yesterday’s pilots, engineers and scientists, born in an analog environment, are giving way to a generation raised in a digital world of coders, computer engineers and gamers. The U.S. Air Force depends heavily on the digital generation to keep its technological advantage. Yet the Air Force must compete with private tech companies like Google and SpaceX in order to recruit the nation’s best minds to deal with tomorrow’s problems and provide needed innovation. ROTC students and Air Force advisors from Cornell University shed light on the digital dilemma the military is now facing as recruiting becomes more strategic and cultural in the 21st century.(U.S. Air Force video by Andrew Arthur Breese) During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein admitted the service has been fighting a war with outdated tactics. Not a war in some foreign land, but one within the nation’s own borders. The field of battle is the open market. The objective: convince some of the most innovative minds in the country — those trained in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) — to work for the Air Force. “I absolutely align with Secretary (of Defense Ashton) Carter that we are in a war for talent and one of the initiatives that is under his ‘Force of the Future’ allows us to go directly to a university and hire talent from that university,” Goldfein testified. “What we have done in the past is to tell those that are interested in joining us to go ahead and get on USA Jobs, post all their resumes and maybe we’ll get back to them in six months; (by then) they’re gone. It’s unacceptable in this environment.” CLICK TO VIEW PHOTO GALLERY The order of battle proposed by Carter looks to streamline hiring practices to position the Defense Department as a hotbed for scientific research talent. It also has new tactics that include opening the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) in California’s Silicon Valley, building cooperation between the military and tech companies, and career intermission programs that allow military researchers to get a taste of the research being pursued at private companies. The defense secretary has even invited vetted hackers to test the Pentagon’s cybersecurity. These new tactics are designed to keep control of territory already held: retaining STEM talent currently employed by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). By allowing Air Force researchers more latitude in their research and flexibility in career paths, the hope is that job satisfaction will increase and, therefore, retention. Ryan Helbach, a Hypersonic Research Engineer, holds a flight test model in Hypersonic Combustion Research Cell 22, used to research SCRAM jet technology at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, Jul 21, 2016. Helbach is the program lead for AFRL’s Intellect to Intellect Exchange (i2i Exchange) which pairs AFRL scientists and engineers with innovative private tech companies and created the AFRL Entrepreneurial Program allowing scientists and engineers to take sabbaticals to pursue outside for-profit goals. It’s a tactic that has kept Ryan Helbach, a hypersonic engineer for AFRL at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, studying Supersonic Combustion Ramjet technology for the Air Force. “I was thinking of leaving the Air Force, but after talking with friends and coworkers I realized I have a fantastic opportunity here in the Air Force and the Air Force Research Labs to shape my job,” he said. “I get to do the engineering, but I also get to create programs that have a lot of influence on the careers of other scientists and engineers that work within the research labs.” Create he has. Helbach is involved in two programs designed to increase workplace satisfaction among his peers and build bridges between AFRL and the private sector. “We have set up this program called the Intellect to Intellect (i2i) Exchange where we are working with a number of different (smaller private tech) companies to try to take some of our folks that are working with deep learning or autonomy or robotics and embed them (with those companies),” Helbach said. “We want to work with them and tap into some of those innovative technologies that we are not working on currently or that we are working on, but we could tap into some different ideas.” Helbach and 1st Lt David McLellan, talk in Hypersonic Combustion Research Cell 22, used in research into SCRAM jet technology, at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, Jul 21, 2016. Helbach has also co-created the AFRL Entrepreneurial Program, which allows for scientists and engineers to pursue personal business projects utilizing AFRL technology through one-year sabbaticals. If the technology is successfully commercialized, they can separate from AFRL to pursue the venture with an agreement that they can return within five years. If the project shows no promise, they can return to their old jobs at the end of the sabbatical year. The Air Force is also fighting this battle on another front — the nation’s schools. To create a constant stream of new technological talent flowing toward AFRL, the Air Force must educate students to the scientific opportunities that exist at its research labs before they choose an employer or career path. In this challenge, the Air Force has achieved some pockets of success within the geographical spheres of influence surrounding  bases hosting research labs. In these geographical areas, STEM outreach programs are plentiful and assisted by word of mouth and familial ties to the Air Force. “I come from a family of nerds and we are a family of military nerds… I was genetically predetermined to be a nerd,” said Cassandra Stanfill, a human factors engineer at AFRL who uses eye-tracking technology and other methods to measure the physical response and stress of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance analysts. Cassandra Stanfill, an Associate Research Engineer with the Intelligence, Surveillance Augmentation and Reconnaissance Branch at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, uses eye tracking technology, and other methods, on test subject Lt. Michael Emard to examine the response of ISR analysts to displays, tools and interfaces used in their jobs, Jul 21, 2016. The research strives to relieve user fatigue and stress due to data overload and increase the efficiency of data assessment and transference by analysts. She grew up near Wright-Patterson AFB with a mother who was active-duty Army, and later became a statistician, and a father who was active-duty Air Force and a human factors engineer. Growing up in a military culture and having the inside scoop on AFRL ingrained in her some of the big selling points of doing research for the Air Force. “The research labs have a multitude of things you can study and work on and you get job security here, which is difficult to find right now,” Stanfill said. “There is so much we can do here that can make an impact. When our Airman can do their jobs more effectively, more efficiently, it helps secure the freedoms and the privileges that we enjoy. I work with cool stuff, I make a difference and I have job that I know I am safe in.” Second Lt. Scott Seidenberger was commissioned May 28, 2016, the day he graduated with a degree from the Industrial and Labor Relations School at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Former Cadet and now Second Lt. Scott Seidenberger, of AFROTC Detachment 520 at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, stands in a commons area of Duffield Hall where science, technology, engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) students gather to study and work on team projects, Apr. 16, 2016. Before reporting for air battle management training at Tyndall AFB, Florida, he and his dissertation committee are editing his thesis, titled “Can the Government and Military Compete with Private Sector Companies for Technical Talent?” in hopes of it being published in a leading academic journal of human resource management. His research, which probes how technical job seekers evaluate opportunities in different sectors and with different firms, sheds light on one of the main obstacles to luring STEM talent away from the warm, for-profit glow of Silicon Valley; so much of what the Air Force Research Labs do is classified, producing few commercial products that civilians use in their daily lives. “It’s called the Halo Effect… So we all use products from Google, Apple and Microsoft day to day and a lot of us evaluate those products favorably,” said Seidenberger. “So there is a spillover effect where we are much more likely to subconsciously think ‘Hmmm… Google must be a good employer’… the defense sector struggles with this effect because most young people do not interact with the defense sector on a day-to-day basis; they are not as familiar with the products and the services that we provide. That’s the challenge for us, trying to build an employer brand and an image for ourselves that is able to compete with the private sector.” The Air Force is attempting to promote the selling points at universities and conferences far from the gate of an Air Force base. The Air Force Diversity and Inclusion office, in coordination with Air Force Recruiting Service, AFRL, U.S. Air Force Academy and Air Force Civilian Service, has developed a nationwide recruiting effort at STEM-focused professional conferences that attract a large number of students. Also, programs do exist to reach college undergraduates, such as the AFRL Scholars program, the Minority Leaders Research Collaboration Program and the Pathways Internship Program. However, getting the word out about research opportunities in the Air Force on STEM-heavy campuses, not adjacent to a base, is often limited to an occasional job fair. On that battlefield, the service must fight for attention in a hall surrounded by the glitz of consumer tech company recruiters armed with a well-known brand, workplaces that resemble playgrounds and better pay and benefits. In 2014, AFRL sought to improve its visibility with STEM undergraduates by initiating the University Relations Program to establish formal relationships with the country’s prominent technical universities and visit as many as possible during the year. Members of the AFRL senior executive service and senior scientists assist with maintaining and growing these relationships, according to Kevin Gooder, chief of the program integration division for the assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition.

Kevin O’Brien, faculty advisor, and Nicole Polemeni-Hegarty, and in background John Draikiwicz, Jane Duin, Emma Carpenter and Jacob Glueck, ready their rover design for the University Mars Rover Challenge for testing in a lab at Phillips Hall on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, Apr. 16, 2016. However, any influence the Air Force gains during the rest of the semester is largely dependent on the presence of personnel pursuing advanced degrees and the service’s emphasis on volunteerism within its ranks. The service’s STEM workforce strategy, Bright Horizons, was signed by former CSAF Gen. Mark A. Welsh, who encouraged all Airmen to “embrace the innovation culture, participate in education and training endeavors and continue to be Air Force STEM ambassadors in your communities.” Capt. Kevin W. O’Brien, the operations flight commander for ROTC Detachment 520 at Cornell University, was one of Seidenberger’s instructors. O’Brien not only teaches AFROTC classes at Cornell, but, with Air Force funding, is also pursuing his Ph.D. in morphing wing technology there. His doctoral research allows him to rub shoulders with civilian undergraduate engineering students who are often surprised to see an Air Force officer getting a technical Ph.D. at an Ivy League institution. O’Brien also volunteers in the engineering community on campus by assisting an undergraduate project team building a robotic rover to compete in the University Rover Challenge held each summer at the Mars Desert Research Station near Hanksville, Utah. For the team members, working with their de-facto faculty advisor was their first contact with a military member in the STEM field. Mechanical Engineering student, Michael Bunis, a member of the Cornell University Mars Rover Team, works on a computer-generated model of a rover, which the team will enter the University Mars Rover Challenge, in a lab at Phillips Hall on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, Apr. 16, 2016. “I lived in the eastern New York City suburbs and went to high school in Connecticut,” said team member Nicole Polemeni-Hegarty, a rising junior at Cornell majoring in mechanical engineering, and currently an intern at Lockheed Martin working in a lasers and sensors lab. “I had never seen anything in high school about the possibility of doing scientific research or engineering in the Air Force. Until I met Capt. O’Brien, I had not even gotten a whiff of doing an internship with the military. Now the Air Force and DOD are definitely on my radar.” However, O’Brien thinks the Air Force should be placing scientific ambassadors at centers of technologic education. In 2014, AFRL established the University Relations Program to establish formal relationships with the country’s prominent technical universities and visit as many as possible during the year. Members of the AFRL Senior Executive Service and senior scientists assist with maintaining and growing these relationships. O’Brien said another hindrance to attracting STEM talent to uniformed service is the rigor, regimentation and rigidity of the military, especially the rank structure. “It’s possible that you could be coming out of college and be more competent and qualified than a major and, at that point, you have to wait up to 10 to 12 years until you are able to make the same impact as they are,” O’Brien said. The Air Force is currently exploring options in certain career fields to address these issues for uniformed researchers, according to Gooder. Members of the Cornell University Mars Rover Team test the rover design they will enter in the University Mars Rover Challenge outside of Phillips Hall at Cornell University, Apr. 16, 2016. Even if the Air Force changes its very culture to elevate its appeal on college campuses, it may be too little, too late. AFRL researchers believe that reaching farther back into the educational system to influence younger STEM students is key to establishing a long-term pipeline of a diverse research talent headed for AFRL. While individual STEM outreach programs that send scientists and engineers into local high schools and primary schools have existed at Air Force bases for decades, the service did not begin to coordinate its battle plan until three years ago, with the formation of the STEM Outreach Office at Wright-Patterson AFB to coordinate the programs at 30 bases in the U.S. and overseas. “One of the first things that needed to be done was to get our arms around the activities that were already happening out there,” said Richard Baker, director for Air Force K-12 STEM Outreach. “We get the obstacles out of their way and provide them the resources that they need to help enhance the programs that they are already doing… and to point them all in generally the same direction from a strategic standpoint.” Baker says that getting to kids in middle school is “the sweet spot” for STEM outreach. At this tween-age, students with an overall interest in pursuing science and math start to really consider what they want to be when they grow up. Sending Air Force engineers into local classes to work with teachers on establishing rocketry or solar car projects not only excites the students, but it also makes them aware of national-level partner programs like the Air Force Association’s CyberPatriot to engage computer students, the StellarXplorers to encourage the study of space and the Air Force-sponsored Junior Science and Humanities Symposium. Left to right, Samson Scheie, 12, Brendan Marx, 12 Samuel Snowden, 9, and Joeseph Yoeder, 11, [cq] test out their robot before competing in a First Lego League tournament at DoD’s Starbase building near the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, Jul 22, 2016. The Air Force STEM outreach offices work with the First Lego League, which teaches young students how to build and program robots made of Legos, to not only support STEM education, but also to make young technical minds aware of opportunities to pursue science in the U.S. Air Force. To reach back even farther in the educational process, Baker’s office supports partnerships with outside programs to develop STEM students. Programs like FIRST LEGO League Junior, FIRST LEGO League (FLL) and FIRST Robotics Competition are DOD embraced programs and provided grant monies to build teams of students to participate in local and national tournaments. Tournaments and teams organized and run by Air Force employees promote awareness of the service’s emphasis on science to parents and kids who come to base-hosted tournaments. In FLL, children construct robots made of LEGOs and learn to program those robots to perform certain tasks, like carrying a small object to a specific area, dropping it there and returning to its starting point. Many of the kids go on to FIRST Robotics Competition and FIRST Tech Challenge, using other materials to build more complex robots with more sophisticated programming. Samuel Snowden, 9, who is homeschooled, loves his pets, baseball and reading magazines, has a special place in his world for LEGOs. When he learned about FLL and that he could make those LEGOs move and follow his commands, he was hooked. “I was born with a Lego in my hand… then I realized that when you get into FIRST LEGO League you get to build and program robots,” Snowden said. “I thought it sounded challenging and I like things that are challenging and I also thought I might like to program sometime in my life.” Samuel’s experience at a weeklong FLL program hosted by Wright-Patterson AFB, ended with the teams’ robots going Lego-to-Lego in a tournament complete with cheerleading mentors, a public address announcer, loud music and goofy hats. However, building and programming a winning robot is just the hook for achieving FLL’s ultimate goals: teaching teamwork and understanding that the scientific process is all about learning from failed experiments and finding new ways to solve a problem. Samuel Snowden, 9, left, who is homeschooled and claims to have been born with a Lego in his hand, talks strategy with teammate Samson Scheie, 12, also homeschooled, before running their robot in the First Lego League competition at DoD’s Starbase building near the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, Jul 22, 2016. The Air Force STEM outreach offices work with the First Lego League, which teaches young students how to build and program robots made of Legos, to not only support STEM education, but also to make young technical minds aware of opportunities to pursue science in the U.S. Air Force. “I think FIRST (Lego League) is really cool and even though the robot is really fun, you shouldn’t focus on that,” he said. “You should focus on learning the First Core Values: We have fun. We are a team. We display gracious professionalism in all we do. Our coaches and mentors don’t have all the answers; we learn together as a team.” Samuel did admit that while FLL was great fun, he had previously learned about the Air Force through its most tried and true recruiting tools: family ties and cool planes. “My brother is actually in the Air Force. When I was 4 years old I thought about going into the Air Force,” he said. “I would probably want to fly F-16 (Fighting Falcon), because they are my favorite plane.” If the whole pilot thing doesn’t work out for Samuel, the seed has been planted through STEM outreach and FLL that he can, one day, work for the Air Force, just like his brother, as a scientist or engineer. Maybe he will even design and program systems for an aircraft way cooler than the F-16. Comments are closed.

Roston - Sep 6, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google Drive has made a small but significant change that better enables it to handle duplicate files. When the same file is downloaded and then re-uploaded, rather than changing the name to reflect that it is a duplicate, Drive will list the most recently uploaded file as “version x,” making it easy to see which file you edited last or to find an older version of the file that you may need. The idea here is that many people upload their files to Google Drive, then download them at some point to make changes, then upload the revised file to the cloud again. When that file is uploaded again, it can be difficult to find what you’re looking for based on naming structure, or impossible to find old pre-edit changes if the new file replaces the old one. Google explains that once this feature goes live, whatever files are uploaded with the same name will be “reduplicated, and the old file will be in revision history.” If you upload folders with the same name as existing folders, they’ll be merged together for easier management. If you don’t want this “deduplication” to happen, you can stop it by clicking “Keep as separate file” after the upload is complete. This will keep them as separate duplications rather than different versions of the same file.

The controversy did not end there for the athletes who were allowed to compete with US swimmer Lilly King seen "wagging her finger" at her Russian rival Yuliya Efimova who won an 11th hour appeal against a doping ban to compete.

Although the ride-sharing giant is among the many who believe driverless cars are just around the corner, the head of the university’s robotics lab thinks otherwise. Herman Herman, named the group's new director after it was gutted, believes companies are 'technically' not ready because they still need engineers the in car - and says a true self driving service is 'not even close'. Scroll down for video   Uber poached a third of Carnegie Mellon University’s robotics lab staff in 2015. Although the ride-sharing giant is among the many big players in the industry who believe driverless cars are just around the corner, the head of the university’s robotics lab thinks otherwise. Pictured is a concept drawing of Uber's self-driving cars TRUTH ABOUT DRIVERLESS  Herman Herman was named the new director of Carnegie Mellon University’s robotics lab after Uber took a third of the staff to its own researcher lab in 2015. Herman told Motherboard that Uber may be talking about self-driving cars, but the firm is no where near the reality. ‘With autonomous cars, you see these videos from Google and Uber showing a car driving around, but people have not taken it past 80 percent,’ Herman told Jordan Pearson with Motherboard. ‘It’s one of those problems where it’s easy to get to the first 80 percent, but it’s incredibly difficult to solve the last 20 percent.’ ‘For you or me to buy a car that can drive autonomously from point A to point B—it’s not even close.

Prior to Uber cleaning house, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) was well-known for its work with autonomous research. In February 2015, the two struck a deal to focus on mapping and safety technologies to support Uber’s ride-sharing mission.

The robotics lab's funding was cut in half by the end of 2015, but recently Uber passed along a check for $5.5 million that could either be as a ‘thank you’ or ‘sorry’. ‘For you or me to buy a car that can drive autonomously from point A to point B—it’s not even close,' said Herman. 'There are fundamental problems that need to be solved.’  Prior to Uber cleaning house, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) was well-known for its work with autonomous research UBER TO REPLACE HUMAN DRIVERS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE  Uber says the self-driving Volvo XC90 cars will have human backup drivers to begin with, but the move will surely worry the country's 327,000 Uber drivers who will eventually be replaced by autonomous vehicles. Uber co-founder and chief executive officer Travis Kalanick has said that the company's goal is to replace human drivers with driverless vehicles as 'quickly as possible'. The $300million Volvo deal will provide SUVs to Uber and see vehicles outfitted with cameras, lasers and sensors to help them navigate the city's streets. An unspecified number of autonomous Ford Fusions will also pick up passengers. The Volvo has 22 camera lenses, a laser on the roof and laser sensors at the corners. Its cameras, sensors and laser can see more than 100 meters in all directions. Herman told Pearson that the robotics lab bounced back since the failed partnership and now has 115 scientists working for the department. They had ‘plenty of projects that were minimally affected’, he said,  but the group did have to cancel two projects they were working on. Although Herman and his team were affected by the Uber’s controversial move, the ridesharing firm seems to be moving along with their plans. This year, Uber’s souped up autonomous Ford cars were seen through around the streets of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, CMU’s headquarters. And most recently, the firm announced a partnership with Volvo. In February 2015, the two struck a deal to focus on mapping and safety technologies to support Uber’s ride-sharing mission. However, it only took three months before the California firm left the university in a ‘crisis’ by taking a third of its staffUber says it will also start hauling passengers with self-driving Volvo CX90 cars.

An on-board computer uses data from sensors, including radar, a laser and cameras, to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles. Under the vision unveiled by Google, passengers might set their destination by typing it into a map or using commands. Apple's iCar A concept video reveals ideas for a futuristic-looking Apple car, with a wide dashboard display and smart capabilities. The video from ConceptsiPhone boasts that the 2020 vehicle design is 'more than a car,' with connectivity to other Apple devices. The concept by Luca Wrede shows a build that mirrors the minimalist design common to Apple products. A wraparound dashboard screen shows speed, traffic predictions, and answers calls. The vehicle can pull up Apple Maps, Safari, and Siri, which are indicated all on the interactive dashboard. The concept car can even connect to the Apple Watch.  LEECo's LeSEE China's LeEco has unveiled an electric autonomous vehicle that it says will surpass Tesla's Model S in 'all aspects of performance'. Dubbed LeSEE, the sleek pearly white sedan has memory foam seats, Knight Rider-style voice activation, an automatic driving mode and a steering wheel that folds toward the dash when the car is set to autopilot. This futuristic concept car was engineered to be a 'smart', 'connected' and 'automated self-driving car' and the firm hopes it will set the stage for a fleet of autonomous taxis.  Although Uber's competitor Lyft stated it is dabbling in self-driving taxis, it won't have anything to show for it until next year. The program will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis and 'included customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city' General Motors & Lyft's autonomous Taxis General Motors announced a $500 million investment in Lyft earlier this year as a joint effort to develop a fleet of self-driving taxis. Although the idea seemed like a distant dream, the duo has announced plans for a testing program on public roads by 2017. The program will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis and 'include real customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city'.   In addition to the testing program, Lyft is working on a new app that will be used for the autonomous cars.  The app is still a prototype, but will list the option for an autonomous car and there is a GM OnStar assistant to answer questions or report issues while you're en route to your destination.  Uber says the self-driving Volvo XC90 cars will have human backup drivers to begin with, but the ultimate goal is to replace human drivers with driverless vehicles as 'quickly as possible', said Uber co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick. This will involve Uber adding its own self-developed autonomous driving systems to the Volvo base vehicle. Volvo will use the same base vehicle for the next stage of its own autonomous car strategy, which will involve fully autonomous driving.  ‘Technically, I’m not sure if it’s ready,’ explained Herman. ‘They still have to have engineers in the car. So, for technical reasons, it’s not there.’ ‘But for non-technical reasons, they decided that it’s a good idea to start talking about it.’    Read more: Uber to use autonomous cars to haul people in next few weeks | Daily Mail Online Share or comment on this article e-mail 17 shares Most watched News videos Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Victoria Fritz hides her baby bump moments before giving birth Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes? 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Shocking moment Kumbuka tries to smash glass at London Zoo President-elect Trump and family dine out at famous 21 Club Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Cops shoot man holding 2-year-old girl hostage Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Little girl leaps to her sister's defense during scolding EXCLUSIVE: Blow up!

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Xiaomi poised to enter U.S. market in October with Android TV-powered 4K Mi Box Kris Wouk Digital TrendsSeptember 6, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Following its debut at Google I/O earlier this year, Xiaomi's 4K Mi Box could launch as soon as next month, offering 4K and HDR for less than $100, and marking the company's first official product launch in the U.S.More Earlier this year at Google I/O, Xiaomi unveiled its 4K Mi Box, a streaming box along the lines of a Roku, Apple TV, or — aesthetically — the Amazon Fire TV. No release date was announced at the time, though it was slated to be available this year. Now it seems that the box could launch as soon as next month, for less than $100. While we’ve had a chance to look at Xiaomi products from smartphones to robot vacuums, this would be the first product from the Chinese company to officially launch in the U.S. Even if it doesn’t launch in October, it shouldn’t be too long a wait, as a source inside the company told TechCrunch that the Mi Box would launch early in the fourth quarter of 2016. Related: Xiaomi’s new Mi Robot Vacuum really sucks (in a good way) and costs just $250 As first described at Google I/O, the Mi Box features support for 4K Ultra HD resolution and is powered by the Android TV platform, putting it in the same range of devices as the Nvidia Shield TV or the Asus Nexus Player. The Mi Box also supports HDR, putting it in a smaller class of streamers that includes the new products from Roku slated for release this fall. The Mi Box is powered by a quad-core processor paired with a Mali 450 GPU, and features 2 GB RAM and 8 GB storage. The single HDMI 2.0a port sends 4K video to your TV at 60 frames per second, while Dolby Digital Plus support makes for immersive audio. Like other Android TV boxes and the Fire TV Gaming Edition, a game controller is included. Hugo Barra, a former Google executive and current vice president of international for Xiaomi, recently said that the first Xiaomi smartphones will be coming to the U.S. in the “near future,” but that doesn’t narrow itdown. The Mi Box, on the other hand, is a more innocuous way to enter the market and could be Xiaomi’s way of testing the waters. Related: Xiaomi unveils the Amazfit, a fitness-tracking watch and wearable for $120 Whether or not the Mi Box takes off will likely have a lot to do with price.

Peter Coles is an economist who left Harvard Business School to work at Airbnb in San Francisco. Photo: JASON HENRY, NYT Economists lured to tech companies by big data, big money 1 / 1 Back to Gallery For eight years, Peter Coles had an economist’s dream job at Harvard Business School. His research focused on the design of efficient markets, an important and growing field that has influenced such things as Treasury bill auctions and decisions on who receives organ transplants. He even got to work with Alvin Roth, who won a Nobel in economic science in 2012. But prestige was not enough to keep Coles at Harvard. In 2013, he moved to the Bay Area. He now works at Airbnb, the online lodging marketplace, one of a number of tech companies luring economists with the promise of big sets of data and big salaries. Silicon Valley is turning to the dismal science in its never-ending quest to squeeze more money out of old markets and build new ones. In turn, the economists say they are eager to explore the digital world for fresh insights into timeless economic questions of pricing, incentives and behavior. “It’s an absolute candy store for economists,” Coles said. The pay, of course, is a lot better than you would find in academia, where economists typically earn $125,000 to $150,000 a year. In tech companies, pay for an economist with a doctorate will usually come in at more than $200,000 a year, the companies say. With bonuses and stock grants, compensation can easily double in a few years. Senior economists who manage teams can make even more. Businesses have been hiring economists for years. Usually, they are asked to study macroeconomic trends — topics like recessions and currency exchange rates — and help their employers deal with them. But what the tech economists are doing is different: Instead of thinking about national or global trends, they study the data trails of consumer behavior to help digital companies make smart decisions that strengthen their online marketplaces in areas like advertising, movies, music, travel and lodging. Tech firms including Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, and up-and-comers like Airbnb and Uber, hope that the improved efficiency will translate into more profit. At Netflix, Randall Lewis, an economic research scientist, is finely measuring the effectiveness of advertising. His work also gets at the correlation-or-causation conundrum in economic behavior: What actions occur coincidentally after people see ads, and what actions are most likely caused by the ads? At Airbnb, Coles is researching the marketplace of hosts and guests for insights, both to help build the business and to understand behavior. One study focuses on procrastination — a subject of great interest to behavioral economists — by looking at bookings. Are they last-minute? Made weeks or months in advance? Do booking habits change by age, gender or country of origin? “They are microeconomic experts, heavy on data and computing tools like machine learning and writing algorithms,” said Tom Beers, executive director of the National Association for Business Economics. Understanding how digital markets work is getting a lot of attention now, said Hal Varian , Google’s chief economist. But, he said, “I thought it was fascinating years ago.” Varian, 69, is the godfather of the tech industry’s in-house economists. Once a well-known professor at UC Berkeley, Varian showed up at Google in 2002, part time at first, but soon became an employee. He helped refine the AdWords marketplace, where advertisers bid to have their ads shown on search pages, based on the words users type into Google’s search engine. Google’s insight was to avoid giving the best ad placement to the highest bidder. Varian worked to develop a different model for ad placement, calculating the probability that a user will click on an ad and find the ad relevant. It was a classic example of smart market design. Since then, Varian and his team have applied their economic perspective to Google’s ad markets, the company’s unusual auction for its initial public offering, bidding strategies for wireless spectrum, patent auctions and purchases, and models for new businesses like driverless cars. For the moment, Amazon seems to be the most aggressive recruiter of economists. It even has an Amazon Economists website for soliciting resumes. In a video on the site, Patrick Bajari, the company’s chief economist, says the economics team has contributed to decisions that have had multibillion-dollar impacts for the company. Another Amazon jobs site lists openings for economists. As of Friday, there were 34. Seeing this emerging job market, the National Association for Business Economics held its first meeting for technology company economists in April in San Francisco. Another is set for October in Silicon Valley. Academia is also starting to take notice — and adapt. “It’s all happening so fast, it’s hard to keep up,” said Susan Athey , an expert in the economics of technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who is also a consultant to Microsoft. Many economics students also take computer science courses, and some major in both. But a new course this fall at Yale, called Designing the Digital Economy, seeks to blend economics and computer science in the way digital economists do at tech companies. The instructor is Glen Weyl, an economist at Microsoft Research, and the course will have guest lecturers from Amazon, Pandora and Uber. The course is a pilot project for curriculum change and perhaps a joint degree program focused on digital markets and their design. Dirk Bergemann, chairman of the Yale economics department, explained that economics is concerned with efficiency, prices and incentives, while computer science focused on algorithms and complexity. “In digital marketplaces, you are trying to address both sets of problems,” he said. Weyl predicts that the rise of digital marketplaces in the economy is just getting underway. Uber in ride-hailing and Airbnb in room-renting, he said, may well be just the start of a redefinition of private property, made possible by digital technology. Things, according to Weyl, will increasingly be rented as services instead of owned. That is the long-term vision of driverless cars: When a vehicle just shows up on command, far fewer cars will sit in driveways. Transportation efficiency, resource consumption and industries will all be transformed, he said. The same could be true for household goods, Weyl said. One possible situation: After you use your espresso machine for breakfast, a drone comes to pick it up, and you rent it out for the day. A current market-design challenge for Amazon and Microsoft is their big cloud computing services. These digital services, for example, face a peak-load problem, much as electric utilities do. How do you sell service at times when there is a risk some customers may be bumped off? Run an auction for what customers are willing to pay for interruptible service? Or offer set discounts for different levels of risk? Both Amazon and Microsoft are working on that now. “Economics influences rather than determines decisions,” said Preston McAfee, Microsoft’s chief economist, who previously worked at Google and Yahoo.

Close September 6, 2016 Automakers, pay attention: a new survey suggests that more than half of U.S. consumers would be interested in cars developed by tech giants Google and Apple. The survey was conducted by TECHnalysis Research, which polled 1,000 Americans who (a) currently own a vehicle and (b) plan to purchase another one within the next two years. Among the many questions those folks were asked was whether they'd be interested in buying a car made by Apple, Google, or another technology company. The results were interesting, to say the least: Of those surveyed, 59% said that they would be definitely, seriously, or moderately interested in a car made by Google, while 52% said that they would be definitely, seriously, or moderately interested in cars from Apple. Drilling down, 33% said they were seriously or moderately interested in a car from Google, while 28% expressed serious or moderate interest in an Apple car.  Among early adopters, 12% of respondents said that they would definitely purchase a car from Apple, while 11% said the same of cars made by Google. At the other side of the spectrum, 18% said that they had no interest in cars from Google, while a significantly higher 24% turned up their noses at Apple cars. CHECK OUT: How do you respond when your car is recalled? There's no consensus, it turns out Translation: a majority of U.S. consumers would be willing to consider buying a car made by Google or Apple. (Results for other, unnamed tech firms weren't so high.)  Also, today's consumers are more interested in Google cars than those made by Apple, except for hardcore early adopters. Among that group, Apple has a slight edge--which isn't surprising, given its legions of rabid fans. Implications What does this mean for car companies? At the very least, they ought to sit up and take notice.  Google and Apple don't produce cars--at least not yet. Apple hasn't even acknowledged that it's developing a car, which is possibly the worst-kept secret in tech. As for Google, one bigwig went so far as to say that the company wasn't planning to build its own vehicles, though a few months later, rumors emerged that Google and Ford were creating a new car company. Complicating matters is the fact that Google and presumably Apple are both working on autonomous cars, which make consumers a little wary. If that's all the two firms produce, they'll be selling to a smaller market, at least for the time being, and at least here in the U.S. (In China, though, the sky's the limit.)  However, when it comes to technology, consumers place far more faith in Silicon Valley than in car companies. We've seen that in the infotainment field, where automaker's efforts have yielded lots of frustration (and lawsuits). And a recent study about attitudes toward autonomous cars revealed that consumers want tech firms to develop driving systems, not car companies themselves. That could give Google and Apple a slight edge on the sales floor. Bottom line: automakers can breathe easy for now, but tomorrow could be another story. How would you feel about cars from Google and Apple? Would you prefer one brand over the other? And who should develop autonomous tech anyway? Sound off in the comments below.

Specifically, Chrome for Mac now uses 33% last power when viewing images, scrolling the page, and watching video. Google is using various power measurement tools to improve battery life across the board. With the recent Material refresh, Chrome is now “rendered fully programmatically” allowing for better and more efficient rendering. An HD video test on Windows 10 shows Chrome 53 — released last week — delivering 2 hours and 12 minutes of longer playback when compared to Chrome 46 from last October. These improvements can be especially seen on popular sites like YouTube, Vimeo, and Facebook. In terms of browser speediness, desktop and Android Chrome is now 15% faster than it was a year ago when measured with tools like Speedometer. Google is also improving speed by adding new features to quicken daily tasks like online shopping. Gradually rolling out to all platforms, the PaymentRequest web standard stores credit card and shipping info for a faster and more convenient checkout process. One of the biggest performance improvements coming later this year sees Chrome killing Flash by defaulting to HTML5 on most sites. The hope is that it will drive most websites to drop various Flash components for the less resource intensive HTML5.

The companies currently are embroiled in a dispute over access to utility poles in Nashville, Tennessee, where Google claims that its competitors have been dragging their feet in making poles ready for Google's wires, even though the work has been approved. Incumbent carriers have fought to block access to new entrants like Google Fiber, and local governments have tried to find solutions -- like the One Touch Make Ready effort to get companies to share utility crews that would give broadband competitors equal access to attach their network equipment to telephone poles at the same time. The Nashville Metro Council is scheduled to vote on the proposed ordinance on Tuesday. Talks recently broke down in Nashville after officials sat down with Google, Comcast, AT&T and others. AT&T has blamed Google for threatening to pack up and leave if it didn't get its own way in terms of local pole access. "Unfortunately Google entered the meeting with no intent of negotiating," AT&T spokesperson Brett Levecchio told the E-Commerce Times. "We offered several solutions that would have addressed Google's concerns without government intervention, but Google refused to compromise." AT&T, which offers fiber in 2.2 million locations within 29 metro areas in the U.S., plans to reach more than 14 million residential and commercial customers with fiber, Levecchio said. Deep Cuts While the wrangling wears on, Alphabet apparently has taken a hard look at Google Fiber's bottom line. "If Google Fiber is not going to be building fiber networks in the next year or so, there are a lot of expensive people that the company will have to carry," broadband analyst Craig Settles told the E-Commerce Times. Alphabet CEO Larry Page recently ordered Google Fiber to slash up to half of its workforce, in a bid to balance out the company's flagging subscriber figures, The Information reported. The news came just weeks after the company indicated it would shift to a wireless growth strategy to take advantage of its new Webpass broadband business. Well short of its internal goals of 5 million subscribers, Google Fiber reportedly could see its workforce slashed in half to about 500 people nationwide, as it works to retool as a wireless broadband company. Alphabet acquired wireless broadband provider Webpass earlier this year. The layoff reports raise questions about how forthcoming Alphabet has been concerning the roadblocks it has encountered in its quest to grow the Google Fiber business. "This is confusing, because we thought Google Fiber was doing so well," said telecom analyst Jeff Kagan. "Apparently not. They recently announced they were moving from the wireline to the wireless business," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Now this." Behind the Curtain Google Fiber stormed out of the gate, bringing the promise of significant competition to underserved cities with ultra-high-speed Internet service at speeds of up to 1,000 Mbps. Google Fiber is much faster than traditional cable broadband. Google Fiber currently operates in seven U.S. cities, including Kansas City, Missouri, where the company has its headquarters; Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Salt Lake City and Provo, Utah; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Nashville. The company has announced plans to expand into numerous other cities -- including Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; Huntsville, Alabama; Dallas; and others. Alphabet's Wireless Experiments Meanwhile, Alphabet has been working on providing wireless high-speed Internet access to the home, company chairman Eric Schmidt said at the company's annual shareholders' meeting this spring. Better computer chips and more accurate wireless signal targeting have made point-to-point wireless Internet connections cheaper than laying cables, he indicated. The technology apparently is capable of delivering Internet connections at 1 Gbps -- equal to Google Fiber's speed. Google Fiber has been working on connecting wireless towers to existing fiber lines. "One of our early forays in testing wireless technology is a 3.5 GHz trial in Kansas City," Google spokesperson Kelly Mason told the E-Commerce Times this spring. Google consultant Robert Iystad earlier this year presented the Kansas City Council with a plan to run tests on wireless Internet access in the city. The company sought to put antennae on city light poles and other structures in eight areas for a two-year test, providing the infrastructure at a discount. It was granted access to the light poles. The Tech Stuff There are three Google technologies involved, according to Sue Rudd, a research director at Strategy Analytics. One is Google Fiber. Another is millimeter wave point-to-point access to fiber, and the third is small local cell sites for use on premises. "Millimeter wave spectrum is relatively unused. Even at 1 bit per Hz, you can get high speeds at high frequencies," Rudd told the E-Commerce Times. "Millimeter bandwidth comes in chunks greater than 5 GHz, such as 20 GHz, and high frequencies are infinitely reusable because they don't go so far." Google's goal is to utilize underused high-frequency millimeter wave spectra to create a global access network linking point to point to the nearest fiber, she explained. Distance is not an issue. Playing With Millimeter Wave Technology Experiments with using millimeter wave technology for WiFi networks date back at least a couple of years. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2014 was converting old drones into millimeter wave WiFi hotspots. Also in 2014, Google began testing a WiFi network that employed millimeter wave and other WiFi technologies. Google has been testing solar-powered drones to deliver 5G Internet using millimeter wave technology, in its secretive Project Skybender, at Spaceport America. Starry early this year announced it was working on a millimeter wave WiFi network to be rolled out in beta in Boston this summer. Rollout dates for 14 other U.S. cities that are part of a 24-month pilot program -- including San Francisco, New York and Washington, D.C. -- have yet to be announced. Facebook this spring announced new terrestrial connectivity systems that leverage millimeter wave WiFi, and said it planned to test the system in San Jose this year. "We think it's great that others are exploring new and innovative ways to bring connectivity to more people," Starry spokesperson Virginia Abrams told the E-Commerce Times this spring. "Our beta will launch as planned late this summer in the Boston area." Why the Rush to High-Bandwidth WiFi? "Eric Schmidt's ... comments are just describing a way to solve the classic last-mile problem for fiber termination," Strategy Analytics' Rudd noted in an earlier interview. "This is a very well-known problem that now has multiple wireless point-to-point and even multi-point options many operators and enterprise vendors are looking at." Possible vendors include premises, cell termination and even campus DAS interconnect players, such as Blinq, Bridgewave, Cambium Networks, Ericsson and NEC, she said. "The federal government is giving out grants to companies to provide WiFi service in rural areas," observed Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research, in an earlier interview. "Some local providers are also encouraging this in areas where they aren't providing service." The allure of WiFi Internet is increasing, because "some cities are getting fed up with companies tearing up their streets to lay cable," McGregor told the E-Commerce Times. The result is, "it's the wild, wild west out there, and everyone's trying to get into providing WiFi service," he said. "I'm looking into it myself."

Back in June, Microsoft conducted a series of tests showing that Chrome is the most battery intensive browser on Windows 10. A similar test run by Google shows Chrome 53 — released last week — delivering 2 hours and 12 minutes of longer HD video playback when compared to Chrome 46 from last October. These improvements can be especially seen on popular sites like YouTube, Vimeo, and Facebook. Google also notes general improvements when viewing images and page scrolling, with Chrome for Mac using 33% less power. The team is using various power measurement tools to improve battery life across the board. With the recent Material refresh, Chrome is now “rendered fully programmatically” allowing for better and more efficient rendering. In terms of browser speediness, desktop and Android Chrome is now 15% faster than it was a year ago when measured with tools like Speedometer. Google is also improving speed by adding new features to quicken daily tasks like online shopping. Gradually rolling out to all platforms, the PaymentRequest web standard stores credit card and shipping info for a faster and more convenient checkout process. One of the biggest performance improvements coming later this year sees Chrome killing Flash by defaulting to HTML5 on most sites. The hope is that it will drive most websites to drop various Flash components for the less resource intensive HTML5.

In effect nearly a third of mankind has a pocket computer, and we are so accustomed to these convenient gadgets that we easily forget the bargain they force on us, on which the entire digital economy is based: Silicon Valley companies give us apps in exchange for our personal data. These companies brazenly collect location, online activity, contacts and other information (1), which they analyse and sell to advertisers, who are delighted to be able to ‘deliver the right messages to the right people in the places and moments that perform best’, as a Facebook ad platform proudly proclaims. Though controversy over surveillance has been growing since Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations, the collection of data for commercial purposes is not generally seen as a political issue, relating to communal choice, and therefore a matter for collective debate. It arouses little concern outside specialist organisations, perhaps because few know about it. There’s a saying from the 1970s: ‘If you’re not paying for the product, you are the product.’ In that decade US economist Dallas Smythe realised that anyone slumped in front of a screen is working unknowingly. Television, he said, creates a product — the audience, the attention of viewers — which TV channels sell to advertisers: ‘You audience members contribute your unpaid work time and in exchange you receive the programme material and the explicit advertisements’ (2). The unpaid work of Internet users is more active. On social networks, we convert our friendships, emotions, desires and anger into data exploitable by algorithms. Every item of information on our profile, every like, tweet, search or click adds to the usable information held by Amazon, Google and Facebook on servers around the world. The unpaid work of converting the world into data is termed ‘digital labor’. Silicon Valley prospers from this original online sin. In 1867 Marx wrote in Capital: ‘What does the primitive accumulation of capital, ie, its historical genesis, resolve itself into? ... the expropriation of the immediate producers.’ Capital used ‘conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder ... force’, to enclose common land, put starving peasants to work for a wage, and colonise the South. Today it also uses ‘lolcat’ videos. Economic historians may credit the casually dressed bosses of Silicon Valley with the creation of a world-group of cheerfully dispossessed labourers, willing co-producers of the services they consume. Google’s $75bn revenues in 2015, mostly from advertising, indicate the scale of shameless accumulation through dispossession. When Facebook published its 2016 second quarter earnings, Re/Code amusedly reported that the social network, with its 1.71bn monthly active users, was ‘making more money on each person [than ever before], $3.82 per user’ (3). Stolen not given Data (from the Latin for given) is the least appropriate name for something that is in fact stolen. The involuntary work done by Internet users may be the subject of brilliant studies by academics (4), but the political and trade union left have not yet incorporated this concept into their analysis, still less their demands. Yet material and immaterial exploitation are closely intertwined. Digital labor is a link in the chain that shackles the miners of Kivu, forced to extract the coltan used in making smartphones, the workers at Foxconn in China who assemble them, and the Uber taxi drivers, Deliveroo couriers and Amazon warehouse workers whose work is ruled by algorithms (5). Who produces data? Who controls it? How is the wealth derived from it shared out? What other economic models could there be? Making these questions political issues is all the more urgent because the proliferation of web-connected objects (Internet of things) and the installation of sensors on industrial production and logistics lines increases the flow of information every day. Ford’s CEO Mark Field boasted in 2015 that ‘today’s cars produce a massive amount of data — upwards of 25GB of information per hour’ (about two seasons of Game of Thrones). From journeys made to driving parameters, musical preferences and weather forecasts, everything is transmitted to the carmaker’s servers. Consultants already suggest drivers might negotiate a discount (6). Some highly organised groups, conscious of the need to protect their interests, have made combating this theft of data a political priority. These include big farmers in the US. Agricultural machines fitted with data capture devices have been harvesting information that makes it possible to finetune sowing, soil treatment and watering to the nearest metre. In 2014 seed and chemical company Monsanto and tractor maker John Deere both suggested to farmers in the Midwest that they should transmit parameters directly to the companies’ servers for processing. Mary Kay Thatcher, the American Farm Bureau’s senior director for congressional relations, is wary. In the educational video Who owns my data?, she says: ‘Farmers need to know who controls their data, who can access it, whether the aggregated or individual data can be shared or sold.’ She is concerned that data captured by multinationals will fall into the hands of speculators who will use it to manipulate the market. ‘They only have to know the information about what is actually happening with harvests minutes before somebody else knows it’ (7). Organisation has paid off: in March, agricultural technology providers and farmers’ representatives agreed ‘privacy and security principles for farm data’. In July the Agricultural Data Coalition set up a server farm for joint information storage. We will all be (micro) shopkeepers Ideas like these have not yet occurred to EU leaders. In October 2015 complaints filed by an Austrian student against Facebook for violation of privacy led to the invalidation of the 20-year-old Safe Harbour agreement, which had permitted the transfer of data to US enterprises. The EU could have forced the web giants to store Europeans’ personal data in Europe, but instead this year signed a new framework agreement for automatic transfers, with the Orwellian name Privacy Shield, in exchange for a pledge from the US Director of National Intelligence that there would be no ‘indiscriminate mass surveillance’. Now you only have to switch on your mobile phone to be involved, unknowingly, in an import-export business. Though the struggle against the TTIP agreement has attracted millions of supporters, the reaffirmation of electronic free trade has elicited no particular reaction. The mobilisation in these areas, and its scale, will result in three possible futures for digital labor. In the first, users broker their own data. Computer scientist Jaron Lanier proposes that if ‘something a person says or does contributes even minutely to a database ... then a nanopayment, proportional both to the degree of contribution and the resultant value, will be due to the person. These nanopayments will add up, and lead to a new social contract’ (8). We will all be (micro) shopkeepers. In the second, the state takes back control. With the intensification of austerity since the beginning of the decade, popular anger has grown over tax evasion by high-tech companies. Alongside the European Commission’s antitrust investigation of Google, and fraud investigations by national authorities, the idea has emerged in France of taxing high-tech enterprises on the value generated by personal data. In their report on tax in the digital sector, senior French civil servants Nicolas Colin and Pierre Collin urge that France should ‘recover the power to tax profits derived from “unpaid work” by Internet users located within French territory’ (9). Sociologist Antonio Casilli proposes that such a tax should fund an unconditional basic income (10), as an instrument of emancipation and to provide some compensation for digital labor. This is one way of turning personal data into a progressive political issue. So there may be a third way, based not on commodification but on socialisation. In transport, health and energy, personal data has until now been used only to implement austerity by cutting costs. It could just as well help to improve urban traffic flow, the healthcare system, energy resource allocation, or education. Rather than being transferred, by default, to the US, it could be compulsorily transferred to an international data agency under the supervision of Unesco (United Nations Organisation for Education, Science and Culture). Rights of access and use could be differentiated: automatic for the individual concerned; free, but anonymised, for local government, research or public statistics organisations; possible for organisers of non-commercial public interest projects. For private entities, access would be conditional and fees charged: priority would be given to the common good, rather than commerce. A related proposal was set out in France in 2015, with a view to reclaiming sovereignty. An international agency would have the advantage of bringing together, under strict standards, countries sensitive to privacy issues that wish to challenge US hegemony. The popularisation of shared ownership and use of data is hampered by a technical inferiority complex which combines perceptions that ‘it’s too complicated’ and that ‘there’s nothing we can do about it’. But, despite its complexity and jargon, the digital domain is not distinct from the rest of society, nor can it be separated from politics. The critic Evgeny Morozov writes: ‘While many of the creators of the Internet bemoan how low their creature has fallen, their anger is misdirected. The fault is not with that amorphous entity but, first of all, with the absence of robust technology policy on the left — a policy that can counter the pro-innovation, pro-disruption, pro-privatisation agenda of Silicon Valley’ (11). The question is not whether there will be a confrontation over control of digital resources, but whether progressive forces will take part in it. Pressure for thepopular reappropriation of online communications, the emancipation of digital labor, and shared ownership and use of data is a logical extension of a 200-year struggle. They counter the fatalistic belief in a future dominated by the surveillance state and the predatory market. Pierre Rimbert Pierre Rimbert is a member of Le Monde diplomatique’s editorial team.

Some San Francisco-area users of Google's Waze app can now use it to share rides to and from work. It's the latest hint that Waze might be part of Google's plan to muscle into ride-hailing giant Uber's turf. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Sep 6, 2016 at 4:04PM Google's self-driving car has been getting attention for years. Google may be gearing up to use the technology to challenge ride-hailing giant Uber. Image source: Alphabet. Is Google gearing up for a clash with ride-haling giant Uber? It might be, according to a Wall Street Journal report this past week. The Journal reported that Google has begun rolling out a service that offers an alternative to Uber's ride-hailing -- without the need for dedicated professional drivers.  A pilot test using Waze to connect riders with drivers Google, a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), has been running a pilot program since May that allows some users of its Waze route-planning app to connect with fellow commuters to share rides. Right now, the pilot program is limited to employees at a few companies in Silicon Valley, but Google plans to open the program to all San Francisco-area users of the Waze app this fall, according to the report.  While riders are paying fares, and drivers are being paid, the structure of the pilot program seems intended to discourage people from operating as full-time drivers, as they would with Uber or rival Lyft. The idea is that Waze will connect riders with drivers who are already headed in the same direction, making it simple for the driver to take them along. Riders are limited to two rides a day -- to work and back, ideally.  Google's Waze app is the key to its move into ride-sharing. Image source: Alphabet. Under the pilot program, riders pay no more than $0.54 cents a mile. It's probably no coincidence that that's the Internal Revenue Service's current standard mileage allowance rate. The idea seems to be to give drivers a small cash incentive to pick up passengers, without asking them to go far out of their way to do so.  What does this program tell us about Google's likely plans? And what does it mean for Uber?   This test won't hurt Uber, but it hints at more At least at the moment, Waze-enabled ride-sharing doesn't seem likely to put a big dent in Uber, even if it's rolled out to all Waze users across the country. Waze (and this new service) are structured around commuting, rather than the taxi-like short urban hops that are Uber's bread and butter.  But it's another signal that Google is feeling its way into the business of personal mobility. Google has been working for years on a self-driving system for cars, but more recently seemed to have ruled out the idea of manufacturing cars itself. That left the obvious question -- how would Google monetize its investment in self-driving technology? -- with a somewhat obvious answer: By horning in on Uber's turf, somehow. This seems likely to be a move in that direction. Adding to the intrigue: Google Ventures was an early investor in Uber, but its board representative, Alphabet executive David Drummond, recently resigned from Uber's board.  Will Google decide to build an automated service to rival Uber? If automated ride-hailing services take off as some analysts predict, Google seems well positioned to end up as a dominant player -- if it decides to make the commitment to become one.  That would put it in direct competition with Uber, a possibility that Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has seen coming for a while. He told Bloomberg last month that worries about Google emerging as a competitor (rather than an ally) were what drove his decision to invest in a separate self-driving research program.  Who will prevail if the two end up battling? On the one hand, Google has Alphabet's massive corporate scale and resources, though it's not clear that Alphabet will be willing to spend on the scale that would be needed to buy (or build) and equip thousands of self-driving cars.  On the other hand, Uber has a big head start on addressing the extremely complicated software problem of routing its cars most efficiently. That's perhaps its most valuable advantage. Will it be enough to hold off the Great Googly One? We'll know more once we see how Google's latest moves with Waze pan out.

SHARES Jenny Blake, co-founder of Google's career development and mentorship program, knows a thing or two about what makes an outstanding employee. Before starting her own coaching firm, Blake helped over 1,000 people improve their careers, all while learning what traits set people up for success. In her new book "Pivot," Blake shares some of her best advice. We asked Blake which interview questions employers should ask to attract highly motivated people. Here's what she said: 1. Tell me about a time where you solved a particularly interesting problem. This question gets at problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, Blake said, which are increasingly important in today's business world. 2. What are you most excited about learning? Blake said this is a good alternative to the popular five-year question. "I don't like the question, 'Where do you see yourself in five years?'" she said. "Because things are changing too quickly, it is totally irrelevant." Instead, she recommends that employers get a sense of what a person is eager to work on and which skills they want to develop. 3. What skills or talents seem totally unrelated to your career but that you enjoy pursuing on the side? This question is another good way to figure out what people are truly passionate about. "I think this one is really interesting," she said. "I've talked with people at Google who raised chickens on the side." 4. What kind of impact are you most excited to make? People want to feel that their work is making an impact, according to Blake. "High net growth individuals want to feel challenged, collaborative and like they are able to make a positive impact within their organizations and outside of them," she writes in "Pivot." 5. When was a time things didn't go as planned, and how did you handle it? "I do think it's good to try to frame something up around how someone handles uncertainty or even mistakes," Blake said. Missteps are inevitable, so hiring people who bounce back is critical. show chapters <p>Marcus Lemonis: Job-hopping is okay if you have a plan</p> <p>Serial entrepreneur and host of CNBC&#039;s &#039;The Profit,&#039; Marcus Lemonis, offers 20-somethings some advice on how to move around in their career, without looking lost.</p> Marcus Lemonis: Job-hopping is okay if you have a plan    Thursday, 8 Sep 2016 | 8:50 AM ET | 01:41 Marguerite WardReporter, CNBC Make It SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

This does nothing more than update the security patch within your devices, but it’s good to see Google on the ball again with these updates. Unfortunately, we’ll have to wait to see how long it takes for the likes of Motorola, Samsung, and HTC to roll these updates out to users. But at least the wheels are in motion to keep our devices secure. Android Nougat Builds:  Pixel C – NRD90R Nexus 5X – NRD90S Nexus 9 – NRD90R Nexus Player – NRD90R Android Marshmallow Builds: Nexus 6P – MTC20L Nexus 5X – MTC20K Nexus 5 – MOB31E Nexus 6 – MMB30W/MOB31E Nexus 9 LTE – MOB31E Unfortunately, it seems that Google has yet to publish the Android 7.0 Nougat security update download for the Nexus 6P, so we’ll have to keep an eye out for that. The images are available starting today, and you can either download them yourself via the links above or wait for the OTA to arrive on your devices. If you want to get your supported device up to date, head to the Google Developers page to download the appropriate Factory Image. Remember to follow the flashing instructions to the “T” to avoid any risks or boot loops while trying to update your device before Google starts seeding. As for some of the changes that have taken place under the hood involve one of the biggest vulnerabilities that Android has ever seen. Stagefright was first discovered last year and essentially allowed someone with bad intentions to take over your device and get all kinds of personal information without you knowing what was going on. This prompted Google to start its Android Security Bulletin process and release monthly security updates for Nexus devices, with the intention of various manufacturer’s following suit. Now it seems that Android 7.0 Nougat  may be out of the woods for now as Google has reportedly rebuilt a core part of Android to cleanse itself of any future Stagefright nonsense. In a report from The Verge, Google actually took the media playback system (where Stagefright affected devices) and rebuilt it from the ground up. The company did this with the intention to protect against the vulnerability and make sure that any device released with Android Nougat would be safe. The problem with this is that not every phone on the market today will even receive Android Nougat. There are even a couple of Nexus devices that will be provided with monthly security updates for another year, but will still be open to manipulation if Stagefright makes a big comeback. This leads us to the age-old problem of fragmentation and what Google can actually do to combat this issue with Android devices being released out of the woodworks every day. Some devices that are released today, won’t see the update to Android Nougat, and if they do, it may take months and may lead up to the release of Android 8.0 when that is released next year. Let’s hope something can be done for these older devices whether from Google or the OEM, and let’s hope that they aren’t just left in the dust.

Samsung is recalling all of its new Galaxy Note7 smartphones following at least 35 incidents of battery explosions or fires. The phones, which went on sale Aug. 19 in the United States, are the company's premier flagship handsets, incorporating a 5.7-inch quad HD dual-edge Super AMOLED touch-screen display and a pen stylus that lets users add drawings and handwritten text to images, documents and more. In a Sept. 2 statement, the consumer electronics company announced a global recall of all of its Galaxy Note7 large smartphones that have been sold so far and that are in distribution channels. In September 2011, news first broke that the kernel.org site that hosts the core development infrastructure behind the Linux kernel was breached. For the last five years, few facts about the attack have been revealed and the attacker remained at large—that is, until he was picked up during a traffic stop in Miami on Aug. 28. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California issued a release on Sept. 1 announcing the arrest of 27-year-old Donald Ryan Austin in connection with the kernel.org attack. Austin is being charged in a four-count indictment in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Austin appeared in a federal court in Miami on Aug. 29 and was released on $50,000 bail on Sept. 1. He is scheduled to be back in court on Sept. 21. Google's Waze Carpool rideshare service for office workers, which launched in limited mode in the San Francisco Bay area last week, actually marks the second major test of the concept for the company in the past year. Last July, Google quietly began pilot tests of an identical service in Israel called RideWith for linking people looking for rides to work with drivers headed to the same destination. Pilot versions of the service were launched in Tel Aviv, Herzliya and Ra'anana. Initial plans had also called for RideWith to be available to students and faculty at Tel Aviv University. Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper that first reported on the pilot, described RideWith as being developed by Waze, the Israel-based maker of navigation applications acquired by Google in 2013 for about $1 billion. Ericsson and Nokia are getting new products ready for next year that officials with both companies say will push telecommunications companies closer to creating 5G wireless networks. In fact, Ericsson executives said last week that the addition of a 5G NR radio for massive MIMO support combined with other 5G technologies the company has released will give Ericsson all the components needed for carriers to build 5G networks in 2017. That would put it three years ahead of the expected completion date of international standards for the wireless technology. The company also is rolling out technologies designed to enhance the performance and efficiency of current networks, with concepts that officials said will become 5G.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Some immediately — and solely — link it to its iconic search box put front and center on google.com, while others who are more aware know about the ocean of products and services the Mountain View firm is deeply involved in. One thing that doesn’t often come to the average person’s mind, though, is hardware. Come the next few months, however, that may all but change… Rumor has it that October 4 is going to be a huge day for the search giant; it should mark the date Google is to unveil the portfolio of devices it is rumored to be working on, and boy is it a hefty one. For all we know, Google could be prepping up to nine new devices. That’s a lot of gear. And what’s more is that it looks like the majority (if not the entirety) of them will at least be branded — if not outright built — by Google itself, with very little external intervention. After all, formally organizing a new hardware team under the leadership of Rick Osterloh had to mean that they were going to do something serious hardware-wise; and about time too, I’d say. Project Ara may have been axed, but there really is no shortage of new stuff. And while not all of it may be announced on October 4, we could still see all of these products on stores’ shelves come the holiday season. So what exactly are we talking about here? Let me recap for you: “Pixel” and “Pixel XL” First we have two new smartphones, the so called “Pixel” and “Pixel XL”, replacing the Nexus 5X and 6P. Manufactured by HTC, the two handsets are however said to be branded as the first truly “Google phones”, which would partially explain why Google is looking to ditch the historically partnership-based “Nexus” nomenclature. In an effort to further streamline the offering, both Pixel phones should look almost identical, save for size and a few specs (a la iPhone/iPhone Plus). (See more renders) Speaking of, we’re talking either a 5″ or 5.5″ AMOLED display (FHD and QHD respectively), a quad-core, 64-bit CPU (perhaps the Snapdragon 821), 4GB of RAM, a 2770 or 3450mAh battery (Pixel and Pixel XL), 12/8MP cameras (with Sony’s IMX378 sensor, aka the 5X/6P’s sensor but with OIS), 32GB of storage as a base option, and then your usual batch of Bluetooth, a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, NFC, etc. Unfortunately, it seems like front-facing stereo speakers will be no more, but considering that HTC is the manufacturer, something akin to the HTC 10‘s system shouldn’t be unexpected. Hopefully Pixel will also mean a cool light bar, but we’ll see about that. We are confident that these are set to be unveiled next month, so start saving. Huawei-made Tablet There’s also a 7″ tablet built by Huawei, with 4GB of RAM. It’s been almost a year from the Pixel C’s launch, so we might expect this to come as a replacement, but my bet is that it will be a complimentary device. The 7-inch Nexus 7s have been pretty popular in the past, so despite the general lack of interest (or indeed market potential) for Android tablets, this could be somewhat of a success. It just remains to be seen how Google is going to market this (it could be a Huawei-made, 3rd gen Nexus 7, but that would be weird, so our bet, if it exists, is that this too will be some sort of Pixel device) and what purpose it will serve. 7-inch tablets make for great media consumption devices, but 2016 phones (and 2017’s for that matter) are already plenty big to accommodate that need, so we’ll see whether that 4GB of RAM will be accompanied by a suite of specs that can make this a more capable device. It’s not clear if this will be part of October’s event, but it is nonetheless rumored to be available within the end of the year. New Android Wear watches Also on deck are two Android Wear smartwatches, again Google-branded. This time around, however, no third party OEM should be involved, with Google doubling down on its hardware efforts. Their main purpose will be to drive interest towards Android Wear up, as the tech behemoth is reportedly slightly unhappy with the platform’s first two years. With the introduction of the Apple Watch and a Samsung increasingly more focused on refining and broadening the compatibility of its Tizen platform, it’s no wonder why Google would want to make such a move, and a pair of self-made smartwatches (of unclear branding) could represent exactly what they need. (Image via Android Police) They would also be a conduit to fully exploit Android Wear 2.0’s potential, and made infinitely more interesting with the arrival of Google’s assistant. The so-codenamed “Angelfish” and “Swordfish” will allegedly be round and cover most people’s needs, with Angelfish being the “full on” device (LTE, GPS, heart-rate sensor, etc.) and Swordfish representing the cheaper, smaller, slightly more customizable option (with support for MODE watch bands). They would make for a sweet pair with the Pixel phones, so hopefully that’ll be the case. Google Home The company’s attempt at making a name for itself among the more traditional OEMs is not just a catch-up game in the more widely used consumer electronics realm, but also one that seeks to stay ahead of the game. Sure, Amazon‘s Alexa — the device it is explicitly going after — has been here for some time now, but while being supported by a slew of third parties, it does not come even remotely close to the level of ecosystem integration Google is aiming for. Google Home will again be a Google assistant-powered device, and one that integrates with all of the company’s apps and services you already have, use, and love. It’s a big bet as much as it is a first step, so we’ll have to see how it goes. Apple‘s presence is indeed looming (as is Microsoft‘s), so it’ll be interesting to see how things pan out. Home is already official, but its attendance at next month’s occurrence will clarify price and availability. A 4K Chromecast There’s not much that needs to be said about this device, which is said to come under the name of either “Chromecast Plus” or “Chromecast Ultra”. Considering that 4K TVs are quickly becoming more and more broadly available (and at increasingly cheaper prices), it only makes sense for Google to step up the game and take advantage of it; hopefully keeping the price low and the device easy to use, colorful and Googley as ever. A VR headset Remember what I just said about Google being ahead of the game? With this device — of which one possible name is “Daydream View” — the company is likely aiming to go even one step further, granting it a solid lead in what seems to be an increasingly bigger trend that could radically change things such as gaming and media consumption, among others. Google put much emphasis on Daydream, its dedicated mobile VR platform baked right into Android Nougat, and its scope is to make VR universally accessible (once capable phones are cheap enough) and useful (with no restricting cables and other gear you need to tether to, like on the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift), so this will likely be a big point of focus during next month’s event. Watch out. The Chromebook Pixel 3 Now, this one’s actually a bit of a fantasy, but considering Google’s rather sudden and mysterious discontinuing of the Pixel 2 last week, it could be that the firm has a new model ready to unveil up its sleeve. There’s no strong argument to support this — nor any rumor — but considering that Chrome OS has just started supporting Android apps (meaning that machines running it have become infinitely more capable all at once) it would be stupid for them not to have a flagship product to best showcase this. Sure, there’s plenty of other Chromebooks out there, but if there’s anything that can be made of this post is that Google’s hardware team is working aggressively, and it’d be a shame (other than a bit weird), among all these new Pixel devices, not to have a new iteration of the one that started it all. Hopefully Google agrees. That all assumes that Chrome OS isn’t dying. Software and hardware integration is something I have long called for at Google, and I honestly can’t wait to see what they are up to. So far, its only two entries have suffered an either abnormally high price (the two Chromebook Pixels) or an underlying half-baked, “last-minute” software (the Pixel C), so it’s been hard to truly judge what a 100% Google experience is like. Hopefully these new products will give us a better sense of how Google is envisioning the future, and indeed show what they’re capable of. Get ready.

Downing Street has said that David Davis was expressing his opinion rather than government policy when he said it would be unlikely for Britain to stay in the single market after Brexit negotiations. Stephen Gethins, the SNP’s Europe spokesman, said this showed the government’s Brexit policy was “descending into farce”. He said: It is ridiculous that after a full two months waiting to get even the barest bones of what their Brexit plans are, ministers are still ‘just expressing opinions’. If the Brexit secretary doesn’t know what government policy on Brexit is then who does ? It is ludicrous. There is clearly utter confusion at the heart of the UK government and on a matter so desperately important – with businesses and people across the UK as a whole looking for some degree of clarity – that is deeply worrying. Keith Vaz has stood down as chair of the home affairs select committee following three days of allegations involving sex workers and drugs. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has unveiled her government’s legislative programme for the next year, including a plan for a £500m fund to support Scottish businesses. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments.

He is now executive director at Teach First. Sam Freedman (@Samfr) The really interesting thing about that snippet is that the DfE think they have to change the law to open more grammars.

September 6, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.27am EDT 11:27 Kevin Courtney, the National Union of Teachers’ general secretary, has put out a lengthy statement condemning the plans to open new grammar schools. Here is an extract. Opening new grammar schools would not only be a backward step but is also a complete distraction from the real problems facing schools and education. For every grammar school there are three or four ‘secondary modern’ schools. All the evidence makes clear that segregating children in this way leads to lower academic standards. The argument that grammar schools create ‘social mobility’ are, in the words of the Ofsted chief inspector, ‘tosh and nonsense’. Evidence shows that in areas which retain grammar schools, disadvantaged students – who are eligible for FSM or who live in poor neighbourhoods – are much less likely to be enrolled, even if they score highly on Key Stage 2 tests. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.24am EDT 11:24 On the Andrew Marr show on Sunday Theresa May was asked directly if she intended to allow more grammar schools to open. The Jonathan Slater document (see 3.55pm) suggests the answer is clearly yes. But May sidestepped the question. She replied: What I want to do in looking at schools is to build on the success of the six years of David Cameron’s premiership when we see – now see more children in good and outstanding schools. But there is still more to be done. There are still parents who feel that their children aren’t getting the opportunities they want them to have because of what happened to their local school. So I want to make sure that children have those opportunities, that all schools are offering a good education for children. May also said Justine Greening, the new education secretary, was “looking at these issues”. The Marr transcript is here (pdf).

The cat is out of the bag: behind closed doors the Tories are planning a return to the bad old days of grammars, ignoring all the evidence which has told us time and again that they do not aid social mobility. As Michael Wilshaw said yesterday, with every grammar school you open you create three more secondary moderns with it. It’s a policy which reveals the truth of this Tory Government: caring only for the few at the expense of the majority. The Tories have overseen a school places crisis, the highest rate of teachers leaving the profession in a decade and over half a million pupils in super-sized classes. These issues should be her priority, not harking back to a golden-age that never existed. Labour is committed to an education system for everyone, not just a select few. Angela Rayner. Photograph: Christopher Thomond Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.02am EDT 11:02 John Pugh, the Lib Dem education spokesman, has put out a statement condemning the plans to open new grammar schools. This lays bare the desperate lengths the Conservative party are willing to go to deliver grammar schools through the cloak of expansion. The government should be ashamed of themselves. If they think this is the right thing to do, they should bring it to Parliament and win the argument. This looks like a desperate plan to avoid parliamentary scrutiny and an inevitable defeat. This rose tinted view of grammar schools might play well for a nostalgic few on the right of the Tory party but make no mistake about it, they are not the drivers of social mobility they would like to claim. The Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all and this will not deliver it. If the government is committed to increasing social mobility, then the key is investing in children from more disadvantaged backgrounds, through Liberal Democrat measures like the pupil premium. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.55am EDT 10:55 Government plans to open new grammar school, confidential document reveals The government is planning to bring back grammar schools, according to official paperwork seen by journalists. An official was carrying the document as he arrived at Number 10 today as the cabinet was meeting and he was photographed. The text was posted on Twitter by the photographer Steve Back, who runs the @PoliticalPics Twitter account. Political Pictures (@PoliticalPics) I've lost count of the times I have told people to get folders in No10, this seen this morning as Cabinet underway pic.twitter.com/YK3CESjBrg September 6, 2016 The document was written by Jonathan Slater, permanent secretary at the Department for Education. It says: The con doc [consultation document] says we will open new grammars, albeit that they would have to follow various conditions. The SoS’s [Secretary of State’s] clear position is that this should be presented in the con doc as an option, and only to be pursued once we have worked with existing grammars to show how they can be expanded and reformed in ways which avoid disadvantaging those who don’t get in. I simply don’t know what the PM thinks of this, but it sounds reasonable to me, and I simply can’t see any way of persuading the Lords to vote for selection on any other basis. The government is not denying that it plans to open new grammar schools.

Loughton, a Conservative, has taken over as acting chair of the home affairs committee pending the election of a full-time replacement. He was speaking to journalists in Portcullis House, Westminster, flanked by other committee members after the committee’s private meeting where Vaz confirmed his resignation. Loughton said: Keith Vaz came to the meeting of the select committee. He gave a very frank account of what had happened and he told us of his intention to resign as chairman of the home affairs select committee ... The committee listened, I think in sadness, to what Keith had to say and with a good deal of respect. Keith has clearly acted in the best interests of the home affairs select committee and the important work that we do. And with sadness we all accepted that that was the appropriate course of action that he has taken. And we also appreciate the many challenges facing him personally and his family. All members of the home affairs select committee, across all parties, paid very fulsome tributes to the work that Keith has done. It is remarkable that he has been chairman of the select committee for nine years, the longest serving select committee chair. In that time he has overseen the publication of 120 reports and I think he has a reputation for getting the best out of witnesses, for being a robust chair, but also being a fair chair as well. I don’t think it is an underestimate to say the work of the committee under his chairmanship has had a direct and big impact on government policy, on law and also on public opinion at times as well.

The company is starting out by partnering with sites like Polyvore and LiketoKnow.it, which are Pinterest-like networks that help fashion bloggers make money off social media posts. That way, Google is able to pull in photos and affiliate links when people search for items like "summer dress." The program is part of Google’s overall shopping ad product, so down the line big-name retailers may be able to sell clothes using the tool as well. Shop the Look is part of the company’s ongoing efforts to make its search engine more powerful and useful, in hopes users won’t spend their time in mobile apps instead. Because as more users access the internet via smartphones running apps, Google’s influence has been diluted alongside the mobile web’s. Why go fire up Google Chrome when you follow your favorite designers or clothing brands on Instagram, or have a curated list of popular Pinterest boards to choose from? Google wants more smartphone owners using the mobile web instead of apps So by baking more features into search, Google is urging people to use its engine for as many different tasks as possible. (And with every search, Google makes money by serving ads.) We’ve seen this more prominently in the past year with Google’s search changes around the 2016 election that surface candidate’s positions on hot button topics and delegate counts during the primaries. Just in the past few months, Google has outfitted search with solitaire and tic-tac-toe games and a symptom search system for self-diagnosis. Each new feature is a subtle nudge to keep using Google search for all your wants and needs.

By Zack Whittaker for Zero Day | September 6, 2016 -- 18:00 GMT (11:00 PDT) | Topic: Security Image: CNET/CBS Interactive What took Google a month to fix took others just a couple of weeks. In the latest round of Android security fixes released Tuesday, the company fixed two remaining flaws that were part of the so-called "Quadrooter" set of vulnerabilities announced last month. SECURITY 'Quadrooter' flaws affect over 900 million Android phones Researchers revealed the flaws at the Def Con security conference. Read More Quadrooter was particularly troublesome because the set of four flaws (hence the name "quad") affected at least 900 million Android devices. These high-risk vulnerabilities would allow a dedicated and well-trained attacker to gain complete access to an affected phone and its data. Google, which develops Android, said that most phones had received at least two or even three of the fixes in previous security bulletins. But the rest would remain outstanding for a month, until now, when the company released its regularly-scheduled monthly patches. That didn't stop at least one phone maker pushing out a patch in the meanwhile. BlackBerry was the first phone maker to patch the flaws. Silent Circle, which makes the Blackphone, also released a patch, but it was subsequently pulled. Google said Tuesday that the two outstanding bug fixes will land on its own-brand Nexus devices in the coming hours and other devices in the next few days. According to the bulletin, Google confirmed that the two escalation of privilege bugs -- CVE-2016-2059 (rated "high") and CVE-2016-5340 (rated "critical") -- were fixed. The Android software and phone maker also fixed six more critical bugs in the mobile operating system, including two remote code execution flaw in core Android components. Nexus users should automatically receive the update.

Revision as of 10:12, 6 September 2016 THIS PAGE IS A WORKING DRAFT The page may be difficult to navigate, and some information on its subject might be incomplete and/or evolving rapidly. If you have any questions or ideas, please add them as a new topic on the discussion page. This page lists all confirmed or suspected incidents or issues involving the CA "WoSign". It will be updated by Mozilla as more information becomes available. Please do not edit this page yourself; if you have proposed changes, email Gerv. The incidents are in chronological order, and have been re-numbered from the original announcement to use letters with gaps in between, for possible future expansion. Contents 1 Incident D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) 1.1 WoSign Response 1.2 Further Comments 2 Incident F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) 2.1 WoSign Response 3 Incident H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) 3.1 WoSign Response 3.2 Further Comments 4 Incident J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) 4.1 WoSign Response 4.2 Further Comments 5 Incident L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) 5.1 WoSign Response 5.2 Further Comments 6 Incident N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) 6.1 WoSign Response 6.1.1 Bug N1 6.1.2 Bug N2 6.2 Further Comments 7 Incident P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) 7.1 WoSign Response 7.2 Further Comments 8 Incident R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) 8.1 WoSign Response 8.2 Further Comments 9 Incident T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) 9.1 WoSign Response 10 Incident V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) 10.1 WoSign Response 10.2 Further Comments 11 Other Points of Note Incident D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this incident does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Incident F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. Incident H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers. (It is not clear if these were all the same number, or in pairs, or some other combination.) This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Incident J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This incident was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this incident perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this incident at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Incident L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance incident did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official incident report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates has been called into question by a discussion participant who testifies that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. Incident N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. They reported this to WoSign, giving only the Github certificates as an example. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance incident did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official incident report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. However, they have misclassified at least one - line 2 of Figure 14 - so the actual split may be different. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Incident P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Incident R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, in violation of section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. More details to be provided. WoSign Response Among other comments: 2016-09-02: Richard Wang: "Please don't bind WoSign incident problem with StartCom, it is two independent company that one registered in China and one located in Israel." Further Comments As well as any issues there may be with the disclosure of the transfer of ownership, the relationship between WoSign and StartCom is also relevant when determining the scope of any sanctions. Incident T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Incident V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Incident 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. Using the value "1" led to a certificate which had a notBefore date (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which was signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. (XXX To investigate: did the chain contain some SHA-256 certs?) The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official incident report. Further Comments This incident does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open. Other Points of Note While not a violation of any Mozilla policy, WoSign has promised to log all certs to CT after a certain date, and yet has not yet managed to comply with the Chrome CT policy of logging to at least one Google and one non-Google log. Arguably, this speaks to competence.

File picture: Eric Risberg San Francisco - There's a quirky twist on tourism emerging amid the Silicon Valley whirlwind of innovation that has tethered everyone to their smartphones. Those omnipresent devices are being used to track down technological touchstones scattered around the San Francisco Bay area so selfies can be taken, videos can be recorded and the experience can be celebrated in a Facebook post, Snapchat or tweet. Here's a tourist's guide to nerd nirvana for those more interested in seeing the suburban home where The Woz built the first Apple computer alongside Steve Jobs than the spooky prison in the Bay where the Birdman of Alcatraz once served time alongside Machine Gun Kelly.   GROWING UP IN A GARAGE Silicon Valley startups have a history of humble beginnings, dating to 1939 when Hewlett-Packard Co. was founded in a Palo Alto, California, garage. It still stands at 367 Addison Ave., considered by many to be the birthplace of Silicon Valley. HP now owns the place. Jobs was one of many entrepreneurs influenced by the HP legacy as a teenager, eventually inspiring him and his engineering friend, Steve “The Woz” Wozniak, to begin working on Apple's first computer in the home of Jobs' parents. That ranch-style house at 2066 Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, is now owned by Jobs' sister, Patricia. After they started Google in 1998, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin built what would become the world's dominant search engine in a garage and room they rented from Susan Wojcicki, whom they later hired (she now runs YouTube for them). The Menlo Park, California, house, at 232 Santa Margarita Ave., is now owned by Google. Shortly after starting Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, Mark Zuckerberg and a few friends moved to Silicon Valley for what they thought would be just one summer. Zuckerberg never returned to Harvard, and the world hasn't been quite the same since then. The Palo Alto, California house where Zuckerberg did a lot of computer coding and threw some wild parties, if you believe the movies, is located at 819 La Jennifer Way. The place is still rented out by young entrepreneurs hoping some of Zuckerberg's magic will rub off on them.   TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY TEMPLES The headquarters of Apple, Google and Facebook have turned into must-see shrines to products that have become part of culture's lifeblood. None of the companies offers public tours, but that doesn't mean you can't steal glimpses at these factories of innovation.   SEARCH STARTS HERE Google is the most accessible of the three headquarters. The hub of its Mountain View, California, campus is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, with other Google offices sprawling almost all the way down to the nearby NASA Ames Research Centre, where Page and Brin keep personal jets in a hangar. Walk down Charleston Road and you are bound to see one of the company's employees (also known as “Googlers”) cruising on yellow, green, blue and red bikes placed outside all the offices to get to meetings more quickly. While strolling around, make sure to swing into the office at 1981 Landings Drive, where you can take a selfie with Android statues memorializing different versions of the operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones. Each statue represents a dessert because Google has nicknamed each version after something sweet. The menu includes “Cupcake,” ''Donut,” ''Eclair,” ''Froyo,” ''Gingerbread,” Honeycomb,” ''Ice Cream Sandwich,” ''Jelly Bean,” ''KitKat,” ''Lollipop” and “Marshmallow.” The latest serving of Android, called “Nougat,” has just started rolling out. Finally, in the Google store on the main campus, you can buy company-branded merchandise, including shirts, hats, mugs, pens and even notebooks (the kind with paper).   A PLACE EVERYONE LIKES The giant thumbs-up sign replicating Facebook's symbol for liking a post has become one of the most photographed spots in Silicon Valley since the social networking company moved its headquarters from Palo Alto to 1 Hacker Way in nearby Menlo Park five years ago. Unless you happen to be in a plane or have a camera-equipped drone, you won't be able to see what's on top of another Facebook building across the street (an underground tunnel connects the offices). That building, designed by famed architect Frank Gehry, features a 9-acre park atop the roof.   ONE MORE THING Apple, founded in 1976, has had a fiercely loyal following for decades, so its Cupertino, California, headquarters has long drawn tourists looking to get a picture of its famous logo and the 1 Infinite Loop sign denoting its address. There is, of course, an Apple store at the headquarters, where people can buy company-branded merchandise not sold in most of its other stores. But you can't get help fixing your iPhone, iPad or Mac here. You'll have to go to another store for an appointment at the Genius Bar that serves as Apple's customer-help desk. The current headquarters will be overshadowed next year when Apple plans to open a nearby 2.8 million-square-foot, circular office that has been likened to a huge spaceship sitting on a 176-acre site. Known as “Campus 2,” the new building is designed to accommodate about 12 000 workers. Before Jobs died in 2011, he stipulated that the campus should be surrounded by about 7 000 trees.   WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE ON TV? The HBO comedy Silicon Valley has won many accolades over three seasons, so fans may want to see the house that serves as headquarters for the fictional startup, Pied Piper. The location has been given as 5230 Newell Road in Palo Alto on the series, but that address doesn't exist. The house is actually is in southern California, at 5230 Penfield Ave. in Woodland Hills. So put it on the sightseeing list for your next visit to Hollywood. AP Connect with IOL Travel on Facebook Follow IOL Travel on Twitter Get our new, free Travel newsletter - subscribe here...

He looks composed and consistent and really knew how to take advantage of Pouille’s weaknesses. In the post-interview he calls New York his second home and playing like that, it’s hard to disagree with him. The 30-year-old looked extremely comfortable today as he makes the semifinals for the very first time at the US Open. Credit must go to Lucas Pouille as he had a great tournament. One must think that beating Nadal in a four-hour match took a lot our of him, but make no mistake, the future looks bright for the 22-year-old Frenchman. That’s it from me, thanks so much for tuning in.

The best rally of the match thus far ends in another unforced error by Pouille. First break opportunity...but Pouille wins it as he comes to the net. Just a note, were seeing some drizzle so theres a chance for the roof to make its introduction. Pouille makes it advantage with a great forehand winner. He wins the game as he comes to the net with a great forehand volley.

First and foremost let me say this: this encounter is exactly why we love this game and the fact that on paper, it was not even meant to happen. Admit it, this had Nadal/Raonic written all over it, but these two were ready to crash the party. The 30-year-old Monfils arrives tonight without dropping a set, including his recent victory against Marcos Baghdatis (6-3, 6-2, 6-3) in the previous round. The Parisian is one of the most exciting players because quite simply he’s everything in one package: audaciously talented, improvisational and extremely frustrating to watch. His acrobatic style can fill a highlight reel but his inability to stay consistent has impeded him from reaching a higher level. He has six titles to his name and only reached a Grand Slam semi-final once: the French Open in 2008. At the US Open, he has reached the quarters twice, without any success. But this summer, with the help of his new coach, Swede Mikael Tillstrom, he is enjoying a great season, making it to the quarterfinals in the Australian Open and winning the Citi Open. In his way, stands the new kid on the block, 22-year-old Pouille, who after beating Nadal in a thrilling four-hour, five-set affair, is ready to make some more noise at Flushing Meadows. After making it to the last eight in Wimbledon earlier this summer, Pouille climbed to 21st in the world. The Frenchman has all the attributes of a star, only time will tell if he lives up to expectation. The last and only time both players have faced each other was last year at the Australian Open in the first round when Monfils came back from two sets down to win 6-7 3-6 6-4 6-1 6-4. Stay tuned, this is going to be a good one.

The Scot’s 141 mile-an-hour rocket on the eighth evening of the tournament was one of nine aces he put past the bewildered Bulgarian, who barely got into the match at any point. On Wednesday Murray plays the sixth seed and former finalist Kei Nishikori, who earlier put out the veteran Ivo Karlovic in three tough sets. Murray said courtside: “I served 145 in San Jose once, but the next day they recalibrated the gun because it was completely wrong. I think I was lucky. I’ve never hit over 140 before. I don’t expect to do it again.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close Topics US Open Tennis 2016 US Open tennis US sports Tennis Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home election 2016 US world opinion sports selected soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home election 2016 US world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports selected soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Sports › US Open Tennis 2016 Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2016 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The company has previously revealed plans for its cars to be able to  predict what drivers are going to do next, as well as drive slowly around children. Now, according to a patent filed by Google, the firm is working on a way to allow its smart cars to get out of the way of police and other emergency vehicles. Google has filed a patent that will allow its smart cars to get out of the way of police and other emergency vehicles. The patent (diagram pictured) will use filters to detect the red and blue flashing lights used by emergency servies HOW WILL IT WORK? The technology will use filters to detect the red and blue flashing lights used by emergency services. Software will also determine whether the lights are flashing or not, and will be able to identify which form of vehicle is approaching by noting the spacing of the lights. The car will then move out of the way of the emergency vehicle. In doing so, it will make sure it does not create an accident by driving itself into a tree or off a bridge, for example. 'A system and method is provided for detecting and responding to emergency vehicles,' the patent application says. 'In one aspect, one or more computing devices may identify a set of light sources from an image based at least in part on one or more templates, and may filter the set of light sources in order to identify one or more light sources corresponding to a potential emergency vehicle.' The technology uses filters to detect the red and blue flashing lights used by emergency services. Software will also determine whether the lights are flashing or not, and will be able to identify which form of vehicle is approaching by noting the spacing of the lights. However, as with the raft of patents granted to Google, it is unclear if the technology will come to fruition at this stage.

Share this article Share 17 shares Google is one of the main contenders when it comes to developing a self-driving car.  The company has previously revealed plans for its cars to be able to predict what drivers are going to do next and drive more slowly around children PREDICTING THE BEHAVIOUR OF OTHER DRIVERS Details emerged earlier this year of a patent filed by Google for detecting and tracking brake and indicator lights of other cars on the road. The technology would enable driverless cars to anticipate the movements of cars on the road ahead using a forward facing camera. Onboard computers would then check for changes in brightness of the lights and work out whether a driver has turned on their indicators. Algorithms will identify pixels in the images, analyse the colours and work out if they are pulsing.  If they are, it then determines how likely it is that the driver has an indicator switched on and feeds back the information to its central system. The car will then move out of the way of the emergency vehicle. In doing so, it will make sure it does not create an accident by driving itself into a tree or off a bridge, for example. 'Autonomous vehicles may...use the cameras, sensors, and global positioning devices to gather and interpret images and sensor data about its surrounding environment, for example, oncoming vehicles, parked cars, trees, buildings' the patent says. Google has been working on its smart vehicle since 2009, with testing being carried out on the roads around its Mountain View headquarters in California. Google says the technology will help reduce delays for the emergency service and cut down on the possible risk of crashes involving its own cars. A study last year found self-driving cars are far more accident-prone than ordinary cars, a new study has claimed. Researchers found self-driving vehicles had 9.1 crashes, compared to just 1.9 for those with a human operator. However, the report found that none of the accidents were the fault of the self driving car. Self-driving cars were also rear-ended 50 per cent more often than traditional vehicles, it found. However, the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute concluded 'self-driving vehicles were not at fault in any crashes they were involved in.' The technology will determine whether the lights are flashing or not, and will be able to identify which form of vehicle is approaching by noting the spacing of the lights, The car will then move out of the way of the emergency vehicle   Read more: United States Patent Application: 0160252905 Share or comment on this article e-mail 17 shares Most watched News videos Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Victoria Fritz hides her baby bump moments before giving birth Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes? 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Shocking moment Kumbuka tries to smash glass at London Zoo President-elect Trump and family dine out at famous 21 Club Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Cops shoot man holding 2-year-old girl hostage Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Little girl leaps to her sister's defense during scolding EXCLUSIVE: Blow up!

Luckily for Les Bleus neither Sweden nor Holland took advantage, drawing as they did 1-1. Belgium won a game despite having Roberto Martínez in charge! But it was against Cyprus! Two goals in the space of 70 stoppage time seconds threatened to give, and then denied, Luxembourg a point in Bulgaria! (I’ve just seen Tonev’s winner, and it was a sweet strike).

Two-faced donors include Pepsi, DuPont and Google Ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections, the donations from companies including PepsiCo, Dupont, and Google reveal a disconnect between how these companies present themselves to the public on environmental issues, and how they manage their political contributions to support business-friendly policy. Many companies active in U.S. politics spread their political donations broadly on both sides of the aisle and consider multiple issues when deciding whom to support. But inconsistency between a company's environmental positions and its political giving may point up a need for better oversight, according to Jon Lukomnik, head of the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute. "There really needs to be a process that looks at these issues ... at C-suite and board levels on a periodic basis," Lukomnik said. 25 of 30 signatories to climate-change pledge also donate to climate-change deniers The Reuters review covered donations made during the 2016 election cycle by the political action committees (PACs) of 30 of the biggest publicly traded U.S. companies that signed Obama's "American Business Act on Climate Change Pledge" in 2015, a public promise to enact climate-friendly corporate policies and support strong climate change oversight like the global climate accord signed in Paris. The review found that 25 of the 30 companies are funding the campaigns of lawmakers featured on a "climate deniers" list that was put together by Organizing For Action, a non-profit created by former Obama campaign aides to advocate his agenda. The list includes more than 130 members of Congress, nearly all Republicans, and is a who's who of the biggest opponents of Obama's plan to combat climate change. Some of those on the list dispute the label "denier" and describe themselves as climate change "skeptics." The list includes Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, an energy advisor to presidential candidate Donald Trump who once argued the Earth was cooling not warming, and Republican U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, who last year held up a snowball on the Senate floor as evidence global warming does not exist. Companies declined to comment The review found PepsiCo and DuPont's political action committees gave about half or more of the money from their top donations in support of senators and congressmen on the list. That amounted to $56,500 from the Pepsi PAC's 29 donations of $2,500 and above, and $40,000 from the DuPont PAC's 19 donations of $2,000 and above. Other signatories to the American Business Act on Climate Change Pledge that gave more than a third of their top political contributions to lawmakers on the list include Google, AT&T , GE, Verizon, and Mondelez, according to the review. Those levels of donations given to climate skeptics are relatively high given that the list covers about a quarter of U.S. Congress members. Officials from PepsiCo, Google, AT&T, and Verizon did not respond to requests for comment. DuPont declined to comment, and Mondelez referred Reuters to the press release announcing its participation in the climate pledge. To their credit, GE and Pepsi are investing in green technology A GE spokeswoman said the company supports "elected officials based on a wide range of issues, but we have consistently been outspoken about the need to address climate change and have invested over $17 billion in cleaner technology R&D over the last 11 years." PepsiCo has also been working to become more energy efficient, and now operates the country's largest fleet of electric delivery trucks. But it still has a sizable carbon footprint: It produced some 4.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2013, down 2 percent from 2012, according to its website. A more recent figure was not available. DuPont, also working to increase its energy efficiency, emitted 16.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2013. Inhofe: Companies' climate proclamations may not be sincere The five companies reviewed by Reuters that did not fund opponents to Obama's climate change agenda either had no political action committee, like Apple, or made only a small number of contributions, like Coca Cola. Senator Inhofe, who said he doesn't mind the label "climate denier," suggested that some companies had signed the American Business Act on Climate Change pledge for superficial reasons. "These are competitive companies, and the board might have said 'Look, right now it might be a popular thing to join this, and there's no downside since we're not really committing to anything.' That absolutely goes on," he said. Lauren Compere, managing director at sustainable investment manager Boston Common Asset Management, said consistency between policy and political giving was becoming increasingly important to environmentally-minded investors. "No company should want to be perceived as espousing progressive climate policies on the one hand, while funding climate deniers on the other," she said.

One of the most common uses of Google Drive is to store documents which are often downloaded, edited locally, and then reuploaded to Drive. This results in duplicate files which can be a pain to manage. Fortunately, Google has made some tweaks which now makes Drive more capable of managing duplicate files. Google has made a change in Drive to deduplicate files which were initially uploaded in the way described above. Now, when users upload files with the same filename as an existing file, the file will automatically be deduplicated. The old file will remain accessible in the revision history so if any mistakes are made or users simply need to revert back to the old version, that remains an option. This change also applies to folders so uploaded folders with the same name will be merged as well. Users have the option to prevent files from being deduplicated. To make that happen they just have to click on “Keep as separate file” once their file or folder has been uploaded to Drive. This change is going to be gradually released for all Drive users across the globe over the next two weeks. Filed in General. Read more about Google and google drive.

Enjoy main-stage presentations, panel discussions and more. Watch Now » This year’s career-minded graduates are flooding the job market after four years of hard work and higher education, armed with a piece of paper that proves they’re go-getters. They finish things. They’ve got an alma mater that taught them how to live. But as you all start to wonder what comes next, that alma mater could start to feel like a big variable -- will the name of your college impact where you’re able to land a job? Research has repeatedly shown that graduates of so-called “better” schools -- the Oxfords, the Harvards, the Stanfords -- are more likely to be the most “employable,” moving on to top jobs and making pretty darn good money along the way. Recruiters at top employers have been known to say they only look at candidates from a specific set of top-ranking schools. Big banking and investment firms proudly admit they focus most of their recruiting at top-tier campuses. It’s not surprising, then, that parents and students historically spend so much time, effort and money trying to get into these elite universities. We’ve been indoctrinated to believe that the name matters most of all. Related: Placement Blues: What Ivy-League Colleges Should Keep In Mind Prior To the Next Recruitment Season But before today’s grads get too concerned about what’s written on their diploma, take heart -- things are changing. According to Jobvite data, graduates from San Jose State University, University of California, Berkeley and The University of Texas at Austin were the most in-demand for companies hiring between March of 2015 and March of 2016. That’s a huge variety, and it just goes to show that the outlook is good for any hard-working college graduate -- regardless of which college you attended. Luck (and the job market) is on your side. First of all, you’ve got simple supply and demand working in your favor. As technology continues to infiltrate every industry on the planet, companies desperately need employees capable of navigating this brave new world -- and the fact is that the so-called top schools cannot produce enough skilled graduates to fill this need on their own. No company is going to have the time, patience or durability to continue limiting its applicant pool to an elite handful. Being agile and competitive in this job market means developing more creative recruiting strategies and being open to all available options -- and that’s good news for you. The other thing is that all this super-investment in hiring based on a school’s name is not delivering any justifiable returns. That’s why Google’s head of HR, Laszlo Bock, stated flat out last year that his company doesn’t care where you went to college anymore. Google looked at its own data and found that the top-tier graduates it had been hiring -- at a considerably greater expense -- were not always the employees that delivered the greatest results for the company. In fact, Google found that performance, leadership, culture fit, problem solving -- these were the things that differentiated its most productive workers and therefore these were the things that should warrant a better salary. More and more companies are going with Google’s philosophy. They’re willing to pay more for the best talent, sure; but with today’s data analytics capabilities, there are more scientific ways to determine how to get a return on that investment than assuming it pumps naturally in the veins of Stanford grads. Related: 4 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Recruit Exclusively Online What’s in a name? I’ve been working a long time. I’ve been everything from a beat reporter to a technology CEO and I’ve learned that once you’re hired, your performance on the job matters more than anything else. Period. No one sits around the office comparing diplomas. No one will care whether you went to Dartmouth or the University of Michigan. They care if you can do the work you were hired to do. Honestly, I think graduates of second- and third-tier schools are often better prepared for this reality than those who went Ivy League. If you attended a large public institution (I was an undergrad at UCLA), then you’ve routinely sat in classes with 400 other students taught by busy professors who don’t soften or inflate grades. You’ve learned how to buckle down and get things done. That counts for something, believe me. I went to graduate school at an Ivy League university, and while it was certainly tough, it was not the same environment. I think the school of hard knocks regularly humbles graduates who don’t know what the real world is like. Related: 5 Surefire Ways to Attract College Talent So as you head out beyond graduation, keep these thoughts in mind. Be sure, too, that you keep in touch with your friends. Good friends are hard to find -- and they can also be great business contacts as the years go by.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Google’s modular smartphone, Project Ara, is officially dead Google’s modular smartphone, Project Ara, is officially dead By Joel Hruska on September 6, 2016 at 11:30 am Comment Over the past few years, Google has been working on a modular smartphone concept that would allow users to swap certain components and customize the device. Potential add-ons ran the gamut from improved cameras to larger batteries. Initially, Google implied that core blocks like the CPU, display, and sensors might be swappable. But the company changed the design spec earlier this year to a much more limited platform in which the CPU, GPU, sensors, battery, and display were all locked down — leaving little reason to buy an Ara at all. Google seems to have read the writing on the wall and killed the project altogether. While the company hasn’t made a formal announcement yet, Reuters has reported that the cancellation reflects an ongoing effort to streamline Google’s hardware projects and bring them under a single division. The company has also just killed its Pixel 2 Chromebook without announcing a replacement. The Project Ara prototype Project Ara’s design was interesting, but it was never clear how much market the device would actually have, or whether it would offer replacement CPUs or displays. The problems were significant: While PC desktop hardware is extremely modular, PC desktop hardware is also big. Mobile devices are designed for tight levels of integration, which Project Ara would have intrinsically lacked. In a conventional SoC, the CPU, GPU, and I/O hardware all live on the same slice of silicon. Replacing one of these components means replacing all of them. Android would have had to adopt a more Windows-like model of shipping with a large quantity of drivers, and would’ve had to instruct people in how to download new drivers for advanced hardware modules. The theory behind Project Ara was sound: a modular smartphone that would generate much less waste, allow users to repair broken devices by replacing modules, and create a vibrant ecosystem of third-party components that would extend the usefulness and capability of smartphones in new ways (and possibly culminating in the creation of a tricorder-like device from Star Trek). The problem is, it doesn’t play nice with current laws of physics. Building modular devices with separate interconnects and magnetic locks introduces wear and tear issues that can damage these components and leave them non-functional long term. This was a problem Google reportedly struggled to solve — in order for the interconnects to function properly, the contacts had to make tight contact — then maintain that contact over hundreds or thousands of removals and replacements. Gold is often used for these type of contacts, but gold is also comparatively easy to scratch or abrade. And while it’s not clear how much power the interconnects in Project Ara consumed, it would have been over and above that of current smartphones. These issues and Google’s desire to consolidate its hardware efforts appear to have killed Project Ara. It’s not clear what comes next for the hardware it designed. There are rumors that it might license its technology to other partners. But with Google’s efforts having failed, few companies may be interested.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Snapchat May Be Working On Augmented-Reality Glasses Posted: Sep 6 2016, 10:35am CDT | by Noel Diem, in News | Latest Business News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   The Financial Times reports that social media giant Snapchat has become a member of an exclusive Bluetooth group that will allow Snapchat to build hardware using the wireless technology, with the most likely goal being a Snapchat-connected headset. They could even be working to compete against companies like Google by hiring eyewear designer Lauryn Morries. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals Snapchat is building a hardware-centric team to focus on 3D products, making a line of products that could enhance the game. Among Snapchat's hires is Dan Stein, who led recruitment for Google's Project Aura. Former Nokia hardware designers have joined the companies. If Snapchat does end up making a move for the hardware industry, it would stand to learn from the successes and failures of other social media apps that came out with hardware. Just recently, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been lauded for the $2 million purchase of Oculus, a virtual reality start-up. On the other hand, you have Google who was criticized for its own Google Glass, that might have had success if they had just waited a little longer. The Snap Lab is still hiring, looks to be taking a different approach than both of the others - they will focus on augmented reality.  Vanity Fair found a listing on Snapchat’s Web site for a “3D computer vision engineer” with the description: “Prototype groundbreaking new user experiences involving 3D graphics, including experiences that require visual understanding of the scene.” Let's hope the future sees a VR world where the flower crown is permanently attached.

He doesn’t mention one important fact about the burkini ban, possibly because it’s so obvious. Women who wear the burkini, the burqa or the niqab are wearing what they want to wear and not harming anybody. These are the most important facts about the whole matter. It’s not relevant to the ban that Islamic clothes remind one of Islamic societies and that some of those societies are profoundly illiberal. It doesn’t matter that covering up is or isn’t required by the Qur’an. The people banning the clothes aren’t living in those societies. What they are doing is stopping women from wearing what they choose to wear. They are, in fact, acting like the small-minded theocrats who force Iranian women in Iran to wear headscarves. What’s so liberal about that? The French burkini ban-mongers need to rediscover the liberté in their national motto. Floyd Kermode Preston, Victoria, Australia • “It has become fashionable to lampoon multiculturalism and its respect for diversity,” says Will Hutton. That sounds good – but what does it mean? A culture of total diversity – in extremis a mixture of all cultures on earth – would not be a culture at all. By definition any human culture has beliefs and practices particular to itself. In Britain, we expect visitors to drive on the left, for example. Multiculturalism is a concept dreamed up by the French in an honourable attempt to cope with an influx of Algerian Muslims after the Algerian war. But at root it is a contradiction in terms. What is possible is a dominant culture that is tolerant of other cultures within it. That is what we should be aiming for. So if we – or the French – are comfortably dominant in our own national cultures we should be able to cope with burkinis on the beach – up to a point. But if one day Hutton found that 60% or 70% of the ladies on his beach were clad in burkinis, would he be happy with that? David Hayes Bristol, UK • We now live in a world where a woman can be forced by the police to remove some of her clothing in a public place. I hope bikinis never become obligatory. Jenny Sandercock Affoltern am Albis, Switzerland US misdeeds in Yemen Trevor Timm and Guardian Weekly deserve the highest commendation for the piece entitled US is promoting war crimes in Yemen (26 August), pointing the finger at the Obama administration as the reason for this human tragedy. Sadly, this is another man-made humanitarian disaster created by the west, especially the US. Why is this so? George Monbiot, in relation to the climate crisis, wrote (12 August) that it is due to the media’s failure: “the media prefer to turn away from important issues and give us trivia”. A strong and independent news media is the backbone of democracy. In all traditionally democratic countries the news media have lost their purpose in keeping the politicians on the straight and narrow. Today, many of the news media in the west are owned by the wealthy, who want to keep their economic and political power via controlling the media’s editorial policies. One would hope that Timm’s report makes a difference. Bill Mathew Melbourne, Australia • The G18 group of nations states that a Yemeni rally by Houthis makes the search for peace more difficult, but unmentioned as a block to peace are the Saudi/US bombings (26 August). Robert Kinzie Kaneohe, Hawaii, US Google is affecting our brains Stephen Poole asks whether it matters if Google is rewiring our minds (26 August). It is well to remember that all a Google search can do is acquire large quantities of information quickly. The ease with which this can be done may inculcate lazy habits, and may make the user careless about the reliability of the information acquired. If so, that is his or her fault, or, for younger users, perhaps the fault of the way they were taught to use the internet. In the recent past, students used “paste and scissors” material from books. Generally such activities were of little use. Google usually generates much more information in a shorter time. Most people acquire information because they want to know something. Google cannot hurt if the searcher has acquired intellectual skills by grappling with the acquired materials: drawing “creative connections”, as Poole calls it. The worst that Google can do is cause a certain amount of confusion until people are taught how to use it well and taught how not to be overwhelmed by what it throws up. Greg McCarry Sydney, Australia • When reflecting on the possible negative impact of constant internet access on our memory, what Steven Poole didn’t touch upon were the aspects of impatience and ever-shorter attention spans. Some of my friends are seriously stressed out because, every once in a while, they have to wait for more than three seconds before they can book their restaurant table online. Unlike myself (I tend to quietly shake my head and smile patiently in these situations), my friends are all in their 30s, so you would think they would remember life without internet access or a mobile device. But far from it. The more information we have at our disposal and the faster we get it, the more impatient we become. Did you know that according to a Microsoft study, humans have become so obsessed with portable devices that we now have attention spans shorter than that of goldfish? Jan Schwab Freiburg, Germany Happiness has no price Terry Eagleton’s review of William Davies’s book The Happiness Industry (26 August) raises many questions, not least concerning the degree to which psychology, and to a large extent psychiatry, have been commandeered by marketers in their attempt to manipulate an unwitting public. As Aldous Huxley’s brilliant satire Brave New World demonstrates, “soma”, or drug-induced happiness, is potentially a very effective instrument of social control, similar in many ways to the Facebook definition of “friend”. We are fortunate that wiser heads, including Davies’s, recognise that individual psychology is embedded in a broader social, geographic and economic context, and that happiness is beyond the ability of our current neuroscientists to define, control or locate in a specific region of the brain. Does happiness even exist as a definable entity? Or is it, as I believe, an elusive state of mind that can never be found simply by looking for it? Our past experience tells us one thing, at least: it can never be bought or sold, for which we can be eternally happy. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia Briefly • I was pleased to discover that Hastings Council have made some amends since 1970 to the memory of Robert Tressell (born Croker in Dublin) for their shabby neglect of him at the anniversary of his birth (26 August). He’s got a Society now, and some pieces of his St Andrews Church panels are extant. Why not name a bridge for him – The Tressell Trestle? He’d approve. And restore his manuscript’s title for the novel – Ragged Arsed Philanthropists. RM Fransson Wheat Ridge, Colorado, US • Like Ted Jenner (Reply, 26 August) I think the Olympic Games should have a permanent home, probably Athens. I can’t see it happening though, as those who would decide to do so would not wish to see the gravy train terminated. Why politicians vie for the massive dislocation of financial resources the Games brings to even the wealthiest city is beyond my comprehension.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Project Ara And The Chromebook Pixel Are No More! Posted: Sep 6 2016, 11:12am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Technology News   Google   Google recently decided to shut down two of its hardware projects. The first project to get canned was the Chromebook Pixel. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals It was released in February 2015 and inventory has been exhausted both within Google and at Best Buy stores. It was offered into variants, the simple Chromebook Pixel and the Chromebook Pixel LS. The former was available for $999 while the later costed $300 extra. With both of them becoming unavailable Google no longer has a laptop computing device. Google Ara which was one Googles more interesting projects has also seen the end as it was dismissed after three years of development. It was basically a modular smartphone which allowed separate aspects of the device to be exchanged. Because of its uniqueness Project Ara was what distinguished Google from others and we are sad that we won’t be seeing the finished product, even though it was highly ambitious. With these two projects seeing the axe, Google has freed up some of its resources both in terms of labor and money, so it shall be exciting to see what it comes out with next.

He has published fifteen books on A.I. and other topics, and is the former editor-in-chief of Psychology Today. I just saw “Now You See Me 2.” It stars Daniel Radcliffe as diabolical tech magnate Walter Mabry, who’s a cross between Mark Zuckerberg and Lord Voldemort. According to the movie narration, Mabry and his associates “destroy people’s lives, spying on the world… selling privacy to increase their profit.” They also dispose of people in horrific ways, sometimes while laughing evilly. Ha ha ha! It’s the job of the elite magicians called The Horsemen—played by Mark Ruffalo, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, and Lizzy Caplan—to spin their magic to expose the bad guys, forcing them to “step into the light.” And you thought Daniel Radcliffe could never be evil. Image: Summit Entertainment The movie is ludicrous but it's also a fanciful metaphor for a real-life situation being played out every day on the internet. Do such bad guys really exist? Except for the horrific, remorseless killings (as far as I know), an increasing body of evidence suggests they do. A small number of huge companies really are spying on the world, violating our privacy to increase their profit, and, as I document in my recent essay, “The New Censorship,” at times, destroying people’s lives. Small business owners have long complained of the Google's frequent and mysterious adjustments to its search algorithm, which effectively punish them for violating one of the search engine’s mostly obscure criteria. Even some of the world's largest companies live in constant "fear of Google"; sudden banishment from search results, YouTube, AdWords, Adsense, or a dozen other Alphabet-owned platforms can be devastating. When it comes to Big Tech, there's lots to be concerned about, but let's focus on the privacy problem—one that more people are starting to think about, but that few people truly understand. For a while, it looked like Americans were completely indifferent to giving up their personal information to companies like Facebook and Google. That finally seems to be changing. A recent Pew survey found that 91 percent of American adults are now concerned about the fact that they have “lost control” over how their personal data are being used, and a recent study of mine suggests that people are revealing about 40 percent more personal information online than they would if they were more aware of how that information might be used. I think people will be even more concerned when they understand what is really at stake here. When, day after day, people give away small bits of themselves to Big Data, they eventually give up power over their lives. Here is how this works: When we use “free” online services such as Facebook, Gmail, YouTube, Instagram, or the Google search engine, we are actually entering into a contract—and, no, I don’t mean this in a flaccid, figurative sense; I mean we are literally entering into a legally binding contract. Read more: Motherboard TV: im Wu On Net Neutrality, Information Empires and Freedom As Google puts it in its 1,900-word Terms of Service agreement, which incorporates its 3,000-word Privacy Policy, "By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms." This rule applies even if you don’t know you are using any of these services, and most of the time, you don’t. Google Analytics, Google AdWords, and Google AdSense, for example, are embedded into millions of web pages. When you visit any of those pages, you are using Google services, and you are bound by their Terms of Service. The same goes for Facebook, whose “beacons” dot the web, although to a lesser extent than Google's products do. So what’s in Google's mysterious contract? What have we unknowingly all agreed to whenever we are using Google services, knowingly or not? For convenience, I have reduced Google’s Terms of Service agreement to a simple, three-part contract. If you can muster the patience, you can read the original documents on your own to see if my take is fair. I think it's remarkably complete: The Contract What you get. You, the User, get lots of “free” stuff. For example, you can ask our search engine as many questions as you like, and we’ll give you answers. We’ll also let you look at our free map guides when you need directions, watch free videos, and give you a free email service—lots and lots of free stuff. What we get. In return, we get to record everything you do 24 hours a day—the questions you ask, the purchases you make, the websites you visit, the videos you watch, the places you go, the people you communicate with, the emails you write—everything. The fine print. We get to keep these records and to use the information we’re collecting about you to connect you with businesses we think might want to sell you things, so you should expect to get advertisements from these businesses. We might also share this information with the, uh, intelligence community, because they helped us figure out how to set up this whole scam in the first place. They have a lot of power over you—the power that comes with information—and you have no power over them. At first glance, this may not sound particularly threatening. It’s just an exchange of information, after all. You get free information from Google, and, in return, you give up information about yourself. Think again. This might be fair in the beginning, but what happens as the months and years go by? You continue to get that tiny trickle of free information every day, but Google has meanwhile accumulated a massive database of information about you—and that database has value. By using the personal information Google obtains about its users to sell advertisements, the company is currently raking in about $80 billion a year. (By comparison, Facebook generated about $18 billion last year.) Do you see the problem? Over time, the arrangement has gotten out of balance. What started as a little anthill of information Google had about you grew into a mountain; on your side, you are still just getting that trickle. Over time, what started out as a reasonably fair arrangement has put you and Google into radically different positions of power. They have a lot of power over you—the power that comes with information—and you have no power over them. If it chose to do so, Google could use the information it has about you to embarrass, coerce, or even ruin you. It could also use what it knows about you to influence you. It could give you information that’s slanted one way or another to benefit the company or to achieve any goal it likes; you would have no way of knowing it was doing so. As my laboratory and online research has shown, by slanting the information it gives you, Google can influence the decisions you make about small things, like where to travel and what to buy, and also about big things, like whom to vote for and what to believe. The Terms of Service agreement guarantees that Google gains more and more control over everything you do, think, and say. You, meanwhile, have no clue. As Noam Chomsky once said about closed-doors trade negotiations, “People not only don't know what's happening to them, they don't even know that they don't know.” See more: I Am Capital This is what we have unknowingly signed up for—a world in which a vast and ever-increasing amount of power is concentrated in the hands of a small number of corporate executives—not just at Google, but, increasingly, at other companies that have adopted Google’s deceptive revenue model. Magicians depend on misdirection to pull off their tricks; so does Google, and it has pulled off a trick that makes movie magic look trivial. It has befuddled us into thinking that its sweet suite of services exists entirely for our benefit. It has directed our attention away from the real purpose of those services: to get us to surrender every shred of our personal lives so it can leverage the information for profit, rapidly gaining the means to exert greater influence over us as it does so—threatening the freedom of people around the world as no other entity has ever done before. We need to start over. We need to force Google’s sleight-of-hand business model into the light and to prohibit it by law. And Google’s surface mission—to organize the world’s information—needs to become a public project, not one run by a for-profit company. Looking back some day, I’m guessing people will think it odd that all of the world’s information was once in the hands of a rapacious corporation. Public libraries don’t have hidden agendas; they don’t track people’s personal habits and sell that information to the highest bidder; they don’t lobby public officials or try to influence public opinion. The public search engine was suggested a few years ago in an article in The Nation, and an organization called Common Search is working now to put the idea into practice; this and similar efforts need to be taken seriously. Google’s search engine is an annotated index to the world’s websites; those websites belong to the world, not to Google, and so should the index, along with all the other “free” services Google and other companies are supposedly giving us. Those services were never free; we have been paying for them with our freedom. Topics: opinion, google, facebook, silicon valley, tech, monopoly, power Contact Motherboard by email.

Files with the same name will now automatically be merged, with the older copy still viewable in revision history… Previously, you would have to manually manage having both the old and new file in your Google Drive — and get stuck having to remember which is the revised/latest version. This new feature only works with files that have the same name and of course allows access to the previous versions, much like with any Google Document. As you can see below, the upload window will now number the different versions of the same file. If you don’t want Drive to merge and retain the older behavior, there is an option in the screen to “Keep as a separate file” after the upload is complete. This feature also merges folders that are named similarly. Persistent revision history is one of the most useful Drive features and in some cases can encourage people to use Google’s productivity suite over native apps like Microsoft Office or Apple Pages. Presumably, this feature only works with documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, and it’s being gradually rolled out to all users over the coming weeks.

He has led many open source community efforts, including ManageIQ, » More about me Learn how you can contribute How Google created a new kind of open source program office Posted 06 Sep 2016 John Mark WalkerFeed 46up Image by :  opensource.com In my previous article, What is an open source program office? And why do you need one?, I introduced the idea of an open source program office (OSPO) and discussed what they do, why a company would want to create one, and how to optimize them. In that article I focused on technology vendors and for a good reason—they were the first to embrace open source program offices strategically. From IBM and Intel to Oracle and even Microsoft, open source program offices were all the rage at technology companies from 1999 through about 2005. At that time, open source program offices were a way for vendors to get a handle on this brave new open source world and coordinate activities through a centralized office. But the one company I held up as the definitive example, Google, was a harbinger of things to come. Google was not a software vendor, at least not in the purest sense. Google was a provider of Internet search services and advertising, as this was before they became known for their mobile platform and services. Google's ability to influence the direction of open source software development brought to mind one of the core tenets of open source development: Everyone has a seat at the table, and everyone can use it to exercise power. Google's foray into open source politics made one thing crystal clear—software production was no longer controlled by software vendors. Since then, one commercial user after another made inroads into software development, in many cases wielding far more power than so-called software creators. Since Google demonstrated that software development was an avenue to increasing industry influence, we've seen many other companies expand into the open source program world, including Yahoo!, Facebook, Twitter, PayPal, Netflix, GitHub, and scores of others. What do all of these companies have in common? None of them are known for creating software for general consumption—at least, they weren't before. Sure, many of them are technology companies, but they were known for delivering services, not software for outside users. Since this rising tide first surfaced, how much influence these companies have on the software industry has dramatically increased, to the point in which many of their engineers and executives are the first to be listed as headline speakers and keynote speakers at technology conferences. The Google example Although many companies have created OSPOs and wield influence over open source communities and ecosystems, Google stands out for its open source efforts. Perhaps this is because all the other OSPOs feel very ... utilitarian in comparison. This is not necessarily bad, but what differentiates Google from other organizations, aside from being the first to embrace the OSPO approach, is that Google embraces the mission of spreading free software to the world. And no it's not altruistic, because the company garners acclaim and accolades for the greater glory of the Googleplex, but I've known many of Google's OSPO staffers through the years, and there's one thing I've never heard them say: "I'm an open source pragmatist." I've heard lots of other people at the other OSPOs say those exact words, often with a sense of pride. Google's open source program office staffers aren't just enthusiastic about making Google software better—they seem enthusiastic about changing the world through open source. How does Google benefit by embracing a mission that goes beyond wielding industry influence? The benefits are not easy to calculate, but there are metrics that are objective, such as perceived influence compared to actual engineering contributions. Google may not contribute the most code and, before Kubernetes, its open source projects were either small efforts or tightly constrained and not very open (e.g., Chrome, Android), but it carries great (one might say outsized) influence in open source developer circles, which gave it a great platform to launch Kubernetes and increase its chances of success. But Google did things like create Google Code, which at one time was a massive repository of the world's open source code, and it created the Summer of Code. Although neither of these initiatives involved massive code contributions by Google, they enabled developers around the world to collaborate and write more code. To date, no other company—vendor, user, or otherwise—has embraced this mission to the same degree as Google. Although this is great for Google, one wonders when some other enterprising company will invest in a similar vision. I suspect that the bottom line is risk: Why associate with an initiative not tightly coupled with a company's business objectives? After all, Facebook's business is not to build open source communities; its business is advertising. Someone looking at the books at Facebook would conclude that investing money in growing the world's open source ecosystems is simply not in keeping with the goals of a publicly traded company. However, the counterpoint is that Google also is, at its core, an advertising company, and is able to leverage its open source efforts into real business advantages. There also could be a sense of "been there, done that." At the time that Google started its OSPO, how much of the world would end up running on open source software wasn't clear yet. These days, open source quickly is taking over the software world, to the point in which all major areas of software innovation are happening on open source platforms. Perhaps these companies don't see the need to embrace a larger mission, when that very mission seems quite capable of sustaining itself. In their thinking, the hard work of establishing open source as a viable methodology for creating the world's best software has already been done. Why put time and money into something that doesn't need a boost? I would counter that there is still much to be done, especially for end-user facing software and platforms. Furthermore, expanding the open source mission to under-represented communities would lead to great gains for both the technology world and those communities. The benefits for those who solve that problem are immense—who's going to expand their OSPO to take it on? The point is, if a core factor in Google's uniqueness and success is its embrace of a problem space that's larger than simply its immediate business objectives, isn't there something to learn from that? Technology vendors vs. other companies Now that I've covered why an organization such as Google would create an open source program office, let's consider tech company efforts. As I mentioned, software companies and other companies that don't sell or support software as a primary business have different objectives and challenges to creating an OSPO. Whereas a primary software-development goal for organizations is to create better solutions for internal use, software development vendors often will see open source initiatives as a better way to distribute software products to the far reaches of the globe. This could also explain why some software development vendors have fallen behind when it comes to open source participation and influence—the fear of losing software (or software support) sales outweighs what they think they would gain by participating more aggressively in open source ecosystems. This could be described as extreme risk-aversion from technology vendors. After all, if they're making high-margin money from the sales of software products and services, why risk that just to influence open source ecosystems? After all, it's easy for companies that don't sell software to decide that they want to collaborate more deeply with open source ecosystems, and the subtext of that participation is one of avoiding vendors, so why would vendors help them along? The reason is because the market for old-fashioned vendor-supplied software deployed on premises is shrinking by the day. As you probably know, it's an open source world now, and a company's success can be directly tied to how much they participate in these ecosystems. So companies that get this continue to grow and expand whereas others, not so much. In this context, I have to wonder why a technology vendor in 2016 would not decide that strong investment into open source technologies is the right way forward. In fact, think back to the late 1990s and early 2000s and IBM's news splash around their $1-billion investment in Linux, with their "Peace, Love, and Linux" marketing campaign. Vendors must see themselves as between a rock and a hard place—investing in open source carries the risk of aiding other companies and losing potential sales, whereas not investing in open source carries the risk of being bypassed entirely by the technology world. In the end, however, technology vendors have no choice—collaborate or die. They can willfully disregard trends as long as they want, but ultimately it's to their detriment. They would do well to borrow a few pages from Google and other TODO Group participants and take a holistic approach to open source ecosystems: Which ones are of strategic importance, and how can participation help go to market more quickly with new products and services? And for an extra dash of magic, Google has shown that embracing a mission outside of a company's primary product focus yields results as well. But hey, one step at a time.

SUBSCRIBE Local SEO in 2017 and beyond: managed strategy vs. automation There are many great software options for automating local search tasks, but columnist Andrew Beckman argues that a human-managed approach may still be necessary to see results. Andrew Beckman on September 6, 2016 at 9:25 am More Over the past five-plus years, the digital marketing world has seen an influx of Local Search SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) platforms emerge with different value propositions for brands with physical store locations. Generally speaking, these platforms allow companies to store business location data (Name, Address, Phone Number) in one central location, and then subsequently push that information out to various channels. While SaaS platforms allow digital marketers to manage local business listings on social media and search engine channels, brands themselves are actually expecting greater visibility in organic search results in the process, which does not always occur.  Brand marketers are also realizing that using a SaaS platform requires that they must also budget the human resources to not only manage the platform on a day-to-day basis, but to also consider the various other organic ranking attributes that are needed for a successful SEO program. While SaaS platforms are often presented as turnkey solutions that operate automatically with need for little else, the aforementioned internal resource expenses still need to be factored into an overall ROI in addition to the general SaaS subscriptions and fees. While automation has some benefits, there are still many aspects of local SEO that need to be both monitored and managed by real human beings on an ongoing basis. These include: Analysis of where individual business listings are appearing in Google, Bing, Apple, etc. Data accuracy and ranking position. Percentage of visible business listings for key search terms and phrases (mobile and desktop). Content management and optimization for better user experience and SEO performance. Analytics tracking, measurement and analysis to better inform key strategy adjustments. Which channels are actually contributing to conversions. While SaaS platforms can help streamline portions of your local SEO strategy to be more effective, a managed service approach that utilizes both technology and actual digital marketing experts can provide even greater dividends. Let’s break down the benefits of each approach and highlight some differences as well: Using SaaS platforms for SEO A large number of SaaS platforms allow brand marketers to centralize, authenticate and distribute business data and information across directories and networks. The syndication of data goes directly to various search engines, social media networks and other directories, which helps brands scale location data in order to rank organically. It’s important to note that many SaaS platforms have revenue sharing agreements in place, and as a result provide paid inclusion programs that help update your listings faster and with additional enhanced content fields (for a price). However, paid inclusion programs can only be leveraged to improve ranking in local business directories, such as Yelp, 411.com, Local.com, etc. Major search engines and organizations like Google, Bing, and Apple do not allow these types of paid programs to influence organic ranking. Here are some benefits to using a SaaS platform: Ensuring business listings are updated with appropriate content. Social content publishing. Citation distribution to hundreds of directories. Pin verification (giving you the exact latitude and longitude of a location). Citation analysis (making sure NAP is relevant on all directory locations). Compiling reviews from various sources. In addition to pushing data to channels directly, you also have the ability to use database aggregators to distribute the location data to numerous directories that assist with citation building.  The main companies who have a list of channels they push data to include Factual, Acxiom, Infogroup and Neustar. At the end of the day, SaaS helps automate aspects of your local SEO campaign, but automation can only take you so far. Managed services + technology platforms (the agency model) Technology obviously makes digital marketing much easier in many ways, but managing a proper local business listing and local SEO program requires actual human resources to dig into the data, channels, performance and strategy in order to better optimize for improved ROI. Web analytics, Google Search Console and paid search data must truly be analyzed and interpreted in order for the right actions to be taken. Content needs to be created, distributed and optimized. Citations must be routinely monitored. Backlinks pointing to the primary brand domain must not only be in place, but continually evaluated for authority and ranking value. After the Google Venice and Google Pigeon algorithm updates, there has been an ongoing integration of traditional organic ranking factors into local search results. It is wise to expect there will be more changes coming as the local search ecosystem continually evolves; and since Google has a significant investment in crawling and ranking the web, brands can be better prepared for those changes by focusing more on what lies at the heart of SEO: site structure, content, and links. Although some of the automation platforms available on the market today can provide for a centralized repository for your brand data, it’s what happens to that data after you have it centralized that is the most important element to your local listings strategy. No automation technology or SaaS platform by itself can tackle the primary SEO elements that actually impact ranking — it’s simply not possible. Brands need to employ a comprehensive strategy that includes: High-touch strategic analysis and execution for increasing exposure of your local assets and for assessing an ROI relative to a successful local listing management program. Constant analysis of paid search performance data through web analytics, thus providing actionable analysis for an agency to make the beneficial changes. Site structure, content and link analysis are the pillars of SEO and need to be managed and evaluated on an ongoing basis to maximize organic traffic opportunities. As local listing management becomes more complex, the need for organic optimization is becoming even more important than ever for achieving higher rankings. Having a SaaS platform run your program ultimately becomes a challenge; other SEO factors are playing a part in impacting higher rankings, and by only using software, you’re essentially leveraging a single arrow out of the entire quiver of that is a comprehensive local SEO strategy. Having actual human beings constantly managing the complexities of a sound local SEO strategy is always going to be much more effective in the long-term approach that is inherent to SEO itself, and simply checking a box by deploying SaaS tools is no longer going to pass as having a strong SEO strategy. While a SaaS platform gives you the ability to make some updates to your local listings, you still need to apply human resources that are responsible for actually getting involved in the day-to-day activity of optimizing the program in order to ensure the best possible organic ranking. Furthermore, someone needs to be held accountable for performance and analysis, and SaaS platforms aren’t in a position to provide those details — their responsibility and accountability often ends at execution of the campaign. Summary In conclusion, the fact remains that legitimate SEO strategies cannot be automated, and taking shortcuts by using nothing more than automated tools will result in less-than-satisfactory performance. Furthermore, when you discontinue using a SaaS platform, your organic ranking authority diminishes because rich listing content like local images often get removed, while NAP info becomes increasingly vulnerable to changes (or lack thereof). We’ll leave you with this analogy to clarify it even further: a SaaS platform is like a rented apartment, whereas a managed approach to SEO is like owning a mortgage on a home. At the end of the day, the apartment may be satisfactory, but you don’t actually own the equity you’ve worked so hard to build up. When you take a strategic, hands-on approach that requires human beings doing the real work, the dividends pay off in both the short term and the long term. Brands should no longer be satisfied with minimal short term lift provided by SaaS platforms, but instead should be demanding tangible, long-term performance and results that can only be provided by implementing a managed approach to SEO.

Notable mobile leakster Evan Blass tweeted that a 7-inch Google tablet made by Huawei with a 7-inch display and carrying a sizable 4GB of RAM will likely see the light of day before the end of the year. Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 Rumours sourced from Android Police and Droid Life have the two Pixel smartphones launching October 4th along with Google’s Daydream VR headset and the new Chromecast. It’s possible that the tech giant might also debut this purported Huawei tablet at the same event, however the phrasing of Blass’ tweet brings that theory into question. The tablet would follow Google’s two previous offerings of less than runaway success, the Nexus 9 and Pixel C. Related: Google’s Pixel smartphones will reportedly launch running Android 7.1 SourceTwitter ViaThe Verge jar jar Do people still want 7 inch tablets? Jeff Thibert kids Rev0lver Actually, their parents. And they want a tablet that isn’t crap and doesn’t cost as much as an iPad mini. It has to keep them busy and be good enough for mom or dad to use in a pinch. Raj Singh I have a Surface Pro, a couple iPads and a Sony Z3 Tablet, all awesome devices. I can appreciate a smaller tablet and will likely get this, too, if I like the way it looks and performs. Simple answer: Yes. ExcessDan yeah, phones are close to or at 6″ at this point. A tablet only an inch bigger isn’t useful to me. I might as well save 300-500 bucks and just use my 6P instead. JPfromtheeast The 7/8″ market is still well and plenty alive. Most people in the more normal world want a smaller 5″ device as their phone and something larger for heavy medial consumption or browsing when they are in a wifi area. They don’t want to cut into the battery time on their phone as it is a device used for communication/navigation and the tablet going dead is only a minor issue. Also, as noted lower, KIDS. If the price is right, as in same as the last N7, and the performance is stellar, then this thing will be a hit! Andrew_notPorC I love and still use my 2013 Nexus 7. It’s way more portable than a 10″ 4:3 tablet, and much easier to use one handed. JD The question is will be as good as the Nexus 9? *Cough* F’ing terrble *Cough* Or LIke the Nexus 7FHD? Not great but at least the price was right. Mo Dabbas yeah, the nexus 9 is disappointing when it comes to performance. JD Don’t forget the amazing-ly bad build quality. David Foggia F*ck yes. Need to replace my n7 2013 Pedro How about a Nexus 8… need a bigger screen but keep the price down Omar “Notable mobile leakster Evan Blass tweeted that a 7-inch Google tablet made by Huawei with a 7-inch display…” Will it be bezel-less? Lol. In all seriousness though, with the norm of flagship (and some midrange) phones being 5.5-inches, and phablets nearing the 6-inch mark… Why would you buy a 7-inch tablet on top of those devices? For an extra 1.5-inches of screen space? Mo Dabbas To be honest I suspect that to happen. A while back one of Huawei execs said they’ll bring the nexus back again. With HTC taking on the smartphone nexuses, it was a thought that Huawei would go for a tablet. I only hope it’s a bigger tablet. 7 Inch is almost as big as my phone.

SUBSCRIBE Is Google filtering your business in the local search results? Seeing a shift in Google's local results? It's not just you. Columnist Joy Hawkins documents what appears to be a recent refresh to Google's local ranking filter. Joy Hawkins on September 6, 2016 at 9:49 am More It seems very apparent that Google has a filter for local that weeds through all the listings that should appear in the 3-pack on Google and in the Local Finder (when you click “More Places”), then filters some based on their spam score. Bill Slawski wrote about this in July and referenced the patent that was granted June 21, 2016, about it. To quote the patent: A spam score is assigned to a business listing when the listing is received at a search entity. A noise function is added to the spam score such that the spam score is varied. In the event that the spam score is greater than a first threshold, the listing is identified as fraudulent and the listing is not included in (or is removed from) the group of searchable business listings. I started seeing more of this filter back in July of this year when people started reporting that the local search results were shrinking and eliminating a lot of businesses that were previously visible. The screenshot below helps show the difference that the filter makes. Before July 2016, there were several businesses that were included in the list that were eliminated in July. Then on September 1, the results completely changed again, and many of the previously filtered listings are now included. Some observations that I’ve made about the filter so far are: The filter doesn’t run in real time. We saw an update some time at the beginning of July that shrunk a lot of the local results. Since then, the results didn’t update whatsoever — until September 1. No new businesses were included and none from the existing list were eliminated for a period of two months. This leads me to believe that Google reruns this filter in cycles (which could be weeks or months). The filter is impacting some industries way more than others. In certain industries, it almost appears like the filter doesn’t exist (or the criteria aren’t very strong), whereas in other industries there are more listings getting filtered than making the cut. To look at one of the more extreme cases, I wanted to highlight some observations about the below SERP for “locksmith boulder” which, as of July, only showed four businesses in the Local Finder. I’m seeing the filter hitting the locksmith industry harder than any other due to the amount of fake listings that exist. Scott Barnett co-founded an online business directory called Bizyhood and, when he analyzed the locksmith listings in his directory, he found around 80% of them were fake. What factors does Google filter based on? Age of listing I believe the age of the Google Maps listing is currently one of the strongest ranking factors for the 3-pack. When comparing the listings that made the cut vs. the businesses that didn’t, there was definitely a pattern here. I’ve historically found that old listings carry a ton of ranking power; in fact, they are often the target for spammers who like to hijack listings precisely because they are so strong. Here are a few observations from the “locksmith boulder” set above: City Lock’s listing has reviews on it that are from six years ago. Buffalo Security’s listing has been around since 2011. One of the listings that is filtered only has reviews dating back six months, so it looks like a fairly new listing. Similarly, this listing (which also didn’t make it into the list of four) has only been around since February 2016. Organic ranking I don’t believe it’s any coincidence that all four of the locksmith listings ranking in the Boulder 3-pack have organic rankings in the top 10 as well. Spammers on Google Maps have historically created fake listings without a strong organic presence, so it would make sense that Google is using this as an indicator. When I looked at one of the businesses that didn’t make the cut, they ranked #91 for “locksmith boulder” organically. One of the others wasn’t even in the top 100. Duplicate listings In Slawski’s article, he notes that the patent mentions that businesses employ methods to include multiple listings for the same business, so this is something Google looks at when evaluating the spam filter. For one of the locksmiths that didn’t make the initial cut in July, the address they are using is a plaza, so there are dozens of other listings at the same address. Coincidentally, the address they use also has a UPS Store in the same plaza. Additionally, the suite # formatting on the other businesses in this plaza all follow the same pattern (E104, D102, A111 etc) yet Boulder Lock and Key (pin “F” in the image above) just lists its suite as “#3.” That could be enough to make Google suspicious of the listing and filter it initially. When the results got refreshed on September 1, this particular business was now included in the list.  This might make sense since the listing has now been around longer than when the July update occurred. Keep in mind that when we look for duplicates, we might only see a fraction of what Google does. They can also see removed listings that were created and then removed for various reasons. In another case in a nearby town, one of the filtered businesses had previously had a listing verified for a parking lot using the same phone number (another typical pattern for spammers). Spam filter vs. suspensions It’s important to note that this filter is completely different than listing suspensions. Listings get suspended for different reasons and in industries with a high percentage of spam, businesses can have their listing suspended for making a small change in the dashboard that triggered something. In the last few months, I’ve seen one locksmith get suspended after hiding her address (to keep her listing within the guidelines) and another that got suspended right after he changed his description (before Google removed it). Earlier this year, I wrote about what gets listings suspended and what you need to know about them. As further evidence that suspensions and this filter run independently, it’s important to note that one of these four listings in Boulder was suspended three times in 2015 according to the history on the listing. Listings sometimes get removed by active mappers on Google but every one of these suspensions was Google that removed the listing. Regardless of being suspended that many times, it still ranked high and made the cut whereas several other listings did not. Suspensions also often use manual processes to reinstate listings that were suspended wrongly. Things like business licenses and photos will help a business get reinstated (by proving they are a real business) whereas I don’t see either of those two things being used for this filter. One of the four listings didn’t even have a business license in Colorado under the name that they used. Remember that the filter keeps these listings from appearing in specific search results for their industry whereas suspensions either remove the listing entirely from Google or Google Maps (along with all reviews/photos attached) or un-verifies it, depending on which type of suspension it was. Factors that don’t appear to contribute Business name The business name is one of the most misused fields on Google My Business in the sense that Google has very strict guidelines around how you should list yourself, yet businesses constantly add descriptors and keywords and get away with it because Google doesn’t appear to have a good method to automatically enforce these guidelines. Business names get altered/adjusted when someone reports them or edits them via Google Maps or MapMaker. I have seen little evidence that Google does this on their own whatsoever. For this set of listings, the #2 business has very clear violations in their business title yet is not getting filtered. Everything that comes after “City Lock” would be considered descriptors and are “not allowed.” In summary, Google still has a long way to go to get rid of all the spam that exists but hopefully in the meantime users will continue to report fake listings to help level the playing field for those who are actually trying to abide by the rules. It’s also possible that the update we saw on September 1 was actually an algo tweak, not just a refresh. I can look at the patterns and analyze things, but ultimately the only ones that really know how the algorithm works are Google staffers themselves!

Google is hoping that its next version, Android N, will finally make network administrators as comfortable with Android devices as those of its rivals. This tip will explore some of the Android N security changes, how they will affect enterprise users and if there are areas that Google still needs to address with mobile security. The biggest problem affecting Android device security is the distribution and installation of updates. Millions of devices are still running KitKat 4.4 or older versions, leaving them vulnerable to attack. There are two reasons why so many users don't have the latest updates: firstly, many ignore update notifications, and secondly, Google is reliant on OEMs and carriers to push out the updates Google releases to its users. Google is hoping that seamless updates in Android N will at least solve the first. Google's Chrome OS already benefits from seamless updates and Android N will update in a similar fashion by using two separate system partitions: one for the old system image and one for the updated image. The OS will automatically download system updates in the background and switch to the new version on the next device reboot. Security always works best when it's simple and unobtrusive; seamless updates means no user interaction is needed to install a patch or system update, other than rebooting the device. While seamless updates are as much a user experience enhancement as a security upgrade, the redesign of the Mediaserver component delivers a real improvement in Android device security. Android N has divided Mediaserver and its permissions into multiple sandboxed components to better adhere to the security principle of least privilege. Android N uses a Linux kernel security feature called seccomp to sandbox apps such as Chrome and the Mediaserver, and developers can also use it to better protect the system against compromises in their own apps. This change is aimed at preventing future vulnerabilities from having such a wide impact as Stagefright. The Stagefright vulnerability leveraged the access media files have to the Android system to take over an Android device. Not only does seccomp limit a vulnerability to a single component rather than the entire device, but independently updatable components can also be patched a lot faster outside of a full system update. This is a similar move to when Google split off the WebView component from the main operating system. The other big change in Android N that highlights the never-ending tradeoff between security and convenience is encryption. Until now, Android has used block-level encryption or block-layer full-disk encryption to encrypt the entire device storage. While a secure method of encryption, it can have a notable impact on performance; many OEMs disable encryption, sacrificing Android device security for speed. To allow companies to make budget-priced Androids that offer encryption without performance degradation, Android N has moved to file-level encryption for Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data. AEAD along with a Direct Boot feature introduces a two-level security scheme: device encryption and credentials encryption. Android N Security Changes -          Seamless updates -          Multiple sandbox components -          File-level encryption for AEAD Encrypted data and apps storage explained Security teams and in-house app developers need to understand how data and apps are encrypted in both types of storage. Device encrypted storage is encrypted with a key tied to the device, stored in TrustZone hardware widely available as part of Android device security. The key only becomes available after a device has performed a successful verified boot. To reduce downtime, Android N runs in Direct Boot mode when the device is powered on, but not yet unlocked by the user. Apps and data in device encrypted storage are accessible in Direct Boot mode before the user has unlocked the device. This is so apps like SMS, phone and alarms will be able to run in the background to show notifications or other information before the user unlocks the device after a reboot -- the lack of this functionality is a genuine reason why some users delay installing updates. Data and apps in credential encrypted storage, the default storage location, can't be accessed until the device is unlocked, as it is encrypted with a key associated with the user's credentials, such as his PIN or password. Note that if the user enables the lock screen after unlocking the device, it doesn't lock the credential encrypted storage. Developers should restrict the functionality of an app running in Direct Boot mode until the user has authenticated himself, and personal and sensitive data should be placed in credential encrypted storage. Although file-level encryption is less processor intensive, the downside is that some areas of the file system, like the swap partition, could include unencrypted data. It also means that users are reliant on each app correctly implementing encryption of any sensitive data the app uses or generates. In Android N there are new keystore-related APIs, which will be able to verify whether keys are stored in secure hardware or not, and to specify for how long the key can be used after the user authenticated to the app. Developers should also make use of the SafetyNet Attest API to check device compatibility, integrity and safety. For example, enterprise apps could disable applications from working on devices that haven't been updated. Android device security keeps improving with each OS version, and isolating and deprivileging components will reduce the number of bugs that can turn into dangerous vulnerabilities. Silent and seamless updates will reduce IT management overhead, but even Google admits that the update process is Android's Achilles heel. Google has tried to pressure OEMs into committing to monthly updates, but with little success. Network operators also need to test updates to ensure they don't cause network disruption, adding further delays. Until the millions of legacy Android devices are updated, the Android ecosystem will be a favorite target for hackers, so enterprises need to assess which versions of Android they are happy to have connect to their network and access its resources. For example, even devices that can upgrade to Android N will not have the Direct Boot feature because it's too risky for end users to create the dual-system partitions it requires. Those enterprises wanting to take advantage of Android N may well have to incentivize employees into upgrading to newer, higher-end devices, capable of benefiting from its latest security enhancements.

The company somewhat quietly updated their popular Google Maps service with a new selection option in the Timeline selector, as noticed by Reddit user GoldLeader272 (via Android Police). In addition to running, cycling, driving, and the like, you can now select Catching Pokemon. It doesn't actually help you catch that hard to snag Eevee, but at least your friends will know you tried. Plus, if you ever score that elusive professional Pokemon trainer position, this would essentially let you keep track of your mileage, providing a step by step account of your whereabouts throughout the day. Those jobs are hard to come by, but hey, you never know. It was also recently announced that the game will be receiving the much appreciated Buddy Pokemon mechanic. You will now be able to have your favorite Pokemon walk alongside you, which will net you those oh so precious candies as you and Snorlax walk from place to place. There will be additional rewards as well, but those have not been released yet. Pokemon GO has amassed an impressive sum and has generated $440 million, which is suitably more than a few would-be blockbusters have managed to take in this summer. Movies like Ghostbusters and Independence Day Resurgence have nothing on Pikachu and company.

Sarah Drinkwater, head of the Google Campus, and pioneering YouTuber Myles Dyer were today announced among the speakers at the 2016 event. They are joined by 'nerdcore' comedian James Veitch - who engaged with email scammers claiming to be Nigerian royalty and used the exchanges for a successful stand-up show.

Perennial product leaker Evan Blass claims that a new Google tablet is on the way. Huawei will apparently be building a 7-inch tablet for Google, making the device a follow-up to the Nexus 7. Blass says the device is due out before the end of the year. Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 Huawei-built "Nexus 7" rumors have been floating around for some time. Last year, TechTimes reported on a Huawei-made Nexus 7 that would launch in 2016, but the site's suggested launch time of "Google I/O" didn't pan out. Blass' comments are definitely the most reliable source of Nexus 7 rumors we've seen yet. Of course "Nexus" probably won't be the name of this device. Google is undergoing the Great Hardware Unification of 2016, and according to a report from Android Police, the Nexus line is going away to make way for a unified "Pixel" line. The two upcoming Google phones are reportedly going to be branded "Pixel" and "Pixel XL." If that report holds true, this device would probably be branded a "Pixel," too. We last saw a 7-inch Google tablet in 2013, when the Nexus 7 was released as a follow-up to the original 2012 version. Both of these were built by Asus and were well-received thanks to their novel (at the time) 7-inch widescreen form factor and low price (~$230). Google's tablets since then have all trended toward "big, square, and expensive," with the $499 Pixel C having a 10.2-inch display with a 1:1.41 aspect ratio, while the earlier Nexus 9 was a $399, 8.9-inch, 4:3 device. Rumors point to Google having a big launch party on October 4, where it's expected to launch the new Pixel phones, a new Chromecast, and its Daydream VR initiative. Maybe throw in a tablet, too?

The company has previously revealed plans for its cars to be able to  predict what drivers are going to do next, as well as drive slowly around children. Now, according to a patent filed by Google, the firm is working on a way to allow its smart cars to get out of the way of police and other emergency vehicles. Google has filed a patent that will allow its smart cars to get out of the way of police and other emergency vehicles. The patent (diagram pictured) will use filters to detect the red and blue flashing lights used by emergency servies HOW WILL IT WORK? The technology will use filters to detect the red and blue flashing lights used by emergency services. Software will also determine whether the lights are flashing or not, and will be able to identify which form of vehicle is approaching by noting the spacing of the lights. The car will then move out of the way of the emergency vehicle. In doing so, it will make sure it does not create an accident by driving itself into a tree or off a bridge, for example. 'A system and method is provided for detecting and responding to emergency vehicles,' the patent application says. 'In one aspect, one or more computing devices may identify a set of light sources from an image based at least in part on one or more templates, and may filter the set of light sources in order to identify one or more light sources corresponding to a potential emergency vehicle.' The technology uses filters to detect the red and blue flashing lights used by emergency services. Software will also determine whether the lights are flashing or not, and will be able to identify which form of vehicle is approaching by noting the spacing of the lights. However, as with the raft of patents granted to Google, it is unclear if the technology will come to fruition at this stage.

The technology would enable driverless cars to anticipate the movements of cars on the road ahead using a forward facing camera. Onboard computers would then check for changes in brightness of the lights and work out whether a driver has turned on their indicators. Algorithms will identify pixels in the images, analyse the colours and work out if they are pulsing.  If they are, it then determines how likely it is that the driver has an indicator switched on and feeds back the information to its central system. The car will then move out of the way of the emergency vehicle. In doing so, it will make sure it does not create an accident by driving itself into a tree or off a bridge, for example. 'Autonomous vehicles may...use the cameras, sensors, and global positioning devices to gather and interpret images and sensor data about its surrounding environment, for example, oncoming vehicles, parked cars, trees, buildings' the patent says. Google has been working on its smart vehicle since 2009, with testing being carried out on the roads around its Mountain View headquarters in California. Google says the technology will help reduce delays for the emergency service and cut down on the possible risk of crashes involving its own cars. A study last year found self-driving cars are far more accident-prone than ordinary cars, a new study has claimed. Researchers found self-driving vehicles had 9.1 crashes, compared to just 1.9 for those with a human operator. However, the report found that none of the accidents were the fault of the self driving car. Self-driving cars were also rear-ended 50 per cent more often than traditional vehicles, it found. However, the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute concluded 'self-driving vehicles were not at fault in any crashes they were involved in.' The technology will determine whether the lights are flashing or not, and will be able to identify which form of vehicle is approaching by noting the spacing of the lights, The car will then move out of the way of the emergency vehicle   Read more: United States Patent Application: 0160252905 Share or comment on this article e-mail 17 shares Most watched News videos Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Victoria Fritz hides her baby bump moments before giving birth Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes? 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Shocking moment Kumbuka tries to smash glass at London Zoo President-elect Trump and family dine out at famous 21 Club Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Cops shoot man holding 2-year-old girl hostage Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Little girl leaps to her sister's defense during scolding EXCLUSIVE: Blow up!

Google continues to be one of the most desirable place to work around the world. Crowdsource enables enthusiasts to help Google improve clunky language translation, handwriting recognition (used in its mobile keyboard) and the specificity of the Maps app. Interestingly, the app is not driven by a rewards system; rather it is driven by the desire to “make the internet a better place for your community.” Reading through the app comments and reviews, it becomes obvious that while some people are asking for the app to connect to Google’s Opinion Rewards, others recognize that Google already provides free services and this is a genuine way of returning the favor.

Ford Motor Co. announced that it would put fully driverless vehicles, without steering wheels or pedals, on the road by 2021. Uber said it would start offering autonomous rides in Pittsburgh -- with an Uber employee at the wheel, just in case -- by the end of summer. A new revolution in personal transportation is at hand. "The world is changing," said Hans-Werner Kaas, senior partner at McKinsey & Co.'s global automotive practice. "In the next few years, there will be a significant injection of technology" in new cars. Newcomers like Google, Apple and Uber want into the game, and "the incumbents of the past are trying to change as much as they can," Kaas said. To compete, automakers are entering into partnerships with ride-hailing services and buying technology companies. All the major car companies have set up research labs in Silicon Valley, where they're trying to lure scarce talent and expand their operations. There's good reason. A recent McKinsey study found that new revenue from on-demand mobile services, data-driven services and autonomous driving could add up to more than $1.5 trillion a year industrywide by 2030 -- on top of an estimated $5.2 trillion in traditional car sales and aftermarket products and services. The revolution is being driven by technology, economics and social requirements. Sensors have gotten small enough and cheap enough to be mounted on cars without adding so much cost that people won't buy them. Artificial intelligence has advanced enough to make the sensors' data intelligible. Crowded highways have made driving miserable in urban areas. And consumers have always worried about safety. The companies pushing driverless cars insist they will be safer, and federal transportation officials agree. New regulations are expected soon from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the agency's administrator has said that the rules are being written so as not to hinder innovation. The safety issue was put into question after a fatal crash of a Tesla in Autopilot mode in May. The company said safety statistics are on its side, but any major mishap involving driverless cars is bound to draw media scrutiny. Meantime, the automobile industry is moving ahead, not wanting to be left behind while the transportation industry undergoes a historic transformation. Here is what some of the companies are doing: GOOGLE/FIAT CHRYSLER Google's autonomous vehicle program has 21 modified Lexus SUVs and 33 pod-like small cars that can drive themselves. In May, Google announced a deal with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to more than double the size of its fleet by adding 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans. For now, Google's cars operate only under the oversight of company experts. Google is unlikely to manufacture its own cars for the mass market. FORD Ford announced plans earlier this month to make fully autonomous cars available for sale by 2021. The cars would have no steering wheels or pedals. At first they'll be used for ride hailing and ride sharing, with sales to individual drivers an indeterminate number of years after that. Ford Motor Co. has made a $75 million investment in Velodyne LiDar Inc., a Northern California company that specializes in lidar, a technology that uses light to detect objects. UBER/VOLVO San Francisco-based Uber will enable customers in Pittsburgh to summon rides from autonomous Volvo XC90s and Ford Focuses by the end of the summer. For now, the cars will have an Uber employee in the driver's seat just in case. But Uber intends to eventually render human drivers unnecessary. The world's largest ride-hailing company has also reached a $300 million deal with Volvo to co-develop additional autonomous vehicles. BMW In July, BMW announced plans to release a fleet of fully autonomous vehicles by 2021 in a partnership with Intel and Israeli tech firm Mobileye. BMW has signaled ambitions to develop a range of autonomous vehicles with different levels of human and machine control. It has received permission from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test driverless cars. GENERAL MOTORS/LYFT This year, GM bought an autonomous car startup, Cruise Automation, and announced it would work with Lyft to develop driverless taxis. General Motors announced a $500 million investment in Lyft in January. The two companies announced plans to build an Autonomous On-Demand Network that will leverage GM's autonomous vehicle development and Lyft's ride-matching, routing and payment software. TESLA Tesla has been rolling out self-driving technology to consumers more aggressively than anyone. In 2015, the electric car company activated its Autopilot mode, which automates steering, braking and lane switching but requires the driver to remain attentive and keep his or her hands on the wheel. The software on Tesla vehicles, including Autopilot code, is regularly updated over the airwaves.       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/16/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Montgomery County OFA receives $359K in state, federal funds Saturday, November 12, 2016 State police to focus on 'Move Over' law through Friday Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Mohawk reviews scope of work for annexation Saturday, November 12, 2016 Neighborhood Watch learns to ID drug deals Tuesday, November 15, 2016 'SNL' alumna Kristen Wiig set as show's Nov. 19 guest host Sunday, November 13, 2016 'Waiting With the Veterans' is theme of Advent season at First Presbyterian Church Friday, November 11, 2016 State news in brief Friday, November 11, 2016 WWII vet shares memories Friday, November 11, 2016 3 arrested for prostitution in Amsterdam Monday, November 14, 2016 Mattice case adjourned for pre-plea investigation (2) Isabel faces Nelson for county legislature District 8 seat (1) Mead selected to replace Clayburn as county DPW head (1) Help bring great music to Riverlink Park (0) New exhibit marks anniversaries for Fort Stanwix (0) State News in Brief (0) Fifth graders learn the writing process (0) Kindergarten learns the power of reading (0) Learning to multiply with Tom the Turkey (0) Tecler students becomes World Record Readers (0) Facts and figures for the opening of deer hunting season (4) B-P considers joining forces to reduce its solar farm fee(4) DEC officers have been hard at work during deer season (2) LaPortes celebrate 60th anniversary (2) Taking part in an unforgettable deer hunt was an honor (2) Schools consider options for taxing solar farm projects(2) Amsterdam's Fedullo signs with Saint Rose(1) Joyce A.

(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Salt Lake City sees the beginnings of Google Fiber's scorching-fast gigabit service during a grand opening-type event at their offices in Trolley Square, referred to as Fiber Space, on Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2016. Fiber wars » Google, CenturyLink, Comcast work hard to attract a bigger slice of market. Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (6) With Google Fiber's glitzy launch in the heart of Salt Lake City, one might think the company was introducing high-speed internet access to Utah. Not so fast, say the state's other broadband providers. CenturyLink, Comcast's Xfinity and a host of smaller telecommunications firms have poured millions of dollars into Utah's capital in recent years, expanding how many homes and businesses they reach, increasing available speeds and, in some cases, installing backbone capacity alongside Google's newly enabled fiber-optic network. So, thanks to free enterprise — and smart moves at City Hall — most customers who want faster downloads now have a range of choices in addition to Google Fiber's gigabit deal. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "The good news in Utah is that we have a very competitive environment in the broadband space," said Kelleigh Cole, director of the Utah Broadband Outreach Center, part of the Governor's Office of Economic Development. The Beehive State, Cole said, "is becoming a key location for providers to invest in." Best known for its namesake online search engine, Mountain View, Calif.-based Google Fiber first expressed interest in Salt Lake City in early 2014. In courting Google, city officials streamlined and digitized much of their permitting process in ways that have helped other providers. "That added a lot of efficiencies," said Nole Walkingshaw, civic engagement manager with the city's Department of Community and Economic Development. "We're better at our job because we went through this, and that's where the others are getting an advantage." After a hectic 18-month buildout, Google unveiled high-speed access Aug. 24 for 112 blocks of the city, placing Utah's capital among nearly 25 U.S. hosts where its fiber is live, under construction or in the planning stages. Google is offering residents and small- to medium-size businesses up to gigabit-speed internet — with optional TV and phone packages. Its initial footprint stretches from 100 South to 800 South, between 400 West and 1300 East, with more neighborhoods expected to go live in the coming months. The company also has opened a customer center-turned-internet cafe, dubbed Fiber Space, in the Trolley Square shopping mall. A spokesman said Friday that initial customer demand "has been very strong and is exceeding our expectations." At Google Fiber's unveiling party, Scott Tenney, head of its operations in Utah, said that while the scorching speeds draw public attention, its pricing is also "transparent" — with no hidden fees, data caps, modem or router rentals or multiyear contracts. "We want to win your business," Tenney said. Not surprisingly, so do Google Fiber's competitors, who have also been busy these past few years. Telephone giant CenturyLink has spent about a half-billion dollars in Utah since 2011, widening its network to offer speeds of 100 megabits per second to more than 250,000 households from Logan to St. George, a company official said. It also has run fiber to nearly 100,000 homes, including portions of eastern Salt Lake City's Sugar House, allowing gigabit downloads at prices comparable to Google's. The Louisiana-based company has captured a robust share of Utah's business customers, who often require bandwidth well above gigabit speeds, said Jeremy Ferkin, CenturyLink's vice president for operations in Utah, Nevada and California. "We are not great at going out and telling a wonderful, whiz-bang story that involves a whole lot of pixie dust," Ferkin said. "But what we are great at is building a network that is stable, reliable and future-ready." » Next page...

Tour Pricing Blog Already a Stackfield user?Login Menu About Stackfield Insights Stories Product News Sign Up Login About Stackfield How we unnecessarily burned 20k with Facebook Ads To read this post in German click here Christopher Diesing Posted on September 6, 2016 0 Comments Tweet We are in the midst of 2014. The first months after the Beta-Phase had passed and our first major update brought many new features and a completely new design. Additionally and shortly before that, we had presented Stackfield at different trade fairs, such as CeBIT or Tools, which generated a very good response to our product. Encouraged by these events and successes, we took the decision that it was finally time for a large-scale advertising campaign. While offering a pure online tool, the choice fell naturally on online advertising, especially that we had previously conducted a small advertising campaign in the form of sending letters to agencies that proved unsuccessful – the road from the offline world to an online tool was simply too long and our mailing list was of such poor quality that a large part of the letters was returned. At that time, advertising on Facebook was still relatively new, but we anticipated a great potential here: whether a writer at a marketing agency, a managing director of an IT company or a lawyer at a major law firm – almost everyone had a Facebook account and could be reached through targeted campaigns. Compared to the alternatives, such as banner advertising, Direct Mailing, Google AdWords, etc. we were thus expecting a great success. The Implementation Getting started with Facebook-Marketing through the Facebook Ads editor is extremely easy, which is why we started to create ads right away without major detours. With this tool the upload of multiple images in order to test some Sets, the definition of different target groups and also the setting of geographical boundaries are straightforward. And so the first campaign was created quickly, but we soon realized that there were some problems: although we could see in Google Analytics how many new visitors came to our site from the campaign and how many registered, there was no possibility for long-term tracking. Additionally, it was quite clear that there was a vast amount of fake accounts on Facebook. The number of likes on our Facebook page grew disproportionately fast compared to the actual visits and registrations on Stackfield. The latter problem is considered a waste and unfortunately it must be accepted when using Facebook. We solved the first problem through a separate tool, which labels the user with the originating source when registering. This allowed us to continuously see which campaigns and sources were actually successful and which weren’t. The derived results were anything but pleasant. Let’s consider the period from 11.08.2014 to 11.11.2014 (Facebook’s Fanpage tracking cannot go back more in time, while Google Analytics cannot show more than 93 days …) as a reference: We spent exactly 18.428,99 € on 10 different campaigns, each with its own variations. Through them, we have reached 2.262.403 Facebook users. „Reach“, by Facebook’s definition, includes the users that have potentially noticed the ad (e.g. the ad was displayed) – no interaction with the ad is required. On the other hand, the ultimate goal of the users actually visiting our website was met exactly 31,600 times. This results in a CPC (Cost-Per-Click) of 0,58 €. Surprisingly, Google Analytics reported only 28.818 visits by users who were redirected from Facebook during this timeframe – i.e. 8,81 percent less. From these users, 3.786 registered on Stackfield. Up to this point, the results from Facebook-Marketing proved to be surprisingly good. Even more: these figures were considerably better than the ones obtained by any other marketing channel we were using. We had spent € 4.87 per new user. Back then, like today, this would have been a more than acceptable cost for a new user. As already mentioned, there were certain circumstances that spoiled the joy of these results. Our proprietary tool that tracked the source of our users, yielded a clear conclusion: the churn rate among Facebook users was enormous and at the opposite pole when compared to the other sources – and this at a time when the tool was still free to use. The Facebook users were relatively cheap and quick to acquire, remained for a short time and were soon gone – and nearly all of them. We considered various causes for this problem and tried to solve it through better targeting, more specifically by further optimizing our settings. Targeted ads for counselors or agencies, which increased fivefold the CPC while bringing the right people, did not alter in any way the previous results. Even these users churned after a short time. Why is that? We do not really know! Eventually, Facebook may just be the wrong audience for a B2B tool. Most people visit Facebook in their free time and are not actively looking for a tool like ours. And that seems to generate the different conversion rates: users who come from sources as Google or through referrals remain on Stackfield.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 16, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Guide to Google ranking signals – Part 1: on-page factors SEO 06 Sep 16 | Christopher Ratcliff Facebook0 Linkedin131 Google+34 Twitter 165 Today we begin a mammoth task in presenting to you a breakdown of every single ranking factor Google uses to determine where your site and its content appears in search results pages (SERPs). In fact it’s such a mammoth task, we’re dividing the signals into manageable, neatly categorised parts – which will eventually culminate in a gigantic, all-conquering dossier of every Google ranking signal. There are likely to be hundreds of signals, and we’ll never be 100% sure of everything that comes into play. Also the algorithm changes thousands of times a year, so this will be a constantly evolving document. But we will do our best to be as up-to-date and accurate as possible. Future instalments will specifically cover content, links, machine learning, site-wide factors, domain factors, mobile, speed, local, social… phew, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. First let’s look at the simple, technical elements Google uses to rank your page. On-page factors: 1 – 10 Title tag As I’ve already discussed in our guide to writing title tags, these are used to tell search engines and visitors what your webpage is about in the most concise and accurate way possible. According to Moz, title tags have “long been considered one of the most important on-page SEO elements.” Here’s what you need to know about how they affect your ranking… 1) You need to include any keywords you wish to rank for in the title tag. 2) The closer to the start of the title tag any given keyword is, the more likely it will be to rank for that keyword based query. Primary Keyword – Secondary Keyword | Brand Name 3) Your title tag needs to be written for humans – as in it needs to make logical sense, rather than a keyword stuffed mess. Your title tag will appear in a variety of places, from SERPs, to a social share, to the browser tab, so make sure it’s relevant and readable. 4) Do not duplicate your title tags across your website as this can adversely affect your visibility. Important elements that aren’t necessarily signals, but will affect click-through: Make sure your title tag is 50-60 characters long, including spaces. Anything longer and Google may cut you short. If nobody has heard of your brand or company name (and it’s not part of the important keyword phrases) put it at the end of the title tag. H1 tags The difference between a H1 tag and a title tag is simple: title-tags appear in search results and the H1 tag is what visitors see on the page. Your headline or webpage name will (in the majority of cases) form your H1 tag. Here’s what you should know about H1 tags: 5) Your target keywords should be in the H1 tag. 6) Your H1 however can be different from the title tag. It doesn’t have to be – you won’t be penalised for having the same title tag and h1 tag for a web-page (after all, most CMS generate this automatically) – but varying the keyword phrasing of both can increase your chances of appearing for different search intents. 7) Only use one H1 tag per-page. (Although this isn’t strictly true if you’re using HTML5 where you can use one H1 per section). 8) Break up the main body of your articles by using plenty H2 and H3 tags, but try to use them in a descending, logical order. 9) Your H2 and H3 tags should also contain relevant keywords too. Although you shouldn’t repeat yourself, there should still be words and phrases you wish to rank for.

Google has stated that meta descriptions are NOT a ranking signal. But, the quality of the description will influence click-through rate, so it is very important to use this element wisely… Make sure your most important keywords for the webpage show up in the meta description. Write legible, readable copy, and treat the meta description as if it’s an advert for your web-page A meta description should be no longer than 135 – 160 characters long. Do not duplicate meta descriptions. Next time we’ll look at even more on-page ranking signals. Other instalments in our Google ranking factor guide: Part 7: Site-level signals Part 6: trust signals, authority and expertise. Part 5: duplicate content and syndication. Part 4: content freshness. Part 3: quality content. Part 2: keyword relevancy, frequency and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI).

In short, the search Analytics report has not yet updated since August 31, 2016 and Google is aware of it. Google wrote "a system error began dropping all Search Analytics data after Aug 31. We hope to fix the problem soon and add back the missing data." Now, many are going to believe that the "update" line in the report has something to do with the September 2nd Google update but it is unrelated. The update line simple means there is a data but with the Google Search Console report and Google has a link that takes you to the specific issue. Again, the two are unrelated and also unfortunate, as many cannot currently tell if the Search Analytics report can show if they were hit in a good or bad way by this September 2nd update. Hopefully Google will be able to retrieve the old data and backfill it soon. Forum discussion at Google+.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 16, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports How a customer reviews strategy can impact SEO Events Local SEO 06 Sep 16 | Tereza Litsa Facebook0 Linkedin180 Google+33 Twitter 213 Chris Bullick, Managing Director & Head of Marketing Services for Pull Digital, delivered an interesting presentation at Brighton SEO last week about how reviews can affect purchasing decisions and what this means for SEO. When we discuss the idea of adding reviews to a brand’s strategy, here are the most persuasive stats to support the decision: 90% of consumers read reviews before visiting a business 31% of customers are likely to spend 31% more on a business with excellent reviews Reviews can boost your results by using fresh user-generated content 72% of consumers will take action only after reading a positive review “88% of consumers trust online reviews like personal recommendations” – on reviews and SEO #BrightonSEO — Search Engine Watch (@sewatch) September 2, 2016 Google’s ranking factors are changing all the time and there seems to be an increasing focus on content, uniqueness, device friendliness and social sharing. Thus, every new piece of content should be: Unique (appears nowhere else on the web) Relevant (contains content that engines can interpret as on-topic), Helpful (resolves the searcher’s query in a useful and efficient manner) Uniquely valuable (provides information that’s unavailable elsewhere) Offers great UX (is easy and pleasurable to consume on any device) Likely to spread (convincingly answers the question ‘who would amplify this content and why?’) It is estimated that review signals account for 9.8% of the total ranking factors, which means that they cannot be ignored during SEO, especially if a brand can benefit from their use. Six ways reviews can help SEO Creates fresh user-generated content Content is never enough and reviews make a great form of user-generated-content, coming directly from users – which is more influential for future customers. What’s more, it’s a great form of relevant content and they should always be encouraged. Boosts long-tail keyword traffic As reviewers are buyers of your products, the language they use is similar to the one your target audience will use. Thus, the consistent flow of reviews will help you target more traffic through the right keywords, coming directly from your own customers. Boosts social conversation What if a series of impressive reviews helps your product become popular, increasing both the social reach, but also the sales? How about incorporating reviews to your social strategy as a way to prove the love for your products. Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin180 Google+33 Twitter 213 Related articles Five tools to help you build a content-focused SEO campaign Nine mobile trends to help you stand out in 2017 and beyond Google’s mobile-first index: how to prepare your business Why local matters, even for national advertisers Google favours highly-rated sites Google takes into consideration the rating of sites, favouring those having the highest ratings. It’s your social proof and authority that reviews can boost, which means that it’s not just about adding reviews to your site, you should also to focus on how to improve them. Receive visible star ratings When star ratings are displayed in Google search results, prospective customers can instantly judge whether they can trust your product enough to visit your site. This helps increase the traffic, and possibly the sales, but it’s not always easy to achieve it. Google relies on specific third-party review sites to determine your star rating. You should have at least 30 unique reviews during the past year, with an average of 3.5 or higher. Star ratings may lead to an increased conversion rate of up to 17%, which is a great incentive to research more about them, along with Google’s guidelines on how to be eligible. Improve ranking for products As more people start searching for the reviews of your products, there will be more opportunities to rank higher in SERPS, increasing the chances of seeing more searches in the form of [product name] + review. This may serve as an additional opportunity to reach your potential audience in the most relevant way: right when they are searching for more details about your products. How to make the most of reviews According to Chris Bullick, here are the best ways to use reviews for your brand’s strategy: Have a strategy. You don’t want to leave your brand’s reputation to chance. Encourage reviews. There are many ways to encourage more reviews, whether it’s through the site, email campaigns, or social media. Keep asking for them, new reviews are always welcome. Track and improve your score. It’s not just about gaining new reviews, but also about improving your ratings to increase the conversion rate. A closer communication with customer service would help you understand what customers want from your products, trying to improve it, aiming for better reviews. Reward reviews. As you are seeking more reviews, a reward may be useful for your customers, but still, don’t try too much by providing too many rewards. Right time – right place.  Not every time and place is suitable when asking for reviews, especially when taking into consideration the purchase journey. Make sure you are targeting the right audience (customers) when asking for reviews, rather than a generic audience that may include one-time visitors.  Use rich snippets. Rich snippets on your product pages may help your reviews show up in search results, provided they include the right information for your products to help Google trace them. Reply to reviews. Reviews are still part of your communication with your customers, so even the worst review needs to be answered. Always apologise to a disappointed customer and be ready to help if possible. Keep calm and carry on. Set a tone that reflects your brand and stick to it. Keep in mind that the tone has to be polite and helpful, but it may still be authentic, enhancing the customer experience when needed. Sign up with the best third party review site. As Google relies on third party review sites to determine a site’s reviews, it may be a good idea to learn more about these sites, working towards building your reputation, leading to better SERPs. Don’t forget Facebook ratings. Your review strategy should not ignore reviews on social media, especially on Facebook, where many users flock to learn more about a brand, or a product.  Embrace bad reviews Negative reviews are still important for your review strategy, as they tend to be the most sought out and read by users. Keep monitoring them to improve your customer experience, be ready to respond, and never delete them or hide them.

Matt was the search spam guardian at Google, he went on a leave a while back and was replaced in March 2015 and now is temporarily at the Pentagon working on projects with the Defense Digital Service team. The interview was by Anil Dash and posted on Medium. It was a weird format because they used an app for the interview and Matt was asked a question on a mobile app and he had to reply quickly typing on his mobile phone. But the questions were solid and not just about his work with the Defense Digital Service team. Anil has known Matt for years and asked him some solid questions around his work at Google. Here are the most interesting ones about his challenges while working at Google in the unique position of doing webmaster communication, when there was no such role for that early on. He told Anil that he "was always amazed that more engineers didn't want to step out in front of the curtain." I know he tried, he brought many engineers to conferences, brought them into videos and forums but very few lasted. So he decided to help make a team just for this, named the Webmaster Trends team. When asked about the stresses around how SEOs can get a bit extreme, Matt said "occasionally someone would be stressed and threaten something." Yes, he received threats. In fact, he said he "did get a credible threat at a search conference." He added that since then his "wife insisted that I had to carry a cell phone after that." But when he was asked if that was unusual, he shrugged it off explaining that "even then the kernel of there reaction was trying to set things right." He explained "well, it is there livelihood in many cases," "so I understand the stress that people would be under," Matt added. I then was able to ask a few questions and I asked if he ever considered a body guard and he said "nah. Most people even when stressed are still reasonable and nice." Yea, most people are, but it only takes one, I thought. Matt did add "folks would occasionally send a big cookie or a fruit basket. We always joked whether it was safe to eat them." So what was the tricky part I asked Matt? The knowledge from one area helped in the other. But at times, it was frustrating because I wanted to shut down some loophole faster, and I wasn't going to recommend things that would make the web worse. On balance though, I am so grateful for my time doing communication and outreach. He never once said he left Google because of these challenges and technically, he is still on a leave and with Google. But I assume he is somewhat relieved and thankful not to be getting as many threats these days. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Since the Q&A moderator feature is not in YouTube Live, John is hacking Google Slides Q&A session to use two different systems to handle the hangouts. John posted on Twitter a sample Google Slides Q&A over here and honestly, it seems like it will work. It is separate, but he can easily link to both when he schedules the YouTube Live URL and the Google Slides Q&A URL. Here is what the Slides Q&A looks like: Again, I am very glad John and Google isn't using this as an excuse to stop the webmaster hangouts. They are incredibly valuable to many many webmasters and does add that flavor of one-on-one support that Google has lacked prior to these hangouts. Forum discussion at Twitter.

It made it only the second company in the world to be certified by Google as a location services provider and was a huge feat for the company, John Kennedy, chief executive, told Proactive. "To be one of only two companies to be certified by Google is a huge achievement and one we expect will be critical in encouraging more brands to work with us” Proximity marketing gives advertisers the ability to ‘push’ adverts on to a mobile firm as people walk or travel pass a beacon. Thus far, beacon tech has been driven by Apple’s iBeacon, which has required an app to be installed to create the connection with a customer’s mobile phone. The difference with the Google Eddystone system is that the app is no longer needed. Anyone going past using a mobile phone running on Android, Google’s operating system, can instantly receive client messages and advertising. “It massively enhances the volume of consumers we can reach out to,” said Kennedy, especially as the basic concept is the same. “One side uses a beacon via an app, while the other uses physical web. The messaging is exactly the same to the consumer’s phone.” Getting Google’s approval took many months of hard work, he adds, with the search engine giant setting the bar very high in terms of the technology spec and completion schedule. WATCH: Google certification a 'significant endorsement' says Proxama PLC boss READ: Proxama and the "future of our high streets" Having got there though, Kennedy sees ‘huge’ revenue potential. Proxama already operates a significant network of beacons, most of which are located in London on buses, taxis and at airports, restaurants and so on. But, he says, the opportunity is only as good as the network capability and now as part of the Google network it has a much clearer way to monetise the business. It turns a ‘great opportunity’ into a ‘truly great opportunity’, Kennedy says. Shares today rose by 19% to 1.1p, valuing the company at a shade over £19mln.

GOOGLE Googling our medical symptoms is making us sicker Written by Dr. Mary Aiken Director of the Cyberpsychology Research Network September 06, 2016 Nearly 1% of searches on Google are about health-related questions. (Reuters/Damir Sagolj) Share Written by Dr. Mary Aiken Director of the Cyberpsychology Research Network September 06, 2016 Every year, Americans spend at least $20 billion on unnecessary medical visits in the US. This is one of the drivers behind the spiraling cost of health care, which is predicted to soar to $5.5 trillion by 2024. The last thing you’d imagine is that the internet would have anything to do with this. But guess again. Medical doctors are already aware of the connection, because they see it every day. Patients arrive at offices and clinics with a “Google stack,” as it’s sometimes called: a pile of print-outs from the online research they’ve done that has led them to form their own amateur medical opinion. Seventy-two percent of Americans search for health information online, according to a 2013 Pew study. About 35% search for diagnostic information, and of those who attempt to self-diagnose, just over half proceed to make an appointment with a medical professional to talk about what they found online. In June 2016, Google reported that roughly 1% the site’s searches are related to medical symptoms. For a number of reasons, most medical professionals aren’t too happy about the self-diagnosis trend. It isn’t simply a matter of loss of control or an undermining of their authority though online medical searches—it can mess with the diagnostic process, because the results can suggest rare or morbid conditions to patients, which in turn can prompt the appearance of new “symptoms.” You search online for “sore throat,” for instance, and find yourself engrossed and horrified by descriptions of esophageal cancer. Your anxiety escalates. Psychologists have studied suggestibility for decades. After reading or hearing about illnesses and their symptoms, humans can often imagine they are sick when they are not. Even when symptoms don’t present themselves, learning about rare and terminal disorders can result in health anxiety—worry, agitation, and nervousness over a perceived illness—which also impacts the number of annual unnecessary doctor visits. The increase in reported health anxiety is now significant enough to have a new name. “Cyberchondria” was first coined in a 2001 BBC News report and later validated in a 2003 article in Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. A groundbreaking study in 2009 by Ryen White and Eric Horvitz, two pioneering research scientists at Microsoft, used data analytics to establish the relationship between online medical searches and the heightened incidence of health-related anxiety. In a study of 40 million searches—10,000 of them manually analyzed—they were able to demonstrate that searchers progressed from reading about normal complaints to looking at rare and serious medical conditions. In a companion survey of 515 individuals, nine out of 10 respondents said they’d conducted an online search for symptoms of a common medical condition that led them to review a more serious illness. One in five said this happened to them “frequently.” “The web has the potential to increase anxieties of people who have little or no medical training,” White and Horvitz concluded, “especially when web search is employed as a diagnostic procedure.” Now, seven years later, even Google admits that “health content on the web can be difficult to navigate, and tends to lead people from mild symptoms to scary and unlikely conditions, which can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress.” Admitting there’s a problem is one step. But fixing it is another. I have been involved in a dozen different research silos in the past decade—studying everything from cyberchondria to cybercrime—and the one thing I have observed over and over again is that human behavior is often amplified and accelerated online. We see examples of this escalation in everything from trolling to cyberbullying, cyberstalking to online sex offending. I believe this is caused by an almost predictable mathematical multiplier: the cyber effect, which is the E = mc2 of this century. Anxiety means more doctor visits and crowded waiting rooms—but it also means a rise in risk. The more often you visit a doctor and present with plausible symptoms, the more intrusive procedures you are likely to face in order to investigate the likely (or unlikely) cause. That risk is significant. The third-most-common cause of death in the US, after heart disease and cancer, is “iatrogenic effect,” a blanket term that can refer to an unfortunate drug side effect or interaction, a surgical instrument malfunction, physician negligence, medical error, pathogens in the treatment room, or simple bad luck. According to activist and toxicologist John James, who lost his son due to what he believes was a careless medical mistake in a Texas hospital in 2002, there has been a four-fold increase in iatrogenic deaths in the US between 1999 and 2013. This would appear to follow the growth of the internet. The internet offers so many advantages, but these pluses are increasingly offset by serious problems. Here are some solutions: Creating safer and more-intelligent search protocols for medical queries, so that access to health information doesn’t result in unnecessary anxiety—and consequences. Rethinking media coverage and TV commercials, which can also fuel health anxiety and send people rushing online to self-diagnose. Reforming medical malpractice protocols to discourage unnecessary testing and exploratory investigative procedures. It’s time for medical ethics to migrate online. The question is: Can Dr. Google abide by one of the main tenets of the Hippocratic oath, which doctors swear to at the beginning of their medical practice? Primum non nocere—”First, do no harm.” Dr. Mary Aiken is a cyberpsychologist and author of the forthcoming book The Cyber Effect, published by Spiegel & Grau 23rd August, 2016.

If this is the case, there's one question you'll want answered: is this Android OS update actually worth getting excited about? If you've been hankering after a super-flashy revamp to make it seem we’ve entered a new era of Android, you may be disappointed. Android 7.0 Nougat’s goals are more about preparing for the future of Android app development, adding little tweaks here and there, with the end result being that in use your device will feel faster. Watch: Android Nougat hands-on Related: Android 6.0 Marshmallow review Android 7.0 Nougat – Multi-tasking We'll start with a flashy tentpole feature, one that you may well have met before. On-screen multi-tasking has finally been added to Android. I say “finally” because I remember using something similar in an Android device so long ago that the memory sits in a hazy fog. The Samsung Galaxy S2, released in 2011, featured the “two apps on screen at once” multi-tasking capability that Google has just added to this update. It’s almost funny to think that the feature that once had people accusing Samsung of overloading Android is now becoming a core part of the system. However, it isn't that simple. Google’s application of Multi-Window makes far more sense now that 5.5-inch phones cost as little as £150 – and you’d hope that its implementation is far more slick. But is it? Yes and no. You start Multi-Window multi-tasking by long-pressing the square soft key that normally lets you flick between apps quickly. This splits the screen in half, with the new half then displaying the usual app-switching carousel. You flick through this app Filofax and then tap the app you want. YouTube and Settings: A truly dreadful use of Multi-Window It fills the spare half of the screen and you can alter how much space each app receives by dragging the border between them back and forth. So far, this is almost exactly like the multi-window implementations we’ve seen in the past. The importance of it coming to Android 7.0 Nougat, though, is that soon it will work with almost all apps. Right now, compatibility is patchy. Using the Pixel C, Multi-Window makes your Facebook feed’s contents disappear completely. Android tells you “this probably won’t work” with most apps at the moment, but I was surprised to discover that in the silly-but-addictive 3D obstacle course Faily Brakes it works fine. Facebook says no, Faily Brakes says yes It should take only a minor tweak on the developer’s part to get virtually all apps Multi-Window-ready. And given how long we’ve been waiting for this feature, its application seems disappointingly prosaic – until you look closer. In a handful of Google apps, you can actually drag and drop images and text from one pane to the other. This is the big one, and provides a view of how we may use Android apps in the future. If Multi-Window is to take off, such inter-app communication needs to happen on a wider and deeper scale. I want to be able to drag pics from Google Photos into a Facebook album, for example, even if it is a feature that I may personally never use. It is in this type of interaction that the fundamental gaps between a computer OS such as Windows and a mobile OS such as Android become apparent. The Android Developer website details this feature as follows: “Users can drag and drop data from one activity to another while the two activities are sharing the screen.” But what's the limit of "data"? Once again, though, we've already seen this capability with Samsung. The Samsung Galaxy S6, for example, allows drag-and-drop image transfer between multi-window panes when used with the Samsung email and Samsung Gallery apps. I’ll admit that drag-and-drop multi-tasking hasn't really been a huge deal for me with regards to older Samsung phones or tablets. But when it’s available to the wider ecosystem it could, and should, have a real effect on how future Android apps are designed and used. Being part of the standard API set changes everything. I have a personal interest here, too. I was a little heartbroken when I realised years ago that there was no simple way for the many fantastic iPad music-making apps to talk to one another without the use of external hardware. I'm not talking here about GarageBand, but instead about the slightly less-friendly but more serious synthesizer and sequencer apps such as the Korg iMS-20 and Steinberg Cubasis. Mobile devices now have the processing power and RAM – at least on Android – to become miniature studios, with synth and drum apps effectively becoming plug-ins, but mobile operating systems are too restrictive at present. Although we remain a hundred miles from that, we appear to be heading in that direction. Unless you’re an app developer, you may as well forget about such advanced multi-tasking for now. No third-party apps currently support it, and its implementation is clunky and limited in Android 7.0 Nougat. It’s something that we’ll see honed in Android 8.0, or smaller iterative updates. Hopefully. Still, after trying out Multi-Window with a Google Pixel C for a few days, I do find today’s Multi-Window useful for taking notes on an article I'm reading. In its present state, though, I can’t imagine using it too much on a phone such as the Nexus 6P. What you’ll probably appreciate more in the short term is a far simpler multi-tasking trick. By quickly double-tapping on the multi-tasking button, it's possible to flick between your two most recently used apps. This works well, and is frankly the most cogent use of multi-tasking for phones at the moment.

Obviously. toboev September 7, 2016, 6:16 am With the exception of the Vulcan thing, this article could have been a piece about the "bloatware" in Touchwiz many years ago. Samsung have been pilloried every step of the way. toboev September 7, 2016, 6:19 am I'm struggling to recall anything here that I didn't already have in my old original Note (apart from Vulcan). MattMe September 7, 2016, 8:26 am I was surprised how much of this is new to Android 7. I've had a Sony Z3 for 2 years and all of these (apart from multi-window, which I'll never use on such a small screen) are part of the OS. Never really appreciated how much Sony had modified Android. Probably because it's done subtly to add or tweak features missing from the stock OS, without cramming in too much bloatware. Very happy with Sony's implementation of Android overall, despite the fact it takes them so long to roll it out. On a side note, it appears this year they have decided my Z3 isn't good enough for Android 7 - despite it being higher spec than the new compact phone they are releasing... That combined with the awful new handset hardware is why I'll not be going back to Sony this year. Luckily I'll not be missing any of the nice OS tweaks on the Sony because it's all stock now :) Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

That distinction will be claimed by the Pixel and the Pixel XL, Google’s upcoming 2016 “Nexus” devices, according to a new report. Google is expected to properly reveal the two devices sometime this fall. Google's Pixel and Pixel XL to be released with Android 7.1 (NMR1). — LlabTooFeR (@LlabTooFeR) September 5, 2016 The rumour comes courtesy of a tweet from LlabTooFer, a leaker associated for his/her relationship to HTC. Given that multiple rumours have said HTC is building the two smartphones for Google, there’s a good chance LlabTooFer’s information is correct. Note also that LlabTooFer refers to the devices as the “Pixel” and “Pixel XL,” corroborating earlier reports from Android Central and Android Police that said Google will drop the Nexus brand this year. In the past, the Pixel brand has been associated with Google’s in-house tablets and Chromebooks, which haven’t sold particularly well. Pocket-lint speculates Android 7.1 will include software and features exclusive to the two new phones. In particular, Daydream, Google’s new virtual reality platform, is expected to launch on the Pixel and Pixel XL. Current high-end Android smartphones will not be Daydream certified. We’ll have more on the Pixel and Pixel XL as the date of their reveal gets closer. SourceTwitter ViaPocket-lint St. Misery Still waiting for 7.0 on my Moto Nexus 6, what’s the holdup? Iz3man I rolled back to MM from N on my nexus 6p.. Didn’t like it. Steve Rodrigue If this rumor is true, it will confirm Google don’t care about fragmentation and they are all about iterations, progression, innovation. Android as an OS can’t/won’t stale anytime soon. Google will push forward and Android manufacturers will have to play catch-up game with the Big G. Vincentd120 I currently have a Oneplus One. Don’t plan to upgrade at the moment. But I may consider the Pixel if the price is relatively good *unlocked. Iz3man Not sure I like pixel.. If Google already had a brand named pixel and it wasn’t doing well, why drag the doing alright phones into that mix.. If they wanted to amalgamate their providing under one name, why not use the established and we’ll received Nexus moniker?? Jerry According to Evan Blass the phones will be Nexus not Pixel.. Garrett Cooper I hope the Pixel is everything I want it to be. I’ll be grabbing on if it is. Hate the new name though, Nexus was much better. Ali F. Why Google do not finance/subsidy their devices. I would buy it and pay it over a period of a year. Did they ever think of offering this or they just dont need to. yacman i was sort of hoping for a chrome os phone. something that would update itself every 2 weeks Drena Makes sense to me, I guess, since phones are where the money is.

Google is likely to hold a hardware-related event on 4 October. By Sarmistha Acharya September 6, 2016 13:53 BST Google is expected to launch a 7in Android tablet IBTimes UK If you were thinking there won't be an Android tablet from Google anytime soon, then you could be wrong after reports a 7in mobile device might hit the market before the end of this year. Although not too much is known about the hardware details of Google's potential device, all that has been whispered is it could be built by Huawei and may pack 4GB RAM. Huawei has previously teamed up with Google by building last year's Nexus 6P flagship smartphone. The sketchy details so far about the Huawei-built tablet were shared by notorious Twitter leakster Evan Blass, also known as evleaks. Recently, it was reported that Google would bid farewell to Nexus name in favour of its own branding. Its upcoming Android high-end phones would be dubbed Pixel and Pixel XL, which are essentially the HTC manufactured 5in Sailfish and 5.5in Marlin, respectively. Therefore we can assume the 7in tablet by Huawei could be marketed with Pixel naming. The company is said to have scheduled a media event on 4 October, focusing on new hardware. The company will take the stage to unveil Pixel, Pixel XL, a 4K Chromecast, Google Home and its Daydream VR headset, which will be supported by Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor. The 7in tablet will hopefully make its debut at the event. In April, Huawei trademarked a mysterious device Huawei 7P. The trademark suggests it is related to some kind of mobile device, which could be a smartphone, tablet or even a wearable of some kind.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Warner Bros. flags own site for piracy, orders Google to censor pages Studio also wanted Amazon, Sky, and IMDb links nixed for allegedly breaking copyright law. by Glyn Moody (UK) - Sep 6, 2016 12:48 pm UTC Login to bookmark 134 Warner Bros ordered Google to remove several of its own webpages from search results on the grounds they infringed the media giant's copyright. A posting on the Lumen database of cease and desist letters revealed the bizarre requests, which were sent by monitoring company Vobile on behalf of Warner Bros. It asked for the official pages of Batman: The Dark Knight and The Matrix films to be censored by Google under the terms of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). A few days earlier, according to TorrentFreak, Warner Bros had requested that the official webpage for the movie The Lucky One should be removed from Google's search results in the same way. Ars sought comment from Warner Bros, but it has yet to respond at time of publication. The takedown demands from the company went beyond erroneously targeting itself. It also told Google to remove legit movie streaming links from Amazon, Sky, and IMDb. "Warner is inadvertently trying to make it harder for the public to find links to legitimate content, which runs counter to their intentions," said TorrentFreak. Google spotted the anomalous requests to remove the Amazon, Sky, and IMDb links and decided not to take any action. However, the Warnerbros.com URLs are apparently still being investigated. Google might point out that the huge volume of DMCA requests it now receives makes spotting such errors increasingly difficult. According to its 2016 report on how it's fighting online piracy, Google received requests to remove 558 million webpages last year, an increase of 60 percent over the previous 12 months. One of the problems with the DMCA takedown mechanism is that there is no real penalty for making incorrect claims, which encourages mass submissions of URLs, including false ones. An earlier TorrentFreak article reported on a 2013 court case that accused Warner Bros of abusing the DMCA takedown process using false claims. The case was settled before any judgment was made, leaving the legal issues surrounding erroneous DMCA requests largely unexplored.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google’s new undersea cable offers up to 26 Tbps connectivity across Asia Google and FASTER, a consortium of six international companies recently announced that world’s fastest fiber optic undersea cable, which connects the United States and Japan was complete and will offer access to up to 10Tbps (Terabits per second) of the cable’s total 60Tbps bandwidth. Today Google has announced that its new high-speed undersea cable that links FASTER from Japan to Taiwan is now online. With the new cable, Google’s largest data center in Asia located in Changhua County, Taiwan will provide its millions of users across Asia to access its tools and services, at speeds of up to 26 terabits per second. Google said that the new FASTER cable has enough bandwidth to support every person in Taiwan sending a selfie to a friend in Japan every 15 seconds. That would work out to 138 billion selfies per day. Regarding the new FASTER cable, Google on the official blog, said: You may not notice right away, but this new cable should help Google products and services load more quickly across the region. It should also improve the reliability and consistency of this speedier experience, since the cable was strategically built outside of tsunami zones to help prevent network outages related to natural disasters. "Google's new undersea cable offers up to 26 Tbps connectivity across Asia", 5 out of 5 based on 74 ratings.

By Hope Reese | September 6, 2016, 4:00 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Nick Carr When Nick Carr started his blog Rough Type over a decade ago, he began questioning the impact of the internet on things like our concentration, relationships, and world views. Today, with the current proliferation of mobile phones, tablets, wearables, and other devices, we are more connected than ever. And, these queries—and what the answers imply—are even more important. Utopia is Creepy: And Other Provocations, released today, culls together 80 posts from Carr's blog, along with an original piece "Is Google Making Us Stupid?" from The Atlantic. The collection, coming from a Pulitzer-finalist who has earned a reputation for his sharp insight into technology and society, revisit some of the issues raised in his early writing, as well as examine new issues like driverless cars and robots. TechRepublic questioned Carr about these issues and below is the conversation, lightly edited for clarity. You started your blog, Rough Type, largely about the internet in 2005. Over the last decade, what big changes have you noticed in how we interact with the online world? A lot of the changes have been technical. If you look at how we defined personal computing in 2005 it was still very much built around personal computers—desktops and laptops. Now it's changed entirely so that personal computing takes place over smartphones, through apps that are constantly connected. Thanks to the smartphone, we've gone from a world where computers were important in our lives but we weren't using them all the time to a world where we're connected to computers from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep. When you use a technology so intensively, it changes the way people behave. It changes the way they think. It changes the way they interact with others. I think in those 10 years we've seen a radical expansion of the role of computer hardware and software in our personal lives. Do you imagine that this will continue to become an even bigger part of our lives? All the signs seem to point to a continuation. We'll become even more dependent on computers—in one form or another—and apps and social media services to do things in our lives, to communicate and so on, though maybe we may eventually bump up against some limits. I think the failure of Google Glass, for instance, would seem to indicate that there is a limit to the intrusiveness of computers and computer screens that people are willing to accept. I think there's a small group of very geeky people who have no problem with having a computer monitor in their field of vision pretty much at all times but I think most people that makes them feel disoriented and kind of strange. What do you think of driverless cars? How do you expect them to affect the way we live? What's become frustrating in discussions of self-driving cars or autonomous cars is a fuzziness of the definitions. For instance, look at what Uber's doing in Pittsburgh—they're having autonomous car experts at the wheel, ready to take over when the software can't handle a particular situation. That is very similar to what we've been seeing with Google, and even in a way with Tesla's Autopilot. It's certainly an expansion of the stuff we've already seen, but I don't think there's anything particularly new in what Uber's going to be doing. SEE: An Interview with Nick Carr (CBS News) The billion dollar question is, "can we actually completely get rid of the human being as a backup driver for everyday driving?" I can certainly see the ways you can isolate particular driving chores in very limited ways in particular speeds and so forth, but there's still a pretty big question about whether we really create cars without steering wheels and without other controls, and expect them to be able to do everything that a driver does now. It may turn out to be possible, it may turn out to be trickier than we think, but clearly companies like Uber and Google and Ford and a lot of others see this as one [possibility] of the future of driving. You write about automation, and the ways that humans are important in the equation. Can you illustrate this? There was a very interesting story about Toyota a couple of years ago. Toyota has been a big leader in factory automation and factory technology in general, but it's been having quality problems in recent years. There've been a lot of recalls, and this is something that is not only a business problem for Toyota. It's something that goes exactly contrary to their culture which is a culture of quality and of meticulous manufacturing cost and so forth. So they brought some new leadership into the company and what they realized is that their dependence on factory automation and robots meant that they were losing their rich tradition of human expertise. There were limitations to what robots could do, even in the factory setting. Robots certainly can be extraordinarily efficient and extraordinarily productive, and you don't have to pay them benefits and so forth. Yet robots are not able to examine in a critical fashion what they're doing in the way that human experts [can]. What Toyota decided is that they needed to bring back the human expertise, the human craftsman. They began to switch from robots to talented artisans in certain facets of their production. I think it started with the crankshaft line in one of their Japanese plants. What they found is that actually there is a way to achieve a partnership between human beings (human experts) and robots that makes both sides of the equation operate better. What do you think of co-bots, or collaborative robots? If you look at a lot of the studies about automation, many came from aviation, where there's a lot of history of human-computer interaction. It certainly suggests that the best way forward is not simply to assume that you want to replace everyone with software or with robots. It's a more of a human-centered approach that says, "How can we get the best of the machine and the best of the human being?" These are not substitutes for one another. The technology is very good at some things and people are very good at some things. If you can figure out a way to automate processes without assuming that you need to get rid of people I think you can get both efficiency and innovation and creativity over the long run. SEE: How our attachment to tech is downgrading our conversations: A word with Sherry Turkle There's a lot of pressure on the other side to simply go the replacement route. I think software programmers are often rewarded by thinking about, "How can we reduce the role of human beings in a process?" When you proceed in that fashion it often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because when you give people little to do they never develop rich talent, they never develop rich insights. How do you respond to those who say that automation will free humans for higher-level tasks? I think the belief that we're freeing up humans for higher level tasks is often a rhetorical fig leaf that covers up the fact that you really want to get rid of as many people as possible. You even see this in some of the utopian rhetoric that comes out of Silicon Valley. That "oh, in the future none of us will have jobs, but we'll all be artists or something." Well that's highly dubious and most people don't even want to be artists. I think it's very easy to use up the term "free up people" in order to avoid saying we're going to fire people, which is really what you're going to do. I think the history of technology in the workplace shows us that there are jobs that are lost to technology and there are other jobs that are created by technology. I think the belief that we're freeing up humans for higher level tasks is often a rhetorical fig leaf that covers up the fact that you really want to get rid of as many people as possible. Nick Carr What I think will happen is that we will see some categories of jobs disappear as we always have seen. We'll see some new categories of jobs appear, but the real question is: Will the future structure of the workforce be such that we have good well-paying middle class jobs, or will we see a desk-skilling effect that reduces wages in a broad fashion? If I'm nervous about the labor effects of automation. It's not so much from widespread unemployment as from widespread underemployment and poor pay, or part-time work. What kind of advice would you give to someone heading off to college today? My first advice would be not to listen to other people's advice. As important as it is to make a living, you also want to do something that's fulfilling. I wouldn't base decisions on predictions by futurists, because they're usually wrong. If you look back even in the recent past you can see a lot of when predictions about particular jobs are made they sometimes are way off the mark. For instance, when ATM machines became common everybody thought, "Oh that's the end for bank tellers." In fact there are more bank tellers now than ever before—ATMs changed things, but not in the way people predicted. SEE: Why AI could destroy more jobs than it creates, and how to save them More complex and less routine work is going to continue to hold the best prospects. If you decide you're going to make a career picking heads of lettuce you may find that there are robots that are going to be able to do that. On the other hand, if you decide you're going to be a small scale farmer who's going to grow crops or animals that are going to be in demand by particular restaurants and local restaurants, you may do fine. It's a good point. I talked to Alec Ross, who thinks that the emphasis on coding, for example, may be misguided, since those jobs won't be available later on. You're already seeing a considerable amount of automation of coding, so this idea that there's going to be unlimited numbers of good jobs for coders is not true. I'm sure there are going to be plenty of good jobs, but I'm not sure that programming is going to absorb the entirety of the unemployed or underemployed people. There are plenty of people who simply are not going to have much aptitude or interest in programming and we have to remember that as well. Not all people are the same and not all people are going to do the same things. Learn more about the impact of new technology on society — subscribe to TechRepublic's 'Next Big Thing' newsletter!

 Running Because this system uses Google Accounts with OAuth2 for authentication there are a few steps one needs to complete in order to get a working system: Create a super user: (ve)$ ve/bin/django-admin createsuperuser
 Start the application on local address 127.0.0.1:8000: (ve)$ ve/bin/django-admin runserver
 OAuth works with HTTP based callbacks & token exchange, for this to work our local server needs to be reachable on the Internet. Ngrok is a great utility that allows for this. Follow the installation instructions on the Ngrok website for your operating system. Once installed run: $ ngrok 8000
 This will generate a random ngrok.com subdomain for you on which your local server will be reachable. The random subdomain address is useful for adhoc testing but we would recommend you use something predictable. This can be done using the -subdomain command line argument: $ ngrok -subdomain mc2 8000
 If you haven’t already, create a Google Developer Project at https://console.developers.google.com/project . Next, navigate to https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials , select the ‘OAuth Consent Screen’, choose a product name and save. Then select “New credentials” and select “OAuth Client ID”. Then enter the necessary information Once saved, Google will have generated the unique keys you will need to complete the OAuth setup: For quick setup, you would then enter the following: (ve)$ export SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY="647082549192-142tni49187fck8i2n1p0ptjofihd1k4.apps.googleusercontent.com"

Despite the rivalry between iOS and Android, the service is slowly gaining traction in the Android environment.  ( Apple | Google Play ) Advertisement Apple Music for Android got released on the Google Play Store almost 10 months ago, but the popularity of the app surges by the week. A recent count shows that Apple Music for Android topped 10 million downloads on Google's application portal. To be specific, the app amassed a total number of installs between 10 million and 50 million. A few days ago, the numbers showed the app sitting at between 5 million and 10 million. On average, 1 million users downloaded the app each month since its release. This is far from stellar, considering that Apple Music is free for use during the first three months and the Android ecosystem is home to about 1 billion users. However, Apple can count this number as a victory, as the notorious rivalry between Android and iOS usually prevents loyalists from each side from tapping into the potentially great apps created by the other. Apple Music landed on Android last year in November. Four months prior, the service premiered on the Apple iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. For the Android version, the app sports a design and features that closely resemble those on the iOS variant. Apple Music for Android exited beta stage in August this year. At the WWDC 2016 event, Apple announced that its streaming music service was adopted by 15 million subscribers with paid accounts. To put it in perspective, the dominant player in the industry, Spotify, banked on 30 million paying subscribers during a similar timeframe. Apple Music for Android was updated in May, which allowed users to upgrade their Individual Membership to a Family Membership, enabling six family members to enjoy Apple Music together. An Individual Membership to the service costs $9.99 per month, while a Family Membership asks users to shell out $14.99. There is also a Student Membership option available at only $4.99 per month. Those who like to make a one-time payment for a long-term subscription should know that Apple has their interest in mind, as well. With a 12-month gift card, users may pay $99 for a full year of Apple Music. This brings the monthly subscription fee to $8.25, granting an 18 percent savings when compared to a month-by-month subscription. Apple device owners will see the app getting a total revamping in iOS 10. The most noteworthy improvements to Apple Music are the way tracks are organized and the improved design that puts large and bold text at the forefront. Users may download Apple Music for Android on Google Play. Keep in mind that the device you install it on must have Android 4.3 or newer.

The extension offers a connection speed of 26 terabits per second, which Google says would allow 138 billion selfies a day to be transmitted between Japan and Taiwan. If that seems a little excessive, the reason for the capacity is that Google’s largest data center in Asia is based in Taiwan, meaning that the entire region should benefit. As with the original cable, Google had to be careful to avoid tsunami zones when routing the cable. You may not notice right away, but this new cable should help Google products and services load more quickly across the region. It should also improve the reliability and consistency of this speedier experience, since the cable was strategically built outside of tsunami zones to help prevent network outages related to natural disasters. That should provide greater resilience when other connections in the region are severed by tsunamis.

Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones expected to launch running Android 7.1 Nougat update Pocket-lint 06/09/2016 pocket-lint.com © Pocket-lint When Google releases its next pure Android phones, they'll launch running Android 7.1 according to the latest leak. The news comes from @LlabTooFeR, a leaker known for revealing nuggets of HTC-centric information before it's confirmed.  Perhaps notably, the tweet refers to the next phones as the Pixel and Pixel XL, rather than any form of Nexus, corroborating rumours that Google is shifting its hardware strategy this year. As for Android 7.1, that's yet to be released by Google and is likely to be the major Android Nougat update that initially includes software elements and features exclusive to the two new phones. Most notably, Daydream VR.  Daydream is almost certainly going to launch first on the two new Pixel phones, setting them apart from any devices currently running Android 7.0 Nougat, or any device that's being updated between now and when the Pixels are announced.  Google's Pixel and Pixel XL to be released with Android 7.1 (NMR1).— LlabTooFeR (@LlabTooFeR) September 5, 2016 There have been rumours for months claiming that Google was turning to HTC to build its next stock Android phones this year. Likewise, speculation and inside information seemed to suggest that HTC wouldn't be a Nexus partner manufacturer, but used more as a contractor to build Google's hardware designs. That's significant, because it means we're unlikely to see HTC's branding on the devices, and we won't see the familiar Nexus moniker stamped anywhere either. The Pixel branding has so far been used for Chromebooks and a tablet of Google's design. Launching a Pixel-monikered phone would certainly help tie all of the search giant's hardware together. It is worth noting that Chromebook Pixel and Pixel C haven't exactly sold like hot cakes, so it'll be interesting to see if the more in-house effort on the phone has a negative or positive impact.  Go to MSN Home More in News Child abuse inquiry delays Janner investigation Sky News Four-year-old's 999 call saves mother's life Sky News Harry wants 'personal security guard for his girlfriend' International Business Times Tram was doing 43.5mph in 12.5mph limit before deadly crash, report reveals City AM Boris slammed for prosecco threat Sky News Putin withdraws Russia from International Criminal Court Associated Press Up Next Jo Cox tried to protect staff as she was attacked, court hears Press Association More in News IVF mum marries donor after tracking him down and falling in love Mirror Tracking an elusive diary from Hitler's inner circle The New York Times £1bn Madonna becomes highest-grossing solo touring artist ever Evening Standard AdChoices AdChoices More From Pocket-lint Samsung could release a large-screen Galaxy S8 to entice Note customers Pocket-lint Huawei could be next to create a bezel-free phone Pocket-lint Apple unveils MacBook Pro with OLED touch panel Pocket-lint What is Spotify and how does it work?

And then we stopped hearing about it, with only the Nexus Marlin and Sailfish (now known as the Pixel and Pixel XL) being churned through the rumor mill. Did Huawei bow out? We’re not sure, but their plans for a repeat performance may actually have turned into plans for a Nexus tablet — the aptly-named Nexus 7P — according to Evan Blass. Blass didn’t have any details about the tablet aside from the fact that it runs 4GB of RAM and is on track for release later this year. We’d love to assume the device will sport at least a Snapdragon 820 chipset to ensure strength in anything you want to do with it, but we aren’t ready to bet the farm on that. Regardless, it’s exciting to hear that the company is finally ready to offer up another 7-inch tablet after a long drought since 2013’s Nexus 7. While that tablet was great and still continues to be a battle-hardened tool which is still receiving the latest versions of Android, we’re sure Google is eager to launch some new hardware to handle future applications like (potentially) Daydream VR. Let’s hope the wait to hear more won’t be too long.   local_offer    Huawei   Nexus 7P   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (15) stars Further Reading First Huawei P10 specs and shots surface Huawei introduces Mate 9 Pro Why Huawei didn't manufacture the Pixel and Pixel XL Huawei announced it has sold 9 million P9 smartphones Best Fitness Trackers November 2016 stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google may not have given up on Nexus tablets just yet. According to new claims, the company is again teaming up with Huawei to build a new Nexus 7 slate that is expected to make its debut before the end of this year. The ever-reliable Evan Blass (@evleaks) claims that the 7-inch device will have 4GB of RAM just like the latest Android flagships, which should make light work of running multiple apps side-by-side in Android 7.0 Nougat. Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 This is all the information Blass has provided for now, so we’ll have to wait to find out more. But we can assume that if this device is being built by Huawei, it will offer a high-end design made from premium materials, just like the company’s own MediaPad M3. Google is expected to announce its new Nexus smartphones made by HTC on October 4, so we could see its new Nexus 7 tablet then. The event could also bring Google-branded smartwatches, a new Chromecast that supports 4K video, and more. The most recent Nexus tablet is the HTC-built Nexus 9, which was launched in 2014 alongside the Nexus 6. However, Google has since released the high-end Pixel C with a larger 10.2-inch display, 3GB of RAM, and up to 64GB of internal storage.

This new information about the existence of a Pixel tablet comes from renowned and more-often-than-not reliable leaker Evan Blass (@evleaks) who suggests a 7-inch display and 4GB of RAM will come included when the Huawei-made slate arrives ‘before the end of the year’ – the best available date for its arrival being at the Google event next month.   Google’s Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 We know nothing about the tablet as of yet – this news is fresh off the press (or the tweet), but we have heard a little bit about the mobile handsets which are rumoured to come in two models: Pixel and Pixel XL. Differences between the two are believed to mainly be construction and materials used (the XL being metallic) and both will be made by HTC and are rumoured to be formerly known as “Marlin” and “Sailfish” – handsets that were once set to become Nexus phones. Specs for the (now) Pixel XL include 5.5-inch QHD display with 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, Adreno 530 GPU with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, expandable. A 13-megapixel main camera and 3,450mAh battery are expected, and both the Pixel and Pixel XL will be the debut platforms for Google’s new Android N (7.1) operating system. With Apple’s event scheduled for tomorrow (Wednesday 7th September), and Samsung having recently launched the Galaxy Note 7 (not without its hiccups) adding Google into the Autumn release schedule means the smartphone and tablet market entering Christmas 2016 and further into 2017 is really heating up (if you’ll pardon the pun).

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Davey Alba. Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 09.06.16. 09.06.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am The Death of Project Ara Shows Google Is All Grown Up Google Project Ara may be no more. As Reuters reported last week, Google has suspended—and possibly killed—its plan to make a modular smartphone with interchangeable components. The move is curious—especially considering that in May at its annual I/O conference, the company restarted its Ara hype after more than a year of silence, loudly proclaiming that about 30 people inside the company’s Advanced Technologies and Projects lab, or ATAP, were using Ara as their primary phone. But at the same time, the move isn’t surprising. Related Stories A Day With Project Ara, Google’s Crazy Modular Phone Google’s Alphabet Transition Has Been Tougher Than A-B-C Google Announces It’s All Grown-Up With Alphabet’s New Logo Alphabet Could Give Google Employees More (Stock) Options Project Ara started at Motorola Mobility under Regina Dugan, the former head of Darpa, and when Google acquired Motorola, Dugan remained in charge. But this spring, not long before Google’s conference, she left the company for Facebook, and she talked about the obstacles faced by Ara and ATAP. “Each of our efforts to create new, seemingly impossible products, has been faced with intense challenges along the way. Technical challenges. Organizational challenges. Challenges that might have broken lesser teams,” she wrote in a blog post, addressing her former colleagues inside ATAP. “This is the type of work we signed up for when we built ATAP. It is terrifying because it means we have to face our fear of failure, stare it down, more days than most. So be it.” Those words carry an added meaning when you consider she was leaving ATAP for Facebook. Facebook is a much smaller company than Google, and it doesn’t yet have the same—ahem—“organizational challenges.” The death of Ara is another sign that Google is struggling to maintain its innovative edge as it morphs into a giant corporation. When you’re big, it’s so much harder to be nimble, to make new things work among all that things that already do. At Facebook, Dugan is running a team called Building 8. And it’s a lot like, well, ATAP. The difference is that Facebook is still small enough and nimble enough to foster an environment where this kind of thing has a better chance of succeeding. Of course, Google realizes it’s getting awfully big, and that’s why it has split itself into many different companies, all under a new umbrella called Alphabet. The idea is to spin off its “moonshots” into largely separate operations run a lot like individual startups. In theory, these companies will be more nimble, and odds are, Google will eventually offer stock in these smaller outfits, as a better way of keeping and attracting talent. But this too is hard. Google Fiber, the company’s ultra-high-speed Internet service, is now run by a separate Alphabet company, called Access, and rumors indicate the new company is now under much greater pressure to balance the books. ‘People can’t just keep tinkering in the corner, and hope that no one discovers what the true financial state of things is.’ Jan Dawson What’s more, you can only spin off so many things. ATAP and Project Ara are far more experimental than Google Fiber. They’re even less likely to make money. “The approach went against the grain of everything we know about smartphones,” says Jan Dawson, a tech market analyst and consultant. “The big problem in smartphones is you need scale to be successful and profitable. Apple and Samsung are the only companies that make really good margins, and everyone else struggles with scale.” So, it stayed inside Google. And it died. Look, some things are gonna die and some are gonna live. ATAP is building other stuff, and maybe that will fare better. But the reality is that when a company gets to be the size of the Google, the smaller stuff has a harder time surviving. Alphabet can help. As Dawson says, with Alphabet, Google seems to be saying, people “can’t just keep tinkering in the corner, and hope that no one discovers what the true financial state of things is.” And that’s about right. But at the same time, you do need people tinkering in the corner. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Alphabet ATAP google project ara Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Finally a settlement approved in a federal court in Los Angeles requiring Warner to compensate everyone who paid licensing fees to use the song - reaching a total of $14 million.  In 2015,U.S. District Judge George King ruled that the company didn't own the lyrics to the ditty, one of the best-known and most beloved songs in the world.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 50 shares Most watched News videos Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Victoria Fritz hides her baby bump moments before giving birth Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes? 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Shocking moment Kumbuka tries to smash glass at London Zoo President-elect Trump and family dine out at famous 21 Club Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Cops shoot man holding 2-year-old girl hostage Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Little girl leaps to her sister's defense during scolding EXCLUSIVE: Blow up!

Self-driving cars will be installed with technology that can identify approaching police cars and trigger an alert so that Google's vehicles can move out of the way or pull over to be questioned. In a US patent filing, the internet giant has imagined a system that can recognise emergency services’ flashing lights. The sensors would identify red or blue colours, as well as the flashing sequence, to automatically detect police vehicles. How do driverless cars work? Play! 01:32 It will also measure whether the car is approaching and if the situation requires a response. Once a police vehicle is detected, the self-driving car manoeuvres itself to “yield" to the vehicle; for example, by pulling over to a side of a road. The system can also be used to detect other types of emergency vehicles, such as ambulances, by learning different light patterns. According to UK  law, a driver must park their vehicle at the next safe opportunity when police signals for them to stop on the road. Police can stop a car for any reason. Similarly, if an ambulance or police car is engaged in a high-speed operation, drivers must try not to obstruct them without breaking the law. Should we put our trust in driverless cars? Rule 219 of the Highway Code advises drivers to "look and listen" for emergency vehicles and "take appropriate action to let it pass… while complying with all traffic signs.” As countless people have been fined for driving through a red light or pulling into a bus lane as an emergency vehicle approaches, the new technology may be able to simplify the issue. Driverless car advocates believe they will make traffic accidents a thing of the past, free up countless hours of commuting time and cut congestion. Google has been at the forefront of developing autonomous vehicles, with its self-driving cars travelling more than 1 million miles on public roads since 2012. It is also understood to have held discussions with the Government about launching driverless cars in the country. Credit: Getty Images In documents obtained by The Telegraph last year, Google bosses describe the UK as a leader in developing laws for driverless cars. The Government, meanwhile, has invested millions in driverless car research, as well as promising to change the law to encourage the technology to take root in the UK. Bristol and Greenwich are examining the challenges of bringing fully automated vehicles on to the UK’s roads, whilst Coventry and Milton Keynes will also host tests involving Lutz podcars.

Google to reveal new Huawei-made Nexus 7 tablet at Pixel phone launch? by Rupert Radley 06 September 2016 0 shares Read Comments A new Nexus 7 tablet is supposedly being produced for Google by Huawei and readied for release before the end of the year, according to a new leak. Could it launch alongside the Pixel phone in October? It is rumoured that Google is getting ready to release a new Huawei-made tablet to succeed its popular Nexus 7, with a release tipped for 2016. According to the tweet by reliable gadget leaker @evleaks, Huawei is making a 7-inch tablet with 4GB of RAM, which sounds characteristically similar to the Nexus 7. Related: iPhone 7 - Rumours, specs and price Adding further fuel to the fire is the fact that Huawei and Google have a history of working together under the Nexus banner, with the Chinese firm producing the Nexus 6P smartphone. With Google’s new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones set to be released on October 4, all eyes are on whether or not the new tablet joins them on the catwalk in California. However, the Nexus moniker is anything but a given and the tablet could well sit in Google's expanding Pixel range.

I would certainly use it if it was anything close to useful. But it isn’t. So I don’t.

But here’s the good news: even though YouTube itself doesn’t publish any RSS feeds, you can cobble some together for each channel you want to follow. To illustrate, I’ll show you how to create an RSS feed for our very own YouTube channel: Visit the channel’s main page. Right-click anywhere and select View page source. Search for data-channel-external-id and look for the value that immediately comes next. In my case, it’s UCfXdejDvNviqilmJ9DvGuow (don’t include the quotes). Tack that value onto the end of this URL https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id= Submit the new URL to your RSS reader. That’s it. You now have an RSS feed for that particular YouTube channel. It’s a bit of work if you have dozens or hundreds of channels that you want to subscribe to, but it’s a nice workaround nonetheless. At least it’s possible. Which YouTube channels do you want RSS feeds for? Share them with us so we can discover some new and interesting channels we’ve never seen before!

Snapchat has already been experimenting with AR technology, which superimposes virtual images and objects onto the real world, within its app. It introduced a range of new filters earlier this year called Lenses that can add masks, drawings and other accessories to users' selfie photos. But the company could take this one step further and introduce a wearable product that can add digital objects to your vision without the need to look at a smartphone.  At a glance | Snapchat The move, reported by the Financial Times, follows a string of hires from augmented reality departments at the likes of Nokia, Google and Logitech. Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Apple have all expressed interest in AR, but are yet to release a successful product or demonstrate a popular use for the technology. Google pulled sales of its Glass headset three years after it was unveiled in 2012, partly because it drew controversy for its ability to surreptitiously film and its £1,000 price tag.  Google Glass' headset was deemed unfashionable by many Unlike Google Glass and Microsoft's HoloLens, Snapchat could be working on a more fashionable pair of AR glasses, if Vergence Labs' previous products are anything to go by.  Snapchat acquired of Vergence Labs, a startup that makes a Google Glass-like product, for $15 million (£9.6 million) back in 2014. Before the acquisition, the startup unveiled the Ephiphany Eyewear range of fashionable glasses that can record video and store up to 32GB of footage.  Evan Spiegel, Snapchat's chief executive, was photographed wearing what looked like a pair of these glasses on holiday last summer, according to Business Insider.  A pair of Vergence Labs' Epiphany Eyewear sunglasses that can surreptitiously record video at the tap of a button Credit: Vergence Labs The Financial Times reported that Snapchat is looking at building a prototype headset, but the company has not commented on whether or not it is designing a wearable device. Snapchat investors have previously commented on the potential of the technology. In 2014 Thomas Laffont, managing director of Coatue Management which invested $50 million in Snapchat, said: "People haven't thought about use cases on new computing platforms. In one tap you take a photo, one more you can share it. Imagine [the difficulty] trying to post on Instagram from a Google Glass device." Snapchat, which has 150 million users, has expanded its features to include instant messaging, the ability to send pictures taken earlier, and a news section.  IFA 2016: The best gadgets from Europe's biggest tech show Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Gadgets Snapchat Show more Technology latest 16 Nov 2016, 7:35pm Pokémon Sun and Moon review - A vibrant and delightful new take on the famous pocket monsters 4 16 Nov 2016, 5:26pm Comment: Snapchat isn't worth $25bn - but that won't stop the technorati making it so James Quinn Premium 16 Nov 2016, 4:14pm Comment: Sex site hackers can never crack the mysteries of the human psyche Zoe Strimpel Premium Gallery 16 Nov 2016, 1:13pm Gallery: The bestselling video game consoles of all time 16 Nov 2016, 12:25pm Comment: The AdultFriendFinder hack shows there are no real secrets online James Titcomb Premium 16 Nov 2016, 11:11am Cheap Android phones send owners' text messages and location data to China 16 Nov 2016, 10:20am Comment: AdultFriendFinder sex hack: We can't stop cheating - accept it Rebecca Reid Premium 15 Nov 2016, 7:55pm Google to create 3,000 more UK jobs in major boost for London technology scene 15 Nov 2016, 6:15pm Tinder adds transgender options in bid to improve diversity 15 Nov 2016, 5:31pm Yours for £249: Apple releases big book with 450 photos of its products 15 Nov 2016, 4:12pm Thousands of UK Government emails revealed in AdultFriendFinder hack 15 Nov 2016, 2:00pm Twitter to let users mute words in effort to battle harassment 15 Nov 2016, 10:54am WhatsApp has finally added video calling 15 Nov 2016, 9:57am Facebook and Google promise to cut off fake news websites from advertising 15 Nov 2016, 12:01am Bad battery life?

Or at least, it may recognize when a police car is approaching. As per a new patent discovered by the PatentYogi team, Google looks to be in the process of making a police vehicle detection system for its autonomous vehicles. After all, a car that’s smart enough to get you from Point A to Point B without any help from its human driver should also be smart enough to avoid those flashing lights. Of course, Google’s cars are already pretty good at following traffic rules and regulations, so regardless, they shouldn’t be attracting much attention from the boys in blue. After all, the self-driving vehicle only caused its first crash back in February, and have otherwise been model artificial citizens on the road. But all the same, there are a number of other traffic rules we know that cars will need to follow. For example, an autonomous vehicle will need to learn how to immediately stop itself on the side of the road if approached by a police car, or get out of the way should an emergency vehicle appear to be on its way to addressing an emergency. Related: Baidu will test autonomous cars right in Google’s backyard As such, the Google patent shows a detection system that automatically detects approaching government vehicles based on their unique pattern of flashing lights. The self-driving cars will be taught to recognize the distinct blue and red lights that police cars emit, and respond appropriately. For example, if a police car is approaching a self-driving car, the latter should yield to the former by pulling over or simply getting out of the way. So get excited, friends. Not only are you a law-abiding citizen, your self-driving car soon will be as well.

Is it really an alternative platform to Google and the big bad OTAs? OTA versus meta: is there really a difference? Not everybody thinks so. Dan Wacksman, Senior Vice President, Global Distribution, Outrigger Hotels and Resorts, argues that “metasearch cost-per-acquisition (CPA) is really just OTA” and that you should “only shift share to this channel when the numbers work”.  He also doesn’t buy the argument that meta drives more direct bookings. Of course, Wacksman has a point. In the early days, the standard metasearch model was for partners – hotels, OTAs, airlines and so on – to pay a cost-per-click. However, with the arrival of facilitated booking like TripAdvisor’s Instant Book, partners must now hand over a cut of the booking value. Metasearch has undoubtedly become more mainstream, not to mention so successful that even Expedia is considering an IPO for Trivago which CEO Dara Khosrowshahi recently told analysts “is now five times larger and the growth rates are 40% plus since we bought it”. At the same time, hotels and airlines, not to mention other travel industry suppliers, are grappling with the rising number of distribution channels, among them apps, voice search and virtual assistants.  So is meta really just the big bad OTA wolf in a sheepskin coat and, if not, what exactly is the point of it in today’s rapidly shifting landscape? For Shane Corstorphine, GM Americas, Skyscanner meta is absolutely not OTA in disguise. “Our DNA today is as a platform, where thousands of partners can come in, rather than as an intermediary comparison site that arbitrages between Google or some other distribution channel and the partner.” Hotels and airlines spend millions, if not billions, on their brands and on the experience and contact with the customer. It’s important that metasearch doesn’t interfere with that Shane Corstorphine, GM Americas, Skyscanner Unlike Amazon in the retail space, Skyscanner doesn’t want to own the customer, nor does it want to fulfill the booking. It sees itself as an alternative to other paid sources of distribution rather than an intermediary. “Hotels and airlines spend millions, if not billions, on their brands and on the experience and contact with the customer and I think it’s important that metasearch doesn’t interfere with that,” Corstorphine says. He adds that: “If the user is booking with Spirit, British Airways or whoever, then that must be absolutely clear.” That’s all well and dandy, but if metasearch engines are willing to work with every partner under the sun, what does that mean for hotels and airlines? Without any checks and balances, it means that any OTA upstart can join the party and that isn’t always great news. One hotelier, who preferred to remain anonymous, had this to say: “When we give room rates to our wholesale partners, they are supposed to bundle the rates with airfare and sell it as a package.  What happens is that other sites, like Amoma, will buy the room rate from our wholesalers and sell it as a standalone room product at a lower rate than we are selling direct”.  In the airline business, where price is an even more important differentiator for consumers, it’s a similar tale of woe. One Middle Eastern airline told EyeforTravel that cheap travel OTA sites like GotoGate pose a similar problem for their business. Customers book with a site like this but when there is a customer service issue, the airline takes the rap, losing brand equity as a result. GotoGate’s travel terms and conditions are very clear and the message can be interpreted as: ‘Any problems, don’t come crying to us’.   Not only does this mean lost revenues, it also undermines trust of the consumer in the airline. Skyscanner is aware of such practices and asks hotel and airline partners to raise the flag with them wherever possible. “Our job is to provide search for users and to match them with the best product. But where price parity is being broken we will work hard with partners to try to resolve that issue,” says Corstorphine whose says their goal is not to frustrate hotel or airline partners. As research shows, he says, more often than not users do like to book direct with airline or hotelier. Changing times Clearly, there is a huge amount going on in metasearch strategically, and today it’s not just about bums on seats or heads on beds. According to Corstorphine, its role is becoming one of a platform to enable partners to rapidly access new distribution channels like app, voice or virtual assistants. In this rapidly changing environment Skyscanner has been aggressively signing new partners (it’s currently in talks with about 50). One important strategic move last year was its partnership with British Airways (BA), the first airline to use IATA’s new distribution capability (NDC). The move allowed users in some countries to browse elements such as cabin details, baggage allowance and upgrade options on BA flights, and then book using Skyscanner’s facilitated booking tool.  At all times, however, says Corstorphine it is “entirely obvious” to the user that they are booking with BA. Facilitated bookings should be ‘entirely obvious’ These B2B partnerships are a fast growing part of Skyscanner’s business and another ‘industry first’ of 2015 was the integration of its flight API into Alexa, Amazon’s cloud-based voice service. Among other things Alexa lets users select a playlist, write the shopping list and search for flight information without having to touch a screen, and rumours are that it could soon launch in the UK. Not stopping at just the one travel partner, Amazon has also integrated Kayak’s API because, after all, it wants to connect with, not just a handful of partners, but the world. Aside from apps, Skyscanner sees this rise of voice search and virtual assistants as growing trends that cannot be ignored. Today Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Google Now are already a feature of most smartphones. And then you only have to look to how it’s taking off in China, where 20% of users booking via mobile have made at least one using voice search, for a glimpse into the future. In a recent MIT Technology Review Andrew Ng, chief scientist at search engine Baidu, and associate professor at Stanford, said that voice “may soon be reliable enough to be used for interacting with all sorts of devices”. No such thing as a beautiful API When booking a flight through Alexa, the user is not aware that Skyscanner is powering the back end and they don’t need to be. This, argues Corstorphine, is the future of metasearch.“Our goal is to connect the user and the partner and to provide as little friction as possible in this process,” he says. There is no such thing as a beautiful API in travel If that sounds a little too easy, think again. “This is not a straightforward thing to do,” says Corstophine, adding that, “there is no such thing as a beautiful API in travel.” Right now Skyscanner in the US is talking to about 50 different partners all of which are at different stages evolution funnel. As strong advocate of NDC, Skyscanner says that airline compliant partners (like BA) “can very quickly be integrated from a facilitated booking point of view”. Where Skyscanner is also hoping to steal a march is in the ancillary arena; the upsell is a major focus for all travel suppliers “We need to be as good, if not better, at upselling ancillary offerings than we are at converting the hotel or flight,” says Corstophine. This, again, cements his earlier point that meta is no longer just about direct conversions (heads on beds, bums on seats). With close to 1000 A-B tests running at any time, Skyscanner says that it can test at scale how to make the customer experience better in a way that hotel and airline partners often can’t. (Though they can’t really say the same about big OTA partners, which also have significant clout).  Something for hoteliers like Wacksman, who argue that you shouldn’t “be blinded by the argument that metasearch is driving more ‘direct’ bookings”, to sleep on? Join the distribution debate at TDS North America (Oct 6-7) next month when Skyscanner, Outrigger and other big travel names will be sharing their insights into the future of this fast-growing sector.

Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS.

"Incident -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this incident does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Incident F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. Incident H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers. (It is not clear if these were all the same number, or in pairs, or some other combination.) This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Incident J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This incident was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this incident perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this incident at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Incident L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance incident did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. 2016-09-04: Official incident report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. Incident N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. They reported this to WoSign, giving only the Github certificates as an example. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance incident did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official incident report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. However, they have misclassified at least one - line 2 of Figure 14 - so the actual split may be different. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Incident P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Incident R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, in violation of section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. More details to be provided. WoSign Response Among other comments: 2016-09-02: Richard Wang: "Please don't bind WoSign incident problem with StartCom, it is two independent company that one registered in China and one located in Israel." Further Comments As well as any issues there may be with the disclosure of the transfer of ownership, the relationship between WoSign and StartCom is also relevant when determining the scope of any sanctions. Incident T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Incident V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Incident 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. Using the value "1" led to a certificate which had a notBefore date (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which was signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. (XXX To investigate: did the chain contain some SHA-256 certs?) The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official incident report. Further Comments This incident does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open. Other Points of Note While not a violation of any Mozilla policy, WoSign has promised to log all certs to CT after a certain date, and yet has not yet managed to comply with the Chrome CT policy of logging to at least one Google and one non-Google log. Arguably, this speaks to competence.

In June, the FASTER Consortium announced that the cable linking the US West Coast and Japan was complete and ready to go into service. Now Google and its FASTER Consortium cohorts have announced another undersea fiber optic cable is ready to enter service. This FASTER cable is a TRANS-Pacific link for Asia and connects Japan to Taiwan. Google operates its largest data center in Asia in Taiwan and the faster cable will allow for speed improvements in a suite of Google services from YouTube videos and email to BigQuery data results. The new Asian cable is able to transfer data at speeds up to 26 terabits per second. Massive data speeds are a bit hard to wrap the mind around so Google has tried to put that 26 terabits per second number into a perspective we can understand. The new FASTER cable has enough bandwidth to support every person in Taiwan sending a selfie to a friend in Japan every 15 seconds. That would work out to 138 billion selfies per day. Google says that users of its services might not notice the faster speeds right away, but the upgraded cable will allow services to load faster across the entire region. The cable will also improve reliability and consistency for the faster service. The FASTER Consortium did build the cable outside of tsunami zones to prevent network outages related to any natural disasters. The new undersea cable isn’t all that Google plans to do to make its services faster for people in the region it serves, it is also building two new data centers in the region and has expanded its Singapore facility.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Google redesigns security warnings after 70% of Chrome users ignore them 03 Feb 2015 37 Data loss, Google, Google Chrome, Security threats, Web Browsers Post navigation Previous: Hackers breach password database at Atlassian’s “HipChat” collaboration service Next: Google extends its all-seeing eye, invites third party apps to Google Now by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit POPUP ALERT!!!! Be it the iconic yellow “Yield” sign with an exclamation mark inside or, say, the red lock with a warning “X” meaning “broken!”, popup alerts warn people away from risky business, right? You would hope so. When we’re talking specifically about SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) warnings, the consequences of ignoring alerts can be pretty dire: eavesdroppers modifying or reading emails or tweets, or attackers intercepting credit card or other sensitive data, for example. Google’s security team has analysed its own SSL warning interface. The team had tinkered with that interface and put out a simpler, hopefully less confusing one in Chrome 37, with the hope that it would teach users more secure behaviours. The results of the redesign weren’t exactly what you’d call breathtaking, it tells us. In an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) presentation and paper, the Chrome security team tells us that the redesign did in fact nudge up secure behaviour a bit, but there’s still plenty of work to be done. The problem Prior to Chrome 37, most Google Chrome users would not back out of SSL quicksand. In fact, a mere 30% of Chrome users adhered to SSL warnings. (For whatever reason, Firefox users are far more compliant with the browser’s SSL warnings: 70% adhere to the alerts.) Why would most – 70% – of Google Chrome users “proceed anyway” rather than get “back to safety”? They’re jaded, alert-numbed or confused, so they simply ignore alerts, Google says, particularly when the alert is jargon-filled, isn’t succinct, isn’t specific, or is flat-out wrong. There are multiple reasons why alerts can be wrong. For example, 20% of HTTPS Strict Transport Security (HSTS) errors are caused by clocks being set wrong, Google says. Other errors are produced when an employer has a DPI box or content filter between a user and the internet, or a client is missing a root certificate. In such cases, a user will get an SSL warning that tells them nothing, and serves only to teach them to click “OK” on a dialogue, Google says. Here’s the old warning that everybody loved to ignore: Confusing warnings only make users more insecure, and they normalise risky behaviour, Google says. Google had tried to make the interface easier to understand, and to restrict itself to giving warnings only when there’s a real risk. What’s a real risk? Well, on one hand, there are misconfigured servers or firewalls triggering spurious warnings. On the other hand, users who ignore an SSL warning and proceed can face physical harm or imprisonment. From the paper: Browsers display SSL warnings when the encryption is too weak or the server could not be authenticated. The connection is immediately halted, pending the user’s decision about the warning. In some cases, the problem indicates a real attack. Syrian Internet users saw SSL warnings when the Syrian Telecom Ministry allegedly attacked Facebook users. Similarly, SSL warnings alerted Chinese Internet users to attacks on Google and GitHub. So how did Google seek to change user behaviour? Google set out to explain SSL dangers in alerts, with an eye to conveying: the threat source (the attacker is on the network, as opposed to being on a malicious site, for example), the specific data that’s at risk (“passwords, messages, or credit cards”, for example), and, with an emphasis on errors on well-regarded sites, such as bank sites. The goal was to strip the alerts of jargon, to hit a sixth-grade reading level, to be as brief as possible, to be specific about the risk, and to provide enough information. To the Google team’s surprise, these types of text tweaks didn’t affect user behaviour, regardless of how simple, specific, or non-technical they made it. They managed to moderately improve users understanding of the risks, but not adherence to the desired “get me out of here!” behaviour they were after: users instead kept walking straight into the quicksand during testing. OK, so what did work? The one thing that did work was to change the design elements of the warning. Google used what’s called “opinionated” design, which relies on visual cues to promote the choice that designers think is the safest action. Some of the visual elements of the so-called opinionated design, which was the one Google opted for at the end of testing: The safe button is a bright blue color that stands out against the background: the same blue that Google uses in other properties for primary actions. In contrast, the unsafe choice is a dark gray text link. Hiding the unsafe choice, forcing users to jump through hoops to do something unsafe. The Google Chrome malware warning hides the “proceed” button behind an “Advanced” link. For what it’s worth, Firefox users actually have to click four times to proceed through Mozilla Firefox SSL warnings. That one isn’t a complete win-win: Google notes that this element increases the annoyance factor, given how hard users have to work to ignore false positives. The results were dramatic: the opinionated design of the new SSL warning nearly doubled user compliance. Adherence rates went from 31% to 58% in a controlled field experiment, and from 37% to 62% in the field following the release of the new warning. Still, too many users don’t get it, Google says, and having users understand is even more important than having them mindlessly comply: Unfortunately, comprehension rates remain lower than desired for all of the SSL warning texts that we tested. This is disappointing, as we view comprehension as more important than adherence. ... We attribute the low comprehension rates to the difficulty of creating an SSL warning that is simultaneously brief, non-technical, simple, and specific. Readers, where do alerts fail you?

Reply xorinzor says: February 3, 2015 at 7:20 pm As a webdeveloper I’d be very annoyed if I would have to click more then once to finally get the “continue” button. Aside of that, users who have no clue what they’re doing and just want to go back would probably in 99,9% of all cases click the blue button rather then the gray text link, and even after that it’s probably again another 99% that would click “continue” rather then “back to safety” Reply xorinzor says: February 3, 2015 at 7:21 pm correction: another 99% that would click “back to safety” rather then “continue” Reply MR says: May 7, 2015 at 3:57 pm I’m a developer too, and I agree that now is the correct way. Proceed with only one click for who does not understand the risks, is very dangerous! If someone intercept the connection and replace the original certificate (for example, if someone open his fake wireless near a place where many people are trying to access to the internet), the victims will not know that are bean spied! Good job google! Reply Anonymous says: September 1, 2015 at 3:24 pm Yeah it’s operation cash I in opm dummy clicks at the expense of the users frustration and it makes it hard to learn when people install apache software to achieve this. Shame Reply Boris says: February 3, 2015 at 1:07 pm The warnings often aren’t very actionable. Often you go to a site to perform a specific task. The task cannot be completed by ‘going back to safety’. I think it would help if users could do an action (like leaving a message or fixing the clock) that would give them the feeling they advanced the task and can for example come back in a week when the server is correctly configured. In practice, this is not really possible, but I think this is the only way to solve this problem. Reply Guy says: February 3, 2015 at 1:28 pm I only ever see this message when I log into our firewall, as we have a self signed certificate. Of course, I always click through… Reply wckreps says: February 3, 2015 at 1:57 pm Perhaps the most effective page would be one with a prominent click-through button labeled, “Checkout now” with the typical credit card and PayPal logos underneath it. Clicking on the button would display a message tersely explaining how there’s a good chance they’ll be hosed if they don’t stop now! Reply The Aviator says: February 3, 2015 at 2:03 pm 100% of the security warnings I get are because I don’t have a CERT-authorty signing my personal site’s cert, or because the hostname for another website is off by a character. It’d be nice if the warnings showed up only for sites I care about, like my bank account. Reply Kelson says: February 3, 2015 at 6:08 pm Hostnames that are off by a character are common among phishing sites, so that’s still worth reporting. Reply 2072 says: February 3, 2015 at 2:06 pm It’s nice to do this but Chrom(e/ium) devs should also drop RC4 support witch is reportedly useless since quite some time now… Reply Xavier says: February 3, 2015 at 2:13 pm I’m sure that a large portion of these stats come from people browsing to internal servers with self-signed certs. A bigger emphasis needs to be placed on ensuring that companies, regardless of size, have a functional PKI system. I try to issue certs for the servers I’m responsible for, but 99% of companies I’ve consulted for completely ignore that aspect, opting to leave the self-signed and click through. Reply Guy says: February 3, 2015 at 3:42 pm PKI is very expensive and complex and would be overkill for our organisation and many others. It would prevent click-throughs, sure, but who besides IT would be clicking through to internal servers and devices anyway? You’d hope that IT would take SSL security warnings seriously, even if the end-users don’t. For enterprise, I hear there’s justification for that kind of investment, but for small business, I need a better reason for spending several thousand pounds. Reply Andrew Ludgate says: February 5, 2015 at 12:17 am PKI doesn’t have to be expensive and complex. For a small business, the business needs to set up a single certificate they use to sign everything. Then they sign all their internal services with that certificate, and provision the root certificate to all desktops/desktop browsers. The big problem tends to be businesses that don’t actually practice IT security at all, and provision desktop computers with the operator as the administrator, with no central software/certificate provisioning source. As these companies often don’t even have an IT manager, let alone an IT department, nobody is aware of how to use the tools they have to secure the information that keeps them in business. So they hire an outside contractor to set up/secure the essentials as a single event, and ignore the rest. As for a better reason: avoiding being hit by phishing attacks, ransomware, BSA license audits, and other IT events that could cripple your ability to do business are all better reasons. Investing in a public key infrastructure doesn’t mean purchasing a signed key from a public certificate authority (although these days, you can get those for free) — it just means setting up a chain of trust and using it across all your IT assets. It costs a bit of time to set it up, and a bit of inconvenience when you want to change something, but that’s about it. Reply Damon says: February 7, 2015 at 12:35 pm “It costs a bit of time to set it up, and a bit of inconvenience when you want to change something, but that’s about it…” So that’s the downside to the company of 15 staff for which I am de-facto IT Manager. What’s the up-side? What’s in it for them? Why should they bother? Reply Paul Ducklin says: February 7, 2015 at 2:19 pm One advantage of having your own web servers (including your web filter, if you have one) explicitly trusted by your 15 staff’s browsers is that they won’t keep getting security warnings that they learn (need) to ignore… Reply Farid says: February 3, 2015 at 2:28 pm Firefox’s security warning bypass process is an acceptable compromise. The only problem is the “Permanently store this exception” check box which is always on by default. If, for example, you want to temporarily bypass the warnings for a trusted website until the server misconfiguration is fixed, you’ll have to clear that check box every time you access the website. One slip of mind and you’ll have permanently stored an unwanted exception without even realizing it. Reply Al Murray says: February 3, 2015 at 2:40 pm interestingly, when accessing naked security at work I get SSL invalid certificate warnings from FireFox but can load the site using Chrome. FF warning content: nakedsecurity.sophos.com uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is unknown. (Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer) Reply Paul Ducklin says: February 3, 2015 at 10:25 pm So…who is the issuer of the Naked Security certificate you’re receiving? Is it *really* our cert (issuer “GlobalSign Extended Validation CA – SHA256 – G2”, trusted by default by Firefox), or are you getting a “man-in-the-middle” certificate sent by your work’s web filtering gateway? I’ll guess the latter, and I’ll go on to guess that your web filter’s certificate has been added to Chrome but not to Firefox. Reply Wilbur says: February 3, 2015 at 11:11 pm For several days, about a week ago, I was getting that error in Firefox with every image posted in articles on this site. Firefox would show the broken image icon, I would click to show it and Firefox would give me the warning – only it referred to a WordPress link. It appears you were hosting your images somewhere else that had a problem, but the main site did not have the problem. I have noticed in the last few days the error has not reappeared, so whatever was going on seems to have been fixed. Wilbur Reply Paul Ducklin says: February 4, 2015 at 8:38 am Our content and images are hosted by WordPress.com VIP. The content should be served with URLs starting https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/ with a TLS certificate issued for nakedsecurity.​sophos.​com by GlobalSign Extended Validation CA - SHA256 - G2. The images come from the WordPress Giant Stash O’ Images at https://sophosnews.files.wordpress.com/ with a TLS certificate issued for *.files.​wordpress.​com by Go Daddy Secure Certificate Authority - G2. I can’t see why either of those would cause a warning in Firefox – never has in my Firefox, anyway. Both those issuers are trusted by default by Firefox. (See Preferences | Advanced | Certificates | View Certificates | Authorities.) I suppose this sort of thing, namely “that shouldn’t happen!” (yet it did), is one of the problems with the whole HTTPS infrastructure. Things go wrong, there’s no easily-found explanation, then they fix themselves, and nothing bad happens that you can see. So, next time, you’re a bit less inquisitive, and so on… Reply BlockItAll says: February 3, 2015 at 3:10 pm The problem here is that there is still a way to bypass the warning and get to the website. If the browsers completely blocked access, that would force the website owners to step up the security and fix the issues. Then users wouldn’t be constantly bombarded with alerts and would start to take notice of them. Reply Sootie says: February 3, 2015 at 8:21 pm That would be really helpful for IT pro’s who are setting up the certificates or testing things… /sarcasm Reply Chris says: February 3, 2015 at 8:59 pm And trust every decision to a simple piece of software? As so many people here are saying, the ability to click through is necessary, especially in the IT field, where I’m working with internal sites hosted on local servers that would be pointless to pay for a professional certificate for. To completely cutoff access to any site that a free piece of software decides is suspicious is, at best, insulting to the user, and at worse, detrimental to productivity of a person or business. Reply Andi says: February 3, 2015 at 3:38 pm I get a warning from Google when I access the admin side of my server, located in the USA. Sometimes it’s the only way of doing things, as the backend of eCommerce package doesn’t let me do ‘everything’. Needless to say I ignore the warning, I need to perform the admin on my website stuff. Reply David H says: February 3, 2015 at 10:06 pm At that point, I want to be able to see the certificate and what appears to be broken. Is it just expired, is it my company man-in-the-middling me or something odder? IE doesn’t give the option of looking at certificates without visiting the site, so no better. At my company where MITM is deployed, chromium/chrome makes life too hard, firefox is easier. Just avoid doing anything private like email or banking. Reply Jaybee says: February 3, 2015 at 11:49 pm I really don’t like the notion of my browser teaching me behaviour. Hopefully there will be a plugin to disable this. Reply tlvp says: February 4, 2015 at 8:39 am What’s with the certificate warning triggered by the HTTPS site www . whitehouse . gov ? Reply George says: February 5, 2015 at 6:40 pm Isn’t this exactly what Microsoft did with browser warnings a few years ago? Reply HanSam Solo says: July 21, 2015 at 6:28 am Sure it has some design flaws but the real problems are the advertisement that come and are associated with the pages. Advertisement that has nothing to do with logging into your accounts page or entering data sensitive material. Every page I go to I have that dang yellow lock instead of the green. I suspect it’s very much the advertisement since I have a fairly new and clean laptop which has gone through many endless windows updates. Reply k4gvo says: August 20, 2015 at 9:23 pm I click through about 99% of the time since I’m going to my own sites with self signed certs. I make no money from them, hence, I’m no about to spend big bucks for a cert. The prices they charge for what amounts to updating a database is outrageous. They want 3-10 times as much for a cert as I do to rent a VPS. Reply AT1937 says: December 9, 2015 at 1:53 pm Chrome’s certificate handling design is a giant annoyance to web developers like myself and my team. The simple inability to A) Ignore Cert Errors for Local LAN or B) Permanently store certificate error exceptions is pain in the ass. Reply Sandy says: March 18, 2016 at 7:06 am I’m a technophobe with nothing but an Android phone. There are so many fake warnings that are themselves a trap that I never click “back to safety” – I just use the back button or swipe the page offscreen. At first I used to email formerly trusted sites to ask if they’d had problems, but they always say their certificate is fine and can’t understand why there’s an issue. For simple folks like me it’s all very confusing so now when I see a warning I just exit, fast. Reply Jim says: July 17, 2016 at 11:14 pm If any of the people not responding are like me they are probably not able to respond in the correct manner, because: they are PC illiterate enough to not be able to follow all the confusing directions. You folks use a lot of terms that people like me just have no clue as to what is being said or don’t know how to follow up. Try writing your directions to lets say a 3 year old, or an 83 year old. Moght work better. Reply Grayson Peddie says: July 30, 2016 at 4:49 am I’ve been to a LinuxMusicians.com forum that I frequent and got certificate warnings. Well, get this: my connection is always private and I will ignore it anyway, even though I know it’s dangerous and I could be susceptible to MITM attack… Reply Darren Forster says: September 6, 2016 at 9:12 am I find their change to over ride the SSL option a pain in the backside. I’ve got one website that I regularly update and the owner has set up the SSL wrong. I notice on Chrome 53 on Windows 10 there doesn’t appear to be anyway to override this problem (maybe I’m not lookin hard enough), I can’t see any advanced button, and it doesn’t even give me a proper reason why it’s not allowed. If I try on my Linux laptop it’s fine and I have the option to proceed but that’s running a very old version of Chrome. Also on my smartphone (Moto X Play) I get the old type warning so can ignore it there too, only problem with the smartphone is that the website I’m updating uses Adobe Flash as an uploader for files (the person who designed this site must have been having a laugh using such decadent technology!) so I can’t even upload files from my smartphone (and looking towards the end of the year I possibly won’t even be able to upload files via Chrome either. I just wonder how long the main webmaster will keep using Flash for before admitting defeat! Reply Landon Crews says: October 3, 2016 at 11:10 pm Alerts fail me when sites I routinely visit (va.gov, university moodle site, and just about any other government run site) kicks back an SSL warning for me. As Google put nicely, these false alerts only teach me to ignore them and someday that’ll probably cost me. Thanks Google! >:[ Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 16, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Google experiments with new desktop SERP layout More News SEO 06 Sep 16 | Christopher Ratcliff Facebook0 Linkedin254 Google+26 Twitter 280 Yesterday, while indulging in my daily spot of ego-surfing very important research, I was surprised to find Google offering me a completely new layout. It seems Google is once again experimenting with a card-based SERP for desktop, where each result is placed in its own separated box like you would normally see on a mobile search. This is the search for an album review I recently published… These cards appear all the way down the page… Assuming this may just be a one-off, or specific to ‘reviews’, I then searched for my very favourite query… All the results are ‘carded’ once again, with News results given their own specific area. I also tried a local search for ‘london steak restaurants’… Not only are the results in card-form, but Google is showing a local three-pack here, rather than the two-pack its been experimenting with recently. There are a few interesting things to note in this experiment… The number of results (11 plus News results) on the new layout is exactly the same as the ’standard’ layout. The snippet width is significantly longer on the card-based SERP. There are roughly 20 extra characters here than on the standard width. On mobile there’s grey shading between the cards to add further delineation, this is missing on the desktop version. After a flurry of searches, I am no longer being served the new look SERP :( Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin254 Google+26 Twitter 280 Related articles Five tools to help you build a content-focused SEO campaign Nine mobile trends to help you stand out in 2017 and beyond 10 ideas to market and monetize your digital book or whitepaper Google’s mobile-first index: how to prepare your business The timing is interesting… Just a few days ago, Google’s core algorithm experienced significant turbulence, which led many experts to believe a change is coming. Google has also recently been testing another desktop UI variation, by increasing the spacing between results. According to The SEM Post the test gives a much cleaner look with more white space, but it also means that results get pushed further down the page. However it should be noted that Google has experimented with this card-based layout before. Way back in 2013 it underwent testing, but shortly disappeared soon after. It then appeared again earlier this year in May. Although neither test led to a roll-out, there’s clearly a reason why it keeps coming back. It does make for a cleaner SERP, with results feeling neater and better organised. And perhaps Google persists with the test because it would make its desktop and mobile UI consistent. Maybe in a year’s time we’ll know the winner in the battle of ’more space’ vs. ‘cards’. Or maybe we’ll be staring at something completely different… Personally my fingers are crossed for results appearing one-at-a-time on screen via increasingly elaborate star-wipes.

In less than two decades, social media platforms have become, for some, the biggest conglomeration of their thoughts, social network, photos and videos. Photo albums in the attic are no longer the storage spot for cherished memories — Facebook and Instagram are. So what happens to these accounts when you die? What legal rights do social media platforms have to your content, what legal rights does your family have to your digital content and what access will anyone have to it? Increasingly, the social media accounts people leave behind become ghostly presences on the internet, but each account is chock full of data, records and media from that person’s life, some of which was private or not meant to be shared. What happens to that? Each social media website has concocted a different response to this 21st century issue. Facebook Facebook takes the privacy of its users very seriously. So seriously, in fact, that when parents of a 15-year old who had committed suicide sought access to his Facebook account, Facebook fought tooth and nail to derail a court order to give the parents access. Facebook allows three options for each account. Account holders can designate a “legacy contact” in advance, who can pin a notification to your account, respond to friend requests, change photos and archive your posts and media. Whenever your death is reported to Facebook, your legacy contact will be notified of the actions they can take with your account. Your account can also be memorialized. The friend or family member who reports your death to Facebook can opt in to memorialization, which freezes your account, hiding it from everyone but your current Facebook friends who can view your profile and leave messages. Your account can also be deleted entirely, just like when you delete your own profile. Although Facebook retains an archive of all deleted profiles, your information will not be shared with anyone if it is deleted, except for your legacy contact who retains the ability to archive your shared information before deleting it. Twitter Twitter has adopted a similar policy to Facebook. Your private information will not be shared with anyone after your death, but your loved ones or will executors can have Twitter delete your account upon proof of death. You may also request to have a specific piece of media deleted, rather than the entire account, but Twitter may evaluate that piece of media’s social impact before deciding to delete it or not. Aside from deleting the account, Twitter offers no other options. Google Unfortunately, this massive conglomerate account will be the least straightforward for loved ones to handle. Your Google account includes YouTube, Gmail, Google Drive, Picasa and all other Google programs your account is linked to. If you have an Android phone, your Google account is linked to your phone. This is arguably one of the most important for your loved ones to access. Like Facebook, Google will permanently keep an archive of all your information, and your loved ones will never be able to access all of it. But they can apply for some access. Google reviews requests on a case-by-case basis and is not straightforward about what requirements it has to grant requests. Your best option is to use Google’s Inactive Account Manager feature to specify what you would like to happen to your account when you pass. You can choose a contact Google will notify and allow them to download data from the sections of your account you choose. Instagram Instagram is less open about its death policy. Buried in the privacy policy is a note that reads, “In the event of the death of an Instagram User, please contact us. We will usually conduct our communication via email; should we require any other information, we will contact you at the email address you have provided in your request.” The only option Instagram offers is to delete the account or leave it up. If your relative wants to delete the account, they can contact Instagram to delete it; otherwise, your account will remain unused and inactive on the internet. The best way to ensure your family members can get access to the information they need is to plan ahead and give your relatives a way to access your accounts. However, if your concern is your privacy, then don’t worry. All social media websites seem to have your back on this one.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Warner Bros names itself as a pirate Posted on September 6, 2016 by Nick Farrell - Business, News, Security Dumb-arse legal enforcers working for Warner Bros ordered a takedown of studio’s own site on Google claiming it was a pirate site. Vobile, a company that files hundreds of thousands of takedown requests every month asked the search giant to remove links to legitimate movie streaming websites run by Amazon and Sky, as well as the film database IMDB. According to Torrent Freak Vobile had made some “glaring errors” including asking Google to remove links to the official websites for films such as Batman: The Dark Knight and The Matrix. Licensed online movie portals such as Amazon and Sky Cinema were also reported for copyright infringement.  Companies such as Vobile typically work on behalf of major film studios, reporting illegally uploaded copies of movies and television programmes. Google’s transparency report says Vobile has submitted more than 13 million links for removal. Most of this is done automatically and the links are never checked. For some reason Vobile does not white-list obvious sites like warnerbros.com and amazon.com – but apparently. Fortunately for Warner Brothers Google decided not to remove links to Amazon, IMDB and Sky Cinema from its results.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version September 6, 2016 - 13:48 AMT SHARE Google reportedly readying successor to Nexus 7 tablet Prominent leaker Evan Blass claims that a 7-inch Huawei 7P tablet is being manufactured for Google and will be released before the end of the year, Engadget reports. Google first launched the Nexus 7 in 2013. Blass, who has successfully predicted the launch of many gadgets in his day, said the tablet would include 4GB of RAM -- but didn't include any other specs or any photos or renders. There hasn't been much other buzz around this tablet; Tech Times noted a similar rumor way back in December, and Huawei filed a trademark for the 7P earlier this year. A theoretical Nexus 7P would follow the current naming scheme with Google's Nexus phones. But with massive phones becoming more and more commonplace, the market for smaller tablets (like the older Nexus 7) appears to have shrank significantly. Also, it's not clear that the next phones Google releases will be branded "Nexus" at all, Engadget says. Recent rumors point out that the next Google phones might feature the Pixel brand, which has thus far been reserved for high-end Chromebooks and an Android tablet. Google's only Android tablet for sale now is the Pixel C, the company is rumored to be holding an event to show off its latest hardware on October 4. SHARE PanARMENIAN.Net © 2000—2016

These phones are said to be made by HTC and are said to be non-Nexus devices. However as it turns out, there might be new tablets in the works as well. This is according to a tweet by Evan Blass who suggests that this new tablet could be launched by the end of the year. According to Blass, he claims that this tablet is made by Huawei. Huawei and Google have worked together before with the Nexus 6P so this wouldn’t be that much of a stretch. Details on the tablet remain slim but apparently it will feature a 7-inch display and 4GB of RAM, but other than that we’re not sure what else we can expect. Assuming that the Pixel rumors are true, there might be a good chance that Google could also be moving away from the Nexus branding for its tablet, and that this could be a new Pixel device. Google has already launched the Pixel C tablet so we guess this move won’t be completely unprecedented. It’s interesting that these tablet rumors are arriving so late, which has us wondering if maybe the device will see a launch the same time as the Pixel handsets, which is rumored for the 4th of October, or if it will be towards the end of the year, but we guess we’ll just have to wait and see.

People started to think the mini-tablet line would never be updated following Google's release of 6-inch sized Nexus phones. Now renowned smartphone leaker Evan Blass @evleaks has Tweeted that a successor to the Nexus 7 is on the way and it will be released before the year is out. Last night @evleaks published the Tweet embedded below: Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) 5 September 2016 As you can see we don't have a lot of information about this new tablet, as this is the first we have heard about it. Obviously it will sport a 7-inch screen, the other specification we have is that it will have 4GB of RAM. Furthermore, with the new Huawei-made Google 7-inch tablet you can expect the latest version of Android to be installed, at the time of its release. Considering launch possibilities, the new 7-inch tablet could be part of the 4th October event where it is said Google will launch a pair of 'Pixel' branded phones made by HTC, a 4K Chromecast streamer, a Daydram View VR headset, and the Google Home household voice assistant. With Google recently having released tablets under the 'Pixel' name the Huawei-made 7-incher could also be brought under that banner, rather than becoming the Nexus 7 (third gen).

It has good reasons too and the vast majority will not care but certainly there are those still clinging to the AOSP and they are going to be in for a shock. http://www.radiofreemobile.com/google-android-closed-source-pt-ii/ Posted by this_is_gav - Tue 06 Sep 2016 11:09 Smudger Having had a Nexus 7 2012 then a Hudl 2 and a Shield K1, the 7-inch tablets just seems too small now. Looks nicely built though. Wonder if it'll be 1080p or higher?Agreed. 8 inch should probably be the size for smaller-end tablets in my opinion. There's no point having a 7“ tablet when my phone is 5.5” (Nexus 6P, so this is likely to be targetted at people like me). I can actually get my Shield K1 in most of my jean's pockets - if it can fit in a pocket it isn't a tablet. :p The Huawei 6P is awesome though. Even on the silver one the black strip on the back doesn't look out of place in person, though it is odd in pictures. Awkwardness when picking it up from a flat surface (combination of thinness and button placement I think) and battery life are the only minor criticisms I have, and even the battery is OK and good when you consider the width of the phone (if you ignore that visor).

This was what the Nexus range was all about. But this lead to at least a few compromises.  With the arrival of Daydream VR, and with so many hardware makers falling on financial hard times, Google couldn't afford any compromises. The Pixel is the company's first home-made smartphone. It offers the latest version of Android, with a few Pixel-specific features, and support for the as-yet-unreleased VR system. Google Pixel Review: Design The Pixel may not have been technically built by Google, but neither is the iPhone technically built by Apple. It's commonplace to have another company building the actual hardware. For the Pixel, Google chose HTC, a company which has seen its own-brand devices slump in popularity over recent years. But here's the good part: HTC knows how to build really good phones. Google Pixel and Pixel XL: When and where can I get them? Think back to the Nexus One, undoubtedly one of the best-made Nexus phones released. It was built by HTC. More recently, the HTC One Series, ranging from the M7 to M9, all drew plaudits for their industrial design. In short: Google couldn't have picked a better hardware manufacturer. And it shows in the device. Everything about the exterior design and manufacturing feels deliberate, purposeful and precise. Whether you're looking at the textured power button, the Type-C port and flanking cutouts for the mic and speaker, the 3.5mm jack or the weird glass panel on the back, it's all exact. Pocket-lint Then there's the soft bead-blasted metal finish on the back which rounds really nicely towards the perfectly flat edges and the large angle chamfers. All of it is so well finished and designed, it's impossible to ignore. We're not particularly fond of the unusual-looking glass panel on the back, which hosts the camera, sensors, dual-tone LED flash and circular fingerprint sensor. But we get it. In an era where so many smartphones look the same, it's nice to have something different, something that says "this is the Pixel phone". With that, and the single "G" stamped on the back, it's recognisable as a device all of its own. Google Pixel tips: First things to do with your new Google superphone One element that's difficult to get used to is the position of the volume and power buttons. Most phones tend to have the power button lowest, whereas Google opted to put the power button above the volume switch. That means it's easy to accidentally turn volume down, rather than send the phone to sleep. Pocket-lint All these perks and quirks are packed in to a phone which fits really nicely in the hand, feels durable, and has a heft of class without being too heavy. Google Pixel Review: Display With the Pixel being the smaller of the two new Google phones, the 5-inch screen features fewer pixels than its big brother, the Pixel XL. While the larger model has a Quad HD screen, the Pixel has a Full HD panel. Still, 1080 x 1920 pixels shoved into a display that's only 5-inches diagonally makes for a very sharp screen. At 441 pixels per inch, everything is crisp. It is AMOLED too, and comes with all the benefits and drawbacks of choosing that over LCD. Specifically, colours are vibrant, contrast is high and blacks are deep. That means it's fantastic for watching movies, gaming, or viewing anything with lots of colour. Pocket-lint It does mean that whites aren't quite as pure as they would be on a good LCD panel - they come across as ever so slightly warm, but you're unlikely to notice unless you have it side-by-side with an iPhone or other device. On the whole, the Pixel's display is one of the nicest we've seen on a phone at this scale. The panel itself is so close to the glass surface that viewing angles are superb, and content almost appears as if it's on the surface. Google Pixel Review: Software The Google Pixel comes with the brand new version of Android Nougat. But you can take what you know about 7.0 Nougat and throw it away, because the Pixel Launcher and software are considerably different to the software we've been using since the first Nexus developer preview went live a few months ago. Pocket-lint First up is Google Assistant, the voice controlled assistant. It is, essentially, Google Now packaged in to a more human, chat-like user interface. It has many of the same functions you're used to - like telling you the weather, knowing your calendar events, setting reminders, sports scores and much more - but packaged in to an interface that's more intuitive. Part of the setup process - when first powering up the phone - is training it to recognise your voice, the same way Google Now does when you want the "Ok Google" command to wake it up when it's dormant. You can also launch it by tapping and holding the virtual home button. Now, instead of launching a Google Search interface, the command launches a chat thread, similar to Google Allo, the company's messaging app, in the bottom half of the screen which then expands once a question has been posed.  Pocket-lint The beauty of Google Assistant is that it keeps learning. As time goes by, and you use it more, its predictive reply suggestions are more tailored to the kinds of things you would ask or say. Like Google Allo, these appear as individual bubbles underneath the most recent response from Google.  Unlike every version of Android so far, there's no app drawer button. The familiar dotted circle icon has been replaced by an app drawer that simply drags up from the bottom of the home screen. While the gesture feels more intuitive, the biggest benefit of this is that it allows you to have a fifth app icon pinned to the dock. Google Pixel tips and tricks: Getting to grips with Google's phone The app icons themselves have been given a new feature too. Similar to the iPhone, you can bring up app shortcuts for some of the default Android apps like Messenger, Calendar, Camera and Dialler. Because there's no pressure sensitive screen, you bring these up by long-pressing the app.  Another new addition in the Pixel launcher is the wallpaper picker, which now has a vast collection of default wallpapers, including some breathtaking landscapes and cityscapes from professional photographers, as well as Google's own live wallpapers. Some of these react and change colour to match the time and the weather, others are just Google Earth images that move slowly and react as you swipe through home screen spaces.  Pocket-lint All the default app icons are now round, as are the folder windows, and you can quick-reply to notifications without leaving the app you're in, or from the lock screen. But, apart from those design changes and features, there are some real benefits to having a Pixel phone over another Android smartphone.  Firstly, the Google Photos app allows you backup all of your photos in full size, original resolution, for free. Normally, on other Android phones or iPhone, you only get free unlimited backup space if you choose to reduce the quality. What's more, there's no time limit on the offer. As long as you have the Pixel phone, you get full resolution backups.  Secondly, the Settings app has a second tab giving you quick, easy access to a support team. You can call them or start a text-based chat with them as they help you through any issues you're having.  Pocket-lint Apart from those features, the software is otherwise Android 7.1 Nougat as we know it. That includes the split-screen multitasking mode, which seems a little wasted on a 5-inch screen. Although it is still useful for those odd moments when you need to reference a video, map position, or quote while typing an email or message.  Easy access to your battery performance from the drop-down menu - which, by the way, you can access now by swiping down on the Pixel Imprint sensor on the back - is a much welcome addition, as is the ability to add, remove and rearrange quick settings tiles.  Google Pixel Review: Performance One of the benefits of creating its own phone, is that the Google software can be fine-tuned to run like a charm on the hardware. With its clean, stock Android experience, there's no bloat or additional software to get in the way. That means everything is very snappy and smooth in operation. In fact, we'd go as far as saying it's the most responsive Android phone we've ever used. Pocket-lint While a big part of that is the new lightweight software experience, it's also down to the efficient and powerful Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor and 4GB RAM that's on board. Game animations are stutter-free and smooth, while load times are as quick as you'd hope for from a flagship phone. It may not get the highest benchmark scores we've seen during tests, but it still runs like a dream - and that, ultimately, is what matters most. There's the option for 32 or 128GB of storage and as anyone who owned a Nexus will tell you, there's no provision for microSD card expansion here. That's a downside compared to many flagship Android phones. Sure, Apple has never offered expandable storage and that works for iPhone; Android does and in this new competitive "phone by Google" world, customers will expect such features. Google Pixel Review: Battery Life On paper, the 2,770mAh battery may not seem like it would be capacious enough to offer great battery life, but that's where numbers on paper can deceive. There are a couple of things worth taking in to consideration that ensure the Pixel's battery lasts well beyond a full day of regular use. First is thanks again to that software. Like Android Marshmallow before it, Android 7 Nougat has Google Doze. This essentially means that when the phone is put down on a surface and in standby, any excessive background processes are killed. This ensures there's little battery usage when the phone isn't in use, like when you're asleep. Unlike Marshmallow, Nougat's Doze mode is also active when the phone is in your pocket, or in your hand. It doesn't have to be lying still on a flat surface. In short: if your phone isn't being used, your battery isn't either. Pocket-lint With light use, our Pixel got from 07:30 to 18:00 with 60 per cent of its capacity left. For light users, this Pixel phone could even be a two day phone. Most days, we got to bed time with between 30-40 per cent charge remaining. That was after spending most of the evening testing the phone's performance (AKA playing hours of Temple Run 2). For heavy users, we suspect the Pixel would still get you to the end of a work day comfortably. Regardless of how long it lasts any specific user, the phone still charges really quickly, thanks to its Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 support. Google claims you can get seven hours worth of battery juice from plugging it in for just 15 minutes. Our experience says you should be able to fully charge it in little over an hour. Google Pixel Review: Camera Google claims its camera is among the best out there, pointing to the often-cited DxOMark mobile scores to prove to us all that it's the best camera on a smartphone to date. In our experience, it is good, but it's far from perfect. Pocket-lint One of its early flaws - which could presumably fixed with a software update - is its tendency to get the white balance wrong. In some photos, it applies a white balance as if lightning is incredibly cool, and overcompensates by making the scene more yellow. Almost as if an orange filter has been placed on the outside of the lens. We found this happened on both the front and rear facing camera. With that said, it is capable of producing some really great shots. Even without manual controls - which we've come to expect from top Android phones - it can create photographs with great colour and detail. Perhaps more impressive is that it captures them very quickly. There's almost zero waiting time between hitting the shutter button and the shot being captured. One element which surprised us was how well it coped in low-light situations. Even without manual exposure settings, and with the flash switched off, it can shoot sharp, blur-free images with great colour quality. Pocket-lint It sometimes has trouble focusing on objects close-up, so macro shots are hit and miss. With instances like this, and with the white balance issues, we can't help but feel a manual or "pro" mode with customisable ISO, shutter speed, white balance and focus would be hugely beneficial. But that's not the Pixel's focus: it's all about simplicity. Verdict The Google Pixel is the best Android experience available right now. For the first time we get to see exactly what Google has in mind for hardware design and features. Google is completely in control, and you can tell. Everything is tight, refined and polished to a degree we've never seen in a Nexus phone. Of course, this year, the Pixel arrives without the usual Nexus cheaper-than-flagship price. Indeed, the Pixel costs as much as an iPhone - and that could potentially come back to bite Google. On the other hand, with Samsung's reputation needing some serious work given Note 7 issues, the more-expensive-than-usual Android phone couldn't have come at a better time for Google. If you're after a 5-inch Android smartphone then there's simply nothing else on the market that compares to the Pixel. And because it's a Pixel, made by Google, you'll get prompt software updates, regularly, promptly and for at least a few years. You're not at the whim of a hardware manufacturer or a network operator. From £599, Amazon Sections Google Android Phones OnePlus 3T vs Google Pixel XL: What's the difference?

Android-86… Fancy using Android on your computer? Android-86 released first build of Nougat for the PC By Christian de Looper — September 5, 2016 1:45 PM Subscribe to this topic Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends It’s safe to say that Android and Intel don’t play that well together these days, and neither Google nor Intel are doing much to change that. Despite that, however, the Android-86 project, which is aimed at bringing Android to computers, is alive and well. In fact, the Android 7.0 build for developers has just been released through the project. What does that mean? You can now run Android 7.0 Nougat on your computer. Related: Google testing a new, streamlined search history format on Android Of course, it’s important to note that the software, which is based on Google’s Android Open Source Project, is still under development. You will, however, be able to enjoy some of Nougat’s standout features, such as multi-window mode and split-screen mode. It’s also important to note that the project is by and large aimed at developers. The official page for Android-x86 tells you how to create the operating system from the source, but you’ll need to know what you’re doing in order to do that. To download a disc image, you can head over to Geek Til it Hertz. Of course, Android on a PC might not be the best choice for everyone, especially because of the fact that it doesn’t yet support all of Nougat’s features. For example, the file manager doesn’t yet work. Before the Nougat build was made public, there was a build of Android Marshmallow for computers in the form of Remix OS. Remix OS was stable enough to run on computers, and was created specifically to run fast and perform well. It also excelled in things like multiple window support, optimizations for the keyboard and mouse, the taskbar, and so on. Android Nougat, however, will bring a number of great new features to the operating system. The aforementioned multitasking features are perhaps the most important, however the OS also brings improved notifications, and customizable quick settings.

Google Will No Longer Be Accepting Grantspro Status Applications – What Should You Do Now? Nate Wood Head of biddable media 6th September, 2016 What happened? The Grantspro program has been a real boon for charities, giving eligible institutions up to $40,000 of monthly AdWords budget. The grant has helped many charities to gather donations from the search that otherwise would have put a strain on their digital marketing budgets. For some charities the aspiration to graduate from standard Google Grants into the Grantspro program prompted an effort on optimising existing grants and AdWords activity to meet the eligibility criteria. However, on Thursday 1st September Google very quietly announced on its Grantspro support page that it would no longer be accepting applications for Grantspro status. This isn’t the first time that Google has paused the Grantspro application process, with a similar action taking place in 2013 when the Grantspro team updated the eligibility criteria. The program was accepting applications again by June 2014. This time, though, it looks as if the action may be a little more permanent. Google’s official response to the action is as follows: “The Ad Grants team is no longer accepting applications for the Grantspro program as part of new efforts to streamline the program. This update aside, the program will continue to remain open and free to all eligible non-profits.” So, what should you do? With the pause on new applications we recommend the following: All existing Google Grantspro grantees should continue to optimise their activity to continue to meet your eligibility requirements. The reported streamlining may change the eligibility criteria, so ensure that you are fully on top of all correspondence from Google and continue to ensure that you are squarely meeting all requirements. For all existing Google Ad Grants recipients the eligibility criteria can still be used as a goal in your activity optimisation. All of the criteria indicate a healthy account, with good practice driving performance forward. If you’re not already optimising your account with this in mind then now is the time to do so, as the efficiencies gained from having these best practice actions in place can have a positive effect on your overall AdWords performance and Google Ad Grant efficiency. If you are a charity that has not yet applied for a Google Ad Grant then do so now. There is not yet any indication that the standard Google Ad Grant program will be reviewed, but we still recommend applying and getting activity set up. Google offer free advertising for your charity and the standard amount of $10,000 per month can provide a real boost to your fundraising activity. Fresh Egg has helped a number of charities with Google Ad Grants applications, account setup and account optimisation. We have a useful introductory guide to Google Ad Grants that you might like to read before perhaps giving our team a call to discuss your options further.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Tablet Google may launch a Huawei-made 7-inch tablet this year Tablet Google may launch a Huawei-made 7-inch tablet this year By Sohil Nikam - It’s no secret that Google will soon be introducing us to its new range of flagship smartphones, but what’s new is that there might even be a tablet to accompany them this year. It is being said that the search giant has commissioned Huawei to make a 7-inch tablet that will be released before the end of 2016. This bit of information comes via the Twitter account of serial leakster Evan Blass, who has also mentioned that the supposed tablet will feature 4GB of RAM. With a screen size of 7 inches, it will replace the much loved Nexus 7 slate which was introduced way back in 2013. But there are serious doubts about what it will be called though. Rumors are indicating that Google will be referring to this year’s Nexus phones as Pixel and Pixel XL. With that in mind, does the 7-inch tablet become the Pixel 7? Alternatively, Google might even end up naming it the Nexus 7P, as Huawei had apparently filed a trademark for ‘7P’ earlier this year. Also Read: Android 7.0 Nougat starts rolling out for Nexus devices The Pixel C is the only tablet which Google has in the market right now. Even its Nexus 9 tablet ceased production in May this year, after its average reception. And with the Pixel C being a large 10.2-inch tablet, a 7-inch slate running the latest Android software sounds very much like a good idea. If only Google gets its pricing and functionality right. Now that the news is out, we’re expecting more details about this 7-inch Huawei-made tablet to keep popping up in the coming weeks. So stay tuned.

Earlier reports pointed out that HTC is making this year’s Nexus phones and there are two of them — Pixel and Pixel XL, codenamed Sailfish and Marlin, respectively. “Google’s Pixel XL has allegedly surfaced on a Geekbench benchmark listing recently, showcasing a couple of pieces of information that seem to confirm once more that the codename for the device is Marlin,” technology website AndroidHeadlines.com reported on Tuesday.  Pixel XL is expected to have an aluminium unibody design, a rear-facing fingerprint scanner, and a 5.5-inch screen, according to earlier leaks. Pixel XL is rumoured to pack quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor clocked at 1.59GHz paired up with 4GB of RAM and will be running on NMR1, a version of Android 7.0 Nougat operating system. According to other rumours, the devices will run Android Nougat 7.1 out of the box. Some reports have suggested that Pixel lineup will replace the existing Nexus lineup to realign the hardware line.

Students looking for help writing research papers can turn to an online reference manager to streamline the process. Several popular tools provide platforms that store articles, features that generate bibliographies, and functionality that encourages collaboration on projects. But these tools aren’t just for people taking college courses. Anyone who needs a way to keep his research organized can benefit from one of the following services. Here’s a look at several popular research and reference managers, including their key functions and new features, as well as a sneak peek at their future upgrades. EndNote With the EndNote bibliographic management software, users can find, use, and share research, as well as collect, organize, and format references. They can sync their EndNote libraries across Mac and Windows desktop computers, on iPads, and online. Parent Company: Thomson Reuters Tagline: “Use your research superpowers for good—leave the organizing to us” Mobile Apps: Apple App Store Social Media: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube Features: “Find it,” “Create it,” “Store it,” and “Share it” are EndNote’s four main functions for research management. Users can search online databases to find full-text articles and autocomplete their references. They can create and format citations in more than 5,000 styles using the built-in bibliography maker. Storage involves organizing and marking up files “in any way that works” for the user, and sharing means collaboration with teams and with the global research community. Customers: EndNote is used in the academic, corporate, and government sectors. What’s New: As part of the release of EndNote X7.2, EndNote added a library sharing feature that allows users to collaborate on research with up to 14 other colleagues and peers. Users can share their entire EndNote library—including references, PDF files, and annotations—and everyone in the group can use the library simultaneously. Existing X7 users (as well as new users) also received unlimited storage capacity with the X7.2 release. What’s Next: EndNote concentrates on the idea that research is a collaborative effort and will continue to make its tools collaboration-friendly. It will also add more support for managing all research assets and begin to offer recommendation capabilities that support the research workflow. During the next year, Thomson Reuters plans to move the traffic from its EndNote online forum into the EndNote Community, which is a platform that allows users to share tips and tricks with each other. Flow (now RefWorks) Flow is billed as “the only workflow tool you need.” It’s a reference and document manager with a variety of features designed by ProQuest’s Research Solutions team, whose mission is to “empower researchers to discover, grow, and thrive.” Parent Company: ProQuest Tagline: “Research Better” Mobile Apps: ProQuest plans to launch a responsive tablet user interface for Flow in late 2014, with small-screen responsiveness planned for early 2015. This means that formal mobile apps will be unnecessary, since Flow will adjust to various screen sizes on its own. Features: Flow lets users collect research, collaborate on work, and research anywhere. They can click to import their existing references and annotations into Flow, as well as click to drag full-text articles to the platform from anywhere on the web, even from behind paywalls, and Flow automatically enters the reference metadata. Using its collaboration options, researchers can share readings with up to 10 people for free and jointly annotate documents with people from any institution around the world. And it’s cloud-based, so there is no software involved; research is available instantly on any device. Flow for Word syncs with a user’s library to create citations directly in a Word document even while offline. Customers: Flow is available for academic, corporate, and government libraries and information centers. It caters to more than 1,200 organizations as well as to individuals who opt for free personal (2GB of storage) or premium plans (10GB of storage). What’s New: ProQuest introduced a Google Docs add-on for Flow so that its document management tools integrate with Docs to help users find, annotate, and share documents in the cloud, as well as work in a common virtual space with others. The add-on includes a selection of 3,000 output styles for bibliographies and citations. ProQuest also integrated Flow with its Summon discovery service to give researchers persistent access across both platforms, which means that search results from Summon can be saved in Flow, and users can create Flow accounts while working in Summon. What’s Next: ProQuest’s goal is to embed Flow at the center of each phase of the research workflow in order to streamline and simplify the research process. The company will continue to integrate with tools that specialize in various phases of the process and will deepen its existing integrations with Summon, Word, the ProQuest platform, and the Google Docs add-on. Upcoming enhancements include the expansion of the Summon integration to capture full text and the ability to integrate with the ProQuest platform so users can save documents to Flow directly from results lists. Mendeley Mendeley is a free reference manager and academic social network for students and researchers. It’s available for Mac, Windows, and Linux systems, as well as for iOS devices. Parent Company: Elsevier Tagline: “Your research, anywhere.” Mobile Apps: Apple App Store Social Media: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Flickr, LinkedIn Features: Mendeley’s five main features help users organize and share their research: 1) References, documents, and notes are securely stored, fully searchable, and accessible across platforms (i.e., desktop computers, web browsers, or mobile devices) from one place; 2) PDFs are available for highlighting, annotating, and adding sticky notes both online and off; 3) Users can generate citations and bibliographies—compatible with Word, LibreOffice, and BibTeX—as they write in the style they choose; 4) Users can share reading lists, references, or full-text articles publicly or privately and collaborate with groups that work together on research assignments and papers and share feedback; and 5) Colleagues, peers, and classmates can follow each other’s research outputs and showcase their published research. Customers: More than 3 million researchers use the service, including students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and the University of Cambridge. What’s New: A new API launched in September that allows the service to build on its third-party app ecosystem and offer its users more functionality. Among other enhancements, the documentation on Mendeley’s developer portal now includes tutorials, and its GitHub account has more SDKs (software development kits) and code samples. What’s Next: Mendeley is currently building an app for Android devices. Paperpile Paperpile is a web application and browser extension for people who want to manage their research library in Chrome. They can sign up with their Google account and must have Chrome (for Windows, OS X, or Linux) or Chrome OS. The tool’s goal is to simplify research collection and management as well as paper writing. Parent Company: Paperpile, LLC Tagline: “No-fuss reference management for the web” Mobile Apps: According to the FAQ, dedicated mobile apps are in the works. For now, Paperpile PDF files are viewable using the Google Drive app on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Social Media: Facebook, Twitter, Google+ Features: Paperpile uses Chrome’s technology to bring typical desktop-only features to a web application that integrates reference management into the Google Apps ecosystem. For example, users can format citations and collaborate with colleagues to write papers with Google Docs, regardless of whether each participant uses Paperpile. Papers can be organized by folders and with labels and starred as favorites, and research can be filtered by author, journal, or item type. When users find a reference on the web (from integrated sources such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Twitter, and hundreds of journal sites), Paperpile downloads the PDF, names it, and stores it in Google Drive so the content syncs across devices and can be shared easily via a private web link. Paperpile helps users manage and export reference data by fixing incorrect information, finding duplicates, and performing other tasks automatically. Users can create bibliographies in more than 7,000 citation styles and access up to 30GB of free storage space on Google Drive. Customers: Due to its integration with PubMed, Paperpile attracts scientists from a variety of fields, including life science and medicine and physics and engineering. Humanities researchers can also benefit from Paperpile’s storage capabilities, which can accommodate gigabytes of digital books. Paperpile offers personal subscriptions, group licenses, and site licenses for university and research institutes. What’s New: This summer, Paperpile announced five key updates that simplify paper writing in Google Docs and enhance its service. Google developed a Suggestions feature that helps users track, discuss, and accept or reject individual edits in Google Docs, and it added superscript formatting functionality to Docs. Paperpile officially introduced the ability to create footnote citations; added support for italic, superscript, and subscript formatting; and allowed the use of Citation Style Language (CSL) to format customized citations. What’s Next: Future plans include a customer-requested feature: annotations for PDF files that will allow users to add “sticky notes” to the documents and highlight text. Users’ annotations will save directly to the PDF files so they can view them with any PDF viewer, not just Paperpile’s. This functionality will be part of an upcoming release. ReadCube ReadCube is a free tool for Mac and Windows systems that helps researchers, libraries, and publishers manage their literature, find new articles, annotate PDF files, and perform other related tasks. ReadCube’s bookmarklet adds papers to a user’s ReadCube library from any browser. Parent Company: Labtiva Tagline: “Bring your Papers to Life.” Mobile Apps: Apple App Store Social Media: Facebook, Twitter, Google+ Features: ReadCube’s features include enhanced PDFs, personalized recommendations, a citation tool, syncing and backup capabilities, and watch folders. Users can view optimized PDFs alongside supplements and related materials, access a full reference list, use notes and highlighting tools, customize the viewer interface, and more. Recommendations for papers are delivered daily based on the content in a user’s library. SmartCite, its citation management tool, supports 6,000-plus citation styles and allows users to input citations directly from sources such as PubMed. Citation data remains on a manuscript while users collaborate with multiple authors. SmartCite also works directly with Microsoft Word. ReadCube Pro, which costs $5 per month or $50 per year, offers unlimited cloud syncing and storage that makes a user’s ReadCube library, notes, lists, and annotations available on multiple devices. Watch folders automatically import PDF files saved in laptop folders to the ReadCube library. Pro perks also include advanced article metrics. Customers: ReadCube’s users live in 220 countries and work from more than 2,500 institutions. These include Harvard University, Imperial College London, and Zhejiang University. What’s New: This summer, ReadCube released a new HTML5-compatible web reader and an updated app for iOS devices. New publisher partners include IGI Global, the Canadian Medical Association, De Gruyter, and Wolters Kluwer. What’s Next: ReadCube will add new functionality to SmartCite, as well as introduce an Android app, a Web-based library, and its own search engine. It is also looking to enter into new collaborations and integrations with publishing partners.  Brandi Scardilli is the editor of NewsBreaks and managing editor of Information Today.

A Huawei-made 7-inch device is reportedly set for release before the end of 2016. The original Nexus 7 really shook up the tablet market on its release in 2012, while its 2013 follow-up was one of the best devices around at the time. However, stores were soon flooded with 7-inchers of varying qualities and the sector became over saturated. Google moved onto other screen sizes, with the HTC-made Nexus 9 being the most recently available, and it was thought that the age of the 7-inch tablet had passed. According to @evleaks though, the Nexus 7 is to return. Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 We know little about it at present, with the serial leakster only posting its existence and that it will have 4GB of RAM, but his Twitter posting does correlate with one former rumour. Huawei filed a trademark for the name "Huawei 7P" in spring leading a few to suggest a new Nexus tablet could be on its way, or even a massive phone. Thankfully, now it looks like it'll be a Nexus 7P tablet rather than a stupidly large mobile handset. Let the floodgates open for the inevitable flood of leaked pictures and specs.

So far, the company's platform lead devices are expected to feature the Pixel brand. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones are expected to be unveiled on October 4, and now new intel on the two smartphones has cropped up online. The Google Pixel XL was purportedly also run through Geekbench, revealing some key specification details. However, alongside these two smartphones, Google is also expected to launch a new 7-inch Pixel tablet as well. Google will unveil all of these products in October, and also release the first major maintenance release of Android Nougat 7.1 alongside. The build number of this first maintenance release has also been leaked, and is expected to be NDE63B.Beginning with the tablet, Evan Blass has tipped that Google has asked Huawei to build a 7-inch tablet. Blass claims that the tablet will sport 4GB of RAM, and will be released before the end of the year. Blass does not use the word Nexus in his tweet hinting that Google could be unveiling another Pixel-branded device to complement last year's 10-inch Pixel C. And while Blass hasn't provided a tangible timeline for release, it will most likely launch it alongside the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones on October 4. Coming to the smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL devices were leaked recently, and new information about the camera on board has now surfaced. Both the smartphones are expected to sport the same Sony cameras at the front and back. According to tipster LlabTooFeR, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will have a 12-megapixel camera with Sony IMX378 sensors at the back, and an 8-megapixel front camera with Sony IMX179 sensors on the front. While the sensors are a slight upgrade from the predecessors, what these sensors might exactly entail remains unknown at the moment. The Google Pixel XL was also tested on Geekbench, and the listing reveals that the smartphone will be powered by the Snapdragon 820 SoC paired with a 4GB of RAM. It is also seen running on Android NMR1, which could possibly be the first maintenance release of Android Nougat. LlabTooFeR has also revealed that the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will be running on Android Nougat 7.1. He revealed that the build number for Andorid Nougat 7.1 is NDE63B. While the worldwide release is pegged for October, Gadgets 360 has learnt that Google may release the new smartphones "in a handful of countries including India" in September. Previous leaks suggest that the Pixel smartphone sports a 5-inch display and will be priced at $449 (roughly Rs. 30,000). The Pixel XL is the larger of the two with a 5.5-inch display, and is expected to be priced at $599 (roughly Rs. 40,100).

Shares close 5% higher It’s been a good day for Sports Direct investors, as well as for workers who can wave goodbye to that hated Six-Strikes list of offences. Shares in the company just closed, up 5% today at 349p -- a level not seen since the Brexit vote -- as the City welcomes today’s report into the ‘serious shortcomings’ at the sports retailer. That means Sports Direct is now worth £2.083bn, by my calculations, up from £1.98bn last night. And 55% of that increase has gone to Mike Ashley, who still owns more than half the company. The rally appears to be driven by optimism that Ashley is (belatedly) tackling its corporate governance failures, and put some of the Shirebrook scandal behind it. But that might be too optimistic; as we’ve been covering through the day, unions, lawyers and commentators all fear that Sports Direct isn’t going far enough. We have to wait another year for the new 360-degree assessment, announced today, to see how sweeping the company will be will be. In the meantime, the Shirebook agency workers will still be stuck on their old zero-hour contracts, meaning Ashley’s dream of retail excellence is someway over the horizon. Wednesday will be another big day for Sports Direct, as it faces shareholders at its AGM. Will chairman Keith Hellawell be forced out? Will the media get some proper answers from Ashley (he’s got a certain reputation for reticence with the press pack)? Tune in tomorrow to find out..... Sports Direct to ditch zero-hours contracts Read more Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.03pm EDT 12:03 Our financial editor Nils Pratley has spoken - today’s report is simply ‘too tame’, and lets Mike Ashley off too easily. Nils writes: Welcome news: Sports Direct and Mike Ashley have decided they will no longer defend the indefensible. The company acknowledges “serious shortcomings” in working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse that it “deeply regrets and apologises for”. The notorious six strikes and you’re out policy has been abandoned. Past payments below the minimum wage are described as “unacceptable but unintentional”. In stores, staff will be offered the chance to switch from zero-hours contracts to ones that guarantee 12 hours of employment a week. And Sports Direct is not saying the matter is closed: a fuller review of working practices and corporate governance will follow. Jolly good, but let’s not pretend that this report is independent. It was written by one of the company’s legal advisers Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, and sections and phrases read almost as if they were dictated by Ashley....

Here’s the details: One of the UK’s biggest commercial property landlords has begun inserting anti-slavery clauses in tenancy contracts amid growing scrutiny of working practices at retailers including Sports Direct International. Sky News has learnt that Hermes Real Estate, an £8.2bn property group which is part of Hermes Investment Management, recently told Sports Direct of its anger at working conditions for the chain’s warehouse and shop-floor staff. Hermes Real Estate has also asked lawyers to include anti-slavery clauses in all new lease management contracts - although the provisions do not apply to existing tenancy agreements, according to people close to the situation. More here: Jeannie Dumas (@Dumes618) Sports Direct Landlord Hermes Turns To 'Anti-Slavery' Clauses https://t.co/gBf6SppEEs @hermesinvest #corpgov September 6, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.52am EDT 10:52 Although CEO Dave Forsey gets plenty of criticism in today’s Sports Direct report [as explained earlier] Mike Ashley avoids the blame bucket. Instead, the inquiry restricts itself to rather bland reminders that the company’s founder (and driving force) can’t be expected to know everything that’s going on. For example, this section paints Ashley as a man with a commitment to excellence: Where there is rapid growth in lean structures and fast moving markets there is a greater strain placed on the business when it is trying to comply with its moral and legal obligations to its staff and the community. Growth businesses need to work harder to ensure that their working environment is and remains a healthy and productive one and even more so if it aspires to be one of the best places to work in retail, as stated by Mr Ashley. A fine aspiration, of course.

Partner Emma Satyamurti says: “Having raised issues arising from the use of Zero Hours contracts in previous litigation against Sports Direct, we are pleased that today’s report suggests the company has finally realised that its use of these types of contracts is problematic. However it remains to be seen when and how this new commitment will be implemented, and whether historic injustices will be addressed. “We remain concerned about the agency workers at Sports Direct’s Shirebrook warehouse, as this group do not appear to benefit from the guaranteed hours commitment made in Sport Direct’s media campaign launched ahead of tomorrow’s AGM – this pledge appears to be limited to staff directly employed by Sports Direct. Leigh Day is already fighting a court case for Sports Direct workers who were excluded from its staff bonus scheme as they didn’t hold permanent contracts, as Satyamurti explains: “We continue to represent 188 Sports Direct staff and ex-employees who missed out on bonuses because they were on zero hours contracts. Our clients, many of whom are long serving, worked hard to generate the large profits from which Sports Direct has benefited, yet were excluded from the bonus scheme run by the multi-billion pound company.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.20am EDT 09:20 Pressure continues to mount on Sports Direct’s top brass.

For example, Forsey is criticised for not ensuring that the company actually has a proper contract with the agencies supplying thousands of workers.... During the oral evidence of Mr Ashley before the [BIS] Committee [ he was asked about whether he should know more about the contracts between Sports Direct and the Agencies. He observed that he couldn’t know everything about every contract. These agreements were ultimately the responsibility of Dave Forsey (“Mr Forsey”) as Chief Executive and others in the Retail Team who dealt with the Agencies on a day to day basis. In fact on investigation there appears to be no formal signed contract in place for either Agency. Effectively the terms and conditions are based on custom and practice and/or unsigned terms. Forsey is also blasted for allowing workers to be paid less than the national minimum wage (as they hang around to be searched at the end of their shift): At the management level Mr Forsey had failed to inform the Board (or Mr Ashley) of some of the issues namely the progress of the NMW issue in a timely or effective manner over the course of a year or so. Warning signs that had been given off by the media and to a lesser extent the Unions regarding NMW issues had not been heeded properly or adequately and so some points were not escalated. These sound like career-limiting mistakes for a CEO. But not, apparently, at Sports Direct -- Forsey is still in his role, but has been ordered to give up his £3.6m bonus.

And two of the biggest unions aren’t prepared to drop their concerns, just because the company has apologised and pledged to mend its ways. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady has echoed Labour, by pushing for zero-hours contracts to be canned. “An apology is always a good start, but this is too little, too late. What we really need is an independent investigation, as called for by the trade union resolution at tomorrow’s Sports Direct AGM. “A report written by a law firm which previously represented Mike Ashley and management simply won’t cut it. Sports Direct cannot be allowed to mark their own homework. “Cases like this show why the government must act to end the abuse of zero-hours contracts, and get serious on enforcing employment rights. The Unite union, which played a major role in uncovering the Sports Direct scandal, also wants Mike Ashley and co to do more - starting by curbing its use of agency staff. Assistant general secretary Steve Turner explains: Unite still has concerns over the use of the two employment agencies, The Best Connection and Transline, which supply over 3,400 workers to the Sports Direct Shirebrook warehouse. For Unite it has been their behaviour and the lack of oversight that has been the cause of so many of the abuses at Shirebrook. “We therefore call on Sports Direct to reconsider its proposal to only move 10 agency workers a month onto direct, permanent contracts. At that rate it will take over 340 months or 28 years for the whole of the agency workforce at Shirebrook to be moved on to secure, direct contracts.

And he should know, having worked undercover at Sports Direct’s warehouse last year. One key blindspot is that the report doesn’t really question why SPD employs so many agency workers at all (rather than putting them on staff -- and guaranteeing them more rights). Simon writes: Sports Direct has never given a proper justification as to why it needs to employ the vast majority of warehouse staff on temporary contracts all year round. Some workers have been there for years on these “temporary” arrangements, which even the report acknowledges are “arguably a form of “zero-hours contracts”.

I hope this isn’t the last word from Mr Ashley, and that we can look forward to further such announcements in coming weeks, particularly regarding warehouse staff. “But we cannot rely on bad publicity to stamp out every instance of employers mistreating their staff. The Tory Government need to follow Labour’s lead and commit to banning zero hours contracts and other exploitative practices in the workplace. “Surely modern employers value their workforce as their most important asset. We have launched Workplace 2020 because we believe that profitable and efficient enterprises in the 21st Century can and should have up-to-date personnel practices including the right for the workforce to join a union.” Here’s more details on Workplace 2020, which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn outlined in May. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.22am EDT 05:22 It’s important to remember that Sports Direct isn’t abolishing zero hours contracts for agency workers at its Shirebrook warehouse [today’s offer of permanent contracts only applies to casual staff at its shops]. That’s significant, as most staff in Derbyshire are employed by agencies, not SPD itself. The Resolution Foundation says we still need better protections for agency workers [who are often on the lowest wages with the least benefits]. Their policy analyst Conor D’Arcy says: “Today’s report into working practices at Sports Direct highlights the pernicious effect of job insecurity on people’s lives. “The move to offer guaranteed hours to staff on zero hours contracts is welcome and one that government should consider more widely, especially for those who have been on ZHCs for long periods of time. “However, the fact that most staff at the Shirebrook warehouse are actually on agency books shows that there are many forms of employment contract at the bottom end of the British labour market that need closer scrutiny.” Updated at 5.24am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.17am EDT 05:17 Today’s report may not take the heat off Sports Direct’s chairman, Keith Hellawell.

Huawei could be building Google's next tablet Rumours have emerged via VentureBeat journalist Evan Blass that Google has a "Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year" (The Verge). Should the report be accurate, the tablet – a presumed replacement for the Nexus 9 – is likely to be officially announced at Google's forthcoming launch event on October 4, where we're also expecting to see the company's Daydream VR system and a pair of new smartphones. Huawei is the maker of Google's current Nexus 6P smartphone.

US tech giants oppose government gagging orders A broad array of US technology, media and civil liberties organisations have attached themselves to a lawsuit launched by Microsoft against the US government's continued use of gagging orders when it demands that the firm hand over customer data (Ars Technica). Key to Microsoft's complaint is that, of 2,576 gagging orders attached to law enforcement requests for customer data, including emails, over an 18 month period, over two thirds defined no end date, meaning that Microsoft is never to be allowed to inform the customers in question that their data has been subject to seizure. Microsoft says that this is a violation of the USA's Fourth Amendment: the people's right not to be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures of their property. Among the companies supporting Microsoft's lawsuit are Apple, Google, Mozilla, Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union, BP America and Fox News. 3. Softbank completes acquisition of UK tech giant ARM Japanese technology and telecoms firm Softbank has completed its acquisition of British semiconductor designer ARM Holdings, best known as the company behind the processor designs that power the majority of smartphones and Internet of Things devices (TechCrunch). Now that the deal has received final regulatory approval, ARM is to today be delisted from the London Stock Exchange. Softbank arranged to pay £24 million for the firm in July, when doubt following the Brexit vote had pushed down the value of the pound. ARM is now one of many Japanese holdings in the UK that inspired Japan's government to take the unusual move of issuing a list of demands for the UK's Brexit negotiations on the basis of what would be best for continued international trade and business. 4. Rosetta captures image of its lost Philae lander on Comet 67P Just three weeks before the Rosetta spacecraft is scheduled to carry out a controlled crash-landing onto the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which it's been orbiting since August 2014, it's sent back visual confirmation of the location of its lost companion Philae lander (WIRED). While the lander remains inoperable, these images, taken at a distance of 2.7km, confirm its shadowy final resting place. Philae has been silent since July 9, 2015, and it was presumed that the lander’s battery had run completely flat after falling into a sun-starved patch of rock. In January 2016 Esa officially classified the lander as being in "a state of eternal hibernation" as it was unlikely to have enough power to send out any signals to Rosetta.

Air pollution leaves magnetic particles in the brain New research has found that industrial and urban air pollution leaves residual nanoparticles of magnetite – a magnetic iron oxide – in the human brain (Science). Barbara Maher and her team from Lancaster University worked with colleagues in Mexico to examine postmortem samples of 37 human brains from Manchester and Mexico City (Science). The team's findings indicated that the vast majority of magnetite found in the brains took the form of nanospheres, indicating an artificial origin, compared to the tetrahedral and octahedral shapes of naturally occurring magnetite. The presence of magnetite in the brain has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. 6. Russia arrests YouTuber for playing Pokémon Go in church Russian YouTube videomaker Ruslan Sokolovsky has been arrested after releasing a video of himself playing Pokémon Go in the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg (The Guardian). Sokolovsky, who made the video after seeing news reports warning that players could be jailed if they were caught playing the game on church property, has been charged under Russia's strict laws against inciting hatred and offending religious sensibilities and is to be detained for two months. While representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church have praised the arrest, mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Roizman described the affair as a "disgrace", commenting that "you can’t arrest a man for idiocy." 7. Elon Musk's hyperloop transportation could be coming to the UK One of the many details that emerged in WIRED’s 5,600 word, exhaustive investigation into the hyperloop – the super-fast, vacuum-tube transportation system proposed by Elon Musk – is that it could eventually be built in the UK. Hyperloop One told WIRED that it has held conversations with the government and private companies about potential UK routes and "there’s been quite a strong response" from the government. UK government representatives also attended Hyperloop One’s much-publicised propulsion test in Nevada, in May 2016. The comments were made by Alan James, global VP of business development at Hyperloop One, who previously lobbied for UK Ultraspeed before joining the company. "Innovate UK has taken the lead on that. It is joining together the department of Business, Innovation and Skills, and DFT [Department For Transport], to produce a coordinated response to the hyperloop opportunity." "It’s very early stages," a spokesperson for Innovate UK confirmed to WIRED. "This is a really exciting technology and we’re following it with interest."

By: Tech Desk | Updated: September 6, 2016 1:03 pm Huawei’s 7-inch Android tablet will be a successor to Google’s somewhat successful Nexus 7 tablet from back in 2013 (Image of Nexus 7 for representation) Google might be ready to launch a new 7-inch Android tablet in collaboration with Huawei this year. The tablet is expected to come with 4GB of RAM, according to noted tipster Evan Blass. Google had achieved some success with its Nexus 7 tablet back when it was launched in 2013. Since, then the market for tablets itself has dried up – so it is interesting to see why Google is planning to come back in it. Huawei’s 7-inch Android tablet will be a successor to Google’s somewhat successful Nexus 7 tablet from back in 2013. There is no additional information on the tablet as of yet. Two of Google’s smartphones dubbed Pixel and Pixel XL are rumoured to launch in October. Google has decided to do away with the the Nexus name ,and will now focus on the ‘Pixel’ moniker. The smaller (5-inch display) of the two devices, Pixel – is codenamed Sailfish, while the larger (5.5-inch display) device, Pixel XL is codenamed Marlin, according to an AndroidPolice report. Both devices are being built by HTC. Google had introduced its Google Pixel C tablet back in December 2015, which went on sale in US at a starting price of $499. The tablet features a 2560×1800 resolution 10.2-inch display, with 308 ppi. The tablet comes with an attachable full-size keboard that needs to be purchased separately. It features 3GB RAM an comes in two storage variants – 32Gb and 64GB. The Pixel C was Google’s own hardware.

Actually, it still might not, considering it’s technically still an unverified leak. For leakster LlabTooFeR, however, it’s pretty much a done deal. And considering how the initial Android 7.0 release missed a couple of things, that’s almost a given. Now all we have to do is wait for about a month to see if Marlin and Sailfish, both from HTC, will indeed be the first of Google’s new line of Pixel smartphones. The Android 7.0 Nougat that landed but a few weeks ago wasn’t exactly the full story we’ve come to expect based on leaks. That discrepancy was explained away with the “fact” that the leaked Android versions were actually from Maintenance Release 1 or MR1, which would be known as Android 7.1. Conspicuously missing was the new Launcher, Google Assistant, and full on Daydream support. Those will supposedly land together with Google’s new smartphones, which may no longer be called Nexus smartphones. Made by HTC, the larger Marlin and smaller Sailfish are said to be called the Pixel XL and Pixel, respectively. The two will mostly be the same, differing only in size, display resolution, and battery capacity. All of that will take place on October 4th, believed to be Google’s date with the press. Joining that party will be the first Daydream VR headset, which will represent Google’s new vision for the hot new trend in technology. Also coming is a little bump to Android Wear, though with very few new smartwatches to flaunt.

Intel said it plans to use the Movidius acquisition to position the chip giant to provide computer vision and deep-learning solutions from the device to the cloud. In an article earlier this year, we predicted how the Movidius chip will be the Pentium of the machine age. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. ‘We recognise that specific system on a chip (SoC) attributes will be paramount to giving human-like sight to the 50bn connected devices that are projected by 2020’ – JOSH WALDEN, INTEL “We’re entering an era where devices must be smart and connected,” explained Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s New Technology Group. “When a device is capable of understanding and responding to its environment, entirely new and unprecedented solutions present themselves.” Next step in computing will be machines that think and see for themselves How Intel sees the near future of machines with the ability to see and think for themselves Walden said that Movidius’ technology will put Intel at the forefront of this new wave of computing. Movidius, he said, will fit in with Intel’s RealSense vision and strategy. ‘Computer vision will trigger a Cambrian explosion of compute, with Intel at the forefront of this new wave of computing, enabled by RealSense in conjunction with Movidius and our full suite of perceptual computing technologies’ – JOSH WALDEN, INTEL “Simply put, computer vision enables machines to visually process and understand their surroundings. Cameras serve as the ‘eyes’ of the device, the central processing unit is the ‘brain’, and a vision processor is the ‘visual cortex’. Upon integration, computer vision enables navigation and mapping, collision avoidance, tracking, object recognition, inspection analytics and more – capabilities that are extremely compelling in emerging markets.” The Movidius story Movidius founders David Moloney and Sean Mitchell Dublin-headquartered Movidius was established 10 years ago by David Moloney and Sean Mitchell to bring deep-learning capabilities and machine intelligence to devices ranging from smartphones to today’s drones and VR headsets. Earlier this year, the company struck a lucrative deal with Google to ship its MA2450 chip in upcoming personal devices, including Google’s latest VR headset technology. The key to the deal was Movidius’ ability to make devices like smartphones contextually aware – in effect making phones, robots and drones capable of seeing and understanding their environment. What followed was a number of key deals and breakthroughs, including the launch of the world’s first autonomous drone for Chinese drone maker DJI, the DJI Phantom 4 in March. In June, the company scooped a major deal with Chinese electronics giant Lenovo to power its future range of VR devices. Movidius recently raised €38m in a move that will enable it to generate 100 new jobs in Dublin. The company now has offices in Silicon Valley, Ireland, Romania and China. According to Walden, a major revolution is underway and Intel aims to be at the forefront of it. “We recognise that specific system on a chip (SoC) attributes will be paramount to giving human-like sight to the 50bn connected devices that are projected by 2020.” He said that, with the pending acquisition of Movidius, Intel gains low-power, high-performance SoC platforms to accelerate computer vision applications. It also gives Intel algorithms tuned for deep learning, depth processing, navigation and mapping, as well as natural interactions and broad expertise in embedded computer vision and machine intelligence. “We see massive potential for Movidius to accelerate our initiatives in new and emerging technologies,” Walden said. “The ability to track, navigate, map and recognise both scenes and objects using Movidius’ low-power and high-performance SoCs opens up opportunities in areas where heat, battery life and form factors are key. Specifically, we will look to deploy the technology across our efforts in augmented, virtual and merged reality, drones, robotics, digital security cameras and beyond. “Computer vision will trigger a Cambrian eexplosion of compute, with Intel at the forefront of this new wave of computing, enabled by RealSense in conjunction with Movidius and our full suite of perceptual computing technologies.” The arrival of the distributed computing age “From a first meeting with promoter Sean Mitchell, to its initial investment in 2008, we knew we had a winner with the talented and ambitious founders of Movidius,” said Tom Shinkwin, partner at Enterprise Equity, the first Irish institutional investor in Movidius. “Managing risk with early stage investing is what Enterprise Equity does best. Augmented by world class leadership, Movidius has grown successfully over many rounds of funding to become a world leading vision processing company enabling a new generation of intelligent devices.” Atlantic Bridge, an investor in Movidius, also responded to news of the acquisition. “It is difficult to believe now, but back in 2013 when Atlantic Bridge led the $16m A-round investment in Movidius, many analysts and industry peers did not believe that a new microprocessor company could emerge as a leader in an intensely competitive and mature industry,” said Atlantic Bridge Ventures in a company blog. “We were more optimistic, recognising early on the potential disruption the Movidius’ vision processing unit (VPU) technology could bring,” it added. “Computer vision was identified as one of the first real commercial opportunities but the fundamental game-changing technology that Movidius had developed enabled deep neural networks and machine-learning applications of all kinds to be performed in real time on battery-powered devices. “The core platform that Movidius had developed enabled for the first time highly-efficient machine intelligence systems to be moved to the edge of the network, improving latency for real-time applications, reducing bandwidth requirements while minimising battery power consumption on the device. The age of distributed intelligence systems had arrived.” This story has since been updated to include comments from some of the early investors in Movidius, Enterprise Equity and Atlantic Bridge Related: M&As, robotics, AI, drones, employers, Movidius, Intel, VR Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Companies Intel acquires machine-learning start-up Nervana Systems for $408m 10 Aug 201615 Shares Hiring Now Always at the cutting edge of new innovation Join us to create the technology of tomorrow The largest employer in northwest Ireland Innovation for mobility and the internet of things Machines IBM acquires Watson-based personal shopping chatbot from Fluid 2 Nov 201631 Shares Companies Intel to spin out McAfee cybersecurity unit in $4.2bn deal 8 Sep 201613 Shares WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT FEATURED EMPLOYERS?
