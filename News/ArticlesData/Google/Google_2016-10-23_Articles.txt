With self-driving technology set to fully take over our roads by 2020, and several states already seeing Uber self-driving cars taking passengers around, the type of change we're going to see will trickle down to every angle of the transportation industry. Eventually, we'll be witnessing a change that will have an impact on several sub-industries that rely on people driving on the road. With Tesla's direct-to-consumer model, we're already seeing disruption in the car dealership segment. This article will explore the impact self-driving cars are going to have on the transportation industry and how this will affect other businesses that rely on the automotive industry -- such as insurance, gasoline and the legal professionals who cater to car accident related litigations. 1. The cost of insuring a driverless car. The biggest area of pay-off for insurance companies is insuring cars and their drivers against accidents. Human error has been reported as the biggest cause of road accidents -- a situation that will be totally taken care of by cars that require no human input. "The higher your risk of getting involved in an auto crash, the higher your premium will be," says Gabriel Levin, a car accident lawyer based in Philadelphia. "Since unmanned cars are designed to reduce road accidents by taking away the single biggest cause of these road accidents, which are human drivers, then insurance companies would be forced to seriously lower their premiums to stay competitive." Yes, we should be happy that self-driving cars will help reduce accidents on roads and in effect, lower insurance premiums for owners. However, should an autonomous vehicle be involved in a crash caused by the computer, who then bears the liabilities and how would the party responsible recoup their losses without it trickling down back on the consumers? A scenario would be when a car manufacturer is made to pay for liabilities and then it increases the cost of their new cars as a result. Related: 3 Ways to Create Successful Proprietary Tech 2. Auto dealership will take a hit. With the likes of Google and Uber on the cutting edge of self-driving car technology, there will be little left for the car dealership industry. When Tesla came on the market with its direct-to-consumers model, the company was quickly tagged as a niche player. Google and Uber would drive an enormous amount of sales, and they won't be dealing with auto dealers. When all automakers make the move from gasoline to all-electric cars to stay competitive in an industry whose laws are being written by nimble tech giants, they might also be forced to shed some weight. Cutting ties with the numerous dealers who may not be adding much value to consumers would be their first move. The auto dealership industry has about a $864 billion market and accounts for more than a million jobs (2015 data). Related: The New Rules for Business Riders in an Uber, a Driverless Car and More 3. Gasoline will take a back seat. Moving from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric cars means gasoline will have an even lesser role to play in transportation in the near future. We'll have to find some better use for our oil. 4. Passengers will learn to warm up to autonomous vehicles. The first passenger-related challenge would be the driver learning to accept his role as an observing passenger who should be prepared to take over when necessary. Related: Will We Still Need Stoplights in the Self-Driving Future? While driverless cars are designed to ferry passengers to their destinations without input from a human driver, there are instances where humans still have to take control. For example, the abundance of driverless cars on the road today are still struggling with making sense of driving in a construction zone. We should be prepared for this era by learning to adapt to a better human-computer relationship.

Pocket-lint Sections Apps Cameras Cars Drones Fitness Trackers Gadgets Games Headphones Laptops Parenting Phones Smart Home Smartwatches Speakers Tablets TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Google’s standalone VR/AR headset: What’s the story so far? Elyse Betters25 October 2016VR Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google's VR vision extends beyond Cardboard and Daydream. The company began embracing virtual reality a few years ago when it launched a Cardboard DIY headset with a viewer certification program. Then, in 2016, it introduced the Daydream VR platform, followed by a Daydream mobile VR headset that uses a smartphone for processing power. While those two projects should be keeping Google plenty busy, it hasn't stopped there. It is now reportedly working on a headset that doesn't need a smartphone or PC to power it (much like the Oculus Santa Cruz prototype headset teased in October). It's not limited to VR, either. It'll supposedly blend virtual reality with augmented reality, meaning it might function a lot like Microsoft's HoloLens headset. In other words, Google is being very ambitious. Here's everything we know so far about Google’s standalone headset. Keep in mind we're in early days territory here, so some of the finer details aren't yet known, but we'll continue to update this piece over time as more information about the headset surfaces. Google's VR/AR headset: What's it called? We currently don't know what Google's upcoming AR/VR headset will be called. A codename hasn't even popped up yet. Google's VR/AR headset: How will it work? All-in-one headset First of all, Google's virtual-reality headset will be more legit than Cardboard. The Wall Street Journal said Google is developing an "all-in-one virtual-reality headset". It doesn't require a secondary device, such as a smartphone, computer, or even a game console, meaning it would be one of the first headsets in recent history to power and display a VR experience all on its own. Even the $599 Oculus Rift relies on a PC. Keep in mind, Facebook-owned Oculus VR recently demoed a standalone prototype it's working on, which you can read all about here. Santa Cruz is basically a cable-free version of the Rift. From what we can tell, the form factor of the Santa Cruz looks nearly identical to the Rift, though it appears to have a motherboard/computer on board, which is roughly the size of a deck of cards, attached to the rear head strap. Like the Santa Cruz, Google's planned standalone headset should deliver a quality experience. It will feature a screen, high-powered chips, and outward-facing cameras. Google plans to use chips from Movidius, and the cameras will be able to track the motion of the user's head. It's worth noting this WSJ report from February 2016 followed news that Google named Clay Bavor as its VR chief. Google is working on a VR headset that doesn’t need a phone However, in July 2016, Recode claimed Google decided not to take on Oculus, HTC, and PlayStation. The company was said to prefer the mobile VR route instead and actually ditched its more ambitious plans for VR. Scrapping the standalone headset came at some cost, the report claimed, because around 50 employees were reportedly working on it as well as a VR operating system separate to Android. Google scrapped plans for own Oculus Rift VR headset Augmented reality As of October 2016, Google might be working on a standalone headset that's part virtual reality and part augmented reality. According to Engadget, the device will use sensors and feature integrated eye-tracking technologies and algorithms that let it "map out the real-world space in front of a user", essentially blurring the lines between VR and AR (which sounds a lot like Project Tango technology). Engadget said Google's upcoming VR/AR headset will work without a smartphone and offer an experience that's not as closed off as current VR headsets. It therefore might function like Microsoft HoloLens. Movidius, the computer vision company that Intel is acquiring, is once again rumoured to be supplying some of the components powering the headset. Google's next VR headset might ditch the phone and include AR Built-in radio In October 2016, new documents filed with the US Federal Communications Commission revealed Google is testing a prototype wireless virtual reality device. The documents asked for permission to conduct testing on the device with its employees, contractors, and developers. They also stated the new device would transmit across a very broad range of frequencies, from 2.4 GHz to 5.8 GHz. The Drum said this suggested Google's VR headset has a built-in radio similar to the Google Glass augmented reality headset that was discontinued in 2015. The documents also listed Mike Jazayeri as one of the contacts on the fillings. He joined Google in 2005 and previously worked on Google's Cardboard headset. According to his LinkedIn profile, he is now the director of product management for Google's VR group. Google's VR/AR headset: Is it a Daydream headset? No. The headset is being described as "high end" and will reportedly be separate from Google's Daydream mobile VR platform. Google's VR/AR headset: When will it be available? We currently don't know when Google's VR/AR headset will be available, but Daydream will start shipping in November in the UK and US. Google's VR/AR headset: How much will it cost? We currently don't know how much Google's VR/AR headset will cost if and when it launches for consumers.

It’s no secret, companies use that information to create a digital profile of you. It's similar to those targeted ads on your Facebook timeline. If you are worried about your privacy, Google is paying attention. The company has created free tools to give you back some privacy control. One is the Google activity tool. It shows your recent activity. "If you've created a couple of different linked Gmail accounts, you'll see all of that activity in one place,” Theresa Payta, a cyber security expert said. You can also get rid of that information so Google can't use it in the future. "You can choose to delete that activity. In addition, it will give you the opportunity to decide what is monitored for your activity and stored going in the future,” Payta added. Google also has a privacy tool. It guides you through your privacy settings and helps you figure out what information you want to share. Google says it's keeping your personal information private, but cyber experts say if you don't want all your information out there then don't share it to begin with.

Instead the handset was revealed to only have an IP53 rating. So what gives? Turns out that Google had originally intended to give its Pixel phones waterproof capabilities, but ultimately ran out of time to do so. This was revealed in a WIRED podcast around the 32 minute mark (via Pocket Now) where Google had told them that they planned waterproof features, but towards the end of 2015 they decided to start over with its Pixel phones, meaning that they only had about 9 months to design and produce a handset from scratch. It is because of this that the waterproof features got omitted, presumably because Google wanted to focus more on the core features and waterproofing was tossed to the wayside. That being said, the Pixel phones have so far been pretty well-received. Despite its IP53 rating, a recent water test has revealed that the phone is actually able to survive being submerged underwater for about 30 minutes. Granted this could be an anomaly so don’t go around dunking your Pixel phones just yet, but from the test it does seem to suggest that the phone could be tougher than we thought. Filed in Cellphones.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Speed Test: Google Pixel XL versus Samsung Galaxy S7 edge By R Padla - October 24, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Google Pixel XL, aside from its smaller sibling and the LG V20, is one of the latest premium flagships recently introduced in the market. Since the Note 7 is no longer a threat, the Google-branded phone is now being compared side-by-side with the S7 edge. The latter is the most recent flagship phone from Samsung before the Note 7 was launched. This Speed Test done by SuperSaf TV is a detailed speed test between the Google Pixel XL and Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. This includes checking the fingerprint unlock, camera launch, browser, mobile apps, , gaming, and multitasking. The Galaxy S7 edge used here is an Exynos version running Android 7.1 Nougat while the S7 edge is powered by Snapdragon 821 and Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Overall, the two smartphones are fast, showing very minimal difference. In some cases, the Pixel edged out the S7 edge but watching the video below, we can say the old Samsung device is slightly faster when it comes to loading apps. The devices are neck-on-neck when launching the camera and opening basic to more intensive games. Opening a browser and YouTube is a bit faster on the Pixel phone. When it comes to opening games such as Angry Birds, Temple Run, Subway Surfers, and Dead Trigger 2–the Galaxy S7 edge is faster. Looking at the benchmark tests, the two are higher in both single and multi core tests but the S7 edge still has the higher numbers. However, multi-tasking seems to be faster on the Pixel XL. We’re not sure if the speed is because of the RAM or the Qualcomm S821 or is it because the device is more recent.

The update includes a minor visual refresh and reorganization, and quietly adds the backbone for enabling Chromecast Ultra, the actual Google Home hardware, and support for controlling all of these Cast devices via Google Assistant… If you don’t have a new Google Home or Chromecast Ultra, you won’t notice much new in this update. It’s still used for setting up and managing your Cast devices and finding Chromecast content. But the app does get rid of the search bar and the “devices” tab, and renames the section previously titled “What’s on” to “Watch”. There’s also a new app icon. Previously under the devices tab, there’s now an icon in the top-right hand corner that pulls up a list of all your connected devices. And interestingly, if you have a Chromecast connected, enabling the “Backdrop settings” section now includes mention of “voice control,” assumably via Google Assistant. As far as we can tell, however, this feature hasn’t been enabled quite yet. While the quick teardown we did on this app didn’t reveal any unsuspected changes, it did show us that the new app does indeed mention the Chromecast Ultra, the Google Home hardware, Google Assistant integration, and more. We’re still digging around, so we’ll let you know if we find anything else of note in the app. This update is rolling out as we speak, and it might be available for you right now in the “Updates” section of “My apps & games” in the Play Store app. If not, you can likely get the app by deleting the Google Cast app from your phone and downloading it again. If that still doesn’t work, you can manually download and install it via APKMirror. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

Roston - Oct 24, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit We heard rumor awhile ago that Google is working on a standalone virtual reality headset that’ll also serve as a platform for augmented reality applications. Joining that rumor is a new spat of sources claiming this standalone VR/AR headset will include eye-tracking technology. According to these sources, the headset will also boast sensors for mapping the real world around the headset user. The information comes from Engadget, which says it learned about the features from sources who know about Google’s plans. This standalone headset will differ from Daydream in multiple ways, according to reports, the most notable being that you won’t need a smartphone to use it. The headset will be poised to augment the world around users, as well, using both the eye-tracking technology and sensors/algorithm combo to display digital objects in the IRL environment. Both positional awareness and eye-tracking will be facilitated in part by chips from Movidius, according to the sources. What the headset looks like, though, and how it works isn’t clear at this point. Assuming sources are correct, you won’t have to use a computer to power the device either, removing both the PC and smartphone tethers. Google isn’t the only company with augmented reality aspirations. Microsoft has showed off some of the possibilities of AR with its HoloLens, the likes of which include things like putting a fish tank in the room that doesn’t actually exist, overlaying a digital pet into your environment, and so much more. In the mean time, Google has launched its Daydream VR headset to go along with its new Pixel smartphones, giving consumers a relatively inexpensive alternative to things like Oculus Rift with better capabilities than Cardboard. Not familiar with Daydream? We’ve got all the details on it, as well as Google’s other new devices, here.

A two-day thumping wiped out more than $1 trillion across global bond markets worldwide, on bets that plans under a Trump administration would boost business investments and spending while firing up inflation. It was the worst rout in nearly 1-1/2 years.

But have you run out and bought your very own virtual reality headset yet? No. Not unless you’re a gamer or seriously tech’d-out early adopter.

Yes, even you Mom, and you’ll like them. A lot. For the first time ever, this year’s holiday shopping lists will be packed with requests for VR headsets from kids and adults alike who want to give virtual reality a spin. According to IHS Markit research, within the next two-and-a-half years, regular ole’ people like you and me will snatch up more than 80 million consumer VR headsets. Why? Trying to explain VR to someone who’s never tried it, is like trying to describe the color red to someone who can’t see it. It’s tough to put into words. The best I can do is this: You strap a headset on and the real world fades away. When you look around, you don't see your office or living room, you see a completely new space that wasn't there before, filled with things that can delight, scare, awe, thrill, educate, entertain, and just plain blow you away. My teenage daughter might say, “it gives you all the feels,” and it does. Along with the intense immersion into this new virtual world, comes a new level of emotional stimulation. Even with the cheapest VR headsets, you’re likely to have an “oh wow moment,” kind of like the first time you saw a 3D movie. Buying In If you’re thinking about trying it out yourself, or getting a VR headset or system for someone as a holiday gift, here are the top options available today. With something as basic as the $15 Google Cardboard — a kit you fold and form into a pair of VR goggles to slide your smartphone into — you can step into famous museums in London or Washington DC. You can walk around the galleries pondering works by Rembrandt, van Gogh, and Picasso like you’re actually there. It’s so much better than just clicking through a slideshow online, because it puts you in the halls, looking right, left, up, and down, seeing precious art from every angle, rather than just staring at a computer screen. Total Spend: Google Cardboard ($15) + phone ($200 minimum, works with iOS and Android (older phones work, but the experience isn't great) = $215 © Tobias Schwarz, AFP/Getty Images A journalist uses a smartphone equipped with a so-called "Google Cardboard" mount to use it as a VR (virtual reality) device for trying out a new offer developed by Google's platform "Google Arts & Culture" and the Museum of Natural History in Berlin, Germany. A big step up from there is the Galaxy Gear VR headset that works with newer model Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones. It’s basically magic, kind of like going from a black and white TV to color. It uses Samsung’s big, powerful Galaxy phones exclusively, and has some extra sensors built-in, so the feeling of really “being there” is kicked up a notch. Some of the best Android VR apps like Ocean Rift ($9.99) — where you dive into a sea packed with dolphins, sharks, whales, and countless other ocean oddities, and never have to worry about your oxygen level —  are built specifically with the Gear VR in mind. If you already have a newer Galaxy phone, this is a great choice because it’s inexpensive, high-quality, portable, and a really comfortable fit overall. Total Spend: Galaxy Gear VR ($99) + phone ($400 minimum, cheaper with plan) = $500 PlayStation VR is a perfect way to upgrade from your phone-based virtual reality, especially if you already have a PS4 gaming system. It really is a gamer’s machine at this point: Strap on the high-end headset with motion controllers to track your movements, learn a few basics, and suddenly, you’re in the cockpit of an X-wing, dog-fighting through galaxies far, far away in Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One: X-wing VR Mission ($29.99). Or, you’re Bruce Wayne living through the earliest days of his transformation in Batman: Arkham VR ($19.99). I’m not an avid gamer, and yet it was cool to be surrounded by the finery of Wayne Manor, then descend into the Batcave and slip into the iconic Batsuit. The experience is amazing, but if you’re not into gaming, the novelty of PSVR wears off quickly. You can still kick back and watch a Netflix movie, but it’s still too early to be a general consumer must-have gadget. Total Spend: PlayStation VR bundle (with camera and controllers) ($499) + PS4 ($299) = $800 Moving up from PSVR, is the top tier of virtual reality with the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. These systems use a combination of headset sensors, high-tech controllers, and room-scanning cameras to track your position in 3D space, letting you actually walk around your room while staying immersed in the virtual world. This is also where you’ll find the most mind-blowing experiences in virtual reality, like Grand Canyon VR ($4.99), where you slowly paddle your canoe through the canyon at your own pace and take in the sights and sounds around you. I also love Star Chart ($9.99), which is like owning a super-powered telescope that can see every bit of our solar system and constellations up close. The kind of experiences you can have with these more capable systems are essentially limitless, and some of them will remind you of that feeling you got the first time you used a computer. (Unless you’re too young to remember that…) The one major drawback of the Vive and Rift is that you’ll need a powerful PC computer to run the apps, which boosts the overall price up a great deal if you don’t already have one. Total Spend: HTC Vive ($799) + computer ($600 roughly) = $1400 Oculus Rift ($599) + Oculus Touch controllers ($199) + computer ($600) = $1400 If you pay attention to this stuff and noticed that I didn’t review Google’s new Daydream View VR, that’s because I haven’t been able to get my hands on it yet. It looks to be similar to the Galaxy Gear VR, but I’ll let you know as soon as I go hands-on. Here’s the bottomline: Try VR as soon as you can — in a store, at a mall, or at your geeky friend’s house. See what all the fuss is about. But it’s okay if you wait another year or even two, to buy-in. It’s early —  and this tech and what you can use it for —  is just going to keep getting better.

The Google Pixel is an amazing phone hidden in a boring body Polygon 10/24/2016 Ben Kuchera © Provided by Polygon Google’s drab-looking Pixel line of phones are going to be many things to many people, but it’s hard to overestimate just how important Google’s move into high-end hardware will prove to be for smart phones in general and portable virtual reality in particular.  Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 58.12 -0.90 -1.52% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 719.07 -19.94 -2.70% We were sent a Google Pixel XL, the larger of the two models, in anticipation of the release of Daydream. Daydream is a virtual reality platform that’s set to take the basic ideas behind Google Cardboard a step further. The idea is to create a virtual reality platform that’s not as disposable as Cardboard, while offering a headset that resembles sweatpants much more than it does a piece of technology. But Daydream isn’t here yet, so let’s talk about the phone. I inserted the AT&T SIM card from my personal phone — an iPhone 6S Plus — and attempted to use the Pixel for a week to get a sense for the hardware before it became the brain and display of our Daydream review unit. There are two things that define the Pixel: It’s fast, and it’s boring. The speed My god it’s fast. Apple prides itself on creating responsive, zippy phones, but the Pixel seemed to chew through both standard tasks and complex assignments with ease. Android is many things, but it often suffers from carrier-ordained cruft and a somewhat sludgy feel in less capable handsets. The Pixel is Google’s attempt to create a high-end competitor to the iPhone, and with Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and 4 GB of RAM, the Pixel delivers that. One of the Pixel’s closest competitor was the Samsung Note 7, and that thing explodes. Google needed to show up, match the price and speed of the latest iPhone and avoid the pitfalls of the myriad flavors of Android that often feel like the digital version of walking down Times Square. It achieved those goals, and more. This is arguably the best Android device you can buy. So yeah, if you want a responsive, powerful Android device? Google has you covered and, since it’s Google, you won’t have to wait for software updates. Pixel runs Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box. But now let’s talk about how boring it is. The Android iPhone The Pixel looks like an iPhone from the front, even though there’s no front home button. There is a section of the rear of the unit that’s made of Gorilla Glass and features a fingerprint sensor, and that’s basically it. There’s a letter “G” on the back to let you know it’s from Google. The materials feel good in your hand, and it’s clear that this is a premium device, but it’s the opposite of flashy. It’s unlikely you’ll ever be using it and have someone ask what it’s like to use a Pixel. John Gruber wrote an amazing post about the “boring” nature of Apple’s design language with the iPhone line, and Google is basically drafting behind Apple, benefiting from the decreased wind resistance. © Provided by Polygon Google Pixel “Here’s the genius of the black and (especially) jet black iPhones 7,” Gruber wrote. “In a very seductive way, they look like something new and desirable. And at the same time, they are instantly recognizable as iPhones. That is what ... I’m-bored-with-Apple’s-designs pundits don’t get. With a highly successful product and brand, new versions need to strike a balance between familiarity, the foundations of the brand, and hot newness. The bored-with-Apple crowd just wants the hot newness.” Google didn’t really need to come out with a device that looked shockingly different nor did it feel the need to try to introduce you to any new design language. It’s a phone. Steve Jobs more or less decided what phones look like now when he and Apple introduced the first iPhone, and Google is secure enough to simply release a phone. The Pixel even comes with an adapter that allows you to plug your new phone into your existing iPhone to slurp down all your content. The little fold-out “get started” guide all but assumes you’re coming from an iPhone. What Google did was not easy. The company — along with HTC — created a phone that uses well-established design, is screamingly fast, features one of the best cameras on the market without feeling the need to announce itself visually. I see swagger where others complain about an uninspired design. And of course the whole thing is tied so tightly into the Google ecosystem that they’re inseparable. Google is more than happy to store an unlimited amount of photos and videos, and in fact there are options to have any backed up photos or videos over 90 days old deleted. The “free up space now” button option does the same thing. When you’re the manufacturer of the phone and the designer of the services included, “cruft” turns into “features.” While Apple is adding extra lenses to extend what its cameras can do, Google is exploring software options, to great effect. The only feature that makes me look longingly at the iPhone 7s is the water resistance, and the lack of it in the Pixel line is baffling. The counter-argument is the inclusion of a standard headphone jack, and it’s likely those two things are connected. Google created a phone that’s easy to use, fast as hell and is filled with a number of neat little touches that only become evident once you’ve used the phone for a bit. I thought the ability to waggle the phone to switch from the rear- and front-facing cameras was silly until I started to rely on it when taking selfies with my wife. So it looks like a phone. Big deal. That’s what we’re buying, anyway. But what about Daydream? That’s a good question, and it’s the reason we’re talking about the phone at all. Google is releasing a virtual reality platform called Daydream next month, and it’s the company’s next step in turning Cardboard and the content already available for it into something a bit more serious. All that speed we were discussing above is now very important not just to drive phone responsiveness, but to allow the high framerates necessary to maintain comfort in VR. This is also a shot at Samsung and Oculus, and by Oculus we mean Facebook. © Provided by Polygon Google Daydream View VR headset colors The Gear VR worked so well in part because Samsung allowed Oculus deep access to software and hardware of its phones. It was a special relationship, not to mention a selling point and a differentiator in a crowded market. Google has responded not just with Daydream as a platform, but by baking Android VR Mode into the latest version of the Android operating system as a whole. Anyone can release Daydream-ready phones as long as they conform to the specifications. That relationship between Samsung and Facebook is not only no longer so unique, it’s actively detrimental; when people hear Galaxy they think explosions, and that’s a deal breaker in a device you’re supposed to strap to your face. And Daydream is the reason I would suggest the Pixel XL to anyone interested in using this phone as their doorway into virtual reality. While the standard Pixel has a beautiful screen running at 1920 by 1080, that gives you a pixel density of 440 PPI, or pixels per inch, with the phone’s 5-inch screen. The Pixel XL has a similarly beautiful screen that runs at 2560 by 1440 and measures 5.5 inches, giving it a pixel density of 534 PPI. Pixel density matters when you’re using a platform that brings the screen that close to your face, and the XL is a significant improvement over the standard Pixel. For reference, the Oculus Rift “only” delivers a pixel density of 461 PPI. In practice this means that both models of Pixel phones are good enough for VR, but the Pixel XL will likely look better when placed in the Daydream viewer. It also means that VR enthusiasts may be surprised to find that the Daydream platform, while fueled by a Pixel XL, will have a clearer screen than their tethered head-mounted displays like the Rift or Vive. The Pixel is Google’s attempt at showing the world it can create the best Android device on the market, while attempting to bring VR to the masses and to further lock customers into the company’s myriad services and data-collection methods. It may look boring, but the world of both smartphones and VR will likely be changed fundamentally by its existence.

Here's why they're such a tempting target. Why it was so easy to hack the cameras that took down the web 0 Share: Security by Laura Hautala October 24, 2016 3:44 PM PDT @lhautala Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Xiongmai's webcams may have been at the heart of the hack Friday that led to outages across the web.Photo by Xiongmai If you were anywhere near the internet in the US on Friday, you probably noticed a bunch of your favorite websites were down for much of the day. Now experts are saying it's all because thousands of devices -- like DVRs and web-connected cameras -- were hacked. Once the hackers had control over these devices, they manipulated them into sending an overwhelming number of requests to a company that serves up the websites for Netflix, Google, Spotify and Twitter. When the traffic became too much to handle, the sites crashed. It was an old-school attack -- often called a distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS -- powered by the new web of devices called the internet of things. Security experts have been warning for a few years that internet-connected devices are susceptible to hacking. They just didn't know exactly what hackers might do once they broke into your connected television, refrigerator or thermometer, for example. (Other than some disturbing hacks on baby monitors, that is.) Now we have our answer, and it's worse than what the experts imagined. Focusing on security cameras and DVRs that record footage in businesses outside of the US, hackers created an army of devices to take down large chunks of the internet. It's not all the device manufacturers' fault. Websites and services will have to adapt and do more to prevent attacks like these from being so effective if we want to keep the internet up and running. Here's a primer on why the devices are so easy to hack, and how hackers turned them into a zombie army that attacked the internet. How internet-connected devices are easily taken over DVRs and security camera are connected to the internet. That's on purpose, of course. This feature lets users access them remotely, along with anyone else they need to let in. It's what lets users check in on security cameras when no one's at home or at a business, and what lets manufacturers update device software without making a house call. But this feature is also kind of a bug. Devices in the so-called internet of things are stupid-easy to connect to remotely by just about anyone, not just those with whom you want to share access. If something is connected to the internet, it has an IP address. If something has an IP address, it can be found on search engines like Google and Shodan, a searchable registry of IP addresses with information about the connected device. Hackers can find hundreds or thousands of hackable DVRs and cameras just by entering some search terms. Then, they try to break in... How hackers can break into your devices When zombie cameras attack Internet outage swoops across the US That massive internet outage, explained That massive internet outage, explained Internet-connected devices often come with default passwords. Think you're the only one whose username and password are "admin" and "admin"? Many, if not most, device makers don't require you to set a unique username and password, so many people end up sticking with the defaults. Hackers can find a list of vulnerable DVRs on search engines and try out that default password. If you never changed it, they're in. But even if you do change those defaults, hackers have other options. Advanced methods utilizing services called SSH and telnet let hackers force their way into your device, since changing the password on your device's web app does not necessarily change the password coded into the device. So while the camera was storing security video to prevent crime, hackers were quietly brute-forcing their way into the DVR and adding it to their army of attack soldiers. So how did a camera take down Twitter? To take over the cameras, hackers inserted Mirai, malicious software that lets bad guys use at least 100,000 devices as soldiers in its zombie army. That's according to Flashpoint, a cybersecurity company that has been tracking the proliferation of Mirai across the internet of things since it was first used in a massive attack in September. The technical name for this zombie army is a botnet, and hackers have been making them out of computers for a very long time. Now that hackers can make botnets out of the internet of things, they have a more powerful tool to carry out attacks like the one that happened Friday. They used the botnet to send tons and tons of junk requests to Dyn, a company that manages web traffic for all the websites that were affected. Dyn couldn't sort out the good requests from the bad, and as a result internet users in many parts of the US were cut off from a number of websites. Now you know how an army of DVRs and cameras kept you off Reddit for most of Friday. We still don't know who the hackers are and what they'll do next. It also remains to be seen how websites will change their habits to prevent outages like the ones we saw Friday. As for the manufacturers of internet-connected devices, there has been an interesting development. On Monday, connected-camera manufacturer Xiongmai said it will issue a recall of its devices caught up in the botnet army that attacked Dyn on Friday, according to Reuters. If more companies follow suit, it might give manufacturers more reason to lock down cybersecurity on their devices before putting them up for sale.

Share this article Share 192 shares A patent from 2011 emerged earlier this year showing its designs for a flying car, and Bloomberg reported it is now pursuing a 'simpler, more conventional-looking design.' Now, it has relocated to Hollister - and its new design has been spotted by locals. The attention grabbing plane has a high pitched, electric whine, they say. Video courtesy: Mercury News  'It sounded like an electric motor running, just a high-pitched whine,' Steve Eggleston, assistant manager at an airplane-parts company with offices bordering the Hollister Municipal Airport tarmac, told Bay Area News. It has also been spotted hovering by saleswoman Brittany Rodriguez thought to herself.  During both Zee.Aero flights witnessed by DK Turbines staff from several hundred yards away in September and October, the aircraft hovered about 25 feet off the ground, and landed rapidly, straight down, according to the witnesses. Google's company's co-founder, Larry Page appears to be secretly investing in flying cars. According to Bloomberg Businessweek , Page has personally provided £70 million ($100 million) to two startups developing the technology. In May, the cityapproved a 34-year lease with Zee.Aero for just under an acre of land near the intersection of the municipal airport's two landing strips.  It plans  to build a 14,000-square-foot hangar and office building, plus nearly 10,000 square feet of employee parking and 16,000 square feet of paved area for aircraft parking and movement. Zee.Aero have kept their designs very much under wraps, with the only information on their website stating: 'We're designing, building, and testing better ways to get from A to B.'  However, it has been reported that Zee.Aero has hired aerospace designers and engineers from Nasa, Boeing, and SpaceX, and has been testing two single-seater prototype designs - one that looks like a 'small conventional plane' and another with propellers along the sides. Zee.Aero have kept their designs very much under wraps, with the only information on their website stating: 'We're designing, building, and testing better ways to get from A to B.' One of the patents depicts a car-sized aircraft, wings at the nose and tail, and along the top eight propellers, driven by eight motors, for vertical lift.  Two other propellers on the rear wing would provide forward thrust.  Zee.Aero was set up in 2010, working on a small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically – essentially a flying car. Pictured is a Zee.Aero patent from 2011 THE FLYING CAR COMPANIES Zee.Aero was set up in 2010, working on a small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically – essentially a flying car.  While there was much speculation that the company was affiliated to Google, as their headquarters were next door, Zee.Aero fiercely denied the claims. However, it has since been revealed that Zee.Aero belongs to Larry Page, Google's co-founder.  Zee.Aero now employs close to 150 people. Its operations have expanded to an airport hangar in Hollister, where a pair of prototype aircraft takes regular test flights. In 2015 a second competing flying-car startup called Kitty Hawk, also began operations in its headquarters very near Google's.  Despite the apparent rivalry, Bloomburg have reported that Mr Page, has in fact been putting money into both Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk. Last week, an aircraft was spotted being towed down the runway on two consecutive days, although no hovering or flying was observed by witnesses. Dual propellers in the rear fit with the description and drawings from the patent, but the aircraft appeared to have a single main wing, with pod-like structures beneath it, rather than the smaller wings at the front and rear shown in the drawings.   Job ads on the firm's sight also confirm it is sticking with propellors, saying 'The aerodynamics group is responsible for supporting airframe design, propeller design, performance and stability analysis, handling qualities analysis and flight testing.'  In a May letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the firm said it was building 'an entirely new aircraft that will change personal aviation.' A Zee.Aero spokeswoman said the firm is 'currently not discussing (its) plans publicly.'  In May, the city of Hollister approved a 34-year lease with Zee.Aero for just under an acre of land near the intersection of the municipal airport's two landing strips. According to city documents, the company plans to build a 14,000-square-foot hangar and office building, plus nearly 10,000 square feet of employee parking and 16,000 square feet of paved area for aircraft parking and movement. Page has reportedly been funding Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk, two rival companies based in California's Silicon Valley. Mr Page has demanded that his involvement stay hidden from the public, according to 10 people with intimate knowledge of the company.  According to Bloomberg Businessweek , Google co-founder, Larry Page, has been personally funding two startup companies who are developing flying cars In 2015 a second competing flying-car startup called Kitty Hawk, also began operations in its headquarters close to Google's. According to business filings, Kitty Hawk's president is Sebastian Thrun, th­e head of Google's self-driving car programme and the founder of research division, Google X. Despite the apparent rivalry between the companies, Bloomberg has reported that Page, has in fact been putting money into both Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk. Mr Page and Google declined to speak about Zee.Aero or Kitty Hawk, as did Mr Thrun.  Other companies working on flying cars include Terrafugia. Their TF-X concept car (illustrated) has fold-out wings with twin electric motors attached to each end Bloomberg say that Mr Page's interest in the companies is a personal ambition and he even retained a 'man-cave' at one of the company's headquarters, where he was only referred to as 'GUS' - standing for 'the guy upstairs'. While it is known that both Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk have been working on designs for flying cars, the details of their designs are unclear.   Other companies, such as Aeromobil have also been trying to build a flying car Fans of Harry Potter will remember the blue flying car which Harry and Ron use to reach Hogwarts - which was of course, fueled by magic. But flying cars that run in our real world could be closer than you think Other companies, such as Terrafugia have also been trying to build a flying car, but have given suggested launch dates of 10 years from now in 2026.  However, technology is ever improving, and with access to better materials and autonomous navigation systems, it is thought that within the next few years we will have a self-flying car that takes off and lands vertically.  Speaking to Bloomberg, Mark Moore, an aeronautical engineer from Nasa, said: 'Over the past five years, there have been these tremendous advances in the underlying technology.  'What appears in the next 5 to 10 years will be incredible.'   Read more: Welcome to Larry Page’s Secret Flying Car Factories - Bloomberg Google co-founder’s reported ‘flying car’ spotted hovering in Hollister Google co-founder's reported 'flying car' spotted hovering in Hollister Share or comment on this article e-mail 192 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Malcolm Turnbull accuses Lisa Wilkinson of 'interrogating' him Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters 'Don't be afraid': Trump looks to reassure divided America...

The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Apple's market share and software, and Amazon and Google's cloud businesses will be top of mind for Paul Meeks, CNBC contributor and technology investor, and John Traynor, chief investment officer at People's United Wealth Management. Getty Images Apple's flagship store in New York City Apple Headline numbers: Earnings, revenue and iPhone sales What Traynor is watching: Samsung and the software ecosystem For Traynor, the key issue is whether defectors from Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall are using more of Apple's cloud and content. "We'll keep an eye on that number, but we're hoping that Apple can differentiate between their core demand, how much is Samsung [Galaxy Note] 7 related and really, what they're doing to convert those Samsung customers over to Apple customers." Apple grew its services revenue 19 percent last quarter, hitting App Store records on the heels of augmented reality game Pokemon Go. It has also looked more into content, including a deal with "Carpool Karaoke." "In all of our tech holdings, we're focused on connectivity and content," Traynor said. "And we think Apple is right at the confluence of those two trends." Amazon and Google Headline numbers: Earnings, revenue; Google ad sales; Amazon e-commerce sales What Meeks is watching: Cloud "As you've seen with two other stocks that are jumping on the cloud — Microsoft and Amazon — the dialogue about the company is going to go to what kind of traction they have in the cloud space," Meeks said of Alphabet. In addition to being a dominant force in online commerce, Amazon is also a leading provider of cloud services. It has 31 percent market share, according to Synergy Research Group, followed by Microsoft's Azure, at 9 percent. Google has about 4 percent market share, according to Synergy. But Microsoft reported its cloud revenue grew 116 percent last quarter, with commercial cloud annual revenue run rate of more than $13 billion. Meeks is hoping Amazon will hit at least the level of Microsoft's rate of cloud sales growth. But while Meeks sold Amazon's stock, he's not planning to buy it back just yet. "What happens with tech stocks is they are notoriously volatile," "There will be some Amazon-related issue — a competitive issue, even macroeconomic issue — that will cause a dip in the stock, and if it gets deep enough, I will buy it then."

The company is working on a standalone headset that's part virtual reality and part augmented reality. According to Engadget, the device, which has been rumoured in the past, will use sensors and feature integrated eye-tracking technologies and algorithms that let it "map out the real-world space in front of a user", essentially blurring the lines between VR and AR. That honestly sounds a lot like Google's Project Tango technology, but Engadget said Google's upcoming headset will work without a smartphone and offer an experience that's not as closed off as current VR headsets. It therefore might function like Microsoft HoloLens. Movidius, the computer vision company that Intel is acquiring, is reportedly making some of the headset's components. Not much else is known about the headset, but it will be separate from Google's Daydream VR platform, which you can read all about from here. We don't know what the headset will be called or what else it might feature.

Well, it seems that Google has repurposed its “Cast” application for this purpose. The application was updated today and features a redesigned interface along with an all new icon. However, the weird thing with this icon is that unlike the other new icons that are being introduced along with Android 7.1, the new Home icon is not rounded. As for the rest of the interface, the search bar at the top has been removed as Google has opted to use a FAB in the bottom right-hand corner. Additionally, instead of three different tabs at the top to switch between “What’s On”, “Devices”, and “Get Apps”, the new application just features just two tabs: “Watch” and “Discover”. The update is rolling out in droves to various users, but you can head over to APK Mirror and download the update now.

The application used to control the Chromecast dongles will soon gain extra responsibilities with the pending release of the Google Home speaker. It seems the app (formerly dubbed Chromecast also) will be the means for Google Home buyers to set-up and command the speaker when it arrives in the US on November 4. The Google Home speaker is built on the same core technologies as the Chromecast and even features the Cast tech built in. Related: Google Home complete guide With the name change comes a new logo and some slight UI changes, an Android Authority report has confirmed. The What’s On, Devices and Get Apps tabs have been replaced by just two - Watch and Discover. The Search bar has also been replaced by a floating blue bubble in the bottom right of the display. The update comes after Google began informing customers of a change via the app earlier this month. Given Google is seeking a much larger role in our home tech experience, the change makes sense.

Updated: November 14, 2016 @ 11:53 am Full Forecast News Sports Life Entertainment Dining Buy & Sell AP Can Samsung Recover From the Galaxy Note 7 Disaster? newsfeedback@fool.com (Evan Niu, CFA) Oct 24, 2016 0 Samsung's (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) official recall of the Galaxy Note 7 line earlier this month solidified the product as one of the biggest tech flops in recent memory. In this week's Industry Focus: Tech, The Motley Fool's Dylan Lewis and contributor Evan Niu discuss what we know about the Note 7 explosions, how Samsung's stock has been affected so far, how the company might recover from this, and how much this might hurt the business going forward. On the other side, the duo take a look at some companies that could benefit as they take up Samsung's slack. A full transcript follows the video. A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 14, 2016.

Wunder Capital: Do well and do good. Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast the dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, Oct. 14, and we're talking about the fiery mess that is the Samsung Galaxy Note. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by Fool.com senior tech specialist, Evan Niu. Evan, how's it going? Evan Niu: It's been a fun time to watch Samsung, considering I've been a longtime Samsung skeptic. Lewis: We're both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) guys, we're both iPhone guys, so I think it's been comforting for us to know that the phones in our pocket are not going to spontaneously combust any time soon, right? Niu: It's reassuring. (laughs) I'm not worried about my phone blowing up. Lewis: On today's show, we're going to give a little rundown on what's been going on with Samsung and the Galaxy Note line over the last month-plus, how that line fits into the company's smartphone segment, and the company's financials in general. Then, which companies, if any, might benefit from some of the backlash and the recall of the Galaxy Note line. Evan, you want to get us up to speed, give us a little timeline on what's been going on? Niu: Sure. Galaxy Note 7 launched in mid-August. I think that was part of the deal -- Samsung was really wanting to beat Apple to market on timing, because, as everyone knows, iPhones come out in September. So, I think the company was really pushing toward the timeline of getting this thing out to market as quick as possible to try to beat Apple to the punch. Which is kind of silly, because it's only a month difference. How much of a difference could that make? But, apparently, that was important to Samsung. I think that's partially what's led up to these problems, they cut corners or tried to do things too fast. Things obviously just weren't ready. Then, as we know, in early and mid-September, we started to see reports of Samsung Note 7 either exploding or catching on fire, a lot of the time while they were charging. In general, sometimes you hear stories about this happening. When you're using a third-party charger that's not up to spec, that can sometimes be the culprit. But these were the official chargers, the regular Samsung chargers you were supposed to be using.  So, Samsung does this huge recall, 2.5 million units. They think they figured out that it's the batteries that they sourced in-house from the Samsung SDI internal battery division. So, they do this recall. They leave all the other phones out there that have different batteries from third-party suppliers. They start replacing phones. And now, all of the sudden, in the past week or two, the replacement phones are now catching on fire. (laughs) So, everything is a huge mess, and now they've made the call to officially kill the project altogether. That's a tough call to make, but you have to do it when it's this bad.  It's crazy, because in modern smartphone times, people take this stuff for granted. Before this one, you hadn't heard about an exploding phone, or a phone catching on fire, meaningfully, in years. At least, not at this scale, outside of isolated incidences, like the third-party charger thing I was talking about. But, you don't see this wide-scale type of thing happening. It's been years. I think most consumers have probably thought that companies have figured this out, but apparently they haven't. It's kind of crazy. Lewis: Yeah, still running into some issues on the tech side. This is, I think, brutally bad timing, given that the company is basically coming off its best earnings report in a couple years. It seemed like they had a ton of momentum, decent amount of growth in the smartphone space. Earlier this week, when the company decided to go with the full recall, they also issued an update to guidance. So, we don't even really have to speculate as to what the financial hit might look like, we can look at exactly at what the company said here. They are now expecting third-quarter operating profit to come in at 5.2 trillion South Korean won, which is roughly $4.6 billion, down from the original forecast of 7.8 trillion won. So, a decent amount of rollback there. Third-quarter revenue has also been revised down. It's now expected to be about 47 trillion won from the previous guidance of 49 trillion won. Niu: I think what's even more disconcerting about this whole thing is, Samsung still doesn't know what's wrong with the phones. They cannot figure it out. As recently as last week, there was a New York Times report that their engineers are still trying to replicate the problem, and they can't. That doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. It's one thing if they do this recall, they get the phones back, and they figure it out and presumably fix it. But, if they don't even know what's wrong, that's a huge question mark. It really calls to question all these other things about their future phones. I don't think any of their phones have had this type of problem, but going forward, unless they can figure this out and definitively say, "This is what caused it, and we have a solution ... " This is totally unrelated, but hilarious. They also had washing machines that are now blowing up. I don't know if you saw that. A couple weeks ago, there were reports -- because, Samsung makes everything, and they have these top-load washing machines, and those are now exploding. Clearly, it's a totally different thing, because those don't use lithium ion batteries like the phones do. But it's kind of like, what's going on with everything?! (laughs) Washing machines, too? Lewis: To layer on top of that, I think there are another couple reasons why this is a little bit different than your average product recall, or even food-safety-related issues, like what we've seen with Chipotle or Jack in the Box in the '90s. You talked about how they haven't been able to diagnose the problem, which doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in the other products they have out there. I think one of the other issues is, there's a lot of confusion in the Galaxy line. You look out at Samsung's product offering, frankly, it's really hard to keep all their phones straight. They intentionally moved the Note to be on the 7 naming convention, to keep it consistent with the other offerings. Now, I think you're seeing people that aren't 100% sure which products are safe, and which aren't. I saw news that they had to push notifications, I forget which product, but it was one of their newer and higher-priced phones, that -- Niu: It was the regular S7. Lewis: Right. That, those were not part of the recall, and the people who held those in their hands, if they were reading this notification, didn't need to worry about that. That's fine, but when you have a super fragmented offering, and a lot of the headlines are "Galaxy 7," and they're trying to distill it down to something like that ... Niu: Yeah. For average consumers who don't follow this stuff as closely as we do, they just see some headline about Galaxy something, 7 something. There's a Galaxy S7, there's a Galaxy S7 A, there's the Galaxy Note 7. There's so many, and they're all part of the Galaxy brand that Samsung has put so much money into building. They put tens of millions of dollars into building this brand over the past five or 10 years. And now, this one horribly botched product risks killing all that brand value. It's not uncommon for Samsung to spend more money on marketing, advertising, kickbacks, commissions to retailers and all that, than it does on R&D. It puts a ton of money into this, and now, because they're unified, they're all getting dragged down. They're trying to contain this thing, like you said, notifications saying, "Your phone is safe." It sounds exactly like the phone is not safe. But, "The phone is safe, don't worry." Lewis: I think one of the other things that makes this tougher -- and returning back from this a little tougher -- is the product life cycles of smartphones. You look at a place like Chipotle, fast casual, they're able to give away a ton of free product via coupons, Chiptopia, that kind of stuff, and get people back in restaurants relatively quickly, because meals are a routine purchase for people. Smartphones are not. You're buying a phone every two years. Once you get someone in an ecosystem, the likelihood of them staying there is a lot higher. So, I worry there's going to be this class of people coming onto smartphones, or maybe people that recently decided to make the switch over to the Galaxy line, specifically the Galaxy Note line, that they're second-guessing it, might go with another Android device, might decide to go over to something on the iOS side. Niu: Yeah. That's exactly the thing they need to figure out. Samsung is really good at hardware. Samsung has tried so hard over the past 10 years to get better at software, but of course, they have to get Android from Google, and they do their whole modifications and tweaks, this stuff they put on top of it to try to differentiate. But the point remains that Samsung isn't actually good at that stuff. Their software is not very good. They're really good at hardware. If all the sudden, their hardware is having all these problems, there's really not a good reason to buy a Samsung phone. Historically, their hardware has been incredibly well-made. But now, there's no reason. If their one strength is now being called into question ... Lewis: People are going to go elsewhere. Niu: Exactly. And, even if you want to stay with an Android, there's tons of really good Android phones out there.  Lewis: I think, to help adjust for this a little bit, Samsung is offering customers about $75 to trade in their devices for other Samsung models. That's a good retention effort. They might save some lost customers along the way. But it wouldn't be surprising to see some flight from the brand. One of the other reasons I think this is troubling is the timing in the calendar year. This is ahead of the holiday season, and it's the biggest time of the year for consumer electronics. To have to wipe out an entire product line ahead of the quarter where you're probably going to be doing 40% of your business, at least ... Niu: And one of their most expensive, most profitable products, too. Lewis: Yeah. That's rough, that's really hard to deal with that, as a business.  Niu: Yeah. This is the time, holiday shopping season. Everyone makes all their money here. And now, Samsung has to pull one of their flagship...the Note 7 has been a differentiator compared to the iPhone for a long time, because it comes with a stylus, it's bigger. It was like the posterboy for phablets. Samsung has established itself as the phablet leader, and Apple now has the 7 Plus, which isn't as big as the Note 7 and doesn't have a stylus. But other than that, it's pretty comparable, as far as giant phones go. Lewis: Yeah. I started briefly introducing what the company was expecting for revenue writedown and revised guidance. It looks like analysts were expecting the company to ship about 15 to 19 million units from Q3 2016 through Q1 2017. To put that into context, Samsung shipped between 75 million and 78 million smartphones last quarter. So, while this is a big deal, it's a fancy new line they were really trying to get some momentum behind, in the grander scheme of their product mix, it's actually maybe about 10% or so. I don't think it's as big of a deal as people realize. Niu: I think the big difference is, a lot of Samsung's volume comes from these low-end, cheaper smartphones in places like India. They sell phones that are $50 to $100. They're not making a lot of money on that, but they ship a lot of units, which helps them keep their rank in the smartphone market. Like you mentioned, it's a lot more than Apple, 75 million on a non-holiday quarter, that's a ton of phones. But a lot of those are low-margin, low-value units versus these high-end phones -- that's where these companies make their margins. I think it has a leverage effect, in that it seems smaller in terms of units. But it had a pretty big impact on operating profits. Generally speaking, mobile is about half of Samsung's business, in terms of revenue and operating profit, roughly, before this whole thing. Mobile includes a bunch of things, like tablet and these phones. But the mobile segment itself is incredibly important to them. Within the mobile segment if you look at the margin profile within their mobile business, these high-end phones are quite important in terms of profitability. Those low-end phones get a lot of volume, but considering that Samsung is largely a hardware player, if they sell a low-end phone to someone, it's not like they're capturing that customer on to their platform like Google or Apple would be. They're just trying to sell the phone. So, I think it won't have a huge impact on total volumes. But I think, again, coming back to the brand, it's so damaging for the brand. That's something that's really hard to put a number on right now -- brand valuation. I think that's the bigger thing here. Missing out on one product cycle is one thing, if it's contained within this product cycle. But if there's lasting damage to the brand, they could be hurting for a long time. Lewis: I think that's why you've seen market reaction to this actually not be so bad. Short-term, if we're to take the company at the guidance that they're giving, and we look at the product mix, and they're able to hold the volumes on those other brands, the drop that we've seen makes sense. I think if you look back to when this story originally broke, the company was down about 4% or 5%, which really isn't all that crazy given that this is one of their most consumer-facing and high-profile lines. They do have so many other offerings in the smartphone market. If those hold, there shouldn't be too much of an issue there. One of the things people might not realize about Samsung is, they're a little bit more diversified than your Apple, in terms of the different hardware arenas that they've planned. To give you an idea of their revenue mix, consumer electronics is about 22% of revenue, and that does not include smartphones. IT and mobile communications, as you said before, a little over 50% of revenue. Device solutions, which is the semiconductor and display panel business, 36% of revenue. The IT and mobile is the highest-margin business that they are in, and having a high-profile phone, a high-ASP phone (average selling price), being removed, might lead to some margin compression there. But if they're able to hold on the other brands, I think this muted reaction from the market makes sense. Niu: Yeah, I guess we'll just have to see if they can successfully pull off this crisis management. I think it's a good thing to kill those phones, definitely, especially when you don't know what's going on. You have to bite the bullet. Lewis: Absolutely. In the second half of the show, we're going to hit briefly on a couple companies that might be poised to benefit as Samsung goes into crisis mode. But before we do, what if you could help combat global climate change, and make money at the same time? You might be interested in that, right? Wunder Capital is an award-winning online investment platform that allows individuals to invest in solar energy projects around the U.S. Wunder's online investment platform allows you to earn up to 11% annually while diversifying your portfolio, curbing pollution, and combating global climate change.

So, Evan, we talked about how the premium side of the smartphone market could see some shake-up. We might see some consumers that were interested in the Galaxy line, maybe they were Galaxy Note owners, taking this opportunity to either try an iOS device, maybe another Android device. Do you think there are any big beneficiaries with this? Niu: I think there are definitely some winners and losers. If we start with the loser list, I think it's a little bit shorter, because Samsung is mostly self-contained in terms of its suppliers. Samsung is so directly integrated that it makes most of the components that go to its phones. It still has some third-party part suppliers. But as far as supply relationships go that might suffer from reduced unit volumes, it's mostly going to be within Samsung itself. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) probably loses a little bit because the Snapdragon 820 is inside the U.S. variants -- Keep up with money news, sent to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. Lewis: Can you explain what the Snapdragon does? Niu: Snapdragon is the main applications processor that has integrated modem and all these things. It's one of the most important pieces of any phone, the processor. Samsung, what they do is they have all these different variants for different geographies. Samsung has been trying to ship to its own in-house Exynos processor. I think the last year, they were exclusively Exynos, with no Snapdragon, but this year, Qualcomm has gotten back into the mix, they've improved their chips a little bit and got more competitive. There's some variance for different geographies, and Qualcomm is in the U.S. variance. So, they'll lose a little bit, since they obviously won't be selling into this phone anymore. But there's kind of a hedge, because Qualcomm does sell a lot into Apple. If people buy iPhones instead of the Note 7, probably incrementally negative to Qualcomm, but they're not totally out of the picture. Lewis: Right, you might be a little pinched, but nothing crazy. Niu: Right, there's a little bit of a hedge, there's a silver lining. And of course, it depends on which iPhone you get, because not Qualcomm has lost a little bit of spot in the iPhone, because Qualcomm used to be the exclusive modem supplier, and for the first time ever, Apple has gone to Intel -- well, first time not including Infineon 10 years ago. Now, this year, Apple is now buying modems from Qualcomm and Intel, depending on which phone you get. As far as pure winners, I would say certainly Apple. Lewis: Yeah, I think they're up 10% since some of the products issues around the Note 7 surfaced. The market certainly seems to think -- Niu: Yeah, there was already iPhone 7 optimism, and now the shares just keep going higher. They're at 2016 highs because of all this stuff that's going on with Samsung. I think it's pretty clear that a lot of people are probably going to try. And we've already been seeing Android switching rates continue to rise every quarter. Apple touts this every quarter, every quarter they're like, "highest Android switcher rates ever." I think that trend is going to continue, particularly with one of the biggest Android OEMs hitting into this wall here. As I mentioned, Intel is now in some of the iPhones. So Intel, to the extent that people are buying the phones with their modem, they benefit. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), I think, is a big winner here too. They actually just released earnings that were pretty strong. Taiwan Semiconductor is producing Apple's A10 Fusion chip. Another change this year is that, in prior years, Apple had been dual-sourcing its chip manufacturing from both Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor, which started one or two years ago. They only brought on Taiwan Semiconductor one or two years ago. But now, supposedly, with all the indications that we're getting, it's exclusively to TSMC, which is a huge win for them and a huge blow to Samsung, in terms of the foundry business on the chip manufacturing side. That's a lot more chips that Taiwan Semi is going to be making for Apple. They just released earnings; it was pretty strong, came in above expectations. I don't remember the exact numbers. But the important thing is that Taiwan Semiconductor raised fourth-quarter guidance, and that raised guidance did not factor in the possibility of these other phones being discontinued. So they were already super bullish, even before factoring in the Note 7's discontinuation into their forecast. So, I think they're really going to bank this holiday quarter if Apple sells enough phones. That's a ton of orders going to TSMC to make these A10 Fusion chips. I think they're probably a pretty big winner here. Lewis: Yeah, I think a lot of people tend to read into the commentary we get from component manufacturers that go into the iPhone as a general baseline for how that segment might be doing when Apple reports again. If you're seeing guidance up from Taiwan Semiconductor, that probably bodes well for the iPhone business. Niu: Yeah. And even before the Samsung Note -- that's what blew me away -- their guidance was so strong, and they literally said, "This does not include any impact if the Note 7 is discontinued," which it has been. So, it looks really good for them. As far as third-party carriers or retailers are concerned, I think they're pretty ambivalent. They're just trying to do their best to help their customers not be in danger. Their brands aren't going to be affected, and they're not going to be bearing a lot of cost because Samsung is going to be paying for all of this. So most of the retailers and carriers just want to do what's right for the customer and get these things off the market. I don't think there's going to be any damage to them. Lewis: I've seen [Alphabet's] Google thrown around in the list of potential winners as well. The idea is kind of similar with Apple -- they released the Pixel phone somewhat recently. Having a major potential competitor off the table bodes well for people giving that a shot. That's not going to be something that meaningfully contributes to the numbers for Google. I think, when you're talking about Apple and Google here, seeing Samsung falter and knowing that there might be a slightly larger bite of the smartphone market available to them isn't something that's thesis-altering. It's certainly interesting for some of the component manufacturers that are specifically in some of these devices and not others. But big picture, if you like Apple and Google already, stick with them. But don't buy solely on the idea that they might pick up some incremental business here. Niu: Yeah. The Pixel looks like a pretty good phone. Of course, it's Google's first phone, they designed the whole thing. They're outsourcing manufacturing, naturally, to HTC. But as far as them designing the phone itself, this is the first time that they're really doing the whole thing. It looks like a really good phone. I think, definitely, people that are not getting the Note 7 might consider the Pixel, because it's a pure Google phone stock Android without all the third-party software and all this stuff on it. But I think the biggest challenge there in terms of getting people to switch from a Note 7 to a Pixel XL or whatever the large one is called, it's really just about distribution. Google doesn't have distribution channels in the way that most companies in the space do. They're partnering with Verizon, which is the only carrier partner. Other than that, they're selling it online through the online store. But, it might surprise you how many people, when they need a new phone, they go to the carrier store. They just go to the retail store. Lewis: It becomes kind of a default decision, right? Niu: Yeah. And it makes some sense, because that's where they have the most selection, they can deal with all their plan stuff. I personally tend to buy things online, and I think a lot of people do. But, carrier distribution is an incredibly important channel for any phone maker. People that already know which phone they want they'll just go and buy that phone online. But a lot of people don't know, and they still like to shop around, like any other product in their lives, versus people like you and me are probably so loyal that it's not even a decision, it's just, when am I going to get my iPhone? But, for a lot of people, their phone breaks, or it's time for an upgrade, they just go to the carrier store and pick one. For the other carriers other than Verizon, Pixel's not going to be there, because Google is distributing themselves. It's harder for Google to get these carrier relationships going, because the carriers want more control. It's harder for Google to negotiate because they've never been a big player in the physical smartphone space. So I think the biggest thing that's going to hold them back is their lack of distribution. Lewis: It sounds like the rundown for investors here is, Apple, Google, possible beneficiaries. The people that might really see some importance swings in what goes on with their numbers are some of the component manufacturers like you talked about, Taiwan Semiconductor. My feeling is, for Samsung's business, if they're able to keep the bad PR and negative brand association contained to the Note line, then this won't be something that's really awful for them long-term. If it does start to bleed into the other products they offer, the S7 and things like that, it could spell trouble for their mobile segment for a long time. Niu: Yeah, the main thing is to figure out what the hell is going on with these things. Clearly, if they launch a phone next year and it has the same thing, that would thesis altering, two in a row. And, if they can't figure it out, there's reason to think that-there might be another one. Lewis: Yeah, I think a lot of consumers want them to know exactly what's going on and tell the public. Then we might see a nice rally in Samsung sales. Niu: They can't replicate this in their labs! It's just crazy. Lewis: Anything else before I let you go, Evan? Niu: No, I think we hit it all.

 Bombshell lawsuit reveals drama at Magic Leap, the secretive multibillion-dollar startup backed by Google Kif Leswing Oct. 24, 2016, 4:16 PM 45,022 facebook linkedin twitter email print Abovitz, CEO of augmented reality startup Magic Leap, waves during the first day of the annual Allen and Co. media conference in Sun Valley Thomson Reuters Multi-billion dollar startup Magic Leap, which is building a cutting-edge augmented reality headset, is currently in a legal battle with the engineer who started its first Silicon Valley office. Court filings reveal new secrets about the company, including a west coast software team in disarray, insufficient hardware for testing, and a secret skunkworks team devoted to getting patents and designing new prototypes — before its first product has even hit the market. The company believes that Adrian Kaehler and Gary Bradski, two VPs at Magic Leap, tried to rip off its technology and talent to start a new robotics startup.  Kaehler and Bradski, who sued the company for wrongful termination earlier this year, say that Magic Leap unfairly robbed them of their shares in Magic Leap and broke their employment contracts. Magic Leap countered by suing the pair for misappropriation of trade secrets in Northern California District Court.  While the suit was settled in October, documents and emails filed in the case reveal a major disconnect between the Florida-based Magic Leap and its satellite offices in Silicon Valley.  A $4.5 billion startup Magic Leap Magic Leap is one of the most mysterious and hyped startups in tech. The company has raised a massive amount of venture money — $1.39 billion — from nearly every top technology investor, including Google, Alibaba, KPCB, and Andreessen Horowitz. It has not yet shipped a product, and people who have tried the prototypes are required to sign legal documents that prevent them from discussing them. Magic Leap's still unrevealed product will be a set of AR glasses, according to testimony in the lawsuit. The glasses will be attached to a smartphone-sized computer, according to a source with knowledge of Magic Leap's product.  The highly anticipated augmented reality glasses will superimpose computer images into the real world. (As opposed to virtual reality, which immerses the viewer in a computer-generated world.) The company was reportedly valued at $4.5 billion in February.  Magic Leap declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Kaehler declined to comment through his attorney. Bradski could not be immediately reached.  Disgruntled employees Earlier this year, Bradski told Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz that he wanted to form a new startup focusing on cutting-edge robotics with his friend Kaehler, and planned to try to hire Magic Leap employees from its West Coast office. Then in May, the pair found they were no longer Magic Leap employees — or even advisors — and their access to email was cut off. Then came the dueling lawsuits.  Magic Leap paints Bradski and Kaehler, who worked on software for Magic Leap, as disgruntled employees, even producing an email that Bradski sent to Kaehler in August 2015 from his Magic Leap work email address:  “Like Jobs, R has a reality distortion field. Unlike Jobs, R’s is more like a bad high, just leaves you feeling tired with a vague headache in the morning and is not productive." In this note, R likely refers to Rony Abovitz, the CEO of Magic Leap, and compares him unfavorably to former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who was known for being difficult to work with.  Abovitz says that Bradski and Kaehler were planning to start their startup for a year before they quit. "Dr. Bradski did not tell me what his future plans were going to be, and led me to believe that he was excited about being at Magic Leap," Abovitz wrote.  Magic Leap's lawyer, David Lundmark, implies that Bradski wanted more power in the company, and was primarily worried about his personal income, even though he personally chose the location for the company's Mountain View and Sunnyvale offices.  "Dr. Bradski told me more than once that he did not have confidence in the leadership or processes of Magic Leap," Lundmark wrote. "Dr. Bradski expressed to me a lack of confidence in the proposition that certain compensation-related milestones, such as a secondary offering and bonus program, were going to happen in a timely manner." Public documents He notes that when Kaehler received his bonuses and liquidated stock in a secondary offering, he put a sticky note on his monitor that said "gone for two weeks."  Sunshine state of mind 2014 is apparently the year of the selfie. With my tiny Graeme. A photo posted by Spencer Lindsay (@spencerlindsay) on Jan 31, 2014 at 10:32am PST on Jan 31, 2014 at 10:32am PST Magic Leap is unusual among high-value tech startups because it's based in Plantation, Florida, where its CEO, Rony Abovitz, grew up and lives. Most tech startups are concentrated in Silicon Valley, New York, or a handful of other tech hubs like Boston, Seattle, or Austin, Texas. Bradski had a good reputation before joining Magic Leap — he founded OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library in wide use, and previously founded a robotics startup that was bought by Google. He founded the West Coast office for Magic Leap in 2013, growing it to over 100 employees. According to Bradski's testimony, as well as other sources close to the company, the Florida location has made it hard to recruit and retain software talent, especially in artificial intelligence. Bradski claims he had to promise hires not to move them to Florida. "It was difficult to recruit top people in the deep net field to Magic Leap, since everyone external wanted to live in New York or Silicon Valley, but Magic Leap's base of operations is in Florida," Bradski testified in writing. "We lost several deep net hires that I thought would be key leaders because of this." One of those hires ended up at Google Brain, Google's artificial intelligence research group, according to the court documents. Once the Silicon Valley office was established, there was plenty of friction between it and headquarters. "What is not recognized ... is just how many hours I spent in 'worker therapy' with so many employees who expressed deep dissatisfaction with the 'us v. them' mentality that existed in the way the Florida executives tried to absentee manage the California talent," Kaehler wrote in testimony.  "From my familiarity with the spectrum of engineering work being done in the company, the majority of the best work was being done on the West Coast," he continued.  "I spent a lot of time dealing with convincing disgruntled and frustrated employees to stay," Bradski wrote. One carrot that he used was a Magic Leap-scheduled secondary market stock buy, which would allow employees to turn their options into cash.  In an private email to an investor uncovered by Magic Leap, Bradski explains that he will try to help hire and retain employees at the Mountain View office, but "hell, many are leaving anyhow."  Sources also tell Business Insider that Abovitz's attention is primarily focused on Florida operations.  So why is Magic Leap based in Florida instead of Silicon Valley? One theory, posited by Kaehler: "It seemed to me and was expressed to me by many employees in various language that the East Coast operation existed for the pleasure of senior people who preferred to live in that [income] tax-free state," he wrote in testimony seen by Business Insider.  Not enough glasses  A drawing from a Magic Leap patent. Not necessarily what the glasses will look like. Magic Leap Access to Magic Leap's glasses is closely controlled, and testers must sign a legal non-disclosure agreement promising not to talk about them before they can get a demo of how they work. Magic Leap employees in California don't have enough prototypes to do their work, according to the suit.  "Through Summer 2014, Magic Leap's actual hardware team based in Florida seemed to be having difficulties making AR headsets for use by Magic Leap personnel," Bradski wrote. He says his personal project could not get started until the company "built enough of its AR glasses for most employees to regularly use them day-to-day." "We were hardware starved in Magic Leap West until the day I left," he writes, and says that at one point he asked Florida for "30-50 more headsets" to get "common headset usage started" at Magic Leap's West Coast office. "This hardware has still not arrived as far as I know," he wrote. In a legal filing, Abovitz says that Magic Leap is completing its manufacturing plant.  A secret skunkworks team Rony Abovitz emails about the N+1 program Public documents Last fall, Magic Leap assigned Bradski to a new skunkworks team. Other leaders of the "N+1" team include Brian Schowengerdt, founder and Chief Science Officer, and Neal Stephenson, famous sci-fi author and chief futurist at Magic Leap. We previously reported that Stephenson and Schowengerdt are not located at the company's Florida headquarters, and work out of a satellite office in Seattle. "Magic Leap’s N+1 projects look to 'invent the future,' by developing the future applications of Magic Leap’s technology," Abovitz wrote.  According to an email sent by Abovitz, the N+1 team was focused on filing patents, creating prototypes, and potentially publishing scientific papers.  However, Bradski saw the new assignment as something of a demotion, and he complains in the suit that he did not have enough staff underneath him to do these special projects. Before he left, Bradski focused on building a deep learning team as well as working on embedded hardware for computer vision.  A settlement conference between the two former Magic Leap VPs and the company is scheduled for later this week.  Know anything about Magic Leap?

What you Google can reveal your interests, the questions you'd be embarrassed to ask another human being, and your hopes for the future. "People also tell Google things — a lot of things — that they may not admit to others," wrote Stuart A. Gabriel and Seth Stephens-Davidowitz in this weekend's New York Times op-ed about election search trends. Your search history is, in many ways, like a much more abbreviated form of a journal, where you record your thoughts and questions about what's happening in the world around you. And that's true for your own personal history as well as that of the larger population. So what does this "journal" look like over the course of one of the most bizarre and scary elections in U.S. history? We reached out to Google to find out. Its team of search-trend analysts pulled data about the most searched terms and topics at different moments during campaign season. Click through to see what we found. Then, go to the Google Election Trends site to see more issues people are interested in as we lead up to Election Day. You might even be able to make some predictions of your own.

This relationship has become stronger as Google search data has gotten richer. A simple test before making retirement decision  | Wall Street Journal (Co-written by UCLA’s Shlomo Benartzi) Nobody wants to regret his or her retirement choices; many of these decisions cannot be undone. By identifying those workers who are planning for a late retirement but are likely to succumb to the temptation of an early one, we can take steps to prevent mistakes before they occur. Hispanics fastest-growing population in public schools  | Washington Post Hispanic students are the ­fastest-growing population nationally in public schools, said Pedro Noguera, an education professor at UCLA’s Graduate School of Education and Information Sciences. “This is happening across the country. Rural, urban, suburban,” he said. Taking a hard look at Los Angeles charter schools  | Los Angeles Times UCLA education professor John Rogers wants state law to require more transparency from charters. And he’d give districts more latitude in evaluation. School boards, he said, should be able to consider whether a charter is having a negative effect on the students of the district as a whole. Or whether it has encouraged parents, community members and possibly students to take part in leading the school. Sudden power is a scourge, and not just in politics  | Boston Globe Others see these new findings as complementing studies on sexual violence. Such violence correlates not with high or low self-esteem but with unstable self-esteem, says Neil Malamuth, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. How much do campaigns really matter?  | NPR’s “Innovation Hub” “I think the first thing to keep in mind is the difference between predicting something and understanding or explaining something. And so it isn’t just political scientists who didn’t see Trump coming. Nobody saw Trump coming,” said UCLA’s Lynn Vavreck. (Approx. 1:15 mark) Media bias in the presidential election  | KABC-AM’s “Gurvey’s Law” “I do think there’s media bias in favor of Democrats. It certainly doesn’t surprise me the journalists wouldn’t want to donate to Trump given all of the things Trump has said about the journalists. So that somewhat overstates the magnitude of the bias. And again, even many Republicans, like me, don’t like Trump,” said UCLA’s Eugene Volokh. (Approx. 00:45 mark) [Audio download] House Republicans wage war on medical research  | Bloomberg In response to the committee, the UCLA Medical Center noted that “human fetal tissues exhibit biological properties that are distinct from those of tissues derived from children or adults, and these properties, often related to an enhanced capacity for growth and regeneration, can be highly desirable for the development of novel therapies.” Layoffs, higher prices possible in wake of AT&T deal  | Riverside Press-Enterprise William Wei-Choun Yu, an economist with the Anderson School of Management at UCLA, agreed with Husing that an expanded AT&T would merit antitrust scrutiny. “Antitrust might be a possible concern, but over the years we have seen some deals that went through without much resistance,” Yu said. Exploring the psychology behind spending addiction  | Vice Is the addiction a by-product of modern consumer culture rather than innate brain-wiring? “This kind of shopping behaviour has only emerged in recent history,” says Robert Bilder, Chief of Medical Psychology at UCLA. “If we go back even a hundred years, there was not that much opportunity, both in terms of the available portals for shopping, and the available income that people had to pursue it. Albeit you could probably go back and find other kinds of behaviours that were rewarding and that people could develop compulsions about.” How Clinton could lose even as she wins  | BD News 24 (Bangladesh) (Commentary by UCLA’s Bill Schneider) Educated Americans will interpret a big Clinton victory as an endorsement of their “enlightened” values. For less well-educated whites, it will confirm their sense of isolation and resentment. Each of the last four presidents – George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama – promised to bring the country together. They all failed. There is little prospect that either Clinton or Trump – two of the most divisive figures in U.S. politics – can heal the divide. One student turns her pain into progress  | Huffington Post “Niya’s case alone is simply a powerful example about how leadership skills and courage and the ability to reason right from wrong ... get turned into a justification for bringing them into the juvenile justice system,” said [Kimberlé Crenshaw, African American Policy Forum co-founder and a professor of law at UCLA]. Scientists find new genetic roots of schizophrenia  | POST Online Media “This work provides a road map for understanding how common genetic variation associated with a complex disease affects specific genes and pathways,” said principal investigator Dr. Daniel Geschwind, the Gordon and Virginia MacDonald Distinguished Chair in Human Genetics and professor of neurology and psychiatry at UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Archaeological discovery in ancient Jaffa  | Haaretz “It seems like [the Canaanites] lit the ceiling of the gate complex on fire, and it collapsed,” says Prof. Aaron Burke of the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the directors of the renewed excavations at Jaffa. “We discovered 24 one-to-two meter sections of timber and planks, including their wooden pegs, buried in each of the towers that collapsed,” he told Haaretz.

But there’s still more in the making… Google’s long journey into the world of VR, initially started with the rather simplistic Cardboard experiment a few years back, has now reached a point where it could legitimately be included among the company’s agenda’s more serious focus points. And if Daydream doesn’t sound like enough of a big deal, chances are that a second, more premium and allegedly standalone headset will. According to Engadget, a high-end visor is indeed in the works at Mountain View, and it should be one powerful enough not to require a smartphone nor a computer to fully function. It will reportedly be a separate thing from Daydream, and focus on other technologies (on top of VR) such as eye-tracking and real world mapping, to create a mixed reality experience not too dissimilar from, say, Microsoft‘s HoloLens. Other sources say that soon-to-be-Intel-purchased AI company Movidius will supply some of the chips powering the headset, which will aid in tracking motion and positional awareness. Despite being similar in scope to Microsoft’s product, Google’s new headset will allegedly “blur the line between virtual and augmented reality — bringing the world into VR, rather than VR into the world.” Says the report: Earlier today, The Drum reported on a potential “wireless virtual reality” device that passed through the FCC’s approval process. Although the heavily redacted filings reveal very little, beyond some wireless capabilities, it does have Mike Jazayeri, director of product management for Google’s VR group, listed as a contact. We were unable to confirm whether the FCC-approved device, apparently for internal and partner testing, is related to the standalone headset plans. So what do you think about this? Are you excited at the idea of an even deeper push into the virtual/mixed reality by Google? Drop us a comment and let us know.

The device “will include a screen, high-powered processors and outward-facing cameras” according to The Wall Street Journal.   Engadget is now reporting that Google’s VR headset integrates eye tracking technologies “to map out the real-world space in front of a user.” Google's VR headset “blurs the line between virtual and augmented reality.” Google's new VR headset is being designed to provide a better experience compared to the Oculus or HTC Vive . Though we don’t know too much about Google’s VR headset, it seems to be similar to Microsoft’s HoloLens. The report also confirms that Movidius, an AI company being acquired by Intel, will provide chips that will help in tracking motion. The new headset will also be separate from the company’s Daydream VR platform, but won’t require a phone to power it, according to Engadget’s sources. Related Stories Google Daydream View, Chromecast Ultra Available Now Google Guarantees 2 Years Of Android Upgrades For Pixels While we’re not sure when Google’s VR headset could be released, one Journal source says it could arrive later this year, with another source saying it’s still in early development and could potentially be scrapped entirely.  According to the Drum, FCC documents show Google’s device would have a broad range of frequencies, from 2.4 GHz to 5.8 GHz, and that it has a built-in radio similar to its augmented reality headset, Google Glass, which was discontinued in 2015. While the FCC documents have barely any details the device, Mike Jazayeri is one of the contacts on the filings. Jazayeri joined Google in 2005 and has previously worked on Cardboard VR viewer.

NB: This is a viewpoint by Alan Young, president and co-founder of Puzzle Partner. Forbes called Google Trips is a “fantastic… travel app you should download now.” The Verge said it’s “a killer travel app.” Many others hail it as a personalized travel app, but I’d argue it’s not quite there, yet. Here’s what Google Trips can do. It scours my email to find itineraries and provides quick access to the original emails if I need them. Handy. It keeps my car rental details right there along with the air itineraries. I like this, except I mostly Uber these days. The best part of any of this is that it’s available even when I don’t have wifi, which isn’t all that often anymore. I’d argue that Google Trips make travel more mobile-friendly. Otherwise, though, Google Trips is basically a smart destination guide. Using a combination of attractions that I select and my search history, Google Trips will craft attraction itineraries guessing at what my interests are. It’s a nice feature. But not necessarily innovative. It’s a useful tool that integrates some data, but it would be more helpful if it understood that I’m the kind of leisure traveler who flies into a major city, spends one or two nights and then heads to the country. It isn’t able to pick up much in the way of reservations outside of major cities as far as I can tell, and it definitely doesn’t do attractions and restaurants. Not yet at least. What would be a game-changer is to make it more personal. Google Trips is on the cusp of doing this with the itineraries feature, but it must go further than this. It needs to understand how I travel more than it needs to understand what I like to do. What would be useful is to have the app locate where I am and design opportunities for me to get from point A to Point B. For instance, given Google’s mapping capabilities, it could tell me which train station I’m closest to when I request an Uber, so I know where to go, or the easiest way to get from midtown Manhattan to the Upper West side based on where I’m standing. My point is that Google Trips is a step in the right direction, but it’s just that, a step. It’s not going to revolutionize leisure travel in its current form (nor do I think that was the intent but the media seemed to think it was revolutionary). Where it has the potential to make waves is in shifting our data reliance as travelers. Should we choose to engage with it, it will incrementally give Google more power over our information by encouraging us to rely on Google, Gmail, Maps, Local, etc. more than we do other sources so that we can integrate with Google Trips. Most of us are already reliant on Google for a great deal, but in bits and pieces, it may shift travelers away from aggregators and reviews sites toward Google. Moreover, when Google follows by adding to the app a booking engine, for instance, the industry might actually feel it this time. Oliver Heckman, VP of Engineering for Google Travel, recently said that the “master plan is to be the connector that builds awesome travel experiences, qualifies users and then sends them off to the right partners,” but he also mentioned that this could eventually look like helping travelers plan and book travel. While this might not occur through Google Trips, it could in an adjacent, integrated app, such as Allo. At this point, I’ll use it to get to my travel details. And maybe it’s possible that when I’m in the app trying to get to my confirmation number for the millionth time, I’ll use Google Local for attractions and restaurants or reviews. Maybe I’ll end up skipping the TripAdvisor step eventually, which I suspect was Google’s goal. There was some initial stock kickback in the industry among TripAdvisor, Expedia, and Priceline, but Google Trips doesn’t really pose a grave risk until it ratchets up the kind of data it integrates so that it can truly be personalized. To repeat, it needs to understand who the traveler is, not what the traveler wants to do. If enough travelers engage with the app, this is likely, but I question how many travelers will rely on it in its current form.

But what we learned from Google for other products like Google flights was, that the first versions of them all seemed weak compered to the specialists doing only this for years. But you can be sure, that they will learn fast and have a team of 30+ product and engineering people working on trips. Surrounded by the maps, payment, POI and transaction teams e.g. for flights, hotels and other things to do. Additionally around this they also are building the local guide community to enhance the local and hyper-local content giving a real value while travelling – still there is a lot of friction, especially when you move out of the urban areas. The local guides where already using the app since around April this year gathering and fixing broken local content. And Google every day is gathering high frequency information on travelers through their local search queries and the use of Android services which e.g. enables the “popular times” graph displayed in maps. So, we can be prepared to see more of this – but the market is huge, so there is enough cake for all of us. Reply 1 month ago   Sean O'Neill Thanks, Michael. Reply 3 weeks ago   Dorian Harris Agreed with all that, Alan. The headlines were highly misleading – if you read the comments, the reception is muted. And hardly anyone is even talking about Google Trips less than a month after launch. But then Google rarely gets these things right anyway. It’s successes beyond it’s primary search tool, have mainly been through acquisition (i.e. maps) rather than built in-house (Google video and, of course, Google+). And then, as you say, there’s the inherent concern for many of us that the likes of Google, Apple, Facebook and others have more than enough information on us without us willingly giving them more. Sure, if Trips really was the killer app, the story may be different. but it’s not. It’s an also-ran.

They define a supershopper as someone who is shopping primarily on their mobile device, looking for deals on the best products and constantly searching Google to so all of this. "With the ability to instantly discover, research, and purchase, shoppers around the world are more informed and more efficient than ever before - they’ve transformed into supershoppers seemingly overnight." said Julie Krueger, Retail Managing Director at Google. "We all have that friend - the one who somehow knows the latest brands, the season’s must-have products, and where to find the best deals at the snap of a finger." Google says that in 2015 over 50% of holiday shoppers were open to buying from new retailers and that 76% of mobile shoppers have switch their intended brand or retailer after searching Google. "It used to be that shoppers would thumb through catalogues or stare longingly at the holiday window displays, but mobile is now the super shopper’s go-to source for inspiration," says Krueger. "Over 64% of smartphone shoppers turn to mobile search for ideas about what to buy before heading into store. And 1 in 4 mobile video viewers in the U.S. have visited YouTube for help with a purchase decision while they were at a store or visiting a store's website." They also report that people more than ever before are search for phrases like "best gift" indicating that they are using search to find quality, not just deals. Google also believes that shoppers are looking for unique gifts too, reporting that searches related to "cool gifts" grew 80%. Mobile Search: A Door to the Store Searches on mobile are still really about driving business to the brick and mortar store, rather than just pure online shopping. "Although more and more people are willing to buy on mobile, we know that mobile is still used predominantly as a door to the store," said Krueger. "In fact, 76% of people who search for something nearby on their smartphone visit a related business within a day, and 28% of those searches result in a purchase." They say that once in the store, shoppers use their mobile device to find deals and information about the products they are interested in. From a retailers perspective, expect online conversion rates to increase across devices as the holidays get to full stride. Google says that last year on mobile, sales were up 30% on Black Friday and 50% on Cyber Monday.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) 12 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE USA home router suppliers have a profit problem. Yes, they are making money — more this year than last, in fact. For example, the retail business for Netgear, which releases its third-quarter earnings Wednesday, grew 30% in the first half of the year, led by sales of its premium-priced Nighthawk routers. Netgear is the USA’s largest supplier. The problem is that because consumer router suppliers are making money, most don’t realize their $750-million-a-year business is in jeopardy because they’re not delivering what consumers want. They don’t appreciate that their products are difficult to set up and configure. They don’t understand that the jargon they use to differentiate confuses consumers, many of whom put off purchasing as a result. And they don’t see that a new breed of supplier is rising up with hopes of curing them of their profit problem. Earlier this month, Google announced that it will become the latest new entrant in the home Wi-Fi arena. Like new-breed start-ups Eero, Luma and Plume, Google is offering whole-home Wi-Fi that’s simple to set up and easy to secure. And once working, it automatically routes connections so everyone in the house can do what they want, whenever they want, without thinking about it. For many of these new products, you can’t find a single spec or bandwidth number on the box. A Linksys home router.  (Photo: Linksys) Each supplier is offering multi-packs of routers that pair via their own mesh network to extend coverage. At $499, Eero’s three-pack is the priciest option. A three-pack from Luma retails for $399, and $299 from Google. Plume is offering a six-pack of very small router-ettes for $295 ($234 pre-order). Pricing for single-unit options also varies widely. Eero and Luma are available now. Plume and Google are promising November and December delivery, respectively. Profits have a funny way of obscuring the warning signs. Like when BlackBerry thought its market was safe from the onslaught of Apple and Android smartphones because it had a lock on secure email delivery. Or when PC makers initially disregarded the iPad and other tablets as toys that couldn’t possibly go toe to toe with their products. To their credit, PC makers responded decisively, by incorporating many of tablets’ best features. And BlackBerry, well, didn’t. So how will old-guard companies like Apple, Asus, Belkin (which also owns the Linksys brand) and Netgear react to the Wi-Fi upstarts? Hard to say. Wireless Router  (Photo: Belkin) Thus far, Netgear is the only established supplier to introduce a router that fits the bill for whole-home coverage and simplicity. But so far, it looks to me like Netgear is hedging its bets with the new product rather than embracing the vision. Indeed, Netgear has separated the new product, dubbed “Orbi,” from its traditional, profit-laden Wi-Fi router line by placing it in a new category the company calls “Wi-Fi Systems.” That’s curious, given that there is a single-unit option ($249) as well as a dual-pack product ($399). In July, ahead of Orbi’s launch, Netgear CEO Patrick Lo downplayed the impact of mesh-networked router systems during the company’s last earnings call. He called homes too large to be covered by a single router “one percenters.” I don’t know about that. My Wi-Fi rarely reaches the far ends of my house, which weighs in at 2,472 square feet. That is exactly five square feet larger than the median home in the USA, according to the 2015 Census. So I’m probably in pretty good company. In any event, the key feature of the new breed of routers isn’t mesh-networked multi-packs. Rather, it’s brain-dead simplicity. Consumers expect far more from their home networks than ever before — and have far less tolerance than ever before for figuring out how to make that happen. Router suppliers have smartphones and cellular networks to thank for that. Consumers can video chat on the bus to work, share the last play of the big game from the stands and watch a comedian’s stand-up routine in the doctor’s waiting room. They don’t have to switch networks or manage connections when they’re on the move. It just works. And they expect the same level of service over Wi-Fi when they’re home. Now, thanks to a few new suppliers, they can get it. That’s good for consumers. It will bring many of them off the sidelines, accelerating the already healthy market growth. That in turn, will be good news for suppliers. At least, it will be for the ones that can see the forest through the dollars.

By Lydia O'Neal @LydsONeal On 10/24/16 AT 2:58 PM Close After releasing its popular new Pixel smartphone and seeing its shares of shares him more than $800 this month, Google parent company Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is expected to reveal steady growth in its third quarter earnings on Thursday. Investors surveyed by FactSet expected the company’s C class (GOOG) earnings per share (EPS) to grow slightly to $8.63 from $8.42 in the second quarter and $7.35 for the third quarter of 2015. Citing growth in YouTube's popularity and mobile use of its search engine, Alphabet beat analysts’ expectations with its second quarter earnings release in July, with C class earnings per share (EPS) of $8.42 on revenues of $21.5 billion over forecasts $8.04 per share on $20.76 billion. “Video is a huge component of digital content, and YouTube continues to shine,” Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a conference call following the July earnings report. Related Stories Google Removing Content With Royal Insults, Thai Junta Says Google Daydream View, Chromecast Ultra Available Now Pinchai pointed to last quarter’s growth in the Android operating system. “Android is thriving,” Pinchai said, adding that the past year saw 65 billion app installments. But while the software’s growth numbers were beating those of Apple’s iOS operating system, Google wasn’t much of a competitor with the iPhone maker when it came to hardware. That could change with the Pixel, as some see it as Alphabet’s attempt to go head-to-head with Steve Jobs’ brainchild. Still, while Google may be dominating the internet search and video world and becoming a major player in the smartphone industry, its other projects, like Google X’s self-driving car, may face an uphill battle when competing with Uber and Tesla Motors. The Elon Musk-led auto company plans to roll out its Enhanced Autopilot software in December if it gains regulatory approval, and Uber already tested self-driving fleet in Pittsburgh last month. At Google X, meanwhile, the project’s leader announced that he would be stepping down in August, seven and a half years after he joined the team’s push to produce safe driverless cars.

At its recent BoxWorks conference, Box showed off a range of new features that it's planning to add to the service, and to the apps you use it with. They're not guaranteed to show up, but take a look at the list and see if they seem familiar. By Mary Branscombe for 500 words into the future | October 24, 2016 -- 14:42 GMT (07:42 PDT) | Topic: Cloud Organizing files by metadata: Box will soon let you create custom columns using the metadata in files, and you'll be able to use that metadata to filter what files are listed. So if you have documents that are part of a project and you're adding the status of each document in the project, you can filter the list to only show the documents that correspond to tasks you haven't yet completed, or you can show just the contracts and not the invoices. You will also be able to use metadata to create smart collections, so you could create a collection that shows you all the contracts that are within three months of expiring. If any of that sounds familiar, think back to the extensible schemas planned for WinFS (Microsoft's never-delivered object file system) that ended up in SQL Server and, to a certain extent, SharePoint. To be fair, if you think about how to organize, categorize and collect information, at some point you're almost bound to reinvent some of the principles of WinFS; Microsoft has, many times.

We look at how the next generation of enterprise apps could change the game. Read More Using metadata like that will work even better once Box is able to look inside files and categorise them automatically. The service already scans files as you upload them to index text for search, but the plan is to use machine learning to spot what type of document you're uploading -- a contract, an invoice, a resumé, a non-disclosure agreement, an order, a white paper or anything else. Box has a large corpus of documents already, so it can use those for comparison and to train the system. Image recognition will tag photos (the way OneDrive and Google already do). It looks like there might even be a category showing what sentiment IBM Watson thinks the document expresses (so you could search for 'complaint letter' rather than remembering the file name. Entities Box is also hoping to go a step further and work out what the entities mentioned in a file are and how they're connected -- the company you sign the NDA with or send the invoice to, or the person you're dealing with for example. Entities are the latest thing in useful ways of thinking about business. Salesforce Einstein and Dynamics 365 are going to pluck entities out of customer records and sales opportunities to spot when someone mentions a competitor, so that the sales team or customer support know they're not your only option. The pattern of entities that make up companies, departments, jobs, skills and connections are the relationship network graph for which Microsoft is buying LinkedIn. But while Salesforce will have to extract entities from the details of businesses and customer records that it has in its many customer accounts, and Box will have to scrape it out of documents, Microsoft has a head-start with Bing, which has been building a huge database of all kinds of entities for years. Entities are how Bing gets the right kind of links for your search and they're how it can show instant answers to more and more questions without you having to follow any of those links. They're not something that's showing up in SharePoint much, but they're key in Dynamics, Delve Analytics and Outlook. When Outlook spots that you have a flight reservation and adds it to your calendar automatically, it's finding entities like the airline and the flight number in that message. Look for this kind of smart use of entities to start showing up all over the place. Box is planning another clever feature for 2017, with the slightly disturbing name of Box Renditions; this takes a file that you put into Box and turns it into something else -- that could be watermarking video, recognising images and OCRing any text in them (something OneNote can already do for OneDrive and SharePoint), or turning a Word document into speech. A much simpler feature will come in very handy: when someone shares a file with you and then removes the file before you manage to look at it, there's a button you can click that sends a message asking them to let you see the file after all. Yes, you could reply to the email or message where they sent you the link (assuming you kept it and didn't copy the link somewhere else), but it's far easier to click in the same dialog that says you don't have access to the file. Another planned feature is a smart search that Outlook users will recognise, but for far more than 'email messages in the last week that have attachments'. You'll be able to quickly retrieve files in useful chunks like 'Office files I uploaded yesterday' or 'Photos I uploaded last month'. Box is planning to add translation of documents you save in the cloud, and you might be able to translate comments and chats that you have about files. SharePoint is getting a similar translation features soon. More on Sharepoint: Microsoft delivers preview of OneDrive-SharePoint Online sync | Microsoft delivers promised SharePoint mobile app for iOS | Microsoft to add new SMB apps to Office 365 Business Premium plan Box is also planning to add a feature that's been very useful in Word: a side by side view of the differences between two versions of a document -- but you'll get it when you preview a document rather than having to open it. Box is adding rich previews for 360 video and 3D models (OneDrive and SharePoint are just about to get rich previews for Adobe files, including Illustrator (.ai), Photoshop (.psd) and Encapsulated PostScript (.eps), email files (.msg and .eml), more photo formats (including many RAW formats) and streaming video). Box/Microsoft interoperability Some of the loudest applause at the Box sneak peek session was for the new Excel preview, which looks remarkably like Excel Online (because it's powered by Microsoft's Excel REST API). That's going to be useful even with the integration that's coming with the Office Online apps in Office 365, because the preview will still give you full-fidelity preview of your spreadsheet even if you don't have Office 365. Box and Microsoft have a lot of common customers who do have Office 365 though. They'll like the custom tile they'll get in Office 365 to see the files they have stored in Box that they can open in Office Online. The Box tiles you'll see in the Office 365 apps list.

Create a new Office Online file inside Box. Image: Mary Branscombe Without leaving the Box site, you're using PowerPoint Online to edit your presentation. Image: Mary Branscombe You'll also be able to create custom portals in Box that use Office Online to open documents without anyone being able to see that they're stored on Box. A business or a college could create a site where customers or students can preview and annotate documents, or open them in Office Online for editing, and it will all look as if it's happening on the organisation's own site. SharePoint-style features The most SharePoint-like features might be the team workflow tools, which get new options, and the new Box Relay, which IBM is helping to build. Team workflow lets you do simple things like starting a workflow to approve an expense request every time you upload a geotagged photo of a receipt. Box Relay adds forms where you can specify a lot more information to use in the workflow, that you can use to apply metadata or start other workflows. The second-loudest applause was for another familiar SharePoint feature: more admin controls. There's a new admin console that will let you control access, and next year admins will be able to delegate adding external users to Box groups to the managers whose group it is. This isn't Box copying SharePoint though; this is the natural evolution of tools that you use to make documents available to teams of people. It's worth remembering that in the beginning, SharePoint was shadow IT that spread virally because it gave teams a way to get work done together that IT-managed file shares simply didn't. Cloud sharing services like Box were able to get a foothold by offering the next generation of users a solution that let them share, only this time it was often people outside the company they needed to collaborate with. Once those cloud solutions get adopted widely, IT will need tools to monitor and administer and control them, because once entire business processes are going through a workflow built by the people in the team who do the job, their managers need to be able to track it and the compliance team needs to be able to report on it, at which point things start to look at lot like SharePoint. Box would argue that it doesn't have the disadvantages of SharePoint. What that means for a lot of businesses is that it doesn't have the legacy and expectations of SharePoint, or the cruft that accretes to a platform over a decade and more of upgrades and updates and changes in strategy. Microsoft would doubtless argue that the latest version of SharePoint doesn't have the disadvantages of older versions, unless customers insist on dragging those along for the ride (although it would be phrased more politely and with more understanding of how hard it can be to get here from there). The goal for Box -- and for SharePoint -- is to make the admin features comprehensive without letting them cripple the useful features, and to keep on adding useful functionality that takes advantage of new technology to make user's lives easier. You can't rely on the gravity of documents to keep users on a document system that's full of their old documents when a new platform beats it on features. Which means we can expect Box and SharePoint to carry on looking more similar than either Box or Microsoft might like to admit, even though they're fundamentally different. It also means that Box has definitely grown up from a cloud storage system to a document management tool.

PHOTO: Jonathan Simcoe Google has delivered a two-pronged enhancement to its survey product. It's created a new version to provide enterprise level marketers with a tool that that’s integrated into the Analytics 360 Suite and moved its newly renamed existing consumer-level survey tool under the Google Analytics umbrella. The goal is to refresh functionality to more accurately capture consumer sentiment with better metrics. Google Surveys 360 Enter Google Surveys 360, online marketing research which sits inside the Google Analytics 360 Suite. According to Google: "Google Surveys 360 makes it easy for anyone in the organization to create a survey, find a specific audience sample, and generate statistically significant results — in just a few days. It's flexible and powerful, with advanced features that include custom panels to survey specific audiences and the ability to measure ad effectiveness, target by geography (ZIP code), industry and occupation." Consumer-Level Survey Tool Google Surveys 360 stands alongside Google Surveys, Google's consumer-grade pay-as-you-go online market research tool. Originally marketed as Google Customer Surveys, the product is now integrated into the analytics platforms. Faster Market Research Google Surveys reflects demand for fast, accurate market research is quickly. Online surveys are increasingly integrated to in-house solutions to allow results to be pulled faster into analytics reporting. Such positioning eliminates typical delays of traditional research, which Google defines as “hiring a research firm, waiting three months or more, and then getting data that's followed and not shareable.”  How Google Surveys Work To use Google Surveys, users can navigate to a user interface like many of its other well-known platforms.  The interface looks like the image below.  Google Surveys interface Users can filter to an audience and select questions.  Single answer, multiple answers and rating scale are the available formats, while the audience selector filter survey participants based on age, gender, and the location in which they are accessing the survey. Pre-qualifying questions can be added as well. Google Surveys provides respondents by sending your created survey across the Google network. It determines the age, gender and location of respondents based on browsing history and IP. This approach ensures that there is a large representative sample to support statistics behind the results. Personalization Strategies The features in Google Surveys 360 reflect a larger movement to incorporate programmatic features into A/B testing. Recently, both Google and its analytics rival Adobe have added new features and optimization options. Those changes ultimately lower the cost of acquiring larger volume of data to ensure testing accuracy.  Surveys’ campaign pricing — only a few cents per number of responses users select — is an example. Google surveys incorporate personalization strategies that enable marketers and publishers to target surveys to specific user groups who have been exposed to specific content or taken specific actions. Mobile Audience Options  For example, retailers can deploy Google Surveys 360 to respondents who viewed a content item on a website. This can be particularly helpful for mobile sites, since Surveys also allows for an Android selection among audience options. But that raises the question of mobile users from other devices: How are they accounted for? Some features are still in development, but for more about how Google Survey works, check out this post from Ray Beharry and learn about his experiences with the new tool.   About the Author Pierre DeBois, the founder of Zimana, will be speaking at CMSWire’s second annual DX Summit in Chicago this November.

While apps like Facebook Messenger have built-in GIF support, though, the stock Android keyboard has so far lagged behind a little. Not anymore! Google has added a feature to the Android 7.1 keyboard that enables you to search for GIFs, and it even remembers the ones that you’ve used so you can quickly access them at a moment’s notice. Unfortunately the feature is a little buried, but once you learn how to get to it, it should be easier the next time. Related: Put your hands together for one-handed typing mode in Google Keyboard update To access the GIF keyboard, you’ll first need to hit the smiley face button in the Google Keyboard, after which you’ll find a GIF button along the bottom of the keyboard. Tap that, and you’ll be able to search through GIFs, and you’ll see a “frequently used” button that will show you the GIFs you use regularly — that can be pretty useful when you have a selection of your favorite GIFs. gif-keyboardMore Unfortunately, the feature is currently only available if you have Android 7.1 installed, which is only available on the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel C, or the new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Thankfully, Android 7.1 should be coming to more phones in the near future, so you should be able to access millions of GIFs in short order. It also seems as though the keyboard is only available in the Messenger app right now — we couldn’t access the feature on other apps, like Gmail, however the new feature may be made available to those apps soon. The GIFs searchable in the keyboard seem to be sourced from a range of different websites — upon quickly checking out the keyboard for ourselves, we saw GIFs from Giphy, Tumblr, and Riffsy.

SUBSCRIBE SEO on a budget: How a small manufacturer started a program from scratch Think you don't have the resources for an effective SEO program? Think again! Columnist Dianna Huff shares a case study detailing how a small business was able to make big gains with a limited budget. Dianna Huff on October 24, 2016 at 10:13 am More The small manufacturers who are thriving in the face of global competition and other challenges have spent the last five to seven years improving productivity and process efficiencies. This focus has often meant that marketing activity was next to nonexistent — with much new business coming from word-of-mouth. Once a small manufacturer has their process down, however, they’re ready to begin a marketing program that includes SEO. The problem is, where to start? With so much information and so many moving parts, a small business owner can be easily overwhelmed. It’s much easier to simply focus on running the business. Such was the case with one of our clients, a small manufacturing firm of about 30 people. The owner and his team had done a SWOT analysis and were ready to embark on a marketing program that included SEO. The challenges, however, were pretty daunting: zero historical data, few backlinks, and building content and brand awareness on a limited budget. Challenge #1: Zero historical data When my company first began working with the small manufacturer in November 2015, we noted right away that the client’s website had a huge error with regard to the Google Analytics tracking code, which had been added to the website home page only. The low number of visitor sessions was a dead giveaway. With our smaller clients, we see this type of UA code/analytics error on a regular basis, as well as others, such as the wrong UA code inserted into the HTML code or the client not having Admin access to Google Analytics. And then we learn that the person who did have access has fallen off the planet. When this happens, we often have to start fresh with a new Google Analytics account. The first step in creating the client’s SEO program, therefore, was to ensure Google Analytics was properly tracking all web pages. An easy fix, but one that left us with zero data on which to base recommendations for moving forward. Months of keyword guessing Not having any Analytics or Search Console data meant we didn’t know the types of search queries people were using. And since the company hadn’t done much marketing in the past and had relatively low traffic volume, it would take months before we had any data that could tell us anything. The client wanted to appear in Google for a few specific keywords pertaining to the services his company provided. However, the Keyword Planner showed few searchers were using these keywords in their searches. Because we’ve worked with many small manufacturers and their esoteric products and services, we’ve learned the Keyword Planner isn’t always accurate, so we went ahead and optimized the website around iterations of these keywords plus others. After a couple of months, it became apparent that those weren’t the right keywords based on traffic and other data. We ended up making a new list and then carefully analyzing the SERPs for each keyword. We wanted to see how Google viewed the intent of each query and then choose the more transactional keywords — i.e., the keywords people would use when looking for the particular products and services the client provided. In addition, we employed standard SEO tactics: ensuring images had descriptive alt tags using keywords whenever possible, creating internal links to key pages and writing descriptive title/meta description tags for all pages of the website. Challenge #2: Few backlinks For smaller manufacturers, the backlink profile is often limited, and budget and personnel constraints mean the company simply can’t take advantage of a full-fledged content and social media marketing program. However, even on a budget, some things can be done which are easy and cost-effective: One of our first steps was to create a Google My Business page, get the company listed in the YP.com directory and create a LinkedIn corporate profile page. To begin creating a few high-quality links that would also start building awareness (Challenge #3), the marketing plan for the year included sending out two press releases, as well as pitching three article ideas to trade publications (and writing the articles should the pitch be accepted). The first press release and pitch resulted in two publications running a case study and an application note respectively. The case study appeared online; the application note appeared in the publication’s print version and online as well — a huge win for any company, but especially nice for a smaller firm. In addition, we continued to add content to the Resources section of the website. For small companies on a tight budget, creating a Resources section is a cost-effective way to create content. This content can then be posted on the corporate or personal LinkedIn profile, added to e-newsletters and most important, optimized to attract search traffic and links. For our client, we created application notes, FAQs and other types of information of interest to the target audience. As a side note, one of the application notes was repurposed for the industry print publication article — a good example of how small companies can get maximum bang for the marketing buck. Challenge #3: Creating content and building awareness One of the tactics the client had wanted to implement from the beginning was a monthly e-newsletter. The client already had an internal list, so we created a new account in MailChimp, imported the list and developed a template. We created a new topic for each month, but midway through the campaign, the client suggested a topic we could break down into multiple articles — and which would be of high interest to the target audience. That’s when we hit paydirt. Although e-newsletters generally don’t fall under the purview of SEO, they do play a role in that they assist in conversions and inquiries over time. According to Gardner Business Media’s 2015 Media Usage in Manufacturing Report, 68 percent of survey respondents view e-newsletters as an effective method for finding solutions-based info, application stories and information on new products and processes. And 93 percent of respondents indicated they click on companies whose name they recognize in the search results — making e-newsletters an effective way to reinforce brand awareness over time (even if subscribers delete the email after quickly skimming it or don’t read it at all some months). Based on Analytics data we’ve seen with other small manufacturing clients, e-newsletters often play a role in assisting conversions over time and are one of several channels searchers use in their path to conversion. This is why we like to focus on new and returning visitors to the website, conversions and conversion paths rather than open rates. One trick we used, which helped indirectly with SEO, was to repurpose each newsletter article for the website. Then, in each newsletter we added links to this material — which drove people back to the website and gave us more content we could optimize. Results: Slow but steady traffic growth and conversions The chart below shows the All Channels traffic data (adjusted for referral spam) for January through September. Of this, organic accounts for 69 percent, direct 22 percent and referral three percent. More importantly, however, the work we’ve been doing is resulting in conversions. The chart below shows the goal completions for new and returning users for the Q3 period for the website form only; the client has also been getting email and phone inquiries, which his team tracks in-house. What I find exciting is that while the website content we’ve been creating is being found by searchers, the e-newsletter also is driving new and return users to the website — and recently, a few conversions as well. Although the numbers are small, we now have data we can use to create a more finely tuned marketing and measurement plan for year two — a plan which can now include SEO KPIs and targets. The data also gives us a baseline for a discussion on whether to budget for an AdWords campaign in order to determine which keywords drive clicks and inquiries and increase traffic. In conclusion Starting an SEO program from scratch for a smaller company on a budget can be a little daunting, as the expectation for fast results lurks in the background (especially given all the hype and misinformation regarding SEO). The key to success is to set realistic expectations and have patience: for smaller companies on a tight budget and/or limited resources, it can take up to a year to see results from SEO and content marketing. I would also add two other success tips. The first tip is to be consistent. Regularly create pieces of content for the website and optimize it, publish the e-newsletter each month, post to social platforms even if only one platform is being used and so on. Over time, these efforts create momentum which begins to snowball. The second tip is to employ a little ingenuity; make things do double and triple duty so that you can leverage multiple channels without a whole lot of additional effort.

SUBSCRIBE Using PPC brand protection to decrease campaign costs by 51% Columnist Lori Weiman makes the case for why it's worth seriously focusing on -- and defending -- your own branded terms in paid search. Lori Weiman on October 24, 2016 at 10:52 am More Search marketers with whom I consult like to complain about how giant improvements in PPC growth are behind us. They fondly recall the glory days of the 2000s when the immature PPC market allowed savvy marketers to boost PPC revenue a ton using simple tweaks to keywords or bidding strategies. I recently completed a series here on Search Engine Land that made the case that there are still big gains to be made if you know where to focus. The eight-part series showed how branded keyword protection is this year’s secret weapon to achieving the monster revenue growth we miss so dearly. The impetus for this series was how PPC brand protection is changing, but I’ve noticed that most marketers are not keeping up. Here’s the brand defense story I presented: Optimization tactics have come and gone since the days of five-cent bids, and we’ve discovered that PPC brand bidding is the next tactic for driving meaningful revenue gains. Branded keywords are more valuable than you think. They get quality traffic and clicks, and they require careful, constant protection. In 2016, advanced marketers protect their branded terms by coordinating with partners, reducing competition where possible and exercising legal actions when necessary. There are plenty of examples of best practices and effective brand protection techniques to copy from. The future is bright for brand protection strategies, especially for agencies, MAP compliance and hotel price parity. PPC brand protection case study An important part of this series was an Avery PPC brand protection case study showing how the retailer’s competitors were using the Avery trademark in their ad copy across multiple engines — a violation of the engines’ policies. Avery’s agency (Chacka Marketing) learned of the violations from its ad monitoring tool (disclosure: The Search Monitor, my employer) and used the advertising evidence to get Google, Bing and Yahoo to take down the ads. With fewer competitors on their branded terms, Avery saw these very meaningful results for revenue: Brand CPCs decreased by 64 percent; clicks increased by 34 percent; and campaign costs decreased by 51 percent. New brand protection data Since finishing the series in May, I found new data discussing the importance of protecting branded searches. Merkle published this data in their Q2 Digital Marketing Report, which analyzed their clients’ search activities in Paid Search, SEO and social media. A few highlights related to the value of branded searches: Brand CPCs in AdWords were higher in 2015 than any time during the previous five years. The first-page minimum CPC for AdWords also jumped significantly during 2015 for branded keywords. Brand CPCs on Bing and Yahoo have risen in 2016, while Google’s brand CPCs have been more steady. Ad spend on Google’s branded US paid search increased by 20 percent y/y during Q2 of 2016. Google’s branded CPCs on mobile devices jumped suddenly and sharply during July. Advertisers are clearly placing more value on their branded searches, bidding up the CPCs. The Merkle data is in line with what The Search Monitor tracks on its platform. Throughout 2016, we’ve seen that the search results page has become increasingly competitive for branded searches. Some more specific data to support this point: In a 14-day review of branded ads from 100 top retailers earlier this year, The Search Monitor saw more than 2,000 ads that were not the brand-holder’s ads. Roughly one-third of these ads had issues with direct linking (aka URL Hijacking). For every competitor added into the mix, between 10 and 12 percent goes to another brand. It also means the cost per click (CPC) rises. One Search Monitor client shared how they saw one million instances each month where someone was bidding on their branded terms, and the revenue loss from trademark infringements was in the hundreds of millions annually. Exercise: search marketing visibility & PPC brand protection So how should PPC marketers protect their branded searches? I’d like to share an exercise we do with our clients to reveal the extent of the problem. Calculate visibility. For each one of your branded keywords (including all iterations such as typos, URLs and products), calculate a search marketing visibility metric in PPC for you, your partners and your competitors. Evaluate partners. Identify all partners with higher visibility than yours. If you allow them to be more visible than you, congratulate them. If they are not allowed to bid on your branded terms, or if they must be less visible than you are, require that they change their ways ASAP. Show them your ad monitoring proof. Evaluate competitors. For competitors, you have two options: For competitors using your trademarks in their ad copy, contact the engines with proof and get the ads taken down. For competitors using your brand in the Display URL (allowed), find the ones with higher search visibility than yours. Increase your visibility by improving your bidding strategy (e.g., bid higher, increase daily budgets, play with bid adjustments) and increasing your Quality Score (e.g., improve ad copy, adjust your targeting, make landing pages more relevant). This exercise should open your eyes as to how much protection your branded keywords need. If these keywords are currently locked down, don’t get too complacent. They are valuable and a target, so continue this exercise. We recommend doing this exercise at least twice per month and keeping track of historical trends. With the exercise behind you, here are a few other recommendations for protecting your most valuable asset: Know the engines’ rules for brand infringement. Some things are allowed, such as bidding on a branded term, while some aren’t. Know the distinctions. Monitor activity on your branded keywords. Do this by city, country (if applicable), device type (e.g., mobile) and engine. Brand violators are sneaky about how they target your brand. Automate when possible. Yes, monitoring your branded keywords can be time-consuming, so let the 1s and 0s do a lot of the work for you. As an agency client of ours with many retail clients noted: “Using an ad monitoring tool saved us a lot of time. We no longer have to do active searching, gather screen shots and file formal trademark violations within the engines.” Take action on infringers.

First images emerge of radical electric vehicle that can take off and land vertically - and even hover Zee.Aero is testing its craft in Hollister at a secret base Small, all-electric plane can take off and land vertically One of two private investments Page believed to have made in flying cars By Mark Prigg For Dailymail.com Published: 14:19 EST, 24 October 2016 | Updated: 14:37 EST, 24 October 2016 e-mail 192 shares 6 View comments While he may be better known as a self driving car enthusiast, a new video has given a glimpse of Google co-founder Larry Page's secretive self flying car project. Earlier this year it was revealed Page appeared to be privately investing in two separate flying car firms, providing them with $100m. Now, of of the prototype craft has been spotted at a remote airfield in California - and locals say they have even seen it hovering above the ground.   Scroll down for video  The zee.aero prototype has been spotted at the firm's secretive test lab in Hollister, and was spotted because of its strange shape and ability to hover. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, he has personally provided £70 million ($100 million) to two startups developing the technology, and now one of the first prototypes has been spotted. He has reportedly been funding Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk, two rival companies based in California's Silicon Valley. Zee.Aero was set up in 2010, working on a small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically – essentially a flying car.

Share this article Share 192 shares A patent from 2011 emerged earlier this year showing its designs for a flying car, and Bloomberg reported it is now pursuing a 'simpler, more conventional-looking design.' Now, it has relocated to Hollister - and its new design has been spotted by locals. The attention grabbing plane has a high pitched, electric whine, they say. Video courtesy: Mercury News  'It sounded like an electric motor running, just a high-pitched whine,' Steve Eggleston, assistant manager at an airplane-parts company with offices bordering the Hollister Municipal Airport tarmac, told Bay Area News. It has also been spotted hovering by saleswoman Brittany Rodriguez thought to herself.  During both Zee.Aero flights witnessed by DK Turbines staff from several hundred yards away in September and October, the aircraft hovered about 25 feet off the ground, and landed rapidly, straight down, according to the witnesses. Google's company's co-founder, Larry Page appears to be secretly investing in flying cars. According to Bloomberg Businessweek , Page has personally provided £70 million ($100 million) to two startups developing the technology. In May, the cityapproved a 34-year lease with Zee.Aero for just under an acre of land near the intersection of the municipal airport's two landing strips.  It plans  to build a 14,000-square-foot hangar and office building, plus nearly 10,000 square feet of employee parking and 16,000 square feet of paved area for aircraft parking and movement. Zee.Aero have kept their designs very much under wraps, with the only information on their website stating: 'We're designing, building, and testing better ways to get from A to B.'  However, it has been reported that Zee.Aero has hired aerospace designers and engineers from Nasa, Boeing, and SpaceX, and has been testing two single-seater prototype designs - one that looks like a 'small conventional plane' and another with propellers along the sides. Zee.Aero have kept their designs very much under wraps, with the only information on their website stating: 'We're designing, building, and testing better ways to get from A to B.' One of the patents depicts a car-sized aircraft, wings at the nose and tail, and along the top eight propellers, driven by eight motors, for vertical lift.  Two other propellers on the rear wing would provide forward thrust.  Zee.Aero was set up in 2010, working on a small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically – essentially a flying car. Pictured is a Zee.Aero patent from 2011 THE FLYING CAR COMPANIES Zee.Aero was set up in 2010, working on a small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically – essentially a flying car.  While there was much speculation that the company was affiliated to Google, as their headquarters were next door, Zee.Aero fiercely denied the claims. However, it has since been revealed that Zee.Aero belongs to Larry Page, Google's co-founder.  Zee.Aero now employs close to 150 people. Its operations have expanded to an airport hangar in Hollister, where a pair of prototype aircraft takes regular test flights. In 2015 a second competing flying-car startup called Kitty Hawk, also began operations in its headquarters very near Google's.  Despite the apparent rivalry, Bloomburg have reported that Mr Page, has in fact been putting money into both Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk. Last week, an aircraft was spotted being towed down the runway on two consecutive days, although no hovering or flying was observed by witnesses. Dual propellers in the rear fit with the description and drawings from the patent, but the aircraft appeared to have a single main wing, with pod-like structures beneath it, rather than the smaller wings at the front and rear shown in the drawings.   Job ads on the firm's sight also confirm it is sticking with propellors, saying 'The aerodynamics group is responsible for supporting airframe design, propeller design, performance and stability analysis, handling qualities analysis and flight testing.'  In a May letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the firm said it was building 'an entirely new aircraft that will change personal aviation.' A Zee.Aero spokeswoman said the firm is 'currently not discussing (its) plans publicly.'  In May, the city of Hollister approved a 34-year lease with Zee.Aero for just under an acre of land near the intersection of the municipal airport's two landing strips. According to city documents, the company plans to build a 14,000-square-foot hangar and office building, plus nearly 10,000 square feet of employee parking and 16,000 square feet of paved area for aircraft parking and movement. Page has reportedly been funding Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk, two rival companies based in California's Silicon Valley. Mr Page has demanded that his involvement stay hidden from the public, according to 10 people with intimate knowledge of the company.  According to Bloomberg Businessweek , Google co-founder, Larry Page, has been personally funding two startup companies who are developing flying cars In 2015 a second competing flying-car startup called Kitty Hawk, also began operations in its headquarters close to Google's. According to business filings, Kitty Hawk's president is Sebastian Thrun, th­e head of Google's self-driving car programme and the founder of research division, Google X. Despite the apparent rivalry between the companies, Bloomberg has reported that Page, has in fact been putting money into both Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk. Mr Page and Google declined to speak about Zee.Aero or Kitty Hawk, as did Mr Thrun.  Other companies working on flying cars include Terrafugia. Their TF-X concept car (illustrated) has fold-out wings with twin electric motors attached to each end Bloomberg say that Mr Page's interest in the companies is a personal ambition and he even retained a 'man-cave' at one of the company's headquarters, where he was only referred to as 'GUS' - standing for 'the guy upstairs'. While it is known that both Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk have been working on designs for flying cars, the details of their designs are unclear.   Other companies, such as Aeromobil have also been trying to build a flying car Fans of Harry Potter will remember the blue flying car which Harry and Ron use to reach Hogwarts - which was of course, fueled by magic. But flying cars that run in our real world could be closer than you think Other companies, such as Terrafugia have also been trying to build a flying car, but have given suggested launch dates of 10 years from now in 2026.  However, technology is ever improving, and with access to better materials and autonomous navigation systems, it is thought that within the next few years we will have a self-flying car that takes off and lands vertically.  Speaking to Bloomberg, Mark Moore, an aeronautical engineer from Nasa, said: 'Over the past five years, there have been these tremendous advances in the underlying technology.  'What appears in the next 5 to 10 years will be incredible.'   Read more: Welcome to Larry Page’s Secret Flying Car Factories - Bloomberg Google co-founder’s reported ‘flying car’ spotted hovering in Hollister Google co-founder's reported 'flying car' spotted hovering in Hollister Share or comment on this article e-mail 192 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Malcolm Turnbull accuses Lisa Wilkinson of 'interrogating' him Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters 'Don't be afraid': Trump looks to reassure divided America...

That means the separate components (camera, battery, sensors) are reasonably easy to replace if they go wrong. And despite Google's best efforts to distance the Pixel (and Pixel XL) from Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the team at iFixit notice more than a few similarities.

The device, which has been rumored previously, functions differently from the Daydream VR headset that will soon ship to consumers. It works completely standalone without any smartphone attached. Additionally, Engadget now reports that the unannounced product integrates eye-tracking technologies and algorithms "to map out the real-world space in front of a user." The result is an experience that's less closed off than current VR headsets and "blurs the line between virtual and augmented reality." From the sounds of it, this merged reality concept seems to resemble that of Microsoft's HoloLens, though we know very little about Google's plans for this product and what features it will offer. The report reveals that some components powering Google's futuristic device are being provided by Movidius, the computer vision company that Intel is acquiring for an undisclosed sum. Daydream, built into Android 7 Nougat, is designed to deliver a VR experience similar to that of Samsung's Gear VR; you strap your phone into the comfortable headset, put it on, and the immersion begins. But it appears that Google executives might partially share the same philosophy as Microsoft, Magic Leap, and Apple's Tim Cook: some link with the outside world is essential. "There’s no substitute for human contact," Cook told BuzzFeed News earlier this month. "And so you want the technology to encourage that." Daydream VR is for total immersion, but Google's standalone headset could prove to be the company's longer-term bet. Google Glass is dead, but the dream behind it might not be.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Pixel submerged under water for one hour, watch full video By R Padla - October 24, 2016 3 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We’ve got our Google Pixel review already and we said it’s Android redefined by Google. When it was first announced, there was no mention of IP rating but we discovered soon that it is IP53 dust and water-resistant. We expected much from the tech giant so the rating is a bit disappointing but some people are saying that the phone can survive being underwater. Water-resistant is different from being waterproof as we’ve been saying over and over again. However, this phone by Google can last being submerged in water for over an hour. Jonathan Morrison recently shared on YouTube his own experiment. He wanted to see if the Google Pixel is really water-resistant. Usually, an IP53-rating means it can survive dust, drizzle, splash, and even raindrops but it’s nothing compared to the Galaxy S7 or iPhone 7. The video is over one hour. It’s one long “test” but Morrison had to do it. Watch the full video below: The verdict? The Google Pixel survived being underwater. Upon checking the screen, it was still working fine and smoothly. The first problem he noticed was the sound quality coming out of the built-in speaker. That shows some water got inside the phone. It should be okay or at least better once the speakers dry up but we’ll have to wait and see.

All three of the last three speakers were fascinating, but it wasn't until I wove all three speeches together that it became clear to me why innovation seems to evaporate the larger a company becomes. I was drawn in particular to why Netscape failed and Google, outside of ad revenue, largely has been unsuccessful, once you factor in economics. I'll walk you through this and then close with my product of the week: a new set of headphones from Plantronics, which have become my favorite travel headphones. The 4 Elements of Innovation The first speaker used, of all things, the creation of chemotherapy as his quintessential example of innovation. He told the story of how leukemia was a death sentence for children coming into the 1960s with not only a 100 percent fatality rate, but also a horrid end for each child. It was so bad that some doctors refused to see the children, he said, and nurses visiting their wards were covered with sprayed blood. It must have been incredibly difficult to see small children suffering in incredible pain, and the images no doubt deeply disturbed the hospital staff. Apparently there were four drugs that had some success, but they were all poisons. Each had a different function, each had terrible side effects, and each was potentially deadly. All of them individually only prolonged what was a horrid experience, so many doctors refused to use any of them. One doctor, and you can read more details here, felt that all four might work where no one had worked before. Keep in mind the patients were children, each of the drugs individually was a deadly poison, and that doctor wanted to use all four. Oh, and since there was no animal counterpart to leukemia in children, the testing would have to be on live patients. He got very little help and was constantly threatened with termination, but he was 98 percent successful, and his work became the foundation for modern day chemotherapy. The speaker used this example to illustrate his contention that four elements are necessary for innovation to take hold: creativity, the ability to see an alternative; conscientiousness, the ability and drive to work to completion; contentiousness, the ability to fight against a common practice; and a sense of urgency, so the task will be completed in a timely way. (I agree with three of these.) Interestingly, he also used Steve Jobs as an example, but those of us who knew Steve knew he was neither creative (the ideas always came from someone else) nor really conscientious (he got others to do most of the work). Just ask Steve Wozniak. Jobs was a visionary, however, and he could see the value in someone else's idea that others often could not. Also, he sure as hell was disagreeable and contentious. The Steve Jobs example suggests that all of the elements necessary for innovation don't have to reside in the same person. It should be possible to create innovative teams that would have all of those traits and end up with something amazing. But... Not in a Large Company The issue is that folks who are contentious and disagreeable, who are free thinkers, don't survive in large firms. They become the nail that the rest of the firm pounds on until they either conform, die or quit. It is actually kind of hard to find visionaries who aren't CEOs for the same reason. Largely, they are forced to fit inside the visions of someone else, and I think that is why most large firms have to acquire much of their innovative technology after a while. It is why Xerox PARC could create the graphical user interface and mouse, but it took Steve Jobs and Apple to bring them to market. I recall that the first iPhone-like phone I saw was created at Palm, and that group quickly was disbanded after being shot down by Palm's then-CEO for having a stupid idea. It didn't conform. Even at Apple, the iPhone required Steve seeing the threat of a music-playing phone to convince him to pioneer and then husband the product to market. Microsoft also had a group that created an iPhone before Apple and even created a better tablet than the iPad, called the "Courier," and both were killed before ever making it to market. It wasn't that those firms didn't have people who could innovate -- they just treated them like problems, and instead of blessing and driving the related innovations, they forced them out of the company. Google's Approach As the Dell World speakers continued, one of the other things that became clear was that the reason Google largely has been a copycat is that it lost track of its identity. The second speaker, talking about coming innovations, showcased a list of cutting-edge firms -- all of which were created by directing people toward something the firm didn't own and monetizing it. Facebook didn't own the content, Uber didn't own the cars, and Airbnb doesn't own the properties. However, Google was the king of monetizing what it didn't own, and that was its entire model for achieving success. The implication was that had Google realized what it was best at -- monetizing access -- then it would have created its own Facebook, Uber and Airbnb. Instead, it tried to copy Apple, Microsoft and eventually Facebook, but none of those endeavors has been particularly successful financially, and some have cut into their revenue and added to costs. For example, both Apple and Microsoft could have been partners instead of rivals. I recall one of IBM cofounder Thomas Watson Jr.'s saying: "Be willing to change everything but who you are." I think Google's -- now Alphabet's -- problem is that it no longer knows what it is. Wrapping Up Overall, the Dell World talks left me with two lessons. One, that if you want innovation you have to identify those who are likely to innovate, and then back and protect them. Truly consider the concept of Skunk Works, (which has resulted in some of the most innovative products ever created) and the new policies at Ford, which expressly protect free thinkers. Two, that if you don't know what your core skill is, then you are likely to fail a lot. I could go down a list of companies, starting with Netscape and ending with Yahoo, that just forgot who they were and either failed or are in the process of failing as a result. This suggests two other things: If you are a creative free thinker, then you don't want to work for a big company that won't protect you; and one of the first things you should ask when considering a new job is whether the firm knows what its core skill is -- in other words knows more about what it is than its name suggests. Something to noodle on this week. I was a huge fan of the original BackBeat headphones because they were comfortable, had decent active noise cancellation, and really good battery life. The problem was they were really big, and I lost two pairs of them taking them out of my backpack to get something else and forgetting to put them back in. At something like US$250 each that got old really, really fast. Well, Plantronics just released the second generation, and they not only are smaller, allowing me to work around them and not take them out of my backpack, but also cheaper, coming in at a bit more reasonable price of $199.99. Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2 I've been carrying them on my last two trips -- they have worked flawlessly, and I haven't come close to losing them. Even though they are smaller, they cut out the noise on a plane just as well, and I've been burning through a ton of old and new TV shows and several hit movies as a result. Because I'm a longtime fan of BackBeat and I'm less likely to lose these, and they are less likely to break me if I do, the new Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2 headphones are my product of the week.

Reports have indicated the Mate 9 will come in both standard and dual-edge curved variants. By Jake Smith for iGeneration | October 24, 2016 -- 17:12 GMT (10:12 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Alleged press image of the Huawei Mate 9 Pro with a dual-edge curved screen. (Image: EvLeaks/VentureBeat) China tech giant Huawei is set to release its next flagship smartphone line, believed to be called the Mate 9, at its event in Munich, Germany on Nov. 3. In typical smartphone fashion these days, the details for the Mate 9 line are pouring in prior to the event. Huawei is believed to offer two versions of the smartphone: a standard Mate 9 and dual-edge curved Mate 9 Pro. Mate 9 The Mate 9 is believed to be similar to the Mate 8 released in late 2015, with upgraded specifications and sharper design. EvLeaks of VentureBeat published alleged press images of the Mate 9 in a tweet. The images of the Mate 9 show the handset will feature a dual-lens Leica Summarit H 1:2.2/27 ASPH camera, USB-C port, and fingerprint scanner on the rear of the handset. Huawei Mate 9 (Image: EvLeaks/VentureBeat) The dual-lens, dual-sensor camera is similar to what was featured on the Huawei P9 released in the first half of 2016, though with better capabilities. Unconfirmed leaks have tipped the Mate 9 as having a 5.9-inch qHD display, a 64-bit, eight-core HiSilicon Kirin 960 system-on-a-chip, 6GB of RAM, and 256GB storage capacity when the handset is fully-spec'd. A Weibo leak pointed to the Mate 9 becoming available in the following colors: Amber Gold, Ceramic White, Amber Grey, Rose Gold, Moonlight Silver, Sky Grey, Mocha Gold, Champagne Gold, and Enamel Gloss Black. Pricing and availability for the Mate 9 is not clear. Mate 9 Pro Likely to take on Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge and the market left open by the Note 7, Huawei will release an upgraded version of the Mate 9 under the "Pro" moniker. The Mate 9 Pro, codenamed Long Island within Huawei, is believed to feature a dual-edge curved 5.9-inch display and step up to a 1440x2560 qHD resolution from the Mate 9's standard 1080 full-HD resolution, according to VentureBeat. Reports have circulated the Mate 9 Pro will only be available in the China market. EvLeaks tweeted it will be available for $1,300 fully-spec'd out. Android Daydream The added resolution of the more expensive Mate 9 Pro is believed to give it support for Google Daydream VR. Announced at Google I/O 2016 in May, Daydream VR is Google's upcoming line of supported "Daydream ready" smartphones, a headset, a controller, and a whole range of apps and experiences accessible through Google Play. Huawei Mate 9 colors (Image: EvLeaks/VentureBeat) Rumors have pointed to the Mate 9 lineup running Android 7.0 Nougat, bringing support for Google's VR platform. It's likely Huawei will throw in its own software twists on Nougat. VentureBeat reported the Mate 9 Pro will be the only Mate 9 to feature support for VR. Huawei previously unveiled a VR headset alongside the Huawei P9 in 2015. Galaxy Note 7 replacement? The Mate 9 comes at an opportune time for Huawei. It has a chance to pick up the millions of customers left turning in their Galaxy Note 7 phones in fear they could explode amidst a global recall. The Galaxy Note 7 was a well-regarded product when first reviewed in August. Could the Huawei Mate 9's specifications and curved screen in the premium model be enough to fill Samsung's shoes?

Google Photos to Start Showing Albums in Search Results The new feature appears to be a server-side rollout Oct 24, 2016 17:31 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google is constantly updating its proprietary applications with lots of new features and tools. It seems that a new feature might be arriving soon, one that would allow the application to show albums in search results. The introduction of the new Google Photos feature means that, when the user searches for a specific word, like dogs, the photos in albums will be included in the search results. In addition, items found by object recognition will also be included, as well as full albums containing photos of dogs. It seems that the new feature has started rolling out only server-side, according to Android Police. In order to display accurate results, the feature requires the name of the albums, location data, and machine learning for an album or face recognition. The tool seems to work on the web app in the same way. According to reports, it should arrive to other users soon, while the latest Google Photos app is already available on the Play Store. Just recently, Google Photos got an update with improved album sorting, which is quite useful considering that many users store their photos on Google’s proprietary app. Google also added improvements to the cropping tool inside the application, as a better rotation slider was implemented as well. In addition, the company added a button that lets users keep the aspect ratio while resizing the box for adding more elements. #Google#Google Photos#Albums#Play Store#Search results reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Posts Official Samples Taken with Pixel’s “Best Smartphone Camera Ever” Google Says Pixel and Pixel XL Have the Best Smartphone Cameras Ever Google Pixel Product Pages with Full Specs Listed on Carphone Warehouse Google Maps Version 9.38 Brings Upcoming Events Tab OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon    Albums in search results in Google Photos New Android APKs Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments Pictures and Specs of Google's Canned Project ARA Smartphone Leaked Out more on: Project Ara i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Published:October 24, 2016 10:41 pm Why not check out your state capital here as well! (Source: Reddit India) How many times do we start typing a search query on Google, only to have the work made easy thanks to the search engine’s auto-complete feature. But have you every wondered what makes Google suggest what it does? How does it manage to read our minds… or not! Well, according to the most-voted answer to the same question on Quora, “Google Autocomplete uses a combination of factors related to the last 10,000 searches, in your geographical location, your own bookmarks, most visited sites from your web history and the behavior/suggestions of your contacts to predict and reflect trends related to you personally provided that you are logged in or use a GPS enabled browser or mobile device.” (And this was answered by a Google advocate and beta tester, in case you’re wondering.) So, effectively, how Google completes your query is a reflection of what is being most searched with those words and in that region. Which is what makes this Reddit India post extremely fascinating. An India map – made by a Reddit user – shows what Google auto-complete shows if one were to type “When will” and then insert the name of the capital of an Indian state — and the results are most fascinating. Apparently in Delhi, people are most curious about university results (that seems like a nice thing to be concerned about), Mumbai people want to know when the city will sink (and THAT is quite alarming), Chennai is fun and wants to know when the Super Kings will return, while most other parts of India is concerned about monsoons. What is troubling, though, is that all of the north-eastern capitals haven’t logged anything at all. Suggesting a dearth of search there – or maybe it suggests that people just have a varied search pattern. Check out the map here.

Whether you’re a hobby blogger or have turned your blog into a business, your main goal is always going to be increasing the number of visitors you have to your site. The way most of your visitors will find your blog is by searching on Google and finding it high in the search rankings. The closer to number one your site lands, the more people who will see it and visit your page. The big question is: how do you get your site ranked closer to the number one spot? When the Googlebot crawls your site, it judges its worth according to a number of factors. Improve any of them and your site should improve in the rankings. One of the most important factors, and one of the easiest to fix, is your site speed. The site speed is a measurement of how long it takes between the time someone clicks on your link and when they can see everything on your page. If your site is optimised correctly it should take half a second or less, and it will look instantaneous to the viewer. If something on your site lags or hangs up, viewers will be stuck waiting for your page to load. Readers are impatient; if your page takes more than a second or two, the odds are good that they’ll click away and look somewhere else. In fact Google research shows you’ll lose 40% of your traffic if a page takes three seconds or longer to load. And that’s a lost reader, a lost shopper and, ultimately, potentially lost money. Create a Benchmark You’ll have no way of knowing how well you improve if you don’t find out where you’re starting from. Finding your base numbers, or benchmark, is easy to do using the Google Search Console. If you’ve never used it before, log on to the Search Console and add your site by clicking onto the “Add Property” box. Once you have your site in the console, you can find your site speed, the number of impressions your site gets each day, and a whole host of other data. Make a note of your starting numbers before you begin working on your site. Increasing Your Speed If you’ve had your blog or website a while you may be blaming your site host on your speed problems. After all, you probably see ads every day promising to give your site lightning fast speed if you switch, right? Your web host may or may not be adding to your speed problems, but they’re the last thing you should consider. Optimise your site to make it as fast as possible where it stands before even thinking about moving it. Otherwise, you might be bringing along a bunch of problems to your new host, and end up with the same problems as before. It’s All About the Cache A cache system tells visiting computers that they’ve been there before, and that they don’t have to go to all the trouble of searching the entire site again. It remembers details for visitors’ computers, skipping the time they’d otherwise spend downloading details. If you have return visitors to your blog, this can significantly speed up load time. If you’re blogging on WordPress, I recommend the ZenCache plugin. It’s easy to configure while it optimises your site for speed. Clear Your Database The Googlebot can’t move smoothly through your blog if it’s cluttered with useless pages. The most effective thing you can do to speed up your site is to optimise your database. This is simpler than it sounds. It’s just a matter of clearing old data that’s no longer required. Delete old posts and comments Empty the trash Delete any plugins you’re no longer using Get rid of draft posts Toss out duplicate pages and pictures The idea is to create as much virtual white space as possible, to allow the Googlebot to crawl freely through your site. Look for Robot Problems Every time you install a new plugin, make sure it hasn’t affected your robots.txt file. If the plugin tweaks these files, it can cause Google to ignore the content on some of your pages. This causes your rankings to sink, because Google thinks you have a bunch of pages with unknown content on them. Your Page Images It’s not news that readers love images on the page, but if you have videos and photos that aren’t optimised, Google won’t love your blog. Oversized images are one of the most common speed problems. Do a search for WordPress plugins to find one that compresses images for your blog. Shrink all your images down to the smallest usable size and you’ll increase your load speed phenomenally. There are many plugins suited to this task, but we recommend WP Smush. Optimising your site is great for reader experience, but it makes Google happy, which is just as important. You’ll end up with higher rankings, which lead to even more visitors to your blog. The bottom line is that Google likes fast loading times and will happily direct traffic to such sites. The faster you make your site, the closer you’ll get to that number one spot on the search page.

So why this affects the performance? Thank you!

Reply Jim Stewart says: 10/26/2016 at 12:54 pm If you are going to delete old posts I would normally redirect them. Just in case a user finds them from an external link or they have bookmarked them.

And yes we can’t deny the fact that website loading speed is now a highly crucial thing to keep visitors glued to our sites. Especially, given that more and more people are accessing the internet via mobile devices, we have to make sure that our pages load really fast. Optimizing images, using a caching plugin and keeping the database clean are something I do very regularly! Jane.

It’s up to us to create a content-rich, meaningfully designed site that keeps our customers and partners engaged and returning for more. Speed matters, Every fraction of a second a visitor waits for our site to load, their frustration grows and that frustration is aimed at our brand.We should be conscious of placing appropriate keywords throughout every aspect of our site – our titles, content, URLs, and image names. We need to think about our keywords as search terms, how would someone looking for information on this topic search for it. It’s important for every webmaster their website should be responsive for every browser and compatible with all devices because people can visit our website from anything maybe it can be mobile, tablet, desktop pc, or laptop so make sure of our website should be responsive with all browsers and compatible with all devices.There is probably no more basic strategy for SEO than the integration of internal links to our site it is an easy way to boost traffic to individual pages, we should make it standard to link back to our archives frequently when creating new content. Social media signals are too much important for SEO. Eventually, thanks for sharing much interesting thought with us. With best wishes, Amar kumar Reply Vishwajeet says: 10/25/2016 at 9:34 pm Awesome post Jim. Its really help me to increase the speed of my site. I have follow all of your steps. Thanks a lot. Reply Neil says: 10/27/2016 at 1:20 pm Hi Jim, Great post. I find it amazing that just small increases or decreases in page load speed can have such a dramatic effect on your bounce rate and potentially your profitability. I read recently that Amazon equate a 100ms move in site speed with a 1% movement in sales. Images must be one of the biggest culprits when it comes to load speed. People love to load great images up to their websites but very few of them (the people that is) bother to optimise those images before loading. Deleting old posts is an interesting concept, for years I believed that having lots of pages in a website improves your ranking however over the past few weeks I have read a number of articles that are saying what you are saying, ie, delete old non relevant content. Reply Jim Stewart says: 10/28/2016 at 9:09 am I would always check traffic to the pages you are going to delete and always redirect them. Reply Vayamtech says: 10/27/2016 at 4:50 pm You are right Jim. When a site takes more time to load, the user clicks on another link/links. To improve the site loading time, we should delete the old posts which are not generating the traffic. Its really helpful. Thanks Jim for sharing this. Excellent post. Reply Liz Froment says: 10/28/2016 at 9:55 am I’m a huge fan of WPSmush, I didn’t realize how much more slowly my site was running before I started using it. A really simple plugin that makes a big difference. Reply Jim Stewart says: 10/29/2016 at 7:22 pm It’s nice and simple :) Another step you can take before uploading is to resize your images to the correct display size and not just rely on compression. Reply Sarah McIntyre says: 10/28/2016 at 7:40 pm It is hard to find posts which are not getting any traffic. Do you know any method which can detect posts in bulk which are not driving traffic to blog? I also want to remove some of my dead posts. ~Sarah Reply Jim Stewart says: 10/29/2016 at 7:20 pm You can have a look in Google Search console / search analytics/ and select Pages. It will show you the posts which are generating the most search volume and for what keyphrase. Reply Fouad says: 10/30/2016 at 3:40 am Hi Jim, Thanks for sharing this important tips. Indeed, several things contribute to making a site rank higher. How do I know if robots.txt file is affected or not? Reply Jim Stewart says: 10/30/2016 at 10:32 am Check Google Search Console and look under the Crawl section for the robots.txt tester. Reply Sam says: 10/31/2016 at 10:37 pm Hi Jim, Thanks for the post. When I first started my blog, I only thought site speed was about optimizing images. Clearly there’s a lot more to it. – Sam Reply Ansh says: 11/01/2016 at 8:19 pm A very fantastic and fabulous article about pure SEO tactics and strategies love it. I really appreciate your sense of humor and the way you write all in full depth about SEO topics. Reply Andrew says: 11/05/2016 at 8:31 am Will using plugins like WPSmush result in images that look sub par on Retina (and other hi res) displays? Reply Jim Stewart says: 11/06/2016 at 8:49 am You can use lossless compression but to be perfectly honest I have not bench tested it because the sites we’ve used it on look fine. The documentation does mention that it’s suitable for retina display quality images. Reply Pasquale Mellone says: 11/08/2016 at 9:42 pm Jim, great post about a common issue among blogs and websites in general. Personally and like @Caroline Middlebrook, I use gtmetrix.com to get a very detailed sense of where my website stands on both Pagespeed and Yslow score. As far as the ideal combination for my website as well as my clients’ (those using WordPress), I have found that WP Super Cache in combination with Autoptimize generate the best performance. I would also recommend a CDN service (eg Cloudflare) Reply Speak Your Mind Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

These battles took place in two ways, one of which showed close shots and asked the viewer to vote on which was “better.” Pulled back full-frame photos were also shown with viewers voting in a similar manner, this time with photos separated in a gallery, voted on with “Likes.” The Google Pixel XL and the LG V20 took three separate photos in low and medium-light conditions. SEE TOO:Galaxy S7 vs Pixel XL Camera Battle Lighting was a mix of natural sunlight and incandescent (yellow) indoor light. We’ve made an effort to keep the photo conditions the same – same angle, same area of touch focus, etcetera. Regardless of that, non-scientific factors do come into play. The camera lens location on the LG V20 is different from the Google Pixel XL, for example. Because of this we’ve had to get creative with camera placement. That this battle took place on the internet makes this whole experiment a bit less than perfect, too. The images below correspond to the votes that immediately follow them. Each set of votes were captured as of 10:30 AM Central Time on the 24th of October, 2016. We’re leaving the poll open on Facebook for the foreseeable future, so don’t freak out if, 10 years from now, the results seem a bit skewed. Printer Zoomed • Google Pixel XL: 18 • LG V20: 22 Printer Full • Google Pixel XL: 34 • LG V20: 13 Of note is the fact that each of the three photos is part of the test presented in two ways. The “close-up” shots are actually cropped versions of the larger images. The only photo where a cropped photo changed the vote was the Printer above. Hard Drive Zoomed • Google Pixel XL: 27 • LG V20: 6 Hard Drive Full • Google Pixel XL: 40 • LG V20: 12 Also important to note is the fact that some photos had far more votes than others. In this, the first time we’ve done this sort of voting process using Facebook, we’ve found that to be unique to the social network. Photos viewers feel stronger about see more votes while those with less obvious differences see fewer. Book Cover Zoomed • Google Pixel XL: 35 • LG V20: 3 Book Cover Full • Google Pixel XL: 32 • LG V20: 16 In this rather short and, again, unscientific test, we’ve found the Google Pixel XL to be the favorite. This test does not show that one camera is better than the other. A more objective test would include far more photos and a test run outside of the web. But for now, courage! Let us know if you agree with the results.

By Aimee Levitt @aimeelevitt Future Sex: A New Kind of Free Love By Emily Witt Like most of us, Emily Witt grew up with a set of expectations about how her life would proceed. It was pretty much the same sort of life her parents, most of her friends, and most of the characters on TV and in the movies had: after a period of experimentation, she envisioned, as she puts it, "my sexual experience eventually reaching a terminus, like a monorail gliding to a stop at Epcot Center. I would disembark, find myself face to face with another human being, and there we would remain in our permanent station of life: the future." Or, as my best friend once sang while drunkenly stumbling down a sidewalk late one night in our mid-20s, "Someday my prince will come, someday I'll ge-et some." This did not happen, at least not by the time Witt turned 30. Instead she broke up with a long-term boyfriend and began having sex with some of her friends, one of whom, it turned out, was not completely single and also maybe had chlamydia. "I thought the secondhand sexual freedom passed down by my parents had been sufficient to my needs," she writes, "until it wasn't." Chastened, Witt decided to pursue the future on her own: she went to San Francisco, which, despite its lack of monorail, has Google, Facebook, and Apple—as close to the future as anyplace in America. There she encountered a wide variety of people experimenting with different forms of sexuality in order to fulfill their own particular desires. She describes their philosophies and practices in her new book Future Sex. There's the porn actress who desires nothing more than to be anally fisted by a dominatrix named Princess Donna during a film shoot. (“It felt really full," she confides afterward.) There's the "internet sexual" 19-year-old college student who becomes a star on the website Chaturbate, a sort of Chatroulette for sexual voyeurs, "by dressing like an American Apparel model, revealing the depth of her existential despair, and making every one of her viewers feel as if he and only he were the person who might understand and rescue her from both her tortured soul and her vow of celibacy." There are the acolytes of orgasmic meditation, who believe in disconnecting sex from emotional entanglement through a process of controlled clitoral stroking. And there are the two polyamorous Google employees who codify the terms of their relationship in a Google doc, which they end up sharing with their friends. Witt's descriptions of all these people are wry and funny, even the ones she dislikes (the orgasmic meditators, who put her off with their earnestness and relentless positivity) and the ones she sees through (the polyamorists who feel secure about embarking on sexual adventures because they can return to the safety of an established relationship; they eventually become engaged at one Burning Man and marry at the next). But even at her most skeptical, she never crosses the line into contempt; at least all these people can articulate their own desires. When the facilitators at a training session in orgasmic meditation ask her about her own, "I was conscious for the first time of the flat white screen that rolled down when I considered such a question, the opaque shadows of movement behind it. A vacant search bar waited, cursor blinking, for ideas that I, who did not consider an idea an idea until it was expressed in language, had never expressed in language." He does no better when faced with a search bar on an actual computer screen that promises to guide her to any kind of date or porn video she could imagine, if only she could imagine it. She can't get over her embarrassment during orgasmic meditation or bring herself to lift up her shirt during a webcam conversation on Chaturbate. She lacks the courage of a friend who seeks out casual encounters on Craigslist with the explicit goals of collecting some entertaining stories and becoming really good at sex. Witt finally finds a sense of freedom at Burning Man and also a deep personal connection and amazing sex—though each, alas, with a different person—but she realizes that the reason Burning Man is so successful is because it exists outside the constraints, and the laws, of the regular world. She ends her odyssey in a very similar place to where she began. "Younger people, I hoped, would not need autonomous zones," she writes. "Their lives would be free of timidity. They would do their new drugs and have their new sex." Witt is aware she writes from a place of privilege. She is white, straight, and fancily educated. She lives in Brooklyn; writes for intellectual journals like n + 1, the London Review of Books, and the New Yorker; and has the freedom to spend a few months in San Francisco pursuing her inquiry into avant-garde sexual behavior and getting high on magical Altoids in the middle of a weekday. Superficially, her project is not much different from the one undertaken by Kate Bolick in Spinster, which also considered sex and the single woman, except instead of looking to the past for answers as Bolick did, Witt explores the future. There are much worse problems in the world right now. And yet, there are larger implications beyond her own personal happiness. Witt wonders if she, like many women, doesn't know what she wants because she has spent so much of her life trying to conform to other people’s expectations of her sexual behavior. Her parents are comforted by the idea that sexual experimentation is a prelude to her finding the One and diving into the world of bridal magazines. Her partners expect her to be aroused, multiorgasmic, and emotionally detached, like the actresses in the porn videos they can now access for free from their laptops. The pharmaceutical companies take the money she spends every month on birth control pills without improving their technology so she won't feel depressed or gain weight or have a six-month-long period. "Part of the reason I wanted to document what free love might look like was to reveal shared experiences of the lives we were living that fell outside a happiness that could be bought or sold," Witt writes. "To experience sexuality was to have a body that pursued a feeling." Is there any way the future of sexuality can liberate women—and men—from all these expectations (including being forced to distinguish between women and men) so they can understand what feelings their bodies are after and feel free to pursue them? For Witt, it's an open question that she leaves the rest of us to answer.  v More Lit Feature » Tags: Lit Feature, Future Sex, Emily Witt, sex, San Francisco, Chaturbate, orgasmic meditation, polyamory, Google, Burning Man, sexual behavior, birth control Tweet Reprints Share Related Stories In Fear of Dying, Erica Jong explores sex and death in the age of Internet dating And renounces the zipless fuck for good. by Gwynedd Stuart Oct 14, 2015 Kate Bolick's new book surveys the past, present, and future of the unmarried woman And, in the process, determines that "spinsters" should no longer be sad by Aimee Levitt May 14, 2015 Currents: New Horizons in Aural Sex Somewhere in the future lies a meeting of sex, music, and digital technology.

From this point on, the app will be known as Google Home, which makes sense considering the fact that it's going to widen its scope once the Google Home device launches. Up until this point, the Cast app was useful for managing Chromecasts and other Google Cast-compatible streaming receivers. After Google Home launches, it will still do that, but additionally it will be used for setting up your smart speaker. The name change isn't surprising, since Google has recently alerted those who have the Cast app installed that it will become Google Home at some point in the future. That's happening now. But the name isn't the only thing that's changed - the Google Home app has a different layout compared to the last iteration of Google Cast. Whereas the old app had three tabs - What's on, Devices, and Get apps - the new one has just two - Watch and Discover. The search bar is gone too, but to achieve the same purpose you can tap on the floating action button in the bottom right corner. In the top right corner is a new icon that will take you to what used to be the Devices tab. If you want to cast your screen or find special offers for your Chromecast, you can still do that from the navigation drawer. Finally, the new app also has a new icon, as you'd expect. Oddly though, it's not round, even if Google has started pushing for round icons with the release of its Pixel phones. Maybe that will come in a later update. Speaking of updates, as usual it may take a few days before this one hits your device, as Google loves its phased rollouts.

Yes, you can still buy standalone licenses in shops and online, but they’re no longer a cost effective solution. Even though Microsoft clearly wants everyone to make the jump to the subscription version, it hasn’t done a great job of educating people about what it entails. There is a lot of misinformation 11 Frequently Asked Office 2016 Questions Answered 11 Frequently Asked Office 2016 Questions Answered Office 2016 is looming and raises many questions. Do you have to buy a subscription, can you upgrade now, and can you go back to Office 2013? We compiled frequently asked questions and provide the... Read More out there — it can be confusing for those who aren’t tech-savvy. The problem is now so acute that Microsoft has recently published an ebook to dispel some of the myths about Office 365. In this article, I’m going to take a closer look at some of those myths, add a couple more you need to be aware of, and explain why you shouldn’t be worried about making the switch. Myth 1: Office 365 Can Only Be Used Online This is probably the most prevalent of all the Office 365 myths, and it’s easy to understand why it began. Microsoft refers to its Office 365 apps as “cloud-based”. Although it’s technically true, the term “cloud” typically makes people think of online-only services like Google Drive or Salesforce. In reality, all the apps are downloaded from the web and installed on your local machine. Ads by Google But there is a small catch: you’ll need to go online at least once every 30 days to let the software “phone home”. Failure to do so will leave you with reduced functionality How to See If Your Office 365 Subscription Is Active How to See If Your Office 365 Subscription Is Active Not sure if you activated your Office 365 subscription? Want to check and make sure? Here's how to do it easily. Read More .

Limitations are compensated by features, useful even to users of desktop Office. Best of all is its Read More , Office Online, is free to all users. Myth 2: Using Office 365 Is a Security Risk Office 365 is tightly integrated with OneDrive How to Save Your Office 2016 Documents to the Cloud How to Save Your Office 2016 Documents to the Cloud Store and organize your files in the cloud. Use cloud services like OneDrive, Dropbox, and Google Drive to make your files available anywhere and to anyone. Read More . You can save your documents on your own computer, but Microsoft tries very hard to convince you otherwise. That concerns a lot of people. We live in an age of data hacks and cyber-criminals. Barely a week goes by without hearing news of a social media provider getting its passwords stolen or a retail outlet losing its customers’ details. Is it concerning? Yes. But should you be worried? No. Your home computer is far more vulnerable than a tech giant’s servers. Think about it. What security do you have in place at home? At best, the vast majority of you will have a free antivirus, only a tiny percentage of users pay for a premium security suite. Lots of people don’t even use a router in their internet setup Why You Should Use a Router Even With Only One PC Why You Should Use a Router Even With Only One PC Every household with internet access should be using a router, even if there's only one PC connected to the network. Here are a few compelling reasons why. Read More ! Microsoft has a full-time team working to keep you safe and they stay abreast of just about every regulation and compliance law you can think of. Myth 3: Microsoft Shares Data With the Government There’s an oft-repeated trope that says services like Microsoft and Google own any data that you put on their servers. Even worse, some people genuinely believe that they’re watching your every move, meticulously reading your email to granny and looking for signs you might be about to drop a bomb on Canada. Nothing could be further from the truth. Microsoft is explicit in their approach to data ownership and usage. Here’s a quote from their website: Microsoft does not mine your data for advertising or for any purpose other than providing you services that you have paid for … If you ever choose to leave Office 365, you take your data with you. Furthermore, Microsoft is the first major cloud service provider to adopt the international standard for cloud privacy. It has five key principles: You are in control of your data. You know what’s happening with your data. Microsoft provides strong security protection for your data. Your data won’t be used for advertising. Microsoft encourages government inquiry to be made directly to you unless legally prohibited. They will challenge attempts to prohibit disclosure in court. Myth 4: Office 365 Lags Behind Competitors There are a few competitors to Office 365 5 Reasons You Should Use iWork Instead of Microsoft Office 5 Reasons You Should Use iWork Instead of Microsoft Office Many long-time Office users will be unwilling to transition away from the apps they're so used to working with, but it's time to give iWork another chance. Read More . Perhaps the most well-known among home users is Google’s suite of products. Make no mistake, Google’s service is fantastic. It’s free, easy to use, and more than adequate for a lot of basic tasks. But Google also benefits from a reputation of being innovative — people automatically think that everything they produce is on the cutting edge. In reality, the Microsoft offering has a lot more features 10 New Microsoft Office 2016 Features to Increase Productivity 10 New Microsoft Office 2016 Features to Increase Productivity Microsoft Office 2016 receives new features all the time.

Read More , a lot more apps, and a lot more development going into it. After all, the Office line of products is Microsoft’s biggest money-maker — they have to stay ahead of the competition. If you’re still not convinced, take a look the development roadmap for Office 365. It’s impressive seeing how fast new functionality is announced and then released. Myth 5: It’s Unpopular and No One Else Is Using It For a lot of people, the idea of spending money on a service like Office 365 is still hard to grasp. They don’t think anyone else is doing it, and they’re not willing to make the jump. The figures tell a different story. Office 365 has only just celebrated its fifth birthday, but in that time it’s gone from nothing to 80 million paid subscriptions. The term “paid subscriptions” is an important one — each home user can share their single subscription with up to four other users. The total number of people using Office 365 is actually a lot, lot higher. What’s Stopping You? If you still haven’t made the jump from regular Office 5 Good Reasons Why You Should NOT Buy Office 2016 5 Good Reasons Why You Should NOT Buy Office 2016 Should you buy the standalone package version of Office 2016? We present our case why we think you shouldn't and show you what you can do instead. Read More to Office 365, consider this: Office 365 Home is $99.99 per year for five users. The service is updated constantly so you’ll always have the latest software available. In contrast, Office Home & Student 2016 is $149.99 for one PC and you will not get any free upgrades. If you’re still unsure about whether to invest in Office 365, I’d love to know why. Is it too expensive? Are there still some myths that concern you? Are you happy with Google’s free offering?

October 31, 2016 at 5:41 am Sorry, but I'm not buying it (no pun intended!) I've seen where MS will make things "difficult" for someone whose subscription might lapse or who might not have renewed what needed renewing. Now is all that worth the hassle? I don't think so...Oh sure your license kinda does the same thing....(every what?...4 years?) and the same with your passport, (after 10 YEARS!) but to have to "remember" to update or reach out to your Office server every 30 days? nah, its not worth it. You'd be better off with Goggle Docs or (my personal favorite!) LibreOffice....because suppose you don't touch your PC for a month......you'd still be able to use the office suite and not get any issue with reading, editing, etc. Also in regards to the whole security debate? Nope. there too you're better off saving all your important documents on your PC and not any cloud server. See, while you might be more vulnerable with your direct connection to the Internet, and a half paid for subscription for an anti-virus, you have to always look at this from a hackers point of view: what makes a more appealing target?? the servers for this Office 365 cloud service WHICH IS ALWAYS ON!!......or the lady who MAY or MAY not be awake at a certain time of day, or who might log off in the middle of an email,?....hackerwise, the little old lady offers very high "potential" gains, but because there's no definitive schedule and you don't want to go "knocking" and find out no one's home for the next week because they're on vacation. or she's in the hospital..orwhat have you. Yeah....nah I'll stick with LibreOffice and will save my documents on the 2TB external drive I have, something I can lock up and can protect myself. No thanks MS. Reply Jack October 29, 2016 at 8:58 am My biggest problem with going over to 365 is that it is a subscription service that only gives you a years worth of updates. However you buy the CD version of Microsoft Office 2016 it is covered for updates until 2025 (extended). I am pleased for those who can afford to get the subscription but there are many (including myself) who are not working and or on low income. And the purchasing of a CD/DVD is more cost effective. Reply PERRY F BRUNS October 25, 2016 at 12:25 pm The big problem I have with Office 365 is that if your subscription lapses--or if there are problems verifying it--your files become read-only. That's a dealbreaker. Reply jimvandamme October 25, 2016 at 3:52 pm Not a problem, you can read anything with LibreOffice. Reply PERRY F BRUNS October 25, 2016 at 4:21 pm Oh, I already use LibreOffice, partially for its cross-compatibility. But what about working with Office 365 documents after a subscription expires? https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-happens-to-my-data-and-access-when-my-Office-365-for-business-subscription-ends-4436582f-211a-45ec-b72e-33647f97d8a3 Read? Yes, for up to 90 days. Edit? Not sure. I'm reasonably sure I'd be able to cut and paste Office 365 information into new documents, but then why not start with LibreOffice to begin with? Reply dragonmouth October 24, 2016 at 11:17 pm "Myth 3: Microsoft Shares Data With the Government" Is the admission by Yahoo that they were providing emails from millions of accounts to the government also a myth? Reply Tina Sieber October 27, 2016 at 10:37 am Yahoo is a different company. Microsoft is setting up huge data centers across Europe to evade the US government. If you're a US citizen, the NSA remains a problem and Microsoft might not be able to escape them. Outside the legal restrictions in the US, Microsoft is doing everything it can to enable users outside the US to keep their data private and safe. I think it's credible when Microsoft says that the company does don't mine your data for advertising and I think Microsoft is making a genuine effort to be transparent. Innocent until proven guilty I guess. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

 Tesla, Google, and Ford are investing billions of dollars in technology America doesn't need Matthew DeBord Oct. 24, 2016, 12:18 PM 15,629 facebook linkedin twitter email print A perfect 5? Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider Trying to achieve fully self-driving cars could be a waste of time and money. But that hasn't stopped a lot of companies from going all in with the idea. The way I see it, there are three main models for self-driving vehicles: The Google Car: Reversed engineered from a future when cars achieve so-called "Level 5" maximum autonomy and don't need drivers or even traditional driving controls. The Uber fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh is aiming for a similar model, but with a bolted-on (so far) technology, rather than tech that's integrated with the vehicle. Tesla Autopilot: An incremental, data-driven approach, involving steady improvements for both hardware and software combined with increasing amounts of real-world experience and a networked effect of "fleet learning." The question with this approach is whether it will ever lead to truly full autonomy. CEO Elon Musk thinks so, and the recent announcement that all new Teslas will be built the hardware to do the job backs him up, if only at a theoretical level for the moment. Hyper Cruise Control: The traditional auto industry is exploring some self-driving ideas but hasn't yet put anything on the road that's as ambitious and even the current version of Tesla Autopilot. The short-term goal is to keep improving good-old cruise control. Effectively, the General Motors, Fords, BMWs, and Toyotas of the world are offloading the development risk of full autonomy to well-financed tech firms and startups. It's a wait-and-see approach, and critically the auto industry isn't really sure that consumers will really want self-driving cars — or want to pay extra for them. Breaking it down To be honest, the traditional industry's tack is realistic but a bit hard-nosed. It's banking on being able to grab self-driving tech off -the-shelf and use its manufacturing might to get it to mass-market scale, if the tech evolves far enough and demonstrates broad appeal. I used to think that Tesla Autopilot made the most sense, but now that Musk has decided he needs to go after self-driving more aggressively, I'm concerned that Tesla is undermining the very thing it needs most now, which is to get an affordable Tesla on the road in the Model 3. The Model 3 was supposed to be a mass-market electric car, first and foremost, engineered to a mass-market price point. Now it has to be electric and capable of driving itself. The Google Car idea is in the most trouble because even as Google racks up the self-driving miles with its test fleet, it hasn't come up with a way to make any money off the tech.  Too good? Google However, as ambitious as the Google Car model is, it's the one that's exerting the most pull at the moment. Level 5 autonomy is its objective, and Tesla has jumped on that bandwagon. Uber also wants full autonomy because it creates the prospect of getting rid of human drivers, a significant current cost for CEO Travis Kalanick's company. Even Ford has said it wants to put fully autonomous cars on the road by 2021. A "proven loser" MIT's David Mindell, a robotics researcher, has a different angle: he thinks that full-autonomy isn't just unneeded — it's historically an invalidated idea and could be outdone by a more perfect version of partial autonomy. Full autonomy, he told MIT News (via Robotic Trends), has "proven to be a loser of an approach in a lot of other domains," adding that he's not making his case from "first principles" but is rather basing his views on "40 years’ worth of examples,” from submersible drones to the Moon landings. Here's his take, in a nutshell. On a scale of 1-10, if no self-driving is 1 and full autonomy is 10, but you could get an ideal integration of human and machine at 5, then shooting for 10 is a waste of time and resources. He cleverly calls this the "perfect 5." We have very little fully autonomous transportation available to us now, despite some nearly ideal closed environments and adequate technology. Pilots still sit in the cockpit of jetliners, even though much of the flying is handle by computers. Ships still have crews, even though its theoretically possible for them to sail from port to port by themselves. Trains would also seem to be a good self-transporting platform, but there are some daunting technical challenges. Uber's driverless Pittsburgh fleet. Business Insider/Corey Protin Cars, cars, cars The action in autonomy is now all around cars, perhaps because we so frequently interact with them, and for many people, traffic and the demands of car ownership are a drag. And because so much of the full-autonomy conversation is being dominated by Silicon Valley futurists, we're hearing a lot about completely removing the driver. But of course, a present-day "driver" could also be thought of as a future vehicle "operator," rather than as a passive passenger. From Mindell's perspective, this might be ideal, as it would add flexibility to a system that would otherwise be "brittle," if it becomes totally computer controlled.  Makes sense to me. We have a precedent for this now, by the way. Everyone who wants to drive a car has to get a driver's license, but plenty of people drive infrequently. They know the basics, however. I can easily envision of "perfect 5" self-driving future in which drivers don't do much but need to possess a core competency in case they have to take over.  This would save us from having to invest billions if not trillions in a fully autonomous future that, if history is any indication, we don't need.

Android Pay expands its reach via new partnerships with Visa and MasterCard Posted Oct 24, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Ecobee kicks off a new voluntary energy study to help fight climate change Google announced this morning two strategic partnerships with Visa and MasterCard aimed at expanding the reach of its mobile payments service, Android Pay. The company says that Android Pay users who are shopping online from their smartphones will soon be able to make payments on hundreds of thousands of new sites where either Visa Checkout or Masterpass are accepted at checkout. Visa Checkout and Masterpass are Visa and MasterCard’s own attempts at carving out their own space in online payments, as a competitor to services like PayPal and Apple Pay, for example, the latter of which arrived in Apple’s Safari browser, on both desktop and mobile, this September. Google, on the other hand, is touting how its payments service, Android Pay, is designed to work with existing solutions to improve online checkout across the mobile web. It notes that those merchants who have already enabled either Visa Checkout or Masterpass won’t have to make any changes on their end when the Android Pay support goes live, as their buttons will update automatically. To use Android Pay on sites that offers Masterpass or Visa Checkout, consumers will first have to link their accounts to the respective services in the Android Pay application. Once set up, you can use Android Pay at checkout along with your preferred authentication method, like fingerprint recognition. The end goal, similar to Apple Pay, is to make it easier to complete the checkout process when shopping online from a mobile device. You won’t have to enter a username and password, which can be a hassle. The result, in many cases, is fewer abandoned shopping carts and higher conversions on merchants’ sites. This is Apple Pay’s promise, as well; and PayPal itself has been working to make online checkout more seamless through its OneTouch solution, which saves your credentials across sites and apps so you don’t have to keep logging in. Google isn’t the only one making nice with Visa and MasterCard, as of late. Earlier this year, both companies also expanded their relationships with PayPal, in an effort by PayPal to make its service a more visible option when shopping in-store at brick-and-mortar retail locations. The move was meant to help PayPal gain traction among increasing competition from rival mobile payment solutions, including Apple Pay, not to mention the growing number of stores offering their own digital wallets, including Starbucks, Wal-Mart, CVS, Kohl’s and others. The Android Pay app will be updated with Visa Checkout and Masterpass integrations in early 2017, Google says. The rollout will begin in the U.S., with plans to expand everywhere Android Pay is available (the UK, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong). 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Android Pay Description Android Play is a mobile payments service for online shoppers.

It may not be quiet for long, though, as fans can now find its once-secret location on Google Maps. As spotted by an eagle-eyed fan, Dr. Stephen Strange’s New York City lair is not quite so secret anymore. As a likely tie-in to the upcoming movie, which stars Benedict Cumberbatch as the Marvel superhero, when you search for “Doctor Strange’s Sanctum Sanctorum” in Google Maps, it brings up the location at 177A Bleecker Street in Manhattan. Google classifies the location (which is actually occupied by a deli) as an “Association or Organization,” which just so happens to have Marvel.com as its web address. Fans have been leaving reviews for the Doctor’s services on Google, despite the fact the Google version of the Sanctum Santorum is even less real than the LEGO version. Love this. Type 177a Bleecker Street into Google Maps and this shows up. (I think it's actually a grocery store on that spot) #DoctorStrange pic.twitter.com/FSx6wwuFbb — Chris Hewitt (@ChrisHewitt) October 24, 2016 Doctor Strange, which also stars Tilda Swinton, Rachel McAdams, Mads Mikkelsen, and Chiwetel Ejiofor, open in theaters on Nov. 4.

With the launch of the Google Pixel more people than ever are enjoying free and unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos with the service, and it seems Google is — as it should — continuing to improve it for all of us. The latest addition to Google Photos is the ability to find albums in search… I’m actually not seeing this feature yet on any of my devices, but Kyle Salewski over on Google+ is (via Android Police).  Basically it lets you find albums of photos related to the search term that you type in at the top of the window. In the case of the below example, Kyle typed in Vegas, and while the results still show images and videos taken in Vegas, the search is also now surfacing a few albums with Vegas in the name. Like I said, I’m not seeing this feature yet on my devices, but if you force quit and restart the app on your phone you might see it show up for you. It should also show up on the web at some point soon. Check it out: Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

This new Android Nougat custom ROM series has to be installed on Google Nexus 7 LTE (aka Deb) and Wi-Fi only (aka Flo) 2013 series models only; if tried on other devices, it might get bricked [To check your device model: Go to Settings >> About phone >> model number] Installation of custom ROM requires clearing of memory in the tablet, so make sure to back all the data by installing Clockwork Mod (CWM) Recovery/ TWRP in the smartphone. Make sure the USB driver is installed in the PC, or else your device (Google Nexus 7) will not be recognised by the computer. Make sure your device has more than 80 percent battery, or else there is chance of the tablet getting temporarily bricked if the installation process is interrupted mid-way. [Disclaimer: This procedure is very technical and should be performed by a person with sound knowledge of rooting (or manual software installation) Android devices. If the step-by-step installation process is not followed properly, there are chances of the smartphone getting bricked or being permanently irreparable. IBTimes India cannot be held responsible for any damage or claims from readers if the procedure does not yield the required results or if the smartphone is bricked.

Step 8: Navigate back to ClockworkMod recovery, and select 'advanced' and tap 'wipe dalvik cache' [Note: This step is optional, but many recommend this procedure so that user will not face boot loops or any other errors in the middle of custom ROM installation].

Big Data Cloud Computing Fintech Infosec Internet of Things Martech Wearable Tech Making Enterprise IT Affordable for Small Businesses with the Cloud Posted October 24, 2016 By Steven Job Making Enterprise IT Affordable Recent advancements in cloud technology have made enterprise IT services, like DNS management, a reality for even small businesses. Customers have started to expect the same levels of online performance from small businesses as they do from enterprises. Everything from application to network performance, even DNS resolution times are all being held to the same standard as tech giants, like Google. If you can’t meet these standards, then the Twittersphere will explode, your brand could be damaged, and you could be losing revenue… all because you can’t be Google. Everyone wants to point the finger at the millennials. The demand generation who expects every business, no matter the size or scale, to have a responsive website, mobile app, social media presence, and everything must load within two seconds or less, or else you’ll have to deal with a scathing Yelp review. But you’d be wrong to assume it’s their fault. Nearly every generation has become accustomed these demands, to the point where they have become standards for all online businesses. While some demands may seem outlandish, we are only going to focus on the critical ones that apply to all industries and businesses. If you are a modern business, then you need to make sure your content is readily accessible and loads quickly regardless of a customer’s location or device. How are small businesses supposed to maintain stride with these performance metrics? Most companies don’t have the resources, connections, or know-how to engineer the same performance as enterprise organizations. Let alone the time to stay on top of Internet trends, vulnerabilities, and regulations. The Answer is ITOS The ITOS (Internet Traffic Optimization Services) industry strives to bridge the gap by using cloud technology to help companies of all sizes achieve the same performance goals as enterprises. ITOS uses cloud-hosted management platforms to give small businesses the same global infrastructure as a tech giant, without the tech giant price tag. Recent studies have shown that migrating to the cloud can and will save your organization money, no matter how large or small your network needs are. These networks use Anycast technology, which is hosted in the cloud, self-healing, and highly redundant. Anycast networks are able to authoritatively represent a domain’s name servers at multiple points of presence. That means your domain’s DNS information is hosted at dozens of locations around the world, on multiple name servers at any given time. This dramatically reduces the time it takes for clients to resolve your domain because your DNS information is hosted locally. It’s simple physics, the closer you are to your end-users, the faster your site will load. Now mom and pop’s can take advantage of multi-million dollar networks with infrastructure at dozens of different critical peering hubs around the world. But speed is only one of many benefits that small businesses gain when implementing an ITOS solution. DNS management has dramatically evolved through the migration to cloud-hosted networks, but more importantly through the availability of big data. The cloud has made big data faster, affordable, and is able to be updated in real-time. Now, you can use big data analytics to influence routing decisions in real time. You can gather critical insights about your end-users’ routing patterns and behaviors and make intelligent routing decisions customized on a per user basis. If you want to learn more about how to implement an ITOS solution to improve your businesses’ online performance, you can download this eBook for free here.

Lifestyle Tech News Antoni van Leeuwenhoek 384th birthday: How the Dutch scientist showed us how disgusting and wondrous we are The ‘Father of Microbiology’ showed us the tiniest details of our bodies – including the sperm cell and the diseases that can inhabit them – and gets a Google Doodle for his trouble Andrew Griffin @_andrew_griffin Monday 24 October 2016 15:34 BST Popular videos Hundreds watch Walnut the whippet take final walk Trump ‘plans to split time’ between White House and New York penthouse Donald Trump softens his stance on Obamacare and Clinton’s emails England and Scotland defy Fifa and wear poppies in World Cup qualifier Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is being celebrated for his work on microbiology with a Google Doodle. And it is well deserved – he is the scientist who perhaps did the most to help us understand what we are. Van Leeuwenhoek helped pioneer microbiology, and has been known as “the father of microbiology”. That involves seeing ourselves and other organisms in their tiniest form – and he was the first to spot some of the very small parts of our body that makes it do very big things, like being alive in the first place. He was the first person to see and document the sperm cell, for instance. And that was just one of then miniature parts of our body he saw: he also depicted the muscle fibres that help us move and the blood flow that keeps the oxygen in our body so it can work.

By improving that technology massively, he was able to spot the small cellular systems that would become his life’s work – it was through making lenses that he came to understand so much about the world. Read more Google Doodle marks birthday of 'father of microbiology' Those lenses were made using silver or copper frames and lenses that were designed to zoom in by as much as 275 times. Some have suggested that he may have created lenses far more powerful than that, giving as much as 500 times more magnified vision than the human eye. He didn’t tell anyone how he had created such revolutionary viewing techniques. It wasn’t until 1975 – hundreds of years after his death – that anyone was actually able to make a microscope in the same way that the Dutchman did. That was in keeping with a life in which van Leeuwenhoek set little down about his work. He never published himself, and instead detailed his revolutionary work in writings to the Royal Society, which then published his findings. But that work helped find out much of what we now know about the tiny and usually invisible life that so closely affects our own. He was able to spot, for instance, the tiny cells that can start life and can also bring it to an end. But the disease that he would eventually give his name to was one that he found, but also one that he suffered with. Late in his life van Leeuwenhoek was struck by a disease that meant he experienced spasms in his body like hiccups – it is now known as van Leeuwenhoek's disease and to this day there is no cure for it. It killed the scientist at the age of 90, on 26 August 1723. But the pioneering scientist has been remembered again in today’s Google Doodle. Gerben Steenks, who made the image, said that it shows the kind of power that microscopes can give – and the animation shows the surprising new world that was found with the technology, so important but so invisible in our daily lives.

Does the structure of a URL (or uniform resource locator for pointless trivia fans) matter to SEO? Yes it does, in fact there are many best practices you should consider when creating a URL for your content. 1) Keep a simple, readable structure This is Google’s number one most important advice – “a site’s URL structure should be as simple as possible.” It should be logical and readable for human beings. So you’re URL should be www.example.com/SEO-advice-for-beginners not www.example.com/index.php?id_sezione=360&sid=4j3898enno0223bns983201djis03 Use actual words and sentences that anyone can understand, especially when copied into other documents or emails. Stay away from eternally long random patterns of letters and numbers. Nobody wants to click on that. Gov.UK recommends it should be as short, memorable and unambiguous as possible, especially if a URL is going to be referred to offline. 2) Use hyphens to break up words in a URL Punctuation is key in promoting readability in URLs. Google recommends hyphens (www.example.com/SEO-advice-for-beginners) instead of underscores (_). 3) All URLs must be in lower case If your URL contains upper case letters, redirect to the lower case version. In some cases (if you’re hosting with Linux/Unix servers) identical URLs where the sole difference is a capital letter – example.com/webpage versus example.com/webPage – can be considered different pages. 4) Stop-words in URLs It used to be that you were recommended to avoid stop words (a, an, the) in URLs, but that doesn’t matter anymore. A URL just needs to make sense to human eyes. 5) Your headline doesn’t have to match the URL exactly In fact it’s a good idea to vary the text, and make it more concise. If your headline says ’25 super-useful SEO best practice tips for beginners’ it may be useful to pair it with a simpler URL: 25-SEO-best-practice-tips-for-beginners 6) Make sure your keywords are near the front of a URL It’s still good SEO practice to ensure a page’s keywords are near the front of a URL – but it still needs to be readable AND not stuffed with keywords.

Google provides a huge list of how this problem can be created in its guide as mentioned in my introduction. It includes: Additive filtering of a set of items. If you provide different views of the same set of items or search results, especially if you let users filter by a certain criteria in an additive manner (for example: hotels in New York and with a panoramic view), the number of URLs on your site will “explode.” Dynamic generation of documents Problematic parameters in the URL (such as session IDs) Sorting parameters Irrelevant parameters in the URL, such as referral parameters Dynamically generated calendar How to fix URL problems Here are Google’s recommendations for fixing problematic URLs: Use a robots.txt file to block Googlebot’s access to certain URLs. Such as dynamic URLs or URLs that generate search results. Avoid the use of session IDs in URLs. Use cookies instead. Shorten URLs by trimming unnecessary parameters. If your site has an infinite calendar, add a nofollow attribute to links to dynamically created future calendar pages. Check your site for broken relative links. The above tips were collected from various resources, including Google’s own advice, Moz’s guide and the Gov.uk style guide. Please let me know of there’s anything missing, and I’ll add in a future update.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama October 24 Follow @htsuka A new Google Pixel XL phone. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Google has taken itself down a very promising road with its new Pixel phone line, offering a level of polish and power that makes it very competitive with the market’s top phones. I admit that I was a bit underwhelmed by the Pixel’s first appearance, which came at a Google launch event earlier this month. Google’s Nexus line of phones had always appealed well to the niche Android superfan audience, and on paper it did not seem that the $750 Pixel would really offer that much more. Yet my mind changed after the company sent me a Pixel XL to review. Both this 5.5-inch phone and its smaller sibling run pure Android and feature Google's voice-controlled Assistant. The Pixel XL proved to be an elegant, capable and — best of all — useful phone. For one, it’s a nice-feeling phone. The Pixel has the right heft to it while still keeping a slim profile. It sits well in the hand; its fingerprint reader is on the back of the phone, in keeping with a design decision made for the last Nexus phones. It’s in a more natural position, and the reader is so snappy that you’re rarely left to linger on the reader for long. Although HTC built the phone, Google designed it. It does not have an ultra-slim, ultra-sleek design, but it feels like more of a high-end phone thanks to its high-quality materials and how they sit in the hand. I have not had the phone quite long enough to make a good determination about its battery, apart from saying that it easily lasts me through a day of normal use and does not drain too quickly, even during testing. The phone also charges quickly, which is a serious point in its favor, especially for people who are traveling. But the real point of the Pixel seems to be to show off the full extent of its system and its fancy new software. The phone will get the latest updates of Google’s software first, and it comes equipped with the company’s latest system, Android Nougat. Google's Assistant shows a lot of promise, providing much of the same information and features as Apple's Siri in a smoother and more conversational style. It is not perfect, but it is impressive — especially for a first try at creating an artificial-intelligence assistant. There are many things I would like to ask Assistant that it cannot do yet, particularly regarding interacting with third-party services. But if Google’s aim was to replace its search bar with the voice-controlled Assistant, it’s well on its way to doing that given how well Assistant follows basic conversation. If I had to pick some downsides, I would say that the camera is not always quite as crisp as its competitors, particularly when taking portraits — though, as I said, the camera is quite good overall. Also, it would be nice if the phone were waterproof. Waterproofing is a phone feature that people probably do not realize they want until it’s too late. And if you’re putting down the cash for the Pixel, it is probably an investment you want to protect. Sure, the Pixel may not be a flashy buy, and it lacks some of the high-end gloss of a top Android phone such as the Samsung S7 Edge. But it hits the basics well, and its performance and overall design show that Google may finally be serious about becoming a viable Android phone manufacturer on its own. If it is, the Pixel is an excellent first step. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Internet is becoming unreadable because of a trend towards lighter, thinner fonts The Telegraph 10/24/2016 By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor © Press Association File photo of an elderly gentleman surfing the internet. The internet is becoming unreadable because of a trend towards lighter and thinner fonts, making it difficult for the elderly or visually-impaired to see words clearly, a web expert has found. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Where text used to be bold and dark, which contrasted well with predominantly white backgrounds, now many websites are switching to light greys or blues for their type. Award winning blogger Kevin Marks, founder of Microformats and former vice president of web services at BT, decided to look into the trend after becoming concerned that his eyesight was failing because he was increasingly struggling to read on screen text. He found a ‘widespread movement’ to reduce the contrast between the words and the background, with tech giants Apple, Google and Twitter all altering their typography. True black on white text has a contrast ratio of 21:1 - the maximum which can be achieved. Most technology companies agree that it is good practice for type to be a minimum of 7:1 so that the visually-impaired can still see text. But Mr Marks, found that even Apple’s own typography guidelines, which recommended 7:1 are written in a contrast ratio of 5.5:1. Google’s guidelines also suggest a 7:1 contrast ratio, but 54 per cent opacity of display, which brings the ratio down to 4.6:1. Mr Marks, who has been named one of the Telegraph’s 50 must influential Britons in technology,  said the changes risk undermining the universal reach of the internet. “The typography choices of companies like Apple and Google set the default design of the web, and these two drivers of design are already dancing on the boundaries of legibility,” he warned on the technology site Backchannel . “If the web is relayed through text that’s difficult to read, it curtails the open access by excluding large swaths of people such as the elderly, the visually impaired, or those retrieving websites through low quality screens. “As we rely on computers not only to retrieve information but also to access and build services that are crucial to our lives, making sure that everyone can see what’s happening becomes increasingly important.” The changes in typography have come about because, as web design evolved, the numbers of fonts, colours and background began to diverge from the original set of ‘web safe’ fonts which were deemed legible online. The rise in LCD technology and high definition screens has also allowed designers to use increasingly thinner fonts, which, while working on desktops, can be virtually impossible to read on smartphones or tablets. In recent years, reference guides such as the Typography Handbook have also steered designers away from too much contrast, claiming that traditional black on white typography strains the eyes, and made it difficult for people with dyslexia.   And many computers are now set to grow dimmer during the evening to avoid too much blue light after dark, which can keep people awake. But the US based Web Accessibility Initiative, which came up with the original ratio formula in 2008 to help web designers said too little contrast made web pages ‘confusing and frustrating’. “Choosing colours with poor contrast makes navigating, reading and interacting a real pain,” said a spokesman. “Good design means sufficient contrast between foreground and background colours. If it’s important enough to be clear. This is essential for people with low contrast sensitivity which becomes more common as we age.” But Mr Marks said that reducing the contrast risked alienating some users. “To arbitrarily throw away contrast based on a fashion that looks good on my perfect screen in my perfectly lit office is abdicating designer’s responsibilities to the very people for whom they are designing,” he said. “My plea to designers and software engineers: Ignore the fads and go back to the typographic principles of print. “You’ll be making things better for people who read on smaller, dimmer screens, even if their eyes aren’t aging like mine. It may not be trendy, but it’s time to consider who is being left out by the web’s aesthetic.” Dr Simon Harper, an experimental Computer Scientist in Human Computer Interaction and Information Systems at the University of Manchester, said: "Black text on a white background may convey a certain harshness, grey text, on the other hand, may convey a softer more friendly feeling. "But for some, these design choices come at the cost of legibility, fatigue and comprehension. We call this a situational impairment, whereby the user is disabled by the device, design, environment, or context of use. "Straining to see text will give many a disabling experience. In the new world of cutting edge digital design all of us will at some point become impaired. "Making sure that controls are present to conform the design to the user, so that the user doesn't always have to conform themselves to the design - sometimes and impossible requirement, is the only viable option."

Use OpenID Login with Google google-i18n-address 2.0.0 Downloads ↓ Address validation helpers for Google's i18n address database This package contains a copy of Google’s i18n address metadata repository that contains great data but comes with no uptime guarantees. Contents of this package will allow you to programatically build address forms that adhere to rules of a particular region or country, validate local addresses and format them to produce a valid address label for delivery. The package also contains a Python interface for address validation. Addresses validation The normalize_address function checks the address and either returns its canonical form (suitable for storage and use in addressing envelopes) or raises an InvalidAddress exception that contains a list of errors. Address fields Here is the list of recognized fields: country_code is a two-letter ISO 3166-1 country code country_area is a designation of a region, province or state, recognized values include official names, designated abbreviations, official translations and latin transliterations city is a city or town name, recognized values include official names, official translations and latin transliterations city_area is a sublocality like a district, recognized values include official names, official translations and latin transliterations street_address is the (possibly multiline) street address postal_code is a postal code or zip code sorting_code is a sorting code name is a person’s name company_name is a name of a company or organization Errors Address validation with only country code: >>> from i18naddress import InvalidAddress, normalize_address
>>> try:
...     address = normalize_address({'country_code': 'US'})
... except InvalidAddress as e:
...     print(e.errors)
...
{'city': 'required',
 'country_area': 'required',
 'postal_code': 'required',
 'street_address': 'required'}
 With correct address: >>> from i18naddress import normalize_address
>>> address = normalize_address({
    'country_code': 'US',
    'country_area': 'California',
    'city': 'Mountain View',
    'postal_code': '94043',
    'street_address': '1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy'})
>>> print(address)
{'city': 'MOUNTAIN VIEW',
 'city_area': '',
 'country_area': 'CA',
 'country_code': 'US',
 'postal_code': '94043',
 'sorting_code': '',
 'street_address': '1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy'}
 Postal code/zip code validation example: >>> from i18naddress import InvalidAddress, normalize_address
>>> try:
...     address = normalize_address({
...         'country_code': 'US',
...         'country_area': 'California',
...         'city': 'Mountain View',
...         'postal_code': '74043',
...         'street_address': '1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy'})
... except InvalidAddress as e:
...     print(e.errors)
...
{'postal_code': 'invalid'}
 Address latinization In some cases it may be useful to display foreign addresses in a more accessible format. You can use the latinize_address function to obtain a more verbose, latinized version of an address. This version is suitable for display and useful for full text search indexing but the normalized form is what should be stored in the database and used when printing address labels. >>> from i18naddress import latinize_address
>>> address = {
...     'country_code': 'CN',
...     'country_area': '云南省',
...     'postal_code': '677400',
...     'city': '临沧市',
...     'city_area': '凤庆县',
...     'street_address': '中关村东路1号'}
>>> latinize_address(address)
{'country_code': 'CN',
 'country_area': 'Yunnan Sheng',
 'city': 'Lincang Shi',
 'city_area': 'Lincang Shi',
 'sorting_code': '',
 'postal_code': '677400',
 'street_address': '中关村东路1号'}
 It will also return expanded names for area types that normally use codes and abbreviations such as state names in US: >>> from i18naddress import latinize_address
>>> address = {
...     'country_code': 'US',
...     'country_area': 'CA',
...     'postal_code': '94037',
...     'city': 'Mountain View',
...     'street_address': '1600 Charleston Rd.'}
>>> latinize_address(address)
{'country_code': 'US',
 'country_area': 'California',
 'city': 'Mountain View',
 'city_area': '',
 'sorting_code': '',
 'postal_code': '94037',
 'street_address': '1600 Charleston Rd.'}
 Address formatting You can use the format_address function to format the address following the destination country’s post office regulations: >>> address = {
...     'country_code': 'CN',
...     'country_area': '云南省',
...     'postal_code': '677400',
...     'city': '临沧市',
...     'city_area': '凤庆县',
...     'street_address': '中关村东路1号'}
>>>> print(format_address(address))
677400
云南省临沧市凤庆县
中关村东路1号
CHINA
 You can also ask for a latin-friendly version: >>> address = {
...     'country_code': 'CN',
...     'country_area': '云南省',
...     'postal_code': '677400',
...     'city': '临沧市',
...     'city_area': '凤庆县',
...     'street_address': '中关村东路1号'}
>>> print(format_address(address, latin=True))
中关村东路1号
凤庆县
临沧市
云南省, 677400
CHINA
 Validation rules You can use the get_validation_rules function to obtain validation data useful for constructing address forms specific for a particular country: >>> from i18naddress import get_validation_rules
>>> get_validation_rules({'country_code': 'US', 'country_area': 'CA'})
ValidationRules(
    country_name='UNITED STATES',
    address_format='%N%n%O%n%A%n%C, %S %Z',
    address_latin_format='%N%n%O%n%A%n%C, %S %Z',
    allowed_fields={'street_address', 'company_name', 'city', 'name', 'country_area', 'postal_code'},
    required_fields={'street_address', 'city', 'country_area', 'postal_code'},
    upper_fields={'city', 'country_area'},
    country_area_type='state',
    country_area_choices=[('AL', 'Alabama'), ..., ('WY', 'Wyoming')],
    city_type='city',
    city_choices=[],
    city_area_type='suburb',
    city_area_choices=[],
    postal_code_type='zip',
    postal_code_matchers=[re.compile('^(\\d{5})(?:[ \\-](\\d{4}))?$'), re.compile('^9[0-5]|96[01]')],
    postal_code_examples='90000,96199',
    postal_code_prefix=')
 All known fields You can use KNOWN_FIELDS set, to render optional address fields as hidden elements of your form: >> from i18naddress import get_validation_rules, KNOWN_FIELDS
>> rules = get_validation_rules({'country_code': 'US'})
>> KNOWN_FIELDS - rules.allowed_fields
{'city_area', 'sorting_code'}

News & Analysis Movidius to Push AI at Edge of Network Surveillance camera deal with Hikvision Junko Yoshida 10/24/2016 11:00 AM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet MADISON, Wis. — Movidius, a leading embedded computer-vision processor company, soon to be acquired by Intel Corp., has agreed with China’s Hikvision to penetrate artificial intelligence (AI) deeper into surveillance cameras. The deal put Movidius in a direct contact with Hikvision (pronounced high-K vision), a Chinese company not only known as a major factor globally in the surveillance market, but also for its expertise in advanced visual analytics. Movidius CEO In a phone interview with EE Times, Movidius CEO, Remi El-Ouazzane, said, “Deploying Artificial Intelligence at the edge [of the network] is becoming a massive trend.” Movidius, which has played a key role behind Google’s Project Tango, has been promoting its ultra low-power vision processing SoC in a number of embedded systems. The company has set its sights on accelerating the adoption of deep learning in a host of applications, including security cameras, drones and augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR), as El-Ouazzane explained. Aside from an extended collaboration with Google in neural network technology, Movidius has been working with DJI, in Shenzhen, China, the world’s leading maker of drones and aerial cameras. Based on Movidius’ vision processor unit called Myriad 2, DJI earlier this year launched its Phantom 4 aircraft, with “the ability to sense and avoid obstacles in real time and hover in a fixed position without the need for a GPS signal,” as described by DJI. Ranked No.1 in scene classification at ImageNet 2016 The deal with Hikvision is geared toward driving Movidius’ embedded vision processor into the world of security cameras. Hikvision security cam Although running Deep Neural Networks has historically required devices to depend on additional computing power in the cloud, Movidius’ ultra-low power Myriad 2 Vision Processing Unit can run advanced algorithms — like those developed by Hikvision — at the edge, inside cameras themselves, explained Movidius. Hikvision isn’t just a volume manufacturer of surveillance cameras. Its core expertise lies in the development of Machine Learning-based advanced visual analysis. In fact, Hikvision just last week won the “scene classification” category at ImageNet Challenge 2016.Organized by Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Michigan, and UNC Chapel Hill, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge evaluates algorithms for object detection and image classification in large scale signals. Other categories include object detection, object localization, object detection from video and scene parsing. According to Hikvision Research Institute, its researchers used "inception-style networks and not-so-deep residuals networks that perform better in considerably less training time." Sense, assess and decide Embedded systems, capable of actions such as “to sense, assess and decide,” will only grow further, explained Movidius CEO El-Ouazzane. Along with this growth, the industry has an increasing number of tech companies “trying to attack ‘Deep Learning’ from different layers and come up with new SoC platforms,” he observed. A case in point is ThinCI (pronounced Think-Eye), a startup just out of the closet. Considering the performance level required for neural network applications in a power-constrained environment, embedded vision processing needs a special, purpose-built architecture, El-Ouazzane explained. This trend is amplified by Moore’s Law which has recently shown signs of slowing down, he added. Common to all three applications — security cameras, drones, AR/VR — is the demand for improvements in power consumption, explained El-Ouazzane. But how exactly are neural networks applied to each of these applications?

Many people hoped that Western technology companies would loosen China’s control over information. Instead, those companies have willingly participated in efforts to censor citizens’ speech. Yahoo gave Chinese authorities information about democracy activists, landing them in jail. Microsoft shut down the blog of prominent media-freedom activist Michael Anti. Google censored search results that were politically sensitive in China. In 2006, those three companies came before Congress and were accused by a subcommittee chairman of “sickening collaboration” with the Chinese government. Google shut down its mainland Chinese search engine in 2010, publicly complaining about censorship and cybersecurity. Facebook has been blocked in China since 2009, and its Instagram photo-sharing service was blocked in 2014. I once thought that it would be disastrous or impossible for the social network to try a Chinese adventure of its own, and some China experts still believe that to be true. But a Facebook launch in China now looks probable. Things reviewed Facebook WeChat Facebook’s founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has signaled to Beijing that he’s willing to do what it takes to get into the country. People who know the company well think it will happen. “It’s not an if, it’s a when,” says Tim Sparapani, who was Facebook’s first director of public policy and is now principal at SPQR Strategies, a consulting firm. Facebook declined to comment for this article, but Zuckerberg said last year: “You can’t have a mission to want to connect everyone in the world and leave out the biggest country.” A decade after Google’s hopeful but ill-fated entry into China, U.S. Internet companies may see the Chinese market as even more tantalizing—yet impenetrable. The number of Chinese Internet users has surged to some 700 million, and they represent a valuable untapped resource for American companies with saturated, highly competitive home markets. But the Communist Party’s attempts to control information have also grown more intense. In addition to the “Great Firewall” that blocks access to foreign websites, legions of human censors, many employed at Internet companies, police domestic blogs and social networks. And a U.S. company would now have to compete with China’s own Internet giants. WeChat, a messaging app from the behemoth Tencent, has hundreds of millions of users. Zuckerberg clearly thinks China is worth the trouble, even if that means leaving some “Western values” at the door. Earlier this year, he traveled to Beijing and had a high-profile meeting with China’s propaganda chief, Liu Yunshan. Chinese state media reported that Facebook’s founder praised China’s Internet progress and pledged to work with the government to create a better cyberspace. Liu highlighted the notion of Internet governance “with Chinese characteristics.” The translation was clear: a Chinese version of Facebook would definitely be censored. This year’s trip was something of a sequel. In 2014, he hosted Lu Wei, minister of the Cyberspace Administration of China, at Facebook’s offices. President Xi Jinping’s book The Governance of China just happened to be on ­Zuckerberg’s desk. This courtship hasn’t been without some awkward moments. When ­Zuckerberg posted a photo of himself cheerfully jogging through the polluted haze of Tiananmen Square this year, he was mocked on Chinese social media. But overall he has made the right moves, says Cheng Li, director of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution. “Chinese leaders pay a lot of attention to personal relationships,” he says. “They think Mark ­Zuckerberg is a friend of China. He’s successful. He’s very China-friendly. He has a Chinese wife. He speaks Chinese. So what else do you want?”   At your service Facebook will still have to overcome Beijing’s suspicions that American Internet companies could destabilize the Communist Party’s rule. Media outlets that described the Arab Spring as the “Facebook Revolution” didn’t do the company any favors. And documents leaked by the former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden fueled Chinese suspicions that American technology companies had “back doors” for U.S. government surveillance. But Facebook’s potential to help Chinese businesses go global could lead Beijing to see the company as a net positive. It already sells advertisements to Chinese companies for display outside the country, but launching a version of Facebook in China could strengthen the connections between Chinese companies and overseas customers. The fact that China now has mature social-media companies of its own might also make the government less wary of Facebook. The company would be unlikely to displace incumbents such as the ubiquitous WeChat, which has taken hold in China in a way that few outside the country truly appreciate. People use WeChat not only to communicate but to make purchases, hail taxis, and book doctor’s appointments. In America you can say “I’m not on Facebook” and still be a functioning member of society. Avoiding WeChat in China is much harder. Zuckerberg’s overtures to China have already caused some alarm, but he doesn’t seem to care. Facebook doesn’t have to unseat WeChat in order to succeed. Capturing a relatively small fraction of China’s enormous Internet market could bring in significant revenue. The U.S. company should be able to differentiate itself by providing a bridge to the wider world. “WeChat can’t compete in that domain,” says Cheng, of the Brookings Institution. “Facebook is a global name. WeChat is a Chinese name.” Google could make a similar argument. Despite closing down its Chinese search engine in 2010, Google still sells advertisements in China. Lokman Tsui, Google’s former head of free expression for Asia and the Pacific and now an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, says, “If you are a Chinese company and want to reach global audiences, Google is still a really good option.” This past June, Google’s CEO, ­Sundar Pichai, said that he wanted the company to properly return to the country. “We want to be in China, serving Chinese users,” he said, speaking at the Code Conference. Tsui says there have been “rumors” that Google’s Play Store may enter China (the company declined to comment). Google’s Android mobile operating system is wildly popular in China, but the company’s ability to extract revenue from that position is limited because the Play Store isn’t ­available. Google’s troubled history with Beijing represents a considerable hurdle, however. “They are certainly not trusted,” says Kaiser Kuo, formerly director of international communications at the Chinese search engine Baidu and now the host of the Sinica podcast at China-focused media startup SupChina. Kuo, a well-respected voice on Chinese Internet issues, thinks Facebook’s China prospects look promising. “It’s likely that they will be in with some of their significant services within the coming year,” he says. “There is fairly high-profile engagement with high-ranking Chinese officials and ranking brass at Facebook. You can’t ignore those signals.” Deal with it If Facebook does get the green light from Beijing, sticky questions remain about the conditions that would be attached. Would it have to work with a Chinese partner? Would the government require that Facebook store data inside China, making it easier for authorities to access? Some technical challenges are already clear. Facebook wants to bring everyone into a global network, but Chinese users would be offered very different experiences from those available to their friends in other countries. Sparapani, Facebook’s former policy director, argues that this shouldn’t be hard to do. “You can geo-fence just about anything,” he says. For example, Facebook already occasionally alters what people in different places around the world can see on the site. In 2015 the company blocked users in France, and only France, from viewing a photo of terrorist attack victims. That same year, a photo of a boy urinating on the Indian flag was made unavailable in India. After receiving a request from the U.K. Gambling Commission, Facebook restricted U.K. access to groups promoting raffles. Regularly censoring Chinese pro-democracy activists would generate much more controversy. Zuckerberg’s overtures to China have already caused some alarm; his recent Beijing trip triggered tweets tagged with #suckerberg. But Zuckerberg doesn’t seem to care. If he were so worried about accusations of cozying up to China, then he probably would not have asked President Xi ­Jinping to give his baby a Chinese name (Xi declined) or so publicly made nice with his propaganda chief. Zuckerberg likes to say that Facebook exists to “make the world more open and connected.” China is an important part of this plan. Google made a similar argument when it went to China in 2006: It’s better to be there than not. More connectivity is good, even if you have to make a few sacrifices along the way, such as participating in Chinese censorship. Would Americans buy that argument? Maybe not. Journalists would write scathing articles. Activists and social-media users would unleash derision. U.S. government officials might express concern. But people would keep using Facebook.

VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Google's Pixel XL has garnered global attention since its early October launch. But what's really inside the aluminum unibody-glass smartphone? Teardown specialist iFixit screwed, spudgered, picked, and tweezed its way through the handset to find out. Google's Pixel features on-screen buttons, a back-mounted fingerprint scanner, single rear-facing camera, two speaker slits, a USB-C port, and a headphone jack. IFixit finds that the device is not exactly a breeze to fix. In fact, its repairability score of six out of 10 is lower than that of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, both of which earned a seven out of 10. The Pixel XL lost points because of the phone's "thin, poorly supported" display assembly and press-fit notches, which make removing the midframe "laborious." On the plus side, the phone allows for easy access to its USB Type-C port and microphone, allowing for cheap replacements. VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Google does its best to obscure any partner input. "With nearly everything out of the case, we've seen almost zero evidence of this phone's HTC manufacturing origin," iFixit says. HTC's moniker appears only on the battery, which features a removal tab for "painless" expulsion. //Related Articles Google Pixel XL vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Premium Phablet Showdown Google's new lineup of Pixel smartphones are the first to tap into Google Assistant and the company's Daydream VR platform. The device comes in two sizes: 5 or 5.5 inches, and runs a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, with a high-definition AMOLED Corning Gorilla Glass 4 display. There is also 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, a fingerprint sensor, a USB-C connector, and 3.5mm headphone jack, plus support for Bluetooth 4.2. The Pixel is a Verizon exclusive in the US (but not really); the carrier has promised to push Android updates to the devices as soon as Google makes them available.

But first it'll have to knock out Nest. The Ecobee 3 [Photos: courtesy of Ecobee] Jared Newman 10.24.16 10:30 AM For the last nine years, Ecobee hasn't strayed from being a maker of smart thermostats. Unlike rival Nest, Ecobee never built its own smart home platform, and hasn't expanded into new product categories. The $170 Ecobee3 Lite, announced last week, is the company's first new hardware in two years, and it's just a budget variant of the existing Ecobee3, ditching room sensor support while knocking down the price by $80. So far, the singular focus has served Toronto-based Ecobee well. Thermostats are the most popular type of self-installed smart home devices, according to The NPD Group, and Ecobee—whose revenues have been doubling every year—is not far behind Nest in sales. Ecobee hopes to reach first place in 2017. the Ecobee Family of devices and apps But Ecobee President and CEO Stuart Lombard says the company is also widening its ambitions. Instead of pegging itself as a thermostat maker, Ecobee wants to become a leader in the larger—but still nascent—connected home business. It's a tall order for a company with no platform of its own, working in what might be an overhyped corner of the tech industry. But Lombard is optimistic, setting a goal of $1 billion in revenues by 2020. Stuart Lombard "When you think about companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon—those are phenomenal companies. We would like to be considered in the same breath as those companies," Lombard says. "We understand we've got a ways to go." Cranking Up The Heat Lombard and Mark Malchiondo, Ecobee's vice president of software development, founded the company in 2007, with the idea to help people consume less energy and save money. They gravitated toward heating and cooling, which can gobble up more than half of home energy use, and toward thermostats in particular. "In 2007, if you had a programmable thermostat, they were impossible to use, dumb as a doorknob, not internet-connected," Lombard says. The original Ecobee Smart thermostat launched in early 2009, promising to save energy while letting users control their home temperature by smartphone. But the device was pricey at $385, and aside from its resistive touch panel, it didn't look like a major departure from the dull white rectangles adorning most walls. Ecobee's 2009 thermostat Like the rest of the thermostat industry, Ecobee was caught snoozing by Nest, which arrived in 2011 with a much slicker smart thermostat for just $250. Nest was quickly acquired by Google and became the smart thermostat leader, while Ecobee spent a few years revamping its hardware. (Honeywell, the old guard of the thermostat business, also entered the smart home fray a few years ago with its Lyric devices.) The Ecobee3, which launched in 2014 for $250, was a major improvement, with a jet black finish, capacitive touch screen, and room sensors that can adjust a home's heat or air conditioning based on occupancy and temperature. Those room sensors—one of which is included in the box—are the Ecobee3's biggest selling point compared to Nest and Honeywell Lyric. But instead of just competing on features, Ecobee is now trying to undercut its rivals with the Ecobee3 Lite. "We believe that we're going to deliver feature parity with Nest at a $169 price point—$80 less than Nest," Lombard says. What's to stop Nest and Honeywell from lowering their prices? Nothing, really. But Rahul Raj, Ecobee's vice president of marketing, counters that neither rival has bothered to introduce room sensors, even though focus groups have shown hot and cold zones to be a well-known issue for homeowners. The same goes for demand for an entry-level product. Surely, Raj says, Nest and Honeywell have heard the same customer requests that Ecobee has, yet they haven't responded. "Everyone always has the option," Raj says, "but not everyone acts." Meanwhile, Lombard suggests that Ecobee will try to widen the feature gap with its flagship product in the future. "We're going to take that dividend that we got from cost savings and we're going to invest that in all kinds of great new technology that we're going to put back into the product, and have feature superiority to Nest and Honeywell at that $249 price point," he says. Crossroads For Smart Thermostats The smart thermostat horse race is pretty close at the moment. Last year, Ecobee told Forbes that it had captured 24% of the U.S. market, citing data from the NPD Group. And while Lombard won't provide an update on market share now, he claims that Ecobee is "closing the gap" with Nest. (NPD also declined to publicize its current market share numbers.) But even if Ecobee can edge out its rivals, that alone probably won't turn it into a billion-dollar business. For all the hype around smart thermostats and smart homes in general, there's not a lot of evidence that average consumers care. In surveys of U.S. consumers by NPD, only 10% of respondents said they own one or more smart home products—a percentage that hasn't changed since last year, NPD analyst John Buffone says. Another survey this year from Gartner found that just 9% of respondents in the U.S., U.K., and Australia had adopted a home automation or energy management solution. Only 14% more plan to get on board in the next 12 months, leaving 78% uninterested in the entire smart home proposition. "One of the single biggest challenges that the broader smart home market is facing is breaking through the early adopter audience that's interested and owns the products today," Buffone says. Research firm Gartner has also cooled its enthusiasm for smart thermostats in particular. Every year, the research firm releases a hype cycle chart for various emerging technologies, and this year's chart shows thermostats headed from peak hype levels into a "trough of disillusionment." Gartner analyst Jessica Ekholm says that's because thermostats are no longer the anchor product in a smart home. Instead, they're becoming one piece among many in larger ecosystems such as Google Home, Amazon's Echo, and Apple HomeKit. "So it is not that they are disappearing, but for sure they are now one part of a bigger ecosystem rather than the connected home product that users need," Ekholm says. Not Another Nest Uncertainty in the market may explain why Nest, Ecobee's biggest rival, has tried to branch out into so many other areas. Since upending the thermostat market in 2011, Nest has launched a smart smoke detector, acquired security camera maker Dropcam, looked to hire people for a home audio initiative, and reportedly was developing security sensors and a hub device for talking to other smart home products. The Nest thermostat The company also introduced a set of smart home device integrations called Works with Nest, along with a broader home communications platform called Nest Weave. In the process, Nest seems to have lost its way. The Information reported in March that management turmoil was the reason many of Nest's initiatives never made it to market, and in June, CEO Tony Fadell stepped down. In what seems like a sign of little confidence from corporate parent Alphabet, Google is about to release its own smart home product, the Google Home connected speaker, without Nest's direct involvement. Google reportedly took engineers away from Nest to work on the project, and is now building another smart home platform, separate from Nest's efforts. Nest counters that Google's focus on search, voice, and entertainment made it a better fit for Home, but that Nest integration will be an important part of the product. Furthermore, Nest says moving engineers over to Google will help unify their respective platform efforts. These struggles recently prompted Navigant Research to name Ecobee as the current leader of the smart thermostat market, scored on factors such as strategy and execution. While Ecobee cheerily points out the plaudits in its press releases, analyst Paige Leuschner says the current rankings are more of an indictment of Nest than a ringing endorsement of Ecobee. "I guess what really pushed Ecobee above Nest in these circumstances was Nest's downfall," Leuschner says. Playing It Cool The challenge for Ecobee, then, will be to expand beyond thermostats in a more focused way than Nest did. "I don't think having one product for 20 years makes a lot of sense for where this is going, but if you look at the things Nest is trying to do, you can't do too much because you will fail at all of them," says Deborah Merril, president and co-CEO of Just Energy. The energy reseller has worked with Ecobee for years on distribution and customer rebates, and Merril is also an Ecobee board member. "The real nugget, the real strategy," she says, "has to be around sticking to your knitting, but also understanding that the blanket keeps getting bigger and bigger to cover more things." Lombard seems to be aware of the potential pitfalls. "If our strategy was to try and copy Nest, or try and copy Honeywell, that would be a losing strategy for us," he says. "So we're really trying to do things that are different from what they're doing." For one thing, Ecobee says it won't build its own broad connected home platform like Nest has attempted. Instead, Ecobee wants to be a major partner in what it sees as the most important ecosystems right now: Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and IFTTT. "One of the things that's really cool is, because we have a leadership position in the energy space in the connected home, we've helped those platforms define what their thermostat integrations are, and how those platforms work with thermostats," Lombard says. As an example, one partner—Lombard won't say who—didn't realize that you can't set a single temperature when a thermostat is in auto mode. Thermostats need an upper bound to trigger the air conditioning and a lower bound to trigger the heat, otherwise they'd constantly be switching back and forth. "Thermostats seem trivial," Lombard says. "There are definitely nuances to them, and doing it properly, and making sure things are reliable and don't break down, is not as trivial as it might seem." Any new Ecobee products will have a "planet-positive" angle to them. The downside to not having its own platform is that Ecobee's partners aren't obligated to adopt Ecobee-specific features. For instance, the company is still trying to get its partners to support the concept of room sensors, so that users might ask Siri or Alexa about the temperature in a specific area of the house. Still, Ecobee's approach has literally paid off in one regard: In August, Amazon participated in a $35 million funding round for Ecobee, alongside Thomvest and Relay Ventures. The investment was Amazon's largest yet from its Alexa fund, which pumps money and development resources into companies that are building on Amazon's voice platform. Douglas Booms, Amazon's vice president of corporate development, says the company has long been impressed with Lombard and with Ecobee, whose engineers helped define how Alexa should interact with smart home devices. The investment was a chance to move the Alexa Fund beyond seed funding and into early stage companies. "Ecobee was a good growth stage opportunity for us," Booms says. "It had potential to create a new and unique Alexa skill around thermostat controls and home energy, and the company is addressing a clear customer problem, energy costs." Ecobee's smartphone app Ecobee The Energy Company Part of Ecobee's latest cash infusion will go towards an advertising push for the current products. Lombard points to the company's own research showing that Ecobee outsells its competition four to one when people are aware of product's benefits, so it's likely that more Ecobee ads will start showing up on TV and in print media to get the word out. But longer-term, Ecobee's smart home strategy is still murky. The company isn't trying to build a broad platform like Nest, nor is it using its investments to expand into completely different product categories. When pressed on the alternatives, Lombard becomes cryptic, repeatedly offering platitudes about "making customers lives simpler and better." Still, he does acknowledge that Ecobee isn't limiting itself to smart thermostats. One fair assumption, he says: Any new Ecobee products will have some energy savings or "planet-positive" angle to them. "We will continue to be focused on smart home, and our goal is to be a leader in the connected home space, with a focus on that constellation that is energy," Lombard says. One clue to Ecobee's future might be found in a new Donate Your Data program, which will allow thermostat users to anonymously contribute usage data to universities and government agencies. Lombard notes that research on home energy use tends to be relegated to a small handful of homes. The program could potentially expand the dataset to hundreds of thousands of homes, with the ability to drill down into specific demographics, occupancies, dwelling sizes, and weather patterns. "Really what we're trying to do is change the way energy-efficiency research is done," Lombard says. While the data program might be a boon for researchers and public policymakers, Lombard acknowledges that it's not 100% altruistic. "This is not for individual or commercial gain," he says. "That said, by being at the table with researchers, we see an opportunity to learn from some of the smartest people thinking about how homeowners use energy—which is core to our brand promise." Ultimately, that ties into Lombard's promise that Ecobee will innovate on both the product side and the data side. Between cheaper hardware, new features, and whatever entirely new products Ecobee is working on, Lombard thinks we're about to see a major transformation in the smart home business. "Connected home is going through a watershed right now that is not dissimilar to what smartphones went through from 2006 to 2009," Lombard says, alluding to the transformation brought about by the iPhone and Android. "I think over the next 24 months, you're going to see some phenomenal innovation that's just going to change the way that people think about connected home and computing in general." 10/25: This story has been updated to include a response from Nest about its relationship with Google. related video: Why Smart Home Companies Should Think Like The Clapper Never miss a story.

Picture: Spencer Platt New York - It's not exactly a store, but the Google “showroom” that opened on Thursday in New York is the internet giant's first real-world shop and a step onto terrain where rival Apple has excelled. The success of the temporary storefront Google opened in the trendy Soho neighbourhood could help the California-based company decide whether to follow Apple's lead and operate its own brick-and-mortar retail operation. The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping on Thursday in a direct challenge to Apple's latest iPhones. “This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch,” Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. “We want people to come in and experience the products.” Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google's freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular wi-fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company's online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. ‘Big battle’ A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company's trademark colours. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores. Apple has a shop in Soho, too, and many more across the country and around the world. As differences on the hardware side of premium smartphones have faded, competitors have increasingly stressed “experiences” such as smoothly accessing content or services. “I am interested in technology, so I just hang out in stores,” Columbia University student Ravi Lakshmanan told AFP in the Google shop. “There is going to be a big battle of platforms and it's going to be interesting to watch.” Another visitor, Ike McLaughlin, said he has flip-flopped between the rivals but is on Google's side for now because he felt Apple was “playing it safe, when Google is taking risks and making a push in artificial intelligence”. McLaughlin's verdict echoes the concerns of analysts that Apple has not delivered a market-shaking new product since the death of visionary co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. But even if its market capitalisation has fallen below peaks hit in 2015, Apple remains the world's most valuable company based on its share price. For the financial year ending September 2015, Apple posted a net profit of $53 billion, double the figure posted in the last year of the reign of Steve Jobs.

The Pixel XL isn’t just important - it’s one of the most meaningful things Google has ever done when it comes to smartphones. And yes, I know I’m talking about the company behind the world’s most popular mobile OS. This top-spec handset isn’t just meant to put every other Android phone to shame - it’s supposed to convince iPhone owners to make the switch too. I’m sad to say goodbye to the great value Nexus range, but I can see Google’s thinking behind the name change. Nexus phones were for geeks, right? All the cool kids bought Samsung Galaxies. Before they started exploding. The Pixel XL is going to change that. This is the first Google phone, built to keep Android die-hards happy and beat Apple at its own game. Google Pixel XL design: Glass half full For a flagship phone, the Pixel XL doesn’t exactly have killer looks. There’s no Galaxy-baiting curved screen, or iPhone-esque gold or pink colours here. Sorry, rose gold. Instead, you get an all-metal frame, glass front, and chunky bezels at the top and bottom. Seriously, why does it need massive bezels when Android has on-screen buttons? It’s not ugly by any means, just a little... meh, in both the black/gunmetal grey and silver/white colour choices. Because of course the UK doesn’t get the eye-catching Blue version. Those rounded edges feel comfortable enough in your palm, and 168g hardly makes it a heavyweight, but it’s a little thick at 8.5mm. There’s a bit more personality going on around back, with a split design that’s two thirds matte metal and one third shiny glass. You won’t find any HTC branding here, even though the Taiwanese company actually builds the Pixel XL - just a subtle Google logo. It’s also where you’ll find the fingerprint scanner, conveniently placed exactly where you index finger naturally rests. Sure, you can’t unlock the phone when it’s lying flat on a desk, but honestly, do you do that a lot? Thought not. This divided opinions in the Stuff office, but personally speaking, I think Google made the right call moving it to the back instead of the front. Google Pixel XL features: HEAD IN THE CLOUD That fingerprint sensor does double duty as a quick way to bring down the notification drawer, without having to reach up to the top of the screen. It’s a godsend here, as the large 5.5in screen and thick bezels stretch your thumbs to their limits. Throw in Nougat’s new Split Screen mode and it finally feels like a bigger screen phone running stock Android makes sense. I didn’t have two apps open side-by-side very often, but it was handy to have the option just a tap or two away. Google’s added plenty of other neat little touches, like the USB C port on the bottom for hassle-free charging (no more having to flip-reverse your cable every time you go to plug it in) and a headphone jack on top - that rarest of extras in a 2016 smartphone. There are a few omissions that might raise an eyebrow, like the lack of waterproofing. Now I’ve never once dropped my phone into a pint glass or a pub toilet, but it’s still one box that Samsung, Sony and even Apple have ticked with their top-end phones. The one thing I really miss, though? a microSD card slot. With the 128GB model commanding a US$100 premium over the basic 32GB version, you’re either going to have to splash out upfront or be careful with your installed apps and downloaded music - even with Google automatically flushing your photos into the cloud when you run low on space. Google Pixel XL camera: PICTURE PERFECT That’s right - every Pixel and Pixel XL get completely unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos. You can snap away all day and never run out of room for full resolution stills or 4K videos. Good job, too. Google reckons the Pixel XL has the best camera ever fitted to a phone. The 12.3MP sensor has large 1.55μm pixels and is paired with an f/2.0 aperture lens - the same combination that served the Nexus 6P so well last year. The underlying hardware is different for 2016, though, and there’s plenty of software magic on-board to help your photos look their best. Oh, and it doesn’t bulge out the back of the phone. Take that, Apple. Video gets a big boost too, with electronic image stabilisation doing a great job of smoothing out handheld videos. It’s not quite as good as having a stabilised gimbal, but it’s the best I’ve seen from a phone. Walk slowly and softly, and the results look seriously cinematic. It's just a shame there's so much rolling shutter whenever you point the lens at artificial lights. It's not so noticeable in stills or even recorded video, but the live viewfinder picks it up instantly. It's irritating, and hopefully something Google can fix with a software update. View post on imgur.com The results speak for themselves: with the HDR+ mode set to auto, the Pixel XL takes some impressively detailed photos. Outdoors, exposure was consistently excellent and colours had real punch, without straying too far from reality. Bright skies stayed brilliant blue, but without losing any foreground colour or contrast. Inside, it does a great job with faces, preserving features while exposing the background correctly. You can even get some great depth of field effects when shooting close-ups, without jumping into Google’s Lens Blur software setting. It might not have optical image stabilisation, but the combination of phase detect & laser autofocus meant barely any of my shots were out of focus. The lack of shutter lag really helps here too. Hold down the shutter button and it’ll snap a continuous burst of photos at 10fps, automatically turning the result into an animation and picking out the sharpest snaps for you to browse through. It’s brilliant for catching The front-facing camera is good for 8MP selfies, although the f/2.4 lens lets in less light and the 1.4µm pixels are smaller to boot. It’ll get the job done in daylight, but you’re better off with the rear camera when the lights go down. It’s on the back where you’ll find the dual-tone flash. It adds some much-needed illumination to dark scenes, but two tiny LEDs are only good enough for portraits and close-ups. Is it the best smartphone camera around, as DXOMark claims? Tough one. It’ll still blow out an extremely bright sky when trying to expose your subject if it’s in the shade, but with the right light, it really does look every bit as good as the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 Plus - if not better, when HDR+ exposes a scene just right. Google Pixel XL software: CAN I ASSIST YOU? Google spent more time talking up the Pixel’s software than hardware specs at its launch event - and with good reason. It’s the first phone to arrive with a pure, untouched, vanilla version of Android 7.1 Nougat. Or rather, mostly untouched. The XL is also rocking Google’s Pixel launcher, which comes with the Google Assistant built in. Sound familiar? Yep, it’s another AI helper like Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa - one that can listen out for questions and use the web to find you the answers. Either tap and hold the home button, or say “OK Google” and it’ll spring into action. It’s great at handling the basics: setting alarms and reminders, checking the weather forecast, converting units of measurement, and looking up simple facts. There's a bit of Google-specific cleverness, too, finding holiday snaps from Google Photos based on date or location, crawling through your emails for flight details, and plotting driving routes on Google Maps. Try to be too clever, though, and you’ll usually be given a web link instead of a spoken answer. You can’t identify songs yet, and until apps start supporting Assistant, you’re tied to Google’s own apps - so no Citymapper route guidance, no jumping straight into a particular show on Netflix, and no looking up Facebook profiles with your voice. Is Assistant a killer feature you’d actually buy a Pixel just to have? Right now, no. But Google’s got big plans for the future, with app integrations and advanced AI promising a lot more to come. Siri is a big part of iOS now, but it took a few years to get there - expect Assistant to be something similar. Google Pixel XL Android: Pure and simple The other benefits of getting a home-grown Googlephone are of course instant updates and patches, which will land on the Pixel XL before any other handset. If you’re a hardcore Android fan, this’ll be a major selling point. You’ll probably love the new look launcher, too. A swipe up shows the app drawer now, and a long press on any Google app brings up several contextual shortcuts for jumping right into where you want to be - just like the iPhone’s Force Touch, only without the extra hardware. This would be great if every app used it, but a lot of third party ones don’t. Long press on an incompatible app and you’ll pick it up instead, ready to move it around the home screen. Annoying. There were a few bugs and glitches in my pre-release review unit, like Bluetooth headphones dropping their connection with alarming regularity. I can’t say I had as many issues on the XL as we saw on the vanilla Pixel, though - so hopefully these are things that’ll get fixed quickly with software updates. Google Pixel XL Screen: OLED THE WAY An extra half-inch of screen space and a few extra pixels are all that separates the Pixel XL from its smaller brother. Well ok, more than a few pixels. The 5in phone makes do with a 1080p display, but the 5.5in Pixel XL has a 2560x1440 resolution panel. This might make it more of a handling nightmare for small-handed gadgeteers, but it really does help squeeze more onscreen at once - especially once you’ve tweaked the font size in the Settings menu. It looks super sharp in the flesh, with punchy colours and excellent viewing angles. The AMOLED panel pumps out the kind of deep blacks and rich contrast I’m used to seeing on Samsung’s phones, without the over-saturation that usually comes with it. Sure, whites aren’t quite as brilliantly bright as on an LCD screen, but it’s easily up there with the best 2016 has had to offer. Google Pixel XL performance: POWER UP It’s a similar story when it comes to internals. After all, what self-respecting 2016 flagship phone doesn’t have a Snapdragon processor and 4GB of RAM? The Pixel XL is rocking a Snapdragon 821, Qualcomm’s latest and greatest quad-core chip. That’s more than enough to make Android Nougat feel as zippy and responsive as any other phone I’ve used this year, if not more so. If you’re just flipping between WhatsApp, Instagram and YouTube, it’s practically overkill. If you’re bothered about benchmarks, the XL scores 4138 in Geekbench 4’s multicore test - edging ahead of the OnePlus 3 and last year’s Snapdragon 820, but lagging behind the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple’s phone scored an impressive 5452, thanks in part to the A10 Fusion chip working hand-in-hand with iOS, rather than relying on an off-the-shelf chip. All that power comes in handy when you’re blitzing through Asphalt 8’s hectic race circuits, though. Frame rates are silky smooth, even on the XL’s 2K resolution screen. There’s nothing on the Google Play store right now that this can’t handle. It'll also come into its own in November when Google's Daydream View VR headset arrives. The phone does start to heat up if you attempt a marathon play session, but you’ll rarely work it that hard over the course of an average day. Google Pixel XL battery life: FULL CHARGE It might have room inside for a bigger battery, but the Pixel XL needs it to keep that higher resolution screen running. That means it doesn’t exactly have much stamina. Stick to the basics, like FaceBook, Twitter and WhatsApp, and you’ll easily get an entire day of use out of a single charge, but battery-sapping games and video streaming will drain you down to the danger zone in about twelve hours. Basically, if you’re going to be hitting Clash Royale hard, make sure you’ve got a plug socket handy. There’s no wireless charging either, but as long as you’ve got the bundled fast charging adapter to hand, you’ll be able to zap in an extra seven hours of battery in just 15 minutes. It’s handy when you’re in a pinch, but only when you’ve got the right plug with you. Google Pixel XL verdict The Pixel XL is a bit of a puzzle. A US$769 puzzle that I’m not sure I’ve managed to solve after a week of using one. Right now, though, the OnePlus 3 is still the best value Android phone - it's half the price of the XL, but matches it for build quality and a near-stock version of Android. If specs, design and features like waterproofing are more important, the Galaxy S7 Edge still has the... well, edge. There’s no drop-dead gorgeous design here. No mind-blowing battery life. No water resistance. It makes it tough to justify such a high price - and going purely on hardware specs, I’m not sure I can. But then that never stopped Apple, did it? The Pixel XL wants to be more than the sum of its parts. It’s not perfect, but it is still a genuine alternative to the iPhone - if you're after simplicity above all else. A brilliant camera, powerful internals and an undiluted Android OS that bleeds Google right down to the core help too, but it's the purity of the Google experience that you're really paying for here. While other manufacturers were duking it out in the mid-range, the Pixel XL showed us how potent a combination Google’s own hardware and software could be. With a few more software updates and tweaks, it’ll be a force to be reckoned with.   Tech Specs  SCREEN 5.5in, 2560x1440 AMOLED CPU Quad-core Snapdragon 821 MEMORY 4GB CAMERA 12.3MP rear w/ phase detect & laser autofocus, dual-LED flash, 8MP front STORAGE 32GB on-board OPERATING SYSTEM Android 7.1 Nougat BATTERY 3450mAh DIMENSIONS 155x76x8.5mm, 168g Stuff says...  Google Pixel XL reviewUnderstated looks and a focus on software over top-spec hardware hide what an important phone this is - even if hardware geeks won't be blown away from US$769 Good Stuff  Fast camera that takes quality snaps As slick and streamlined as Android gets Bad Stuff  Only average battery life Marmite school of design No standout features Liked that?

Google often change their logo in celebration of a holiday, anniversary or birthday of a famous figure Revealed By ALANA MOORHEAD 24th October 2016, 11:09 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments AS many of you will have noticed, Google often change their logo in celebration of a holiday, anniversary or in memory of a famous figure – but why? Google Doodles has become a popular feature over the years but when did it start and what is the history behind it – here’s everything you need to know. Google marks the beginning of the Rio Paralympics with special Doodle What is the history of Google Doodles? In 1998, the search engine founders Larry and Sergey drew a stick figure behind the second 'o' of Google as a message to that they were out of office at the Burning Man festival and with that, Google Doodles were born. Google 11 After the success of the Burning Man, Google celebrated Halloween in 1998 with two pumpkins The company decided that they should decorate the logo to mark cultural moments and it soon became clear that users really enjoyed the change to the Google homepage. In that same year, a turkey was added to Thanksgiving and two pumpkins appeared as the 'o's for Halloween the following year. Google 11 The following year they added a turkey to the logo on Thanksgiving After spending the next two years playing around with the homepage designs, Larry and Sergey appointed Dennis Hwang and he became chief doodler for the company. Now, there is a full team of doodlers, illustrators, graphic designers, animators and classically trained artists who help create what you see on those days. What is today's Google Doodle? Google 11 Google has marked the inventor's 384th birthday with a trademark special doodle Today's Google Doodle marks the 384th birthday of Antoni van Leeuwenhoek. He first recorded and observed muscle fibres, bacteria, sperm, and small blood vessels. The search engine marked his 384th birthday on October 24th with a special trademark doodle. Born in the Netherlands in 1632, Leeuwenhoek was an unlikely inventor as the son of a basket maker, he became a cloth merchant apprentice and began his own drapery business. But his passion was for microscopes. Despite having no formal education or fortune, he began experimenting. Alamy 11 He wrote nearly 600 letters to scientific institutions detailing his observations in later life   How many Google Doodles have there been over the years? 11 Since the first Google Doodle in 1998 there have been over 2,000 doodles including one to celebrate their 18th birthday Since the first Google Doodle in 1998 there have been over 2,000 doodles on the Google homepage around the world, including an animated one to celebrate the company's 18th birthday. And the idea for a doodle comes from both Google employees and users, so if you have an idea for the homepage you can submit it to proposals@google.com. Here are some of the most memorable Google Doodles over the years: The Burning Man: August 30, 1998 Google 11 The Burning Man was the first Google Doodle in 1998 This was the first ever Google Doodle, designed by founders Larry and Sergey to let users know they were out of office. Dennis Hwang told Time: "It shows the Burning Man symbol, the annual alternative festival, which they like to go to whenever they can. "They wanted to let the early Google search engine users know that the site would be running unattended while they were there." DNA: April 25, 2003 Google 11 To celebrate the 50th Anniversary of DNA in 2003, Google replaced the two 'o's with a double helix It was the 50th anniversary of the discovery of DNA in 2003 and to celebrate Google replaced the two 'o's with a double helix. "Because we like to associate our brand with discovery and technology, it was a natural fit to do this for the 50th anniversary of Dr. James Watson discovering the structure of DNA," says Dennis. Valentine's Day: February 14, 2007 Google 11 Valentine's Day 2007 was celebrated with a chocolate covered strawberry Each year, to celebrate St. Valentine's, Google add a romantically themed doodle to the logo but in 2007 their drawing was slightly confusing. "It was a design decision," says Dennis "to have the strawberry represent the G and the stem represent the L. But I guess the stem was too short and people didn't make the connection." LEGO anniversary January 28, 2008 google 11 To commemorate 50 years of Lego, Google used this doodle in 2008 When Google was starting out Larry and Sergey used to build their hard drive enclosures out of LEGO so it was only right for them to celebrate the company's 50th anniversary with a doodle. "We actually poured a bunch of LEGOs on the floor and built the logo out of LEGO in real life to figure out how to illustrate it correctly," recalls Dennis. Isaac Newton's Birthday January 4, 2010 Google 11 To celebrate Sir Isaac Newton's birthday in 2010, Google animated the logo with apples Famous figure's birthdays are often celebrated with Google Doodles and in 2010, but Sir Isaac Newton's doodle was extra special as it was the first animated one the company had done. "It's based on the famous story on how Newton came up with the theory of gravity—that was inspired by an apple falling," says Dennis. In the years after that first animation, Google has come a long way with their doodles and now some even allow you to interact, including the recent Paralympics one. Paralympians: September 7, 2016: Google 11 Google commemorate special events with one-off Doodles The colourful moving animation shows athletes taking part in various sports including weightlifting and swimming to mark the start of the Rio Paralympics.

US copyright chief was assigned to shop till, tweeting The US Copyright Office has been given a brutal Silicon Valley-style sacking, the first time the Copyright Register has been dismissed in 119 years. Maria A Pallante was locked out of her computer on Friday, according to Billboard, on the instructions of her boss, a new Obama appointee, Carla Hayden, the Librarian of Congress. “Officially, Pallante has been appointed as a senior adviser for digital strategy for the Library of Congress, although it’s clear she was asked to step down,” Billboard’s Robert Levine notes. Critics see the move as in line with Silicon Valley asserting its influence over the US Government via its agencies in the dog days of the Obama Administration. Just last month, as Hayden started the post, the Google-funded group Public Knowledge attacked the Copyright Office for upholding the copyright laws. “Pallante was the only one standing between Google and what is left of the copyright system,” wrote David Lowery on the Trichordist blog, which campaigns for better deals for songwriters and musicians. Controversial decisions by the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission have all resulted in proposals or decisions that advanced the business interests of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies. For example, after an investigation of Google for anti-competitive practices, FTC staff concluded there was sufficient evidence to indict - but the Obama-appointed trade commissioners abandoned this for a voluntary deal instead. The FCC, run by former industry lobbyist and major Obama fundraiser Tom Wheeler, has introduced a flood of measures that benefit huge web companies and constrain telcos, the most significant of which is Title II reclassification, which gives the bureaucrats wide-ranging authority over internet practices and private contracts. The DoJ was found to have kept Obama’s office closely involved on antitrust investigations - which has never happened before. What’s the Register of Copyright and why has it annoyed Google Congress created the post of The Register of Copyright at the end of the 19th Century, when copyright protection required an author to register a work (Registration of a work is now not needed if a country is a signatory to the Berne Convention, but in the USA, it entitles the owner to statutory damages.) The role of the Copyright Register has evolved to provide Congress with expert impartial advice. The legal duty of the Register is to uphold a functioning rights marketplace, something Silicon Valley isn’t keen to see, as the windfall profits of today’s giant web companies come from aggregation rather than trade. Although the Library of Congress (as the name implies) reports to Congress, its boss is a Presidential appointee. Barack Obama appointed a librarian from his base of Chicago who rose to be head of the librarians’ association the ALA. Her appointment welcomed by anti-copyright crusaders. But two pieces of advice from the Copyright Register in particular will have infuriated Google, which in each case sought radical changes in the operation of the copyright system. On the advice of DoJ antitrust attorney, the DoJ recommended that part-authors of a song should lose the ability to say no to digital deals they don’t like. The move came from Google’s former key antitrust lawyer Renata Hesse, who had moved from Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati to become acting Attorney General for antitrust issues. Songwriters come out worst out of any negotiation with The Man, and the move, called “100 per cent licensing”, weakened their position further. Pallante warned back in January that 100 per cent licensing raised a host of issues: “The Office believes that an interpretation of the consent decrees that would require these PROs to engage in 100 per cent licensing presents a host of legal and policy concerns. Such an approach would seemingly vitiate important principles of copyright law, interfere with creative collaborations among songwriters, negate private contracts, and impermissibly expand the reach of the consent decrees. It could also severely undermine the efficacy of ASCAP and BMI, which today are able to grant blanket licenses covering the vast majority of performances of musical works—a practice that is considered highly efficient by copyright owners and users alike,” she wrote [PDF]. The dubious legality of Hesse’s proposal was demonstrated when a Court threw out the proposal after a legal challenge from three songwriters was upheld. A Court agreed that Obama’s DoJ had violated due process by stripping them of their rights. The move would have obliged the performing rights societies (who are regulated by the DoJ under a Consent Decree) to check whether they actually had the rights to a composition for millions of songs. Google, which has invested in a rival service to the PROs called Kobalt, would be under no such obligation. Another piece of expert advice from Pallante will also have infuriated Google, which along with being the owner of the most popular internet video service YouTube, is used to getting its own way. Unlike Netflix, which has invested heavily in buying and making TV and movie content (it spent more than HBO or the BBC last year) Google is notorious tight-fisted when it comes to licensing quality video. Faced with an instruction by Congress to replace the antiquated CableCARD standard, FCC Chairman Wheeler rejected the app-based alternative industry came up with, in favour of a proposal backed by a Google-funded NGO, Public Knowledge. The difference? As we explained here, Google’s preferred plan allowed third parties access to the stream, TV guide metadata and subscriber info, paving the way for Chocolate Factory to disaggregate channels and help itself to content without a contract. Pallante called their bluff, warning that it was illegal: “Rather than being passive conduits for licensed programming, it seems that a broad array of the third-party devices and services that would be enabled by the Proposed Rule would essentially be given access to a valuable bundle of copyrighted works, and could repackage and retransmit those works for a profit, without having to comply with agreed contractual terms,” the Copyright Register noted. Who votes for Google? She reminded Google - and this is significant - that under the US Constitution, it is Congress that makes the laws. “It is important to remember that only Congress, through the exercise of its power under Copyright Clause, and not the FCC or any other agency, has the constitutional authority to create exceptions and limitations in copyright law." [Our emphasis] Congress has only intervened rarely and carefully in the case of clear market failure, Pallante noted, and nobody is arguing that the “Golden Age of TV” is a market failure, with premium shows available on a huge range of devices at a low cost, thanks to cable cutting. Pallante said that Wheeler’s proposal “maybe be understood to create a new statutory license” - the most significant intervention government can make. Faced with making such a seismic shift in the economics of TV production, the swing vote of the FCC’s five Commissioners backed away, and the proposal is dead for now. Very few Americans would vote for even weaker rights over the pictures and words they hand over to the giant internet companies like Facebook and Google, so there is little chance of Silicon Valley-friendly copyright “reform” winning a popular democratic mandate. In this climate, the odd backroom assassination could remedy this... hypothetically speaking, of course. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 34 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

LeEco heralded its entrance into the U.S. market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a 7-foot screen priced at $5,000. LeEco positions the LePro 3 as an alternative to Apple's latest iPhone and Google's Pixel phone, whose prices both start at $650. LeEco is promising its giant TV, called the UMax 85, will be as good or better than other high-end home entertainment systems that cost $8,000. Both the phone and TV will go on sale Nov. 2 in LeEco's online store, LeWeb.com. The company also is selling a smaller smartphone and smaller TVs with screens ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches. Besides the phones and TVs, LeEco also is coming to the U.S. with a virtual-reality headset, a high-tech bicycle and an electric car in a challenge to Tesla Motors. The company wants to bundle the devices with other services, including an online video package of shows and movies that ties into its origins as the "Netflix of China." LeEco, which stands for "Happy Ecosystem," is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing U.S. consumers for years. "America is the most important global market for us," LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation. "Once we get the hearts and minds of U.S. users, we can move on to the hearts and minds of global users." Innovation in the U.S. has hit a "bottleneck," making it an optimal time for LeEco to enter the market, Jia said in an interview with The Associated Press that was also translated. He envisions creating a platform that enables consumers to hopscotch from LeEco TVs to phones to cars to watch its video service and use other applications that that company plans to introduce. The company is using the devices as "Trojan horses," to deliver its digital services, said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz. "This is a general trend in the industry, and LeEco is a prime example of how companies are subsidizing hardware with ulterior motives." Google is similarly selling its new Pixel phone in an effort to drive more traffic to its search engine and other service, Goertz noted, though that device is being sold at a premium price. Amazon.com's Echo, an internet-connected speaker that understands and responds to spoken language, also is designed to get boost sales at the company's e-commerce site. The expectations for LeEco are modest. The research firm Strategy Analytics projects that LeEco will sell about 25 million smartphones worldwide this year. By comparison, Apple had sold 214 million iPhones in the past year ending in June. Other Chinese companies that tried to make a splash in the U.S. consumer electronics market have barely made a ripple. But LeEco is making a major commitment. During the summer, the company paid $2 billion for budget-TV maker Vizio, a well-known brand in the U.S. that sells in Costco and other prominent chains. It employs several hundred workers at its U.S. headquarters in San Jose, California, with ambitions to expand in Silicon Valley. Earlier this year, it spent another $250 million to snap up a 50-acre site in Santa Clara, California, where it has approval to build an office complex that could span up to 3 million square feet and accommodate about 12,000 workers. Jia plans to call the complex "EcoWorld." "They are not taking a half-baked approach," Goertz said. "But I think they are going to be hemorrhaging money for the foreseeable future. The question is how long they can sustain this strategy?" Jia, who has accumulated an estimated fortune of nearly $5 billion, will shoulder a huge chunk of any losses because he owns half of LeEco. He declined to say how much LeEco has spent in the U.S. so far. "We are financially prepared to bring a new model and a new value for the U.S. consumers," Jia said.

LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP/Getty Images What’s the problem? As algorithms become entrenched into society, the debate about their effects rages on. In essence, algorithms are sequences of instructions used to solve problems and perform functions in computer programming. As mathematical expressions, algorithms existed long before modern computers. While they vary in application, all algorithms have three things in common: clearly-defined beginning and ending points, discrete sets of “steps,” and design meant to address a specific type of problem. And problems we have. Sorting algorithm Pmdumuid On the one hand, algorithms play the role of prime suspect — responsible for the recent UK pound’s Brexit-induced flash crash, used for political and informational manipulation on social networks, and part of what Harvard Professor Shoshanna Zuboff calls “surveillance capitalism”. Algorithms are everywhereOn the other hand, algorithms make modern life easier: they help us find information, detect disease, connect us to friends and family, show us products we’re likely to be interested in, recommend personalized experiences, and direct us around traffic delays, saving us valuable time and money. Algorithms are everywhere Much has been written on what algorithms do and how they affect us. This includes how algorithms secretly control us, what types of information they filter in or out of our social media feeds, and the thousands of calculated outcomes they force on us daily. This piece isn’t about these issues, or about breaking down the complex nature of how algorithms work. The relevance of algorithms at the moment isn’t because they are used in Google’s search, maps, autocomplete, photos, and translation services; Facebook’s news feed and Trends; Twitter’s trending topics; Netflix’s movie recommendations; Amazon’s prices and product reviews; or for predicting hurricanes, creditworthiness, and home and car insurance liabilities. It’s not because most computer software and mobile applications are essentially bundled packages of algorithms. To return to my very first point, algorithms are important because they are the key process in artificial intelligence: decision-making. AI_gorithms Algorithms are… The Conversation Algorithms, in a sense, are the “nervous system” of AI. They are the models that underpin machine learning, prediction, and problem solving. Yet, as many researchers argue, due to their design by humans, algorithms can never be neutral. algorithms are not neutral by definition algorithms are not neutral by definition algorithms are not neutral by defihttps://t.co/dckOayKybG — Casey Johnston (@caseyjohnston) May 17, 2016 As Vint Cerf, co-inventor of the Internet Protocol, Turing Award winner, and Google VP pointed out in a recent speech at Elon University: “We need to remember that [AI systems] are made out of software. And we don’t know how to write perfect software … the consequence is that however much we might benefit from these devices …, they may not work exactly the way they were intended to work or the way we expect them to. And the more we rely on [AI systems], the more surprised we may be when they don’t work the way we expect.” “The way we expect” is key here, because algorithms are a computer-simulated reflection of encoded human expectations. Engineering memories Facebook’s famous “On This Day” prompt involves “engineering for nostalgia.” Likewise, Instagram algorithmically sorts its timeline so you “see the moments you care about first”. The more we, as humans, rely on algorithms, the more our reality becomes encoded with other people’s flawed expectations. As more AI-powered systems come online, this type of calculated bias will permeate every level of our lives — even our memories and past experiences. Take, for instance, Google Photos, which uses AI-powered “deep learning” to organize people’s photos beyond normal metadata (GPS, time, date, lens, etc.). It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to classify material objects, facial expressions, and emotional relevance. The robotic “assistant” even can touch up images, suggest creative filters and create photo albums automatically.Google Photos: ‘The photos app that’s as smart as you’ Twitter Biased learning, troubled future? As algorithms “learn” more about us through our financial data, location history, biometric features, voice patterns, social networks, stored memories, and “smart home” devices, we move towards a reality constructed by imperfect machine learning systems which try to understand us through other people’s expectations and sets of “rules”. What’s on your mind? Facebook News Feed/The Coversation Algorithms are the literal manifestation of “playing by someone else’s rules.” For dating app Tinder’s algorithmic “Smart Photos” matching, the rules of successful engagement on Tinder are made clear, and enforced on users. Does this mean that we live inside a computer simulation? I’ll defer that question to Elon Musk, who has said, “there’s a billion to one chance we’re living in base reality”. Cerf, however, warns that it’s a mistake to “imbue artificial intelligences with a breadth of knowledge that they don’t actually have, and also with social intelligence that they don’t have”. The algorithmic end game, AI, will get better with time, but it will always be flawed. Even in straightforward applications like a game of chess, algorithms can leave people clueless as to how they arrived at a certain outcome. Great expectations IBM’s Deep Blue Jim Gardner/Flickr Cerf talked about a scenario in which IBM’s “Deep Blue” supercomputer, playing world chess champion Gary Kasparov, made a move that Kasparov could not understand. I mean, it made no sense whatsoever. And he was clearly concerned about it, because he thought for quite a long time and had to play the endgame much faster … in the end it turned out it was a bug.  It was just a mistake. The computer didn’t know what it was doing. But Kasparov assumed that it did, and lost the game as a result. The implications of bias today might result in poor neighborhoods experiencing more police brutality because of predictive data modeling; tomorrow, it will mean people die when the algorithms controlling self-driving cars are programmed to save the occupants lives instead of pedestrians. Bad or good? Is the social use of algorithms inherently “bad,” provided they form the basis of “intelligence” in AI?“ David Lazer, a computer scientist at Northeastern University, is skeptical. In a recent Science article he said: The fact that human lives are regulated by code is hardly a new phenomenon. Organizations run on their own algorithms, called standard operating procedures. And anyone who has been told that “it’s a rule” knows that social rules can be as automatic and thoughtless as any algorithm. It does mean that companies, governments, and institutions that employ algorithms, and soon, AI powered deep learning “neural networks” need to be more transparent in showing us how the algorithms they use might affect our reality. A Google project called Magenta is aimed at making more sophisticated kinds of creative software. #EmTechMIT https://t.co/f6rOmL2yhR — MIT Tech Review (@techreview) October 18, 2016 Given how proprietary algorithms are the new business model, this is doubtful, even despite current laws preventing algorithms from being patentable. A recent SSRN piece maintains the need for a “Food and Drug Administration for algorithms.” Some scholars go so far as to argue that algorithms need managers, too. According to Cerf: It’s a little unnerving to think that we’re building machines that we don’t understand … Not only in the technical sense, like what’s it going to do or how is it going to behave, but also in the social sense, how is it going to impact our society? Just like us Bias Error Message Generator So, algorithms, the underlying process of decision making in artificial intelligence systems are imperfect, prone to bias, and make unpredictable decisions that impact the future.

(Photo Credit: Ms. Danielle Davis (Benning)) VIEW ORIGINAL FORT BENNING, Ga., (Oct. 19, 2016) -- Seventh-graders at Faith Middle School spoke with Hanne Moon, published author and owner of Heritage Press Publications, Oct. 11 via Google hangouts as part of their English Language Arts classes. Bringing a published author into the classroom creates that real-world link to learning. She even knows what the students have been working on, said Dr. Todd Carver, the assistant principal. Lorri Bach, one of the seventh-grade teachers, met Moon over the summer during a writer's conference. "She was one of my teachers," said Bach. "Her topic was nonfiction writing, which is an area that tends to give our students trouble." "I wanted to help my students bridge the gap between fiction and nonfiction. In class, they have no trouble using their imaginations to come up with wonderful stories, but they struggle with nonfiction writing," said Bach. "Students were having trouble introducing the subject and concluding the essay in a powerful way," added Robin Jones, a seventh-grade teacher. "She's working with them on that today. As an expert in her field of writing, she can provide a different insight than we as teachers can." During the Google hangout, Moon revealed that she grew up a military kid. "I was also a military kid. I moved all over the world," she said. Moon offered the students insight saying, "Nonfiction is supposed to give information, but it's not supposed to be dull and boring. You can use fiction techniques in your writing to help make a nice nonfiction narrative. We want to show, not tell what you're trying to convey to your reader." Sean Kerr, a seventh-grader, said that he found the Google hangout interesting. Kerr revealed that he enjoys the research process of nonfiction writing. "I like finding out about things," he said. "I like that we got the chance to talk to a published author," added seventh-grader Olivia Andres. "I've been reading textbooks about writing recently and I noticed that there's a difference between what the textbook tells you to do and what writers actually do. It's interesting to talk to an author that's published and owns a company." Seventh-grader Robin Brough said that she appreciated having the opportunity to speak with a published author. "She's already done this stuff and been through the things that we have. She knows how difficult it is to move and start new thing," she said. "For me, writing is kind of hard. I have trouble expressing things," Robin added. Students at Faith Middle School have also participated in Google hangouts with experts from the Smithsonian American Art Museum during their English Language Arts classes. "We started out with just the Smithsonian," said Cindy Givens, the media specialist. "We now connect with many authors as well as classrooms in other states and countries. Children can talk to one another in real time. We can connect our curriculum to a real person. We are constantly using the technology that is given to us by the Department of Defense Education Activity to its fullest extent." "This is a way of expanding what they've learned outside of the classroom," added Carver. "Using Google hangouts, we can reach out and connect to anyone, anywhere in the world. We try to do this whenever the opportunity presents itself."

The deal made CBS the first major TV network to sign on to the new TV service, which will be housed on Google’s YouTube platform and is likely to premiere in early 2017. Google is also said to be near reaching an agreement to distribute channels owned by Fox and is in advanced talks with NBCUniversal and Walt Disney. The new web TV service is reportedly dubbed 'Unplugged' and will offer a low cost 'skinny' bundle of live TV channels with a monthly price of around $25-40. This is the same type of service that Apple has been trying to launch on the Apple TV; however, recent reports have suggested that the company's aggressive negotiations with cable providers and networks for a TV streaming service may have 'backfired'.

I've been using XBMC/Kodi for years, and it has reached the point to where it is stable and reliable enough that I only subscribe to internet service. $40 per month and I get @70Mbps download speeds, and any show or movie I want to watch, on demand (Exodus or 1Channel add-on), with live streaming of the major broadcast networks (USTVNow add-on). If you put a little work into it, you can also stream premium cable channels through the Navi-X or Phoenix add-ons. All that's needed is an HTPC (Raspberry PI2 or 3, an Android based HTPC, an Apple TV2 or 4-not the 3-theres no public jailbreak tool for it-or even an old laptop or desktop), an Internet connection and a little Googling to learn how to set up Kodi and install the add-ons. Raspberry PI's can be bought for less than $40, as can Android-based HTPC's. I personally have some sort of HTPC in all three bedrooms and the living room of my home. For the kids I got Raspberry PI's because you can install retro game emulators (NES, SNES, N64, PS1, Sega, and a few more) in OSMC with an easy to find script for installing RetroPie as an add-on with a launcher under "Programs" in OSMC.

Stephen Shankland/CNET Google to Apple: It's your move now on VR, smart speaker 0 Share: Phones by Stephen Shankland October 6, 2016 7:17 AM PDT @stshank Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Enlarge Image Google Home, the $129 networked speakers that deliver Google Assistant services Photo by James Martin/CNET Google just ratcheted up the pressure on Apple. For starters on Tuesday, it debuted products Apple lacks -- the Daydream virtual-reality headset, the Google Home digital assistant-powered speaker, the Chromecast Ultra streamer that can pipe 4K video to your TV. On top of that is a broader competitive threat. Google designed its new devices on its own, reflecting an evolution into a company that makes hardware, not just one that writes software and offers online services. Sound familiar? That's the winning strategy Apple employed during the last decade's explosively fast development of the phone and tablet market to vault ahead of rivals like Dell, Microsoft and Samsung. Google could one-up Apple when it comes to integration of hardware, software and services. It's no coincidence that Google's new Pixel is the only phone to get the new Google Assistant and to tap into unlimited cloud storage for any photos and videos that don't fit on the phone. The Google Home smart speaker adds another way to use Google Assistant -- and to control Chromecast devices playing YouTube video on your TV and Google Play Music on your stereo. Google's Pixel phones won't push aside Apple iPhones and Samsung Galaxys any time soon. But with new types of gadgets hitting the market, Google's ambition makes it much more likely you'll see devices sporting the company's "G" logo infiltrate your home. "Google...demonstrated that it's finally serious about hardware," said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. 12 Google Daydream is VR for everyone (pictures) All about execution To really put the competitive pressure on Apple, Google has to deliver the goods, not just announce them. It's shown some ability here, having sold 30 million Chromecasts so far by Strategy Analytics' estimate. But other products haven't fared so well, like the short-lived Nexus Q audio streaming device. Its acquisition of the Motorola phone business didn't last much longer. And Google's earlier Nexus phones remained niche products despite six years of sustained effort. Google's products aren't first to market either -- Amazon's Echo speaker and Alexa voice-powered digital assistant are already a hit with consumers. But unless Apple's smart speaker project and virtual reality efforts bear fruit soon, Google will beat Apple to market. Google Home and Daydream View are both due to arrive in November. The Google Pixel XL, a 5.5-inch Android phone, has a top-shelf camera and built-in Google Assistant abilities. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Google doesn't pose any near-term threat to Apple, according to Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin. As with Microsoft's Surface tablet PC line, it will take Google years of sustained effort to develop a reputation for good products and customer trust, he said, and developing the necessary deep relationships with retailers and carriers to push Pixel phones is "super hard." But while people are settled in their phone-buying habits, it's different with Google Home, which taps into a nascent market that's just starting to get attention thanks to the Echo. "Google has an opportunity to break new ground, and Apple is not there," Bajarin said. Apple declined to comment for this story. First isn't always best The immensely profitable iPhone maker has been judicious about entering new markets, and being first in a new category isn't necessarily as important as having a good product. Enlarge Image Google CEO Sundar Pichai stands before queries you can ask Google Assistant. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Apple wasn't the first to sell digital music players, but the iPod eventually dominated. The iPhone wasn't the first smartphone, but it was the one that rewrote the rules of mobile computing. Google attracted plenty of attention with its Google Glass eyewear, but Apple sat on the sidelines as that product faltered. As online services pervade our lives, Apple can't afford to be complacent. The company has significant services such as FaceTime messaging, iCloud storage, Siri search and Maps. But with more than a billion people each using Gmail and YouTube, and with Google still dominating search, there's no question here who has more clout. That's a big advantage as digital assistants spread to phones, speakers, PCs, TVs, cars and other devices. "It's clear to me we are evolving from a mobile-first world to an AI-first world," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said at the event. Siri can answer some questions and get iPhones to call mom, but Google Assistant is wired up to the most powerful computer brains on the planet when it comes to fetching the information you want. "This event may have been pitched as a hardware launch but it in reality it is a statement of intent from Google in artificial intelligence," said CCS Insight analyst Martin Garner. "Hardware is simply the means to deepen Google's reach into the fabric of daily life." First published October 6 at 5:00 a.m. PT. Update at 7:17 a.m. PT: Added Apple's response.

Contact Us Newsletters Sales: 1-800-405-0844 Articles Customer Stories Why eMarketer Plans Product Tour Research Topics Mobile Moves to Majority Share of Google's Worldwide Ad Revenues In the US, the split is 50/50 this year October 24, 2016 | Media Buying Share Email Print Google, which is set to report Q3 earnings this week, now makes more ad dollars from mobile than from the desktop globally, according to eMarketer’s latest estimates of ad revenues at major publishers. But in its home market of the US, that revenue flip is still in the (very near) future. The shift in share of Google’s US ad revenues from desktop to mobile was sharp between 2015 and 2016. Last year, eMarketer estimates, just shy of 60% of the search giant’s net US ad revenues came from desktop placements. This year, it will be almost exactly 50/50, with desktop revenues eking out a 0.6-percentage-point edge. But by 2018, more than 60% of Google’s net US ad revenues will be thanks to mobile spending. Google is already passing this milestone this year on a worldwide basis: About 59.5% of the company’s net global ad revenues will come from mobile internet ads this year, up from about 45.8% in 2015. By 2018, nearly three-quarters of Google’s net ad revenues worldwide will come from mobile internet ad placements. This year, Google will generate $63.11 billion in net digital ad revenues worldwide, an increase of 19.0% over last year. That represents 32.4% of the worldwide digital ad market, which this year is worth $229.25 billion. Google continues to be by far the dominant player in worldwide search advertising. eMarketer estimates the company will capture $52.88 billion in search ad revenues in 2016, or 56.9% of the search ad market worldwide. On the display side, Google is second to Facebook. It will generate $10.23 billion in display ad revenues worldwide this year, or 12.9% of total display spending. YouTube net ad revenues will grow 30.5% this year to reach $5.58 billion worldwide. In the US, YouTube is the leading over-the-top (OTT) video service, with 180.1 million users this year. That represents 95.7% of OTT video service users in the US. Net ad revenues on the site will reach nearly $3 billion this year in the US, according for almost 10% of Google’s net ad revenues in the country. That share will rise slightly by the end of eMarketer’s forecast period. “Google’s accelerating ad revenues have been driven by capitalizing on usage and marketing trends like mobile search, YouTube’s popularity and programmatic buying,” said eMarketer senior forecasting analyst Martín Utreras. “We see data and advertising at the heart of Google’s new product offerings,” said Utreras. “The new devices are not only aimed at diversifying Google’s revenues but also at enriching Google’s advertising targeting capabilities as consumers engage and share information with Pixel, Google Assistant, Daydream View, Chromecast and other Google ecosystem devices. We see this as contributing to both device sales and advertising revenues in the future.” Go beyond the articles eMarketer PRO customers get quick and easy access to the exact data and analysis they need to make critical business decisions: Explore eMarketer PRO Read how companies use eMarketer to make smarter decisions Previous Article Next Article Latest from eMarketer Latest Articles Latest Webinars How Brand Marketers Measure Digital Video Advertising Most B2B IT Consultants Can't Live Without Their CRM Tools Germany's Online Population Approaching 60 Million More Articles » eMarketer Daily Newsletter » Account-Based Marketing—Beyond the Hype Millennials—A Moving Target for Marketers Artificial Intelligence for Marketers—The Future is Already Here More Webinars » More on this Topic How Data Affects Client-Agency Relationships Mobile Takes Majority Share of UK Time with Digital Media Instagram's Ad Business Is on a Rapid Trajectory Join eMarketer for a free webinar: Account-Based Marketing—Beyond the Hype eMarketer Webinar Thursday, November 17, 1pm ET Click to Register.

PT Written by Dave Mark Marques Brownlee put together the video below, taking Siri and Google Assistant, side by side, through their paces. The set of questions Marques chose were wide in range, but not necessarily definitive. They poked at the boundary of what each assistant did well and poorly, without digging further to find the cliff for each. There’s a lot to learn watching this. First, it’s clear that Siri holds her own against Google Assistant, despite all the naysaying out there. Neither is perfect, both are useful. My sense is that both assistants are tree driven, able to answer questions that are within their tree of knowledge. But one cliff for both assistants is context. For example, Marques asked Siri: Who is the President of the United States? In response, Siri turned to a web search. Clearly, this particular piece of knowledge, the answer to a relatively obvious question, is not in Siri’s tree. When Marques followed with: How tall is he? Siri, clearly missing the context, produced a web search for this question: How tall is United States? To some, this might seem dumb. But this is really a missing branch in Siri’s tree of knowledge. When Marques asked: Did the Clippers win? Siri replied with the score of the previous night’s pre-season game, while Google Assistant replied with the score from the final Clippers game from last season. Clearly, the Google tree of basketball knowledge was missing a branch. Another example: Marques asked: Show me some pictures of German Shepherds. Siri showed web images, Google Assistant found a single YouTube video. Continuing: Show me pictures of cats. Siri showed web images of cats, Google Assistant showed pictures of cats from Marques Google Photos collection. One conclusion you might draw is that Google Assistant knows how to find cats in your photos and Siri does not. But if Marques has asked: Show me my pictures of cats. Siri would have done the same as Google Assistant. So part of the difference, of getting the most from your assistant, is learning the language of your assistant, learning how to lead your assistant appropriately. I loved this video. To me, it shows how much has been achieved by each team, how much power each assistant brings to the table. I use Siri all the time. While there are certainly moments of frustration, they almost always stem from the form of my question. As long as I stay in Siri’s wheelhouse, I get a tremendous amount of value from Siri. A@E What’s weird with the show me pictures of cats question is I get the complete opposite when doing it. I am using Google Now on a Nexus 5x and not Assistant, but when I ask Siri to show me pictures of cats she shows me pictures of cats in my personal library. Same as when I ask her on my MacBook. To get Google Now to show me pictures of cats in my Google Photos library I have to say “Show me MY pictures of cats” or I get a Google search for photos of cats. Oliver Heering In my opinion it cannot be the point in 2016 that I as the user have to learn a machines language to communicate with it. I’m getting more and more frustrated with personal voice-controlled assistance (Siri in particular) because I really want them to understand ME. I’m getting tired of trying to understand THEM (which words do I have to use in which order). I know it is really hard for a machine to figure out the actual command from a spoken sentence but I wished there had been more progress until now than just adding more content to it. Getting things right no matter how you formulate a command should be top priority. Markus Stöbe This reminds me somehow of Newton’s egg freckles debacle… 😀 I loved my Newtons HWR nevertheless…still miss it today. Caleb Hightower Siri still seems like an Apple ‘hobby’ rather than the future of computing. 7 times out of 10 I get random or wrong answers/feedback from Siri. I don’t use Google Assistant. Markus Stöbe What bothers me the most is not that Siri doesn’t understand my correctly on all occasions but the major differences/fluctuations between implementations of Siri on different devices and over time. For example: When I got my Apple Watch I used to say “Tell Markus that I’m 10 Minutes late.” and that worked absolutely fine. After some time, Siri stopped to understand this, asking me whom I want to send a message to or stating it can’t help me with websearch on my Watch…WTF? I didn’t even make an upgrade to watchOS by then! Another thing is the “I can’t help you with this on this device”-Answer in and of itself…holy moly…if Watch-Siri can’t do it, why doesn’t he/she just relay this to iPhone-Siri without asking and get’s me the results on the watch? If TV-Siri can’t search the Internet, ok, why doesn’t he/she even bother to transfer my request to another gadget? But for and frontmost: Why on earth do I have a semi-shizo intelligent assistant with multiple personas? Siri seems to be totally web based to me…so…why are there different implementations that react differently to the same request??? Oh and…some times I get a perfect transcript of my message on my watch display…only to have Siri botch it up in post-processing or telleing me it didn’t understand me or it can’t connect to the interwebs for processing…aaaaargh, Meaux “Siri replied with the score of the previous night’s pre-season game, while Google Assistant replied with the score from the final Clippers game from last season. Clearly, the Google tree of basketball knowledge was missing a branch.” Clearly Google is a real sports fan and knows that nobody cares about preseason games. 🙂 Mo Excellent tests. Funny how similar the voices are. Joe Thorpe I ask Siri for the Wikipedia page for a show or film I am watching on television & it says that it isn’t available in the iTunes store for my region & it says this every time I ask. I ask Google & it takes me straight there. I ask Siri for a map & it rarely comes up with the map I want it produces one from a third country. Google does exactly what I ask. I find Cortana works better than Siri but where Siri does compete is when I ask it to send a text message where it is equal to Cortana & Google.

Alphabet's iPhone 7 killer shows 'almost zero evidence' of HTC brand Google's Android flagship hides away Samsung-made RAM and a particularly fragile OLED panel. By Oliver Cragg October 24, 2016 14:16 BST What lies inside Google's marquee post-Nexus smartphone?iFixit As with all new smartphones, it is only a matter of time before someone does the unthinkable and starts prying open their pricey new toy to see what lies under the hood. This time around the knife has been applied to Google's post-Nexus, iPhone-competing Pixel range, with the larger Pixel XL baring all for the world to see thanks to the surgeons at iFixit. After applying some heat, a suction cup and a plastic pick, the team at iFixit pop the two-tone back off the Pixel XL and get to work on removing a large internal bracket that protects the smartphone's innards. Tearing apart mobile devices in this way is often a good indicator of how easy it would be to repair should problems arise, and the Pixel XL rated a solid, if unspectacular six out of 10 on iFixit's ranking scale. By comparison, Apple's iPhone 7 scored one point higher, while Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge scored a lowly three out of 10. The process also revealed several design aspects of the smartphone that are somewhat surprising – chiefly the modular-like arrangement of many of its components. The camera module, USB Type-C port and 3.5mm headphone jack are all picked out as easily removable – and crucially for repair purposes, replaceable. Also surprising is the almost complete lack of HTC branding within the Pixel considering the Taiwanese smartphone maker co-manufactured Google's first phone since it dropped the Nexus moniker. iFixit says that there is "zero evidence of this phone's HTC manufacturing origin" aside from a tiny HTC logo on the 3450mAh, 13.28 Watt-hour battery. The main reason for the mediocre repair score for the Pixel relates to its 5.5in screen, which iFixit was unable to keep intact during the teardown. In a video review (embedded below), iFixit note that the lack of a frame or bezel and ultra-thin components led to the OLED panel breaking with relative ease. The Pixel range also utilises Samsung tech with the 32GB Universal Flash Storage and 4GB LPDDR4 RAM both provided by the Galaxy maker. Qualcomm makes multiple appearances as well, providing power management components, the Snapdragon 821 processor, quick charge unit and more.

And now, having reliably gone through the first two, Google's latest contribution to the smartphone market has been put through the final stage. YouTuber JerryRigEverything is back with his latest stress test, putting the Google Pixel phone through its paces and unleashing a series of chasis-damaging experiments on the device. Related: Head to Head – Is the Pixel phone overpriced? So, how does it hold up? Pretty well, as it turns out. In the scratch test, the phones' Gorilla Glass 4 resists scratching right up to pressure level six – matching the iPhone 7 and most other phones for scratch resistance. Pretty standard stuff, then. The back of the phone holds up well to the scratches too, with the aluminium section of the backplate allowing for key scratches to be brushed off, while providing a lovely canvas for Jerry's blade to create a more permanent set of indents, resulting in some spellbinding landscape artwork. The speaker mesh on the front, however, is less than stellar, being made of material rather than metal or plastic – meaning you'll have to be careful when cleaning it. Elsewhere, the fingerprint scanner scratches easily but manages to keep working despite being defaced, which is almost as impressive as the phone's resistance to the all-important bend test. The Google pixel manages to resist Jerry's bending efforts well, leading the tester to conclude the phone "could very well be one of the most durable, well built phones of 2016". Related: Google Pixel XL review Unfortunately, the Pixel's screen isn't quite as burn resistant as the LG G5, with Jerry's lighter leaving a permanent white mark on the AMOLED display. Apple's iPhone 7, in contrast, managed to completely recover from the burn test – though burning your phone's screen still seems unlikely. Overall, then, Google seems to have put together a solid phone this time around. Shame it isn't waterproof, though.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us uBreakiFix is Google Pixel’s official walk-in repair partner By Ida Torres - October 24, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Having a good repair program for a newly-bought smartphone or tablet is probably not something that people look for when buying their new gadget, probably since we don’t want the thought of new devices breaking down this early. But after the debacle that some Android manufacturers that we will not name (since everyone knows anyway), this may be a consideration when buying your newest smartphone. For those thinking of purchasing the Google Pixel, then you’d want to know that their official walk-in repair partner is uBreakiFix. The cleverly named repair service which boasts of more than 250 locations all over North America (and with more to come too!) will be your go-to place just in case something goes wrong with your Google Pixel. What uBreakiFix offers is a same-day repair service, and you’ll be able to enjoy that with your new smartphone as well. This will include repairing broken screens, water damage, software problems, camera issues, and other technical problems. It will cost you around $129.99 for Google Pixel screen repairs and $149.99 for Google Pixel XL. The other issues would of course have to be assessed. The Pixel is the first fully Google smartphone, from the design to the hardware, software, and cloud services. Some have actually called it the best Android device in the market and they have been heavily marketing it, more than any Google product in recent years. The price point of both the Google Pixel and Pixel XL is not light, so you would want to take care of it and having a stand-by repair partner is a bonus. If you can’t go to the more than 250 uBreakiFix retail locations in 187 cities across North America, you can actually mail your broken device to them for repair. They are also adding more locations and by the end of this year, they will have more than 275, so that means more opportunities for you to have a same-day repair for your devices. VIA: Yahoo!

Self-driving cars are almost here, aren’t they?   October 24, 2016 at 8:00 am   Bill Gardner I think that artificial intelligence will revolutionize medicine (and everything else). Smarter people than me think so too. Some examples of artificial intelligence-> smarter medicine https://t.co/wXzlXe7YcP by @chrissyfarr @FastCompany #AI pic.twitter.com/LUeHsZjSAi — Eric Topol (@EricTopol) June 21, 2016 But how soon will this happen? One reason to think that the revolution is nigh is the recent successes of other AI-driven technologies, like drones, or the apparent progress in developing self-driving cars. However, I recently had a conversation with Ari Allyn-Feuer,* a smart bioinformatics grad student, that led me to question how much we know about the safety of robotic cars. And if it is hard to prove that robotic cars are safe, it’s going to be even harder to prove that artificially-intelligent medical technologies are safe. Before looking into this, I had a mental model that said that robots were safer than human drivers. The implicit argument was something like this: Human drivers are dangerous.  Tens of thousands of people die on the roads every year.  The great majority of these crashes are associated with impaired humans or driver errors. Robotic cars are safe. Google’s cars have been driving on our roads with no fatalities. We have decades of experience with marine and aviation autopilots. Someone died recently in a Tesla, but that’s just one. Conclusion: Get humans out of the driver’s seats. Do it now. Notice what’s missing from this argument. There are no data. Bad sign. How dangerous are human drivers? There were 32,675 deaths from vehicular accidents in 2014. Yet we are not frightened when we drive. Are we crazy? Well, no. The denominators in traffic safety are huge: American vehicles drove  3,026 billion miles in 2014. Thus there were only 1.08 deaths per 100 million miles driven. We have a 1 in 10,000 chance of dying in a car crash in any given year. How safe are robot cars? Chris Urmson, the director of Google’s self-driving car program, reported that as of May 2015, their robot cars had driven more than 1.7 million miles. This is, literally, an astronomical number: it’s driving to the Moon and back three times. Having no fatalities in that many miles is impressive. Except…  you would expect only 0.2 fatalities in 1.7 million miles on US roads with human drivers. Unfortunately, we do not have nearly enough miles on Google cars to compare them to human drivers. Perhaps we should compare safety by counting crashes, which are far more common than fatalities. Urmson reports 11 Google crashes during those 1.7 million miles, which is 6.5 crashes / million miles driven. Compare this to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration’s (NHTSA’s) report of 6,064,000 police-reported crashes in 2014 for 3,026 billion vehicle miles. This is only 2.0 crashes / million miles. The relative risk of a Google crash would then be 3.2 times the risk for a human driver (1.0 means that the risk of Google cars and human cars is equal, relative risk > 1 means that Google cars are more dangerous). However, these crash rates are not truly comparable. On the one hand, Google cars may be operating on better roads and weather than the typical human driver. On the other hand, and more importantly, human crashes are badly underreported. But how much are they underreported? Using a telephone survey, the NHTSA estimated that 30% of crashes are unreported. If we correct the number of human crashes for underreporting, we get an estimate of 2.9 crashes / million miles. If so, Google cars have a relative risk of 2.2 compared to humans. Worse, the rate of underreporting is itself uncertain. Another NHTSA report quotes an estimate of 55% of crashes being unreported, which means 4.6 crashes / million miles. Even so, Google cars are more crash prone (relative risk = 1.4). So the risk estimates for both robots and humans have a great deal of uncertainty, the robots because of small denominators and the humans because we hide our mistakes to an unknown degree. The upshot is that we don’t know if robotic drivers are as safe as humans. My back of the envelope calculations suggest that they might be a bit less safe. We shouldn’t expect that self-driving cars on the highway are imminent (Tesla agrees). So, should we get Google cars off the roads? That’s not my view. Even if Google cars aren’t as safe as human drivers, they are very safe: None of the 11 Google accidents has injured a human. Robot drivers are machine learners, so they will get better at driving as they accumulate miles on the road. Robots will eventually be safer than humans, making a marginally higher risk now worth it in the long run. A more effective way to reduce traffic fatalities is to develop better ways to take drunk drivers off the road. All this has implications for the automation of medicine. To me, the measurement problems in medical safety look harder than those in auto safety. The denominators for many potentially automatable medical procedure are much smaller than road safety denominators. Many medical errors and mistakes do not have mandated reporting. Underreporting is common and the rate of underreporting is highly uncertain. So it’s going to be extremely hard to evaluate the safety of medical robots from observational data. It will be even harder to measure it from RCTs comparing humans and robots, because the denominators will be tiny and human performances in the human arms of the trials will likely be better than routine human clinical practice. So for safety reasons alone, the automation of medicine will be even slower than the automation of driving. Finally, I’m amused that I let myself be fooled by the hype about robotic cars. Distrust non-data-based journalism: you can get hosed if you accept it without checking. *Ari deserves credit for any good ideas in this post. However, I come to slightly different conclusions than he does, so I am responsible for any errors. @Bill_Gardner Tweetable Comments closed     Uncategorized Loading Follow the blog Why all these options?

Bob O'Donnell, Special for USA Today 8:43 a.m. EDT October 24, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Apple says their voice recognition app Siri is improved. USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham puts Siri through a few tests to find out. Video by Robert Hanashiro The Tap is similar to Echo, but requires you to press a button to speak to Alexa. (Photo: Amazon) FOSTER CITY, Calif. — There’s no question about the influence that artificial Intelligence, or AI, is starting to have on the technology market. AI is now mentioned and discussed at nearly every major tech company event these days, and it’s incorporated into a rapidly growing percentage of the news these companies are generating. More importantly, the kind of “contextual intelligence” AI can enable is finally starting to become real for people. Notice, for example, how your smartphone has started to do things like recommend what time you need to leave home to get to your first event of the day based on current traffic and weather conditions? That’s AI in action. It’s also enabling things like more pertinent suggestion engines for places to eat, and more accurate, and more timely, directions in our navigation apps. The technology’s most immediate impact, however, is enabling the interactions we’re starting to have with our devices through virtual assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana, among others. USA TODAY Google Pixel review: Assistant, camera add up to a winner The accuracy—or rather inaccuracy—of those interactions has been discussed before, but there’s another concern that some people are starting to raise. Core to the concept of AI is that the computers are supposed to learn from us, not the other way around. What seems to be happening, though, is that we’re having to adjust to the manner in which these digital assistants work in order to get what we want. Putting it simply, each of the different assistants requires you to address it in ways that feel a bit awkward (not to mention the fact that each one works a bit differently). In addition, to get the best results, you often have to learn how to ask your questions or make your requests in very particular ways that don’t feel very natural. As a result, people are now having to adapt to how the technology works, instead of the technology responding more naturally to us. On top of that, there are some big questions about how each of these digital assistants will evolve in a way that allows the companies that have created them to maintain some unique competitive differences. (See previous article “What happens when the digital assistants get (really) good.”) The result is that while the promise of AI remains incredibly promising, the current reality isn’t living up to the hype. For early adopters, the need to adapt to devices isn’t a big deal, but for more widespread acceptance, it is an issue. Normal people want devices to work for them and we’re just not there yet. Despite these issues, the focus and interest in AI are understandable. After all, the concept behind AI is pretty compelling: computers leveraging clever software to discover patterns in the actions we take and the things we say, or using real-time measurements of things occurring in the physical world around us, in order to provide useful information that helps us more easily complete the tasks we need to do. Siri's closest Indian restaurant turned out to be in San Jose, California, just a 6 hour drive from Los Angeles  (Photo: Robert Hanashiro) Much of the interest in AI is also due to the fact that its reach and capabilities go far beyond the simple examples mentioned above. It’s being used for much more complex efforts as well, such as recognizing cyber-attacks based on unusual network traffic patterns, to automatically recognizing medical issues through machine vision and image-learning technologies, and literally millions of other applications. Because of AI’s “learning” abilities, some people have raised concerns about the potential threats that AI could pose in the future, from both a national defense perspective and an even larger, almost science-fiction-like societal threat. These types of threats are still futuristic, but it is interesting that several tech companies have formed a consortium to start looking at the larger potential ethical and other potential non-technical impacts of AI. A good portion of the current frustrations with AI are because the technologies are still maturing and still have a long way to go when it comes to accurate recognition, not just for a single phrase, but for an ongoing conversation. The truth is, natural language processing and some of the other core technologies behind these digital assistants are hard to do, particularly when you take into account different accents, different environments, and lots of other potential variables. A screenshot of the app Cortana for iOS and Android.  (Photo: Microsoft) With technological improvements, the awkwardness of these interactions will likely get reduced and the quality of the interactions will go up. In the meantime, however, don’t be surprised if your efforts at AI-driven digital conversations remain a bit stilted.

'Pokemon Go,' which has been a smash-hit across the globe was launched in Taiwan on 6th August. Since its global launch, the mobile game has been an unexpected megahit among users who have taken to the streets with their smartphones. (Photo by Billy H.C. Kwok/Getty Images)  ( Billy H.C. Kwok / Stringer ) The Google Pixel, the Sony Xperia XZ, and the LG V20 are premium smartphones launched in 2016. All the three handsets come with decent specifications, making selecting the best one a bit of a challenge. To help you out, here is a quick comparison of their specs and features. Advertisement When it comes to physical design, the LG V20 is the tallest, slimmest and widest, followed by the Sony Xperia XZ and then by the Google Pixel smartphone.  The LG V20 model is denser than the Xperia model followed by Google's own smartphone as per NDTV Gadgets. The LG V20 model has the largest screen among the three with Sony's smartphone occupying the second place. Both the Google Pixel and Xperia XZ smartphones have similar screen resolutions but lesser than what we have on the LG smartphone. From a processor perspective, the Xperia XZ makes use of Quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 whereas the LG V20 is powered by 1.6 GHz Quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 and the Google Pixel is powered by 1.6 GHz Quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 . Google Pixel with the latest processor holds the edge here with faster CPU speed followed by the V20 smartphone.  The LG smartphone has higher battery capacity among the three smartphones. The second position goes to Sony Xperia XZ.  Among the three smartphones, the LG V20 has the removable battery option. Advertisement The RAM capacity of LG and Google's own smartphone is higher than that of the Sony Xperia model as per Phone Arena. However, Sony Xperia XZ has twice the internal storage as both the V20  and the Pixel smartphones. When it comes to expandable storage option, higher capacity is possible with the LG V20 compared to Sony Xperia smartphone. The Google Pixel does not support expandable storage option. Sony models are well known for their great cameras and the dominance continues for Xperia XZ model. With an incredible 23MP rear camera with flash and a 13 MP front camera, it comfortably beats the LG V20 which comes with 16 MP rear camera and 5 MP front camera and the Google Pixel which comes with 12.3 MP rear camera and 8 MP front camera . The LG V20 occupies the second position in the charts when it comes to camera specs. Among the three models, Sony Xperia XZ is the only model which supports FM Radio and dual-SIM. So is the winner here? Well, it is up to the users to decide that. For shutterbugs and FM Radio lovers, the Sony Xperia XZ seems to be a perfect choice. Google Pixel with new features also seems favorite among many Android lovers. Users who love strong specs, a sleek design or are concerned with more battery life has a better choice going with the LG V20 model.   © 2015 - 2016Mobile & Apps, All rights reserved.

(Photo: Gene Page, AMC) Harry Potter, Anthony Bourdain, Superman, Bill Simmons and Charles Barkley are all going to work for a phone company. AT&T’s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, the New York-based company that owns HBO, CNN, TNT and Warner Bros. film studio, is a huge domino falling in the content business. The deal, which comes with the requisite promises of innovation and cost-savings, will make competitors in the Internet and media businesses uneasy. The move could also set off a new wave of telecommunications companies and Internet giants, such as Google and Apple, buying or making deals with popular content programmers, further blurring the boundaries among the industries. In fact, Apple had been rumored for months to be a potential acquirer of Time Warner. Google's interest in buying premium entertainment content, such as the right to stream NFL games, has also been widely reported. Other cable network operators that also could be potential takeover targets, to name a few, include: AMC Networks, best-known for its top-rated TV show The Walking Dead, but which also owns BBC America and SundanceTV; and Discovery Communications, which owns Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel and Animal Planet. The acquisition, which marries partners in distribution and content, will trigger multiple layers of complexity for customers, industry regulators, investors and consumer watchdogs as they sort out revenue possibilities and conflicts of interest. But competitors of Time Warner or AT&T can no longer afford to stand by idly. Time Warner’s Chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes intimated as much, saying the deal was partly to get ahead of competitors. “You’re going to see all kinds of distributors following,” he said in a press conference call with reporters Saturday night. “And you’re going to see a kind of revolution in the TV world.” In this June 18, 2014 file photo, Jeff Bewkes, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, attends the Cannes Lions 2014, 61st International Advertising Festival in Cannes, France. (AP Photo/Lionel Cironneau, File)  (Photo: Lionel Cironneau, AP) USA TODAY AT&T agrees to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion Telecom providers have been shopping for content companies as their wireless smartphone and broadband Internet service markets mature and growth slows. "As upside from data usage seems to be increasingly capped, we would not be surprised if other distributors were to potentially embrace larger opportunities in the content arena over time," said Barclays analysts Kannan Venkateshwar and Amir Rozwadowski in a recent note to investors. Ownership of Time Warner’s content – including Harry Potter movies, CNN, NBA basketball on TNT, MLB baseball on TBS, HBO’s critically acclaimed shows, and DC Entertainment films, whose franchises include Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman -- guarantees that AT&T can readily make those programs available on its DirecTV satellite TV service without cumbersome negotiations. AT&T can also stream those shows to its Net-delivered and wireless DirecTV-branded streaming services in the works -- and even waive monthly data limits for AT&T smartphone and Internet customers. AT&T bought DirecTV last year for $48.5 billion.

[Via MerlinFTP Drop]  (Photo: Helen Sloan, HBO) USA TODAY Why your cable company wants to make movies With more consumers streaming on their mobile devices, Bewkes, whose company had been wooed by others, pulled the trigger on the deal largely because he was drawn to the idea of delivering his content to consumers on “a multiplatform basis,” he said. Beyond that, AT&T also gets revenue by licensing those movies and TV series to other pay-TV providers and subscription Net TV services such as Netflix.  "Video and entertainment will remain the key driver for the future of consumer-oriented services," said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at Parks Associates. "Video, virtual reality, and other entertainment experiences are data hungry. They will be the experiences that push consumers to higher tiers of broadband or mobile data." Owning content also helps pay-TV providers to avoid costly conflicts over the escalating prices they pay to carry programming, he said. And Time Warner's networks, particularly HBO and TNT, fetch some of the highest fees for pay-TV providers. After closing the acquisition, AT&T-DirecTV will dictate financial and legal terms of Time Warner's negotiations with other cable competitors. "With content costs continuing to increase, operators are expecting more such conflicts in the future. So, ensuring access to popular content certainly helps AT&T," Sappington said. Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal in 2011 foreshadowed AT&T-Time Warner deal. And regulators’ approval of the deal and Comcast’s continued profitability from its business diversity have emboldened pay-TV competitors. Verizon's announced July purchase of Yahoo for $4.8 billion -- and its May 2015 $4.4 billion deal for AOL -- involved content, as well as Internet advertising, making it "a case of buying what it needed to better monetize the data its network produces," said analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research. "Any media company without a controlling shareholder and other than Disney (because of size) could be a target," Wieser said. CBS Corp. and Viacom, despite the recent turmoil surrounding Viacom's management, could be targets. The controlling shareholders of both companies – principally, billionaire media mogul Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone – have called on the two companies to merge. With a combined market cap of more than $40 billion, a CBS-Viacom would hold not only CBS' various networks including Showtime, but also Viacom's assets such as Paramount, BET, Comedy Central, MTV and VH1. Other standalone media companies, such as AMC, Discovery and Scripps, which owns HGTV and Food Network, will be subjects of ongoing merger speculation. As the telecom-media world turns, regulators will have their hands full. AT&T's Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson told reporters that he doesn't see difficulty in passing regulatory muster since he's buying a "supplier," or in business parlance, a deal of "vertical integration." Anti-trust regulators have been typically more concerned with horizontal integration deals, in which a company buys a rival and gain greater market share. Randall Stephenson, chief executive officer of AT&T Inc., gestures during a session on the opening day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2014. [Via MerlinFTP Drop]  (Photo: Chris Ratcliffe, Bloomberg) But given the size of the deal, regulators will hardly rubber-stamp their approval. They did put some conditions on Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal -- a similar case of vertical integration -- and the same would likely happen here, Sappington says. "The fact that AT&T is not one of the two largest pay-TV providers in the U.S. market will help," he said. "It makes it more difficult for opponents to claim a monopolistic advantage for AT&T in this merger." The presidential election also could be a variable. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he'd oppose the merger, if elected, saying "deals like this destroy democracy."

Then you’ve probably already heard of WordPress. As the most popular content management system to date, WordPress powers over 76.5 million websites, be it personal blogs, industry news portals, online stores, or business websites. With its smooth learning curve and versatility, even beginners can get a fully-functional site up and run within minutes. Today, there are several DIY platforms like WordPress that can help you create a beautiful website from the ground up. From blogging platforms to website builders — below are the alternatives you need to consider: Blogging Platform First, let’s start with the top blogging platforms that are best suited for content creators. Take note that, apart from the content management system, WordPress also offers one the most popular blogging platforms in the world known as WordPress.com. It is an entirely different service without the technical aspects such as plugins, coding, and web hosting. In turn, bloggers can focus solely on content creation. Although this setup is not ideal for monetization, it is perfect for hobbyists and would-be site owners who wish to own an online portfolio. 1. Tumblr Tumblr’s greatest strength is the community aspect. Within the platform, other bloggers can see and share your content. It also has features like HTML/CSS customization, social integration, and about 1,000 themes to choose from. 2. Blogger Blogger is Google’s blogging platform. That said, users have full access to tools such as Google Analytics, Keyword Planner, and AdSense. It is entirely free to use and allows you to access the HTML code of your website. 3. Medium If Google has Blogger, then Twitter has Medium — a simple blogging platform that can give publishers a clean and straightforward writing space. One of its advantages is the built-in analytics feature that can help you track the performance of your blog over time. 4. Typepad If you are looking to gain instant visibility for your blog posts, then you should consider a premium blogging platform like Typepad. This platform allows you to get on with blogging immediately and publish your work on the website itself. As a paid service, you also get a ton of customization options to instill your personality into your blog. 5. Ghost Ghost is an open-source blogging platform for hobbyists and professionals who want to establish an online presence. But unlike most other platforms, users have the option to use the downloadable version and use a separate hosting service when creating a website. Website Builders Website builders may not be as easy to use as blogging platforms or as robust as content management systems. Still, they are perfect for aspiring bloggers who are looking at the possibility of monetization without the technical depth found in full-fledged content management systems. Just remember to pick the right website builder that has all the tools you need to accomplish your online goals. 6. SquareSpace SquareSpace is a popular website builder that features a drag-and-drop web interface. It is one of the website builders that has eCommerce support, meaning you can quickly turn your site into an online store. Users can also choose from a number of pre-configured themes that can help newbies create a presentable site. 7. Wix Wix, just like SquareSpace, offers a drag-and-drop interface that can make website creation a breeze. However, Wix has far more options regarding themes and customization. This makes it easier for you to develop your personal brand. On the other hand, your control over the eCommerce aspect of your site is somewhat limited. 8. Weebly Out of all the website builders found in this list, Weebly is probably the easiest one to use. Whether you want to build an online store, a business website, or an online portfolio, Weebly has everything you need to create a beautiful website in no time. It also has advanced features like video backgrounds, real-time shipping tracker, and coupons. Content Management System Lastly, content management systems are comprehensive platforms that allow you to build just about any site. WordPress, for example, has thousands of plugins and themes you can combine to give your site a unique look and feel. Although the learning curve for content management systems is slightly steeper than that of website builders, most platforms offer free learning resources to help beginners get started. 9. Joomla Joomla is an open-source content management system that is being run by a large community of developers and advocates alike. If WordPress has plugins, then Joomla has extensions to help improve the experience of your readers. Joomla also has banner and contact management features that can assist you with lead generation and advertising. 10. Textpattern Finally, Textpattern is a simple yet powerful content management system. Its flexibility gives web designers total control over how content is presented. But to unlock the true potential of the platform, you need to have some technical knowledge such as XHTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. Fortunately, their website offers excellent support from the community and tons of documentation that will help you learn along the way. Conclusion Website creation can be a unique experience to each blogger or site owner. What’s important is that you pick a platform that can provide everything you need to accomplish your online goals. If you are still unsure, then you should do a test run with some of the free platforms listed above such as Wix, Blogger, and Tumblr.

Heard about Ghost and TextPattern for the first time. I have already used blogger and SquareSpace for some time now but I love WordPress the most. Thanks for the good information though.

Fresh Egg’s Attractive Content Test: Match or Make-over? Lana Burgess Inbound marketing manager 24th October, 2016 This blog is the first in our search intent spot check series. Over the next six weeks, we'll highlight opportunities for brands to engage a wider audience by creating content to meet their audience's search intentions. In this post, I’ll be rating the content on three popular brands' websites to see how attractive it is to users and to search engines. Using Fresh Egg’s search intent spot check process, I’ll be highlighting opportunities for the brands to better meet the needs of their audience. This is the first step in attracting, engaging and converting visitors and increasing revenue for these brands. The theory behind our content analysis What makes content attractive to your users? If you want to attract visitors to your site, one of the most important moments for your content is when it is seen in search results. It’s not always the top result that users click on – so wherever you are in the list, how do you ensure your brand is the one that stands out? Put yourself in the shoes of your audience. As a user, with little to go on other than a URL, page title and meta-description you have to make a snap decision about which site in the results is going to meet your needs. So, what helps you make that decision and click through? A deciding factor is seeing page titles, URLs and meta descriptions that fit with your intentions. Results that use words that are semantically similar to those you used to search. Ones which – at a glance - capture what you’re looking for. What makes content attractive to search engines? Matching content to intentions is not just important for that moment of truth in search results, it is also crucial to earn a place in the search results in the first place. Google’s algorithms work to make content that closely and holistically match a user’s search intentions appear more prominently in search results for searches that relate to those intentions. As a brand, by creating content that meets your audience’s search intentions you can gain traction in search results and become more visible to your audience. How do we know if a site has content that matches search intent? So, having content that matches search intentions is the key to attracting and engaging an audience. But how do we assess if a brand is doing this well? At Fresh Egg we have a designed a simple search intent spot check that helps us judge how well a brand is meeting specific search intentions of their audience. This helps us judge if the content is capable of convincing the user – and Google – that it is not only worthy of a place in search results but a click-through and a read too. So, using Fresh Egg’s search intent method – how do three popular brands perform? Search intent content spot check 1: Wistia First up, I took a look at self-professed friendly neighbourhood video platform, Wistia to see how they would fare in our test. Identifying a trigger event for the audience To get started, I got thinking about triggers relevant to the Wistia audience and an obvious one was planning to make a video. When you’re planning to make a video as a business, one of the first questions to answer is how long it should be. Using search intent to find related searches To capture the intent around video length, I came up with the example query “best video length” and entered this into searchintent.co.uk. This graph shows the related searches that I found: Searching the site for content that matches search intentions I used a site search command in Google to search the Wistia site for content that sufficiently matched the search intention behind each of the related searches from the graph. So, how well did Wistia content match search intentions? The verdict Wistia has done well in creating lots of super useful blog content around video length that matches the intention to understand what they best length for a video would be. For example, they have a blog that has lots of detail and some nice graphs that answer the intent visually, using Wistia’s own data. Wistia also make use of videos about video length (see what they’ve done there – so inception) to match search intentions around this. However, when it came down to some of the more specific related search intent, Wistia’s content didn’t do quite so well. For example, whilst there was content about video and social media, there wasn’t anything returned that closely matched my intention when I search for “video length limit YouTube”. The blog lacks platform specific content about video length. So, whilst Wistia has gone some way to matching content to search intentions there is still some room for improvement. Fresh Egg’s content rating:  I’m not head-over-heels but I’m open to a second date. Search intent content spot check 2: Garmin Next up, we looked at wearable tech and navigation product company, Garmin to see how well their content met user’s search intentions onsite. Identifying a trigger event for the audience I chose to focus on intentions around their wearable technology products, as it’s an area of innovation that has received a great deal of press in recent years – as has health and fitness. With these two trends in mind, the trigger event I chose to investigate was training for a marathon. Using search intent to find related searches I entered the search “training for a marathon” into searchintent.co.uk to see what the related terms were and get a sense of the search intent around this topic. This graphs shows the related searches that were returned. Searching the site for content that matches search intentions When I searched the Garmin site for the related searches my analysis had uncovered, such as “training for a marathon from scratch” and “training for marathon diet” I was sadly not met with any relevant content. The verdict The results that were returned were product pages with product copy that mentioned marathon training, but didn’t actually meet my intent. Garmin have done a good job of optimising their product copy for search and their product focused tutorial videos look interesting. However, my intentions as a user when I searched “training for a marathon from scratch” were to get tips and advice, as opposed to product information. A marathon training guide, a blog with top tips or a video on how to get started with marathon training would be much more relevant. Fresh Egg’s content rating:  Garmin’s content is in need of a make-over to keep my (and their audience’s) attention. Search intent content spot check 3: Airbnb Next up, I took a look at Airbnb to see how their content stood up to our search intent test. Identifying a trigger event for the audience I took the event trigger of planning a trip to Berlin (equally could have been any other destination, but I visited the effortlessly cool home of techno earlier this year and stayed in an Airbnb, so it was top of mind). Using search intent to find related searches Using the planning of (another) visit to Berlin as trigger, I entered “things to do in Berlin” to search intent. The graph below shows the related searches this uncovered. Searching the site for content that matches search intentions Next I took the related searches that our analysis had uncovered and checked out whether there was content onsite to match them. My site searches uncovered that Airbnb has some strong content to attract people looking for things to do in Berlin, in the form of an accessible guide. The verdict I was pleased to see that there was lots of juicy content in the guide that met my search intentions and inspired me to keep reading. The fact that the content itself is authored by the hosts is particularly strong, as it helps to increase social trust in the content and make it more engaging. A map showing the location of the attractions featured accompanies the guide – which really matches the intention of someone planning a trip well. The guide is divided into sections on the food scene, drinks and nightlife, sightseeing, parks and nature, arts and culture, shopping, essentials and entertainments and activities. This helps to cater to a range of specific search intents of the audience. So, when I searched the site for “Berlin nightlife” the specific section of the guide relevant to this came up – perfectly matching my intentions. This guide concept is similar to the Discover Cornwall content hub that our team created for Sykes Cottages, which you can read about here. The hub offered users the chance to find out everything they wanted to know about Cornwall with videos, rich image and written guides to food and drink, attractions and other activities. The topics for the content were chosen based on the search intentions of people planning a trip to Cornwall. As such, it was successful in driving traffic and increasing organic visibility, delivering 23,000 visits in just over 12 months and an additional 63,000 organic impressions per month. Room for further intention targeted content Airbnb are doing a sterling job of meeting search intentions for planning a trip with their guide content (which is available for a range of European cities and other destinations). However, my analysis did uncover some small gaps in the content onsite. When I did a site search for “romantic things to do in Berlin” the things to do in Berlin guide content came up, but nothing super specific to activities for couples. As a user, I’d probably still click through on the general guide and expect to find some suggestions for things to do as a couple, as it is sufficiently relevant to what I’m looking for. However, there is room for Airbnb to create further content laser-targeted to this specific intention. Fresh Egg content rating:  It must be love. I’ll send you an invite to the wedding. Conclusion When creating content to draw in visitors and keep their attention, it is important to focus on substantive content that solves problems, rather than just mentioning keywords that are relevant. If your site has content relating to all the major trigger events and intentions relevant to your audience, then you have the best chance of being visible for the right searches. This means you’re able to attract and engaging the widest possible audience. There is still an important place for product copy (at the consideration stage of the buying cycle) but it should be linked through to from “attractive” content, as opposed to being the first thing users are confronted with in response to top-of-the-funnel searches. Ultimately, by attracting and engaging the widest possible, relevant audience you are able to drive more conversions on your site and increase the revenue of your business.

Multi-Window Feature Not Present in the Beta Version of Android 7.1.1 Nougat Google already started rolling out 7.1.1 Developer Preview Oct 24, 2016 12:16 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google made Android 7.0 Nougat available to Nexus devices at the end of August and offered its Pixel smartphones to users with Android 7.1 Nougat pre-installed. Just recently, Google started rolling out Android 7.1.1 Nougat Developer Preview, which comes with some changes. Apparently, the multi-window feature is no longer present in the beta version of Android 7.1.1 Nougat, according to Android Police. In the first Android N Developer Preview, Google made multiple useful gestures available for calling upon the multi-window feature. Users had to swipe up from the overview screen button in order to launch the multi-window mode. The toggle is available on Pixel phones running Android 7.1, but the feature doesn’t seem to work. It’s also missing from the latest Developer Preview, where it had to be enabled from the System UI Tuner with a simple swipe-up gesture. The feature might be a default one on Android, which is why it may have been removed from the beta version and will appear in the stable build. However, there’s still the possibility that it won’t be coming back at all. We’ll just have to wait and see when the next build of Android 7.1 arrives. Google introduced some new features in the 7.1.1 Developer Preview, one of which is the Phone app automatically switching to Do Not Disturb mode when entering a call. New UI changes were also made to the Phone app, and new notifications were introduced. #Google#Android 7.1#Android 7.1.1 Developer Preview#Pixel#Pixel XL reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Pixel Video Ad Parody Shows That the Nexus 6 Is Still a Great Phone Google Announces Android 7.1 Developer Preview Google Assistant Can Be Enabled on Rooted Android Nougat Devices Google Pixel Battery Life Is 40% Higher than Nexus Smartphones OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon    Multi-window mode on Android 7.0 Nougat new android apps Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments Samsung Already Capable of Mass Producing Foldable Smartphones but It's Cautious more on: Samsung foldable phone i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

However, new water resistance tests on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL have hinted to the fact the devices might be able to last longer in water than what Google’s marketing suggests. In a Google Pixel water test on YouTube, Harris Craycraft was able to put his new phone through the paces when it came to water resistance. Craycraft initially put the Pixel phone in a puddle of water, surviving which the phone entered a light shower from a hose on both the front and back sides. With the phone continuing to work properly, he submerged it into a bowl of water for 30 minutes with the screen on and a timer running. After the 30 minutes were up, Craycraft was able to use the phone – claiming that every thing worked as it should. He added that the speakers and the charging port were working properly as well. Another YouTuber, Johnathan Morrison, left his new Pixel smartphone in a bowl of water for an hour. After 60 minutes, he found the phone working properly – albeit the speakers were a little muffled. Morrison was hopeful that the speakers would get back to normal after the phone dried up a little. Of course this is not recommended for actual users who buy the Pixel smartphones, but the videos do make for an interesting watch. Even while flagships from Samsung (Galaxy S7) and Apple (iPhone 7) carry high water resistant ratings of IP68 and IP67. Both of Google’s devices carry an IP53 rating – making them the least water resistant flagship of all. An IP53 rating means that the Pixel and the Pixel XL are resistant to dust, but only resistant to water at certain angles. On the other hand, the Apple iPhone 7 with its IP67 rating allows it to be submersed for 30 minutes. Samsung Galaxy S7, however carries an IP68 rating, which means that it can be put under water (at a depth of up to 1.5m) for 30 minutes.

Google Pixel, Pixel XL are the company’s first real smartphones, and are actually manufactured by HTC, but the branding is all Google.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Assistant goes off against Siri, Cortana in new videos By Ida Torres - October 24, 2016 4 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter One of the things that Google is harping on about their new Pixel smartphones, aside from the fact that it’s the first wholly Google smartphone, is the Google Assistant. It’s still the same “Okay Google” virtual assistant that you’ve known, but it has been enhanced of course and offers you “appropriate, contextually aware smart suggestions for quick replies”. But how does it compare with other AI virtual assistants like Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana? A couple of new videos are pitting Google Assistant against those two. The first video is from Marques Brownlee and it pits the new Google Assistant against the often criticized Siri. Apple’s virtual assistant has often been “accused” of being less than intelligent and not being able to provide quick answers to layered questions. And while the video does show that, there isn’t that big a difference between the two. Google Assistant does really well, like with context-based queries but when Siri does have an answer, it’s often more informative. Contrary to the image that Siri is more personable than most virtual assistants, Brownlee actually found Google Assistant to be the more “closer to human” one. Meanwhile, YouTube tech channel TechAltar tested the new Google Assistant on Allo (which is still slightly different than the one on the Pixel smartphones) against Windows’ Cortana. Google Assistant is more of a chat box, which gives you a more natural feel, while Cortana gives you cards as results, kind of what Google Now was doing before. The latter did better than expected, and in fact, TechAltar chose it over Google Assistant in the end. But of course, Google Assistant running on an actual Pixel phone may be a different matter altogether. It offers more functionalities and if TechAltar compared it instead of just the Google Assistant on Allo, they might have gotten a different result.

That means that when Google brought AMP to the core mobile results, expanding it from the initial launch of just showing it in the top stories section/carousel, that the Search Analytics report doesn't count those AMP pages outside of the top stories section.

The most noticeable change is that when you move the map around with your mouse cursor, the results on the left side update dynamically. It also dynamically updates on the next button click. There is this checkbox option on the bottom of the search results to stop the dynamic search results update when you move the map. It reads "update results when map moves" which is checked by default. Also the directions and web site icons are now replaced with one image.

Screenshot Google reads Gmail email, but it’s for users’ own good—don’t worry. It just wants to serve better ads. Google changed its terms of service this summer to break down the wall between tracked data and personally identifiable information, as Julia Angwin reported on Propublica Friday (she also explains how to turn the linkage off). “This business model has ramifications,” Aral Balkan said in a talk released on Thursday by DOKU:TECH, an annual conference similar to TED. Balkan, of the Ind.ie project, explains the real world costs that tracking of online behavior has on society. Whether or not you believe that your privacy matters, he convincingly argues that tracking imposes real costs in money and time on regular people. ‘We planted a bullshit seed, and we got a bullshit tree’—Aral Balkan His company’s first project is called Better, its a paid ad blocker for Apple products, designed to also beat blocker-blockers. Balkan wrote a script to scan the top one million Alexa-ranked sites for trackers. He identified what he calls the worst site on the internet: Lifebuzz. For those that haven’t visited, it’s just a wall of clickbait. Balkan found 172 web trackers on this one site. “If you block this, you save about 2.5 megabytes every time you load this site,” he said. Findings after scraping and testing the site Lifebuzz, with and without trackers. Screenshot Balkan calculated the real world cost of these trackers from Lifebuzz’s own reported statistics, some of which you can see in its its media kit (though its numbers could be exaggerated). “So using this, we were able to calculate that Lifebuzz, this one site, costs American mobile phone users $4 million a month, in data charges,” he says. “Just to load the trackers.” Then he turns to Forbes. Any visitor to its website gets delayed by this weird “Quote of the Day” interstitial screen before it loads a story. He says that pre-content page has 40 trackers on it and stops people for about 5 seconds before loading the content they came for. With an estimated 46 million visitors per month, Balkan estimates that it costs humanity 7.2 years of human life each month in people waiting for the interstitial page to go away and let them see the content they came for. That’s time humanity is never getting back. But the current business model of journalism doesn’t work without advertising backed by tracking software, a point that lawyers for publisher Axel Springer made quite frankly in arguments before European courts. “Journalistic content is just a vehicle to get readers to view the ads,” its counsel wrote. That’s why this reporter has argued that media entrepreneurs should experiment with cryptocurrency-powered means for web users to pay for content. Then publishers might be able to rely on dumb advertising (ads that know no more about readers than the ones in magazines do). Even without directly connecting tracked data with personally identifiable information, third party trackers with a decent visibility on the web can probably identify most users who don’t go to extra lengths to protect themselves, because it only takes a few data points to identify people with relative certainty. SEE ALSO: An alternative to tracking blockers—lying. Balkan’s blocking software costs $4.99, which aligns its interests with its users. The service completely blocks sites that go too far to counter tracking blockers. To create a world in which people’s data isn’t farmed and our privacy isn’t perpetually violated, he argues that the law needs to recognize that our selves extend into digital space. He’s not alone. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has also said that American law should revisit the principle that commercial interests can do whatever they want with data voluntarily shared with third parties. Further, Balkan argues that governments should subsidize entrepreneurs building decentralized services, using free and open technology, with zero knowledge of their users, so that these entrepreneurs won’t be beholden to venture capital investors to pay the rent while they build services. “We planted a bullshit seed, and we got a bullshit tree,” he says. “Now we’re wondering, ‘Why does the fruit taste like bullshit?’” Observer About Newsletters Advertise Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP

"Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments and Conclusion WoSign say that they were aware that they were doing this, and that the cause was a delay in implementing the changes from CAB Forum ballot 118. Ballot 118 was passed on 16th October 2014, but WoSign were unable to update their systems until March 5th 2015, nearly five months later. This seems like a surprisingly long delay for a relatively simple change, given how quickly WoSign have been able to update their systems in other cases. However, as noted above, this is not a BR violation. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. They explain that there are 16 examples, and it happens when their Certificate Management System loses contact with a signing server during a transaction, and so tries the other one, but both signing servers issue a certificate. One was sent to the subscriber, and the other was stored in their records, and then logged to CT when they logged all their certs. WoSign has since updated their system to use better locking. Further Comments and Conclusion Issuing two different certs with the same serial number is a violation of the RFC, but the impact of this bug is minimal. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. They explain that there were two bugs which led to the same result - one involving a system which did not understand serial numbers with leading zeroes, and the other a race condition. Further Comments and Conclusion This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. It's not clear how "a system bug with the serial number generation, generating a serial number starting with “0” in the first left position" combined with "the signing system had a bug that didn’t know how to deal with this kind of serial number" could lead to duplicate serial numbers. Further clarification has been requested on this point. This incident is unfortunate and an RFC violation, but it was detected fairly promptly (albeit not by WoSign themselves) and fixed. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments and Conclusion WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. There is also the question of whether Mozilla wishes to continue to accept audits from an auditor who misses CPS violations covering such a large proportion of the certificate corpus. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments and Conclusion It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. However, the final incident report still gives the impression that WoSign was able to generate a complete list. WoSign has since stopped doing website validation; if they had continued, better logging of the process would have been necessary. The logs they were keeping while using this process were clearly inadequate. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. WoSign discovered the github misissuances due to a post-issuance review the following day, triggered by "github" being on their list of high-value domains. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. Thanks to Stephen Schrauger for reporting this issue. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments and Conclusion An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw, particularly if it's available in a normal workflow. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. WoSign has since stopped doing website control validation entirely. However, that does not decrease the seriousness of the bug/feature. It also raises the question of how such a feature could make it through review, testing and QA. Issue O: Intermediates with Duplicate Serial Numbers (May - July 2015) WoSign has issued two pairs of intermediates with the same issuer duplicate serial numbers - one pair with a notBefore in May 2015, and one pair with a notBefore in July 2015. All four certificates were issued by WoSign's "CA 沃通根证书" root. This is a violation of RFC 5280. One of each pair has CRL and OCSP URLs with domains such as cr.wscrl.cn, oc.wsocsp.cn and ai.wscrl.cn. These domains no longer exist. The other one of each pair has CRL and OCSP URLs at subdomains of wosign.cn; these subdomains do exist, and point to either Akamai's CDN or what appears to be Qihoo 360's CDN. In the case of one of the pairs, the first cert was logged in the 'pilot' CT log about a month before the second one. One possibility is that WoSign was planning to adopt one strategy for CRL and OCSP hosting, and then changed strategy, which necessitated re-issuing the intermediates with new URLs. If that is the case, it raises the question of why the notBefore date for both certificates is the same. Thanks to Kurt Roeckx and Rob Stradling for their help with this issue. WoSign Response By private mail, Richard Wang of WoSign said that the plan was to use a CDN with a different domain, but in discussions with the CDN provider there was no need to change domain, so they changed the plan to use the existing domain and reissued the intermediate certificate. At that point, they "forgot to change the serial number". The old one issued only test certificates for two months. WoSign plan to revoke "this two intermediate CA and all issued certificates soon" (by which I assume he means the two certificates with the older domain names). Further Comments and Conclusion Given that intermediates are issued manually rather than in an automated fashion, and should normally be surrounded by strong controls as they involve issuance directly from the root, reusing a serial number for two intermediates shows a disappointing lack of care and appropriate processes. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Their later final statement document says: "being a Chinese licensed CA, we must abide by local laws and regulations, we must actively cooperate with domestic browsers to test the SSL certificate using SM2 algorithm issued by a global trusted root in the real Internet, not intranet." Further Comments and Conclusion There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots - and, in fact, WoSign has said they have updated their systems to avoid issuing test certificates from public roots in future. Mozilla is sceptical of the claim that Chinese law or regulation required WoSign to issue these certificates. However, if that were true, the Baseline Requirements contain a mechanism (section 9.16.3) by which a CA can break the BRs if required to do so by local law, with appropriate disclosure to the CAB Forum. That was not done in this case. We note that Symantec was penalised in late 2015 for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Their problems were first revealed in September, and one big discussion of these problems happened in m.d.s.policy starting on 13th October 2015. All of these dates are prior to WoSign's test certificate misissuances. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which we believe violates section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. Furthermore, when this clause was brought to their attention, they denied that any changes fell under it, and they attempted to suppress further information about the ownership transfer when it was brought to the community's attention. Full details can be found in the post in mozilla.dev.security.policy. WoSign Response Richard Wang writes: "An announcement and disclosure will be made shortly pending completion of the business transaction. We can provide the proof documents to Mozilla to show this transaction is not finished if Mozilla think it is necessary." On 2016-09-19, WoSign issued a press release saying that they have "made an equity investment" in StartCom CA. Further Comments and Conclusion Mozilla has confirmed with a Hebrew-speaking lawyer that, as far as the Israeli company authorities are concerned, the transaction which completed the chain to give WoSign 100% ownership of StartCom completed on November 1st 2015. We maintain that this is the date at which the ownership change should have been disclosed to Mozilla. In addition, WoSign's press release about their "equity investment" seems to be economical with the truth; WoSign owns 100% of StartCom. The statement that "WoSign and StartCom [are] two companies operate[d] and managed independently" is hard to square with the fact that the same person is sole director of StartCom and CEO of WoSign. Also, there is technical evidence that StartCom are now using a large part of WoSign's issuance infrastructure. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is probably 67, but may be a few more or less. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, around 12th May 2015, WoSign started using a new certificate template for some of their SHA-1 issuances. This has a fixed notAfter date of 2016-12-29T16:00:00Z (i.e. midnight on 29th/30th December, CST). This may have been a (sensible) move to prevent accidentally issuing SHA-1 certs which ran into 2017. We have found 939 SHA-1 certificates with this fixed notAfter date, including the above three. Certificates issued using this template almost exclusively have notBefore dates on working days in China, suggesting they are issued by explicit WoSign employee action. All of them have notBefores between Monday and Friday, except for 13 on a Saturday and 66 on a Sunday. Of those 66, 4 have notBefores on 2015-09-06, a Sunday which was, unusually, a working day in China. The other 62 all have notBefores on 2015-12-20, which was a Sunday, and not a working day in China. This suggests that, for these 62, the notBefore does not reflect the actual issuance date. For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. Of the 64 certificates they consider, WoSign attribute 6 to a dual-issuance bug, 9 they say are not problematic because they were issued on December 31st 2015, 2 are the mis-issued certs relating to Issue V, and the other 47 are "normal SHA-1 orders". Further Comments Mozilla is seeking further information on the details in WoSign's report and will make further comment at a later date. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which was not requested by the owner of that domain. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. WoSign assert that they completed the domain control checks correctly. Further Comments and Conclusion The owners of alicdn.com have confirmed directly to Mozilla that this incident was caused by an attacker being able to control content on their domain. We would have some concerns with how WoSign's systems validated website control. However, they no longer support this method. This "misissuance" was possible only because alicdn.com was, for some period of time, controlled by an attacker. Therefore, no blame can be attributed to WoSign for the misissuance itself. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments and Conclusion This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open. Issue X: Unpatched Software (September 2016) The first WoSign incident report, produced in response to other issues listed on this page, has a screenshot of a dig query from their validation server. The dig program is part of the bind-utils package, and the output of dig appears to show a bind-utils version of 9.7.3-8.P3.el6. The "el6" shows that this is a version built for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This version of bind-utils was released in December 2011 and so is very out of date. The next release of this package for EL6 following the one WoSign are using is bind-utils 9.7.3-8.P3.el6_2.1, which was released a little later in December 2011. The most recent version is 9.8.2-0.47.rc1.el6, which was released on the 10th of May 2016. There are 19 patched CVEs between the version WoSign is suspected of running and the current version. None of these CVEs are especially severe. However, if this software is in fact that far out of date (nearly five years), it raises questions about the overall patch level of their verification server and even their other infrastructure. WoSign's most recent audit used the "SSL Baseline With Network Security - Version 2.0" criteria. These criteria integrate two CA/Browser Forum Documents - the SSL BRs and the Network & Certificate Systems Security Requirements. A bullet on page 19 of the Network Security Requirements requires that "Recommended security patches are applied to Certificate Systems within six months of the security patch’s availability, unless the CA documents that the security patch would introduce additional vulnerabilities or instabilities that outweigh the benefits of applying the security patch." That appears not to be true of their version of bind, and so may well not be true of other more critical packages on their systems. We would expect the presence of badly outdated software and the lack of an appropriate patching regime to have been caught by WoSign's auditors. Thanks to Paul Pearce for his help with this issue. WoSign Response WoSign's most recent incident report acknowledged the issue and they committed to updating the OS on the server(s) in question. Further Comments and Conclusion N/A. Cross Signing It is important background information to know which WoSign roots are cross-signed by other trusted or previously-trusted roots.

[CHECKLIST INCLUDED] Advertisement Advertisement Driverless Cars In The Year 2020: The Effect And The Companies To Watch Out For By Leby Nightray - 24 Oct '16 02:56AM (Photo : Tesla/YouTube) The new technology, the driverless cars will take the road on 2020. Expect the widespread of this self- or full-autonomous feature of cars. Some companies or automakers are already committed on this new technology. How nice is it for drivers not to drive and still reach their destination? Never say 'that is impossible' because in the year 2020 the road will be filled with driverless cars. Advertisement Expect the widespread of driverless cars in the road since according to Business Insider there are already 11 automakers that are already planning and is committed with the driverless car new technology which are Tesla, Google, Toyota, BMW, Volvo, Nissan, Ford, General Motors, Daimler, Audi, and Baidu. According to Tech Crunch, Rahul Sonnad, the CEO of Tesloop, wasn't really engaged with the 2016 election compared to some as he is engaged with the driverless car . The matter about the autonomous car might also become a relevant political issue by 2020. Now let us see the companies that is racing with each other. Starting with Tesla, which have a goal to get the driverless car ready by 2018. The said goal will still be decided on how regulators will take this new technology. Another company is the Google, the feature that they are planning is fully autonomous. Google's self-driving car project have 2020 as its deadline. Toyota, one of the popular car brands, is also serious about driverless cars. The company already invested a lot of money for the technology. BMW, from Google's fully autonomous, BMW will make a semi-autonomous cars. The company is not rushing as much as other companies do in the market to be safe. Deathproof driverless cars is the aim of Volvo. They will start with semi-autonomous one before going for fully autonomous technology. Nissan is already on its way as it already achieved major advancement while Ford is fully committed to produce a driverless car that will be affordable to all. General Motors have a self-driving concept and is ready to test some prototypes. Daimler is striving hard to to be the first one to launch the driverless car or the autonomous function in vehicles. Audi, a company also committed, hasn't set any date yet for the launching of driverless car. While Baidu is now currently working and testing the project. Rumor has been flying around that Apple will also or has been working on driverless car. No confirmation has yet to be receive. Advertisement Everyone is pretty excited with the new driverless car technology but has anyone considered the effect of it? Effects can differ with different brands. According to Driverless-Future it can kill when it is ill-conceived, there is the left turn problem and many more so it is up to the automakers to manufacturer and solve and avoid possible problematic effects of driverless car.

Caption: Drew Angerer/Bloomberg/Getty Images Skip Article Header. Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Jack Stewart. Jack Stewart Transportation Date of Publication: 10.24.16. 10.24.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Tesla’s Self-Driving Car Plan Seems Insane, But It Just Might Work Drew Angerer/Bloomberg/Getty Images Elon Musk has done it again. The CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX has made an aggressive prediction for his technology, and paired it with an unreasonable deadline. In the past, he’s promised electric cars for everyone and trips to Mars, and built a reputation for achieving those outrageous things, albeit far behind schedule. Now, Musk is pledging that by the end of 2017, he’ll produce a Tesla that can drive itself from Los Angeles to New York City, no human needed. That timeline puts him years ahead of every other big player working on fully autonomous cars. Ford is aiming for 2021, China’s Baidu for 2019. Google hasn’t given a hard date, but 2021 is a good bet. Same goes for GM. And they’re talking about cars that will stay in limited areas—nothing that can cross the country. So, what are the chances Musk can actually make this happen? Let’s break it down. The Claim Tesla’s website already provides a checkbox for “Full Self-Driving Capability,” claiming, “all you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go.” But the cars won’t actually do that, at least not for a while. Musk isn’t issuing the necessary software. These earliest cars won’t even have first generation Autopilot, Tesla’s system that keeps the vehicle in its lane and a safe distance from other vehicles on the highway. Related Video Elon Musk Says Every New Tesla Will Drive Itself The automaker did release a video of its Model X SUV, carrying the new hardware and prototype software, driving itself around Palo Alto. It seems impressive, but it’s no proof of concept. “An unedited sequence of the vehicle driving itself in downtown San Francisco would be more meaningful to see what the vehicle is capable of doing,” says Raj Rajkumar, who runs autonomous driving research at Carnegie Mellon University. Let’s say the car’s as capable as the video makes it seem. Could it get itself across the country? “If we’re looking at another year of development, I think we could see something like that happen,” says Jeffrey Miller, an IEEE member who studies autonomous driving at the University of Southern California. Yet Rajkumar points to Google, which, after nine years of work on this project, still won’t even give a timeline for its rollout. “Mastery of self-driving under real-world conditions is not going to be easy,” he says. And you have to consider Musk’s track record of missing his own deadlines. Tesla products that have missed their original due dates include the Roadster, Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Autopilot. So, kinda everything. Verdict: It’s plausible Musk will meet this deadline, but his own track record says otherwise. The Data Building a car that can handle any situation requires a lot of teaching. Google is the acknowledged leader here: Its fleet of 60 self-driving cars has covered more than two million miles, mostly around a few cities. But Tesla claims an advantage: Its cars have covered over 222 million miles in Autopilot mode, all over the world, collecting data the whole time. “They’re getting a lot more data because of the number of vehicles they’ve sold,” says Miller. Problem is, it’s not clear what kind of data Tesla is collecting. Google’s cars capture the world with camera, radar, and laser sensors, with a human engineer along to flag the important stuff. Mastery of self-driving under real-world conditions is not going to be easy. Raj Rajkumar, director of autonomous driving research at Carnegie-Mellon Tesla’s cars are always online, but don’t think the automaker is building on all the data they provide. “It’s likely lots of data is thrown away, on the fly, while the car is driving,” says Jianxiong Xiao, formerly a computer engineer at Princeton University, now founder of a self-driving software startup. Verdict: Tesla has more, and more diverse data, which might just be enough to leapfrog its competitors. The Tech For extra difficulty, Musk is eschewing widely used LIDAR sensor technology, which fires out laser pulses to build a super accurate graphic representation of the environment. Musk has always hated it, and its price: What Google engineers call the “KFC bucket” on top of their car costs roughly $80,000. Tesla is equipping its cars with eight cameras and a forward-facing radar, which Musk says will provide just as good a view of the world. Giving Up the Wheel Elon Musk Says Every New Tesla Can Drive Itself We Drive the $30K Chevy Bolt, GM’s Tesla-Walloping Electric Car Ford Says It’ll Have a Fleet of Fully Autonomous Cars in Just 5 Years “LIDAR is a great technology, but it’s got moving parts which make it prone to fail, and it’s very expensive,” says Miller. Unlike radar, it has trouble in rain, snow, and fog. Can Tesla do without it? “Absolutely.” Not everyone is so sure. “I’m quite skeptical they can have a solution, which is perfectly safe, without LIDAR,” says Xiao. He says Tesla might build a car that’s safer than a human driver (Musk says twice as safe), but that LIDAR is the only solution for 100 percent safety. To translate sensor data into driving commands, Tesla is using equipping its cars with Nvidia’s Drive PX 2, a supercomputer that uses deep learning to teach the car to handle itself. For the cameras, Tesla will run in-house software, since its previous supplier, Mobileye, dumped it for moving too fast. Verdict: Tesla’s laser-free approach is unconventional, but it can work. The Law Tesla’s ordering website offers a caveat: “Please note that Self-Driving functionality is dependent upon extensive software validation and regulatory approval, which may vary widely by jurisdiction.” No kidding. Related Video Climb Inside Uber’s Self-Driving Car—Its Next Big Disruption Federal and state regulators in the US are slowly developing regulations to govern autonomous technology, but they’re nowhere near ready to validate Tesla’s proposed Level 5 system. Musk is deliberately operating in a grey area, says Miller. “I think he’s taking a big risk, but he’s pushing the technology,” he says. Tesla plans to upgrade its cars’ autonomous capabilities in a drip, drip, fashion. One update could add the ability to obey traffic signals. Another could allow an empty car to search for a parking space, in a private lot, at low speed. The question is, when does the car become “autonomous,” and how do current and future laws govern its behavior? Musk prefers the ask for forgiveness, rather than permission, approach. “It is a way of changing facts on the ground, and that’s what Tesla, and more disruptive companies like Uber are really good at,” says Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law who studies self-driving vehicles. Verdict: Musk doesn’t want to wait for legislation to get his robo-rides on the road, but he may have to. The Ambition Musk has put himself forcefully on the record as pro-autonomy, and says he’s not waiting for the hand-wringers to catch up. Car crashes kill 1.2 million people a year, more than 30,000 of them in the US. “The foundation is laid for cars to be fully autonomous, at a safety level we believe to be at least twice that of a person, maybe better,” he says. Some worry that eagerness could set the technology back. “A serious concern is that Tesla brashly and prematurely introduces technologies that are not ready for deployment yet, encounters crashes and fatalities, and triggers significant pushback from society at large and perhaps much stricter regulation,” says Carnegie Mellon’s Professor Raj Rajkumar. Yet problems with Tesla’s Autopilot system—one death in Florida, possibly another in China—haven’t generated serious fallout. “We get increasingly big crashes and nothing seems to change,” says Walker Smith. German regulators asked Tesla to drop the term “Autopilot,” saying it could over-promise capability. Tesla basically just said nein. Tesla’s self-driving capable cars are already on sale, even if they can’t do what Musk promises just yet. Now, the market will show if people want them. Early adopters—Tesla’s current core buyers—likely will. But the target market for the cheaper Model 3 is the general public. Whether they’ll want to trust a computer, and Elon Musk, to drive them around will be answered by the sales figures. Verdict: Musk’s ambitions usually don’t pan out quite on time, but they haven’t failed him yet.

The handful of enhancements are designed to help G-Suite users work more efficiently and easily, according to a blog post by Google Product Manager Ryan Weber. Docs, for instance, will intelligently suggest an Action Item to assign to the right person through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Users will see a badge on any files with Action Items assigned to them, plus any unresolved suggestions that others have made to their files. Mountain View, Calif.-based Google is also infusing Forms with machine-learning, which enables it to predict the type of question you’re asking and suggest potential responses and adding more ways to format and customize content with voice commands. Finally, the Slack integration allows users to bring files from Drive directly into a Slack conversation. They can also create new Docs, Sheets and Slides files right from Slack. “Every Google Drive file you share in Slack is automatically indexed and searchable, so you can tap into your team’s collective knowledge and quickly find past conversations and files,” a blog post from the Slack team reads. Microsoft Offers Premium Outlook Accounts Microsoft is offering Outlook.com users the chance to personalize their accounts. The Redmond, Wash. based tech giant is offering a premium version of its email service that disables ads and reintroduces the possibility of custom domains, an option Microsoft removed in 2014. The premium accounts will cost $19.95 annually during a promotion, and increase to $49.99 per year after it ends. The initial offer is restricted to the US and there is no support for other functions like groups and auto forwarding at the moment. This is still a preview version so it’s possible that there will be glitches.  It is also worth noting that this is not a replacement for the free Outlook.com which will remain in place. Neither is it clear how far Microsoft intends to go with this and wither it intends to offer it globally. Virgin Launches 'Digital Detox' Virgin Management, the London-based management company owned by British billionaire Richard Branson, is giving its employees a two-hour email break once a week. During the Digital Detox each Wednesday, all email services shut down. The move is designed to encourage employees to shift attention away from the inbox. It's "a great way to encourage people to talk with one another, share ideas, innovate and spend time away from their desks. Digitalization and flexible working has fantastic benefits but we want to help our people balance this,” Josh Bayliss, CEO of Virgin Management, said in a statement. Digital Detox applies to 200 employees at Virgin Management based in the New York and London offices.  Facebook Adds To Instant Articles Menlo Park, Calif.-based Facebook is adding 360 video and 360 photos — which give users a way to immerse themselves in places and situations — to Instant Articles. Publishers will be able to offer both 360 video and 360 photos in-line, which users can navigate through their mobile devices or by tapping and dragging. Each Instant Article can contain multiple 360 photos and videos.  In blog post about the addition Facebook Product Manage Josh Roberts said users can currently use this feature on iOS or Android. Facebook plans to introduce more interactive features in Instant Articles in the next few months. Facebook has great expectations for Instant Articles. Earlier this month, it offered a way for publishers to monetize their content.  As blog post by Harshit Agarwal, Product Manager at Instant Articles, explained: "We now support larger and flexible ad units in Instant Articles, up to an aspect ratio of 2:3. Publishers can bring more of their direct sold campaigns to Instant Articles, including custom, premium formats," he said. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' Domo Strikes New Low in Vendor Competition Everything You Thought You Knew About User Experience Is Wrong Kentico’s New Cloud CMS Is Headless, Thoughtful and Affordable Turn Off Your Printer: It's Almost World Paper Free Day Google Adds Slack Integration to G Suite, More News Dropbox Paper Enhances Collaboration, More Document News Adobe Updates Acrobat DC to Improve Document Editing, Signing Google Drive Search Gets a Natural Language Boost, More News Useful Article?

Released Monday, users who visit Google's homepage will be treated to a short animated clip of Leeuwenhoek examining the Google logo that he finds to contain a variety of dancing bacteria. "I chose to make it an animated Doodle to show the 'before and after' experience that Antoni van Leeuwenhoek had — looking through a microscope and seeing a surprising new world," noted Doodler Gerben Steenks. Known for discovering the existence of bacteria, single cell creatures and spermatozoa, Leeuwenhoek first referred to the organisms he was looking at as "little animals" in a letter to the Royal Society of London. As Google notes, the microbiology pioneer was able to "examine capillaries, muscle fibers, and other wonders of the microscopic universe," using his own constructed lenses that could reach a magnification of 200 times. "Here's to celebrating a true visionary!" Google writes.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek The Best Web Browsers for Speed, Battery Life, and Customization Let’s be honest: Modern web browsers are all pretty solid. Even Microsoft Edge is much better than older versions of Internet Explorer. But we believe Google Chrome is still the best web browser for most people. The Best Overall for Most People: Google Chrome Overall, we prefer Google Chrome. To start, it just feels snappier than other browsers like Firefox and Edge, although Edge has improved somewhat since Windows 10’s release. Google owns Chrome and uses it as a platform to improve and advance the web in general, so Chrome often gets new features before other browsers. It also has some unique features–you can only cast to a Chromecast from the Chrome browser, for example. Chrome generally comes out on top in benchmarks, showing it’s the speediest browser as well (see the last section of this article). Microsoft Edge is catching up with Chrome and may top it in a benchmark or two, but Edge isn’t nearly as feature-filled. If Chrome doesn’t have a feature you want, well, you’re in luck: it has built up a massive catalog of extensions over the last few years, so any feature you want to add, you probably can. Chrome is also available for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android–in addition to Chromebooks, of course. This means you can synchronize your bookmarks, saved tabs, and even passwords across all your devices to access them from anywhere. RELATED ARTICLE Why It’s Good That Your Computer’s RAM Is Full Chrome certainly isn’t perfect, of course. It isn’t the most battery-efficient browser for laptops or the most customizable tool for power users. In addition, it uses an awful lot of RAM, which may make it feel slow on older computers. But, that RAM usage is generally used for useful features and speed improvements on modern computers (remember, used RAM is good), so this isn’t as much of a con as most people would have you believe. It’s mostly only a problem on older or low-powered machines. Plus, Google is getting pretty good at stripping unnecessary cruft from Chrome. They’ve trashed of little-used features like the Chrome app launcher, notification center, and Chrome apps. Google seems like it’s taking Chrome in the right direction, simplifying it and focusing on battery life improvements while continuing to add powerful features for developers. No matter who you are, Chrome will probably serve you well. The Best for Battery Life: Microsoft Edge (Windows) and Apple Safari (Mac) While Chrome has its strengths, long battery life is not one of them. If find yourself struggling to keep your laptop alive between charges, you might be able to do better. Microsoft and Apple, as the companies that make Windows and macOS, respectively, really want to boast high battery life estimates for their computers. All these numbers are measured using Edge on Windows and Safari on macOS. Edge and Safari are just more optimized for battery life. On a Windows PC, the Microsoft Edge web browser offers noticeably longer battery life than Chrome. On a Mac, Apple’s Safari browser offers hours more. Chrome has made some strides recently–and it’s good to see Google making an effort–but Edge and Safari are still ahead. This doesn’t mean all laptop users should automatically pick Edge or Safari. Rather, it means they’re worth a try if you don’t need advanced features, and really need every hour of battery you can get in that moment. Edge and Safari still don’t measure up to Chrome in terms of feature.s For example, both Edge and Safari offer far fewer extensions. They also can’t sync to the same amount of platforms–Edge can only sync between Windows 10 and Windows Mobile 10, while Safari can only sync between macOS and iOS. Chrome also runs on older versions of Windows and macOS, where you can’t run Microsoft Edge or the latest version of Safari. Edge can also be a little flaky because it’s based on Windows 10’s new Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Microsoft still has work to do on UWP. Edge isn’t as bad as it was when Windows 10 was released, but the interface still sometimes seems oddly slow. The Best for Customization: Mozilla Firefox Mozilla positions Firefox as the only browser not controlled by a major corporation; one that’s responsive to the needs of its users rather than the needs of a big company that wants to lock you into its platform. That’s a compelling narrative, but some of Firefox’s moves–like the choice of Yahoo! as its default search engine, and the forced integration of the Pocket read-it-later service–undermine it. We like Pocket, and we understand that Mozilla needs to make money to stay alive, but these forced changes end up being annoying. People shouldn’t be forced to use about:config if they want to disable them. Unfortunately, Firefox is still behind Chrome, Edge, and Safari in critical ways. It doesn’t offer the same multi-process architecture and security sandboxing features other browsers offer. The long-delayed Electrolysis project, which will add multi-process features, is still unfinished. This makes the browser less responsive, especially on CPUs with multiple cores, and means Firefox is less protected against security vulnerabilities. Firefox is also consistently the slowest browser in benchmarks. That said, Firefox is still the most customizable of the lot. Its add-on framework is the most powerful. For example, you can’t easily get tree-style tabs in a vertical sidebar on Chrome, Edge, or Safari–but you can do this on Firefox by quickly installing an add-on. If there’s something you can’t do with a Chrome extension, you can probably do it with a Firefox add-on. Though a lot of options are available in about:config, so in some cases, you may not even need an add-on. Of course, most people don’t need these powerful customization options. But if you do, Firefox is the place to get them. Mozilla is currently working on a new add-on framework for Firefox that will be more Chrome-like, so it remains to be seen if Firefox will stay this customizable. Mozilla does promise that it will extend the add-on framework to allow popular add-ons to continue to function, even if they couldn’t on Chrome. There’s reason for some optimism here, but we wouldn’t use Firefox ourselves until Electrolysis is done. Benchmarked: Which Browsers Are the Fastest? We know people like seeing raw benchmarks, so we chose to benchmark the latest browsers on both Windows 10’s Anniversary Update and macOS Sierra. Just keep in mind: Benchmarks don’t tell the entire story.  Modern browsers are all within spitting distance of each other, and a browser might underperform on benchmarks but perform better in day-to-day use. Features like Google Instant or Chrome’s pre-rendering will make a browser faster in day-to-day use, but won’t show up in benchmarks, for example. So we don’t recommend choosing your browser based on benchmarks alone. Raw Benchmark Scores: Windows 10 Anniversary Update On Windows 10, Chrome appears to be the fastest browser with Edge in second place. Edge does pull ahead of Chrome on the Octane 2.0 benchmark, however. Firefox is consistently in last place. Jetstream 1.1 (Bigger Scores Are Better) Chrome 53: 207.81 Microsoft Edge 38: 201.14 Firefox 49: 167.10 Kraken 1.1 (Smaller Times Are Better) Chrome 53: 861.9ms Microsoft Edge 38: 1082.6ms Firefox 49: 1174.9ms Octane 2.0 (Bigger Scores Are Better) Microsoft Edge 38: 35326 Chrome 53: 34107 Firefox 49: 30987 Raw Benchmark Scores: macOS Sierra On macOS Sierra, Chrome appears to be the fastest browser with Safari in second place. Firefox is consistently in last place. Jetstream 1.1 (Bigger Scores Are Better) Chrome 53: 135.47 Safari 10: 99.407 Firefox 49: 95.411 Kraken 1.1 (Smaller Times Are Better) Chrome 53: 1297.6ms Safari 10: 1299.6ms Firefox 49: 1534.6ms Octane 2.0 (Bigger Scores Are Better) Chrome 53: 22978 Safari 10: 22084 Firefox 49: 21643 No one browser will be on top forever. The browser wars will continue, and competition is constantly making every browser better. Competition is forcing Google to improve Chrome’s battery life, Mozilla to make Firefox multi-process, and Microsoft and Apple to keep improving Edge and Safari to keep improving their browsers with new features. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (25 REPLIES) October 24, 2016 MuggleBornNY When I couldn't stand using IE anymore, I switched to Firefox & it was my default browser for many years. I loved it! No other browser can beat it for customization. But I was forced to use Chrome last year because of a major issue with my antivirus app. After using Chrome for a few months, I had to agree it's noticeably faster than Firefox. So even though my antivirus app was fixed, I've stayed with Chrome. But I still use Firefox as a backup. I'll always have a soft spot for Firefox! October 24, 2016 Tony So in the myopic view of HTG, the Opera browser does not exist ?. I gave up on IE ages ago, ditto FF.Stuck with Chrome for along time until I discovered what a memory hog it is and how intrusive in its behavior. I have a much better seat of the pants reaction to Opera's interface and features. October 24, 2016 Toby Nicholls Could I get a review of Ecosia search engine please?? October 24, 2016 Maxthon has to be a firm favourite for customisation; it leaves those you've reviewed way behind. I've used it for years but it crashed too often so have moved to FlashPeak SlimJet. October 24, 2016 Mel Topf Hey there: I have just about used every browser available. For the longest time, I was Firefox all the way. However, Firefox, really slowed down and crashed several times. It could be that there are so many add-ons which makes it luxurious but it tends to slow down the browser when loading. My favorites were the color tabs, thousands of scenes, and many others but because of the problems I was having, I had to switch to another browser. Edge in my opinion is not very good as it has no features. I tried Opera, Maxthon, Blue Moon which is just a few but I had to stick with IE 11 because it is fast and generally works fine. Although I have an older HP notebook, it still has quite ample memory, HD, 2Ghz clock and win 10 OS. Until I find another good browser, I will stick to IE 11. October 24, 2016 Thomas Bookmarks: Firefox could use improvement, but their built-in bookmarks manager is good. Chrome bookmarks are unusable, and the add-ons are not there. Saving pages: Chrome's SingleFile is very good with few blips, and the Veiw Tabs which saves multiple tabs at once `is equally good. The saved files are portable with very few blips. Firefox seems to mess up pages more often with with .maff and .mhtml formats. maff appears not to be portable, and .mhtml is very spotty re file portability to other browsers. Performance. Firefox became unusable earlier 2016 when it could not handle too many tabs, and also would choke on bookmark searches. I had a peek at Chrome and migrated my extensive bookmark collection over. Chrome failed the bookmarks tests miserably, and I lost much metadata on the bookmarks which made it hard to search them when I moved back to Firefox. Currently: I use Firefox for majority of my work, but fire up chrome for work that I know I want to archive locally. Conclusion: I doubt either of these browsers will resolve these power user issues since the trend these days seems to be moving to KISS and Smartphones, neither of which are much use for high productivity needs. October 24, 2016 Jim Been a Chrome user for many yrs but it has a problem on one of my laptops with "The Golf Channel" display. Does fine for a while after uninstalling and reinstalling browser or even after a re-install of windows but always eventuall corrupts that one site's display after a while. So I now use Firefox more oftern than not. Do not see any significant reduction in speed with Firefox. October 24, 2016 david croydon No-one interested in Vivaldi? October 24, 2016 TO_Techie I used Iron for a long time (a Chromiun-like browser) and it worked well until it started to use staggering amounts of memory. There were some sites that it couldn't handle, mainly KVM / IMM type of links and access. I have switched to FireFox and so far so good. I like the fact that I can synchronize my favorites with my phone. I tried Chrome on iOS but I din;t like the experience. October 24, 2016 Art Northrup, Jr. I wonder why Chris didn't include Opera in the article. I'm not a fan of Chrome, although I do have the "stripped down" SRWare Iron spin-off & while I used Firefox almost exclusively for a long time, I liked some things about Opera. Newer Opera versions are much faster than Firefox, I have a few extensions that work best with Opera & I've have customized it to the point that I rarely use anything else. One little thing that makes things just a little easier & faster is when you select & right-click text on a webpage (as I often do) you instantly see 2 choices, search or copy, so just click the one you want.. And, you can choose which search engine you want to be the default. The only thing lacking is a "home" button, but Opera's "speed dial" is the best, and my "home page" is #1 on it. I've been using the internet since 1997 & today's Opera is definitely my favorite browser. October 24, 2016 Jon Lachapelle Ok so I have been using the internet for over 265 years,started outwith Netscape,then firefox my wife uses Chrome which IS a huge memory hog,then had firefox and that is now my backup but by far the fastest is called Seamonkey and can be customized any way you want it and it even supports firefox extensions October 25, 2016 William Vogel The reason I like Firefox best it bcuz it is the one that has all the sites I visit installed along the top of my screen below the address bar. It even has ones that are out-of site but appear when I click the >> symbol on the right side and they drop down. Google Chrome has some site-icons, but they aren't ones I put there myself and explorer may not have any -- can't reccie, that's how often I go there. I don't notice Firefox being slow. October 25, 2016 campbell2644 The fact that Firefox is free from major companies that try to control and record everything you do is, as you say compelling, and outweighs other issues. Firefox is my browser of choice and keeps on getting better October 25, 2016 I stopped using Chrome because it's such a HUGE memory hog. My computer started slowing down and in my searching I found MILLIONS of KBs in memory files that Chrome creates to save you search time and it doesn't delete these files when you close the browser. Run Ccleaner after a Chrome session and then after a Firefox session, you'll see. October 25, 2016 Skip Hayden Why was Dolphin not considered ? October 26, 2016 David LaVeque Firefox for Android is the only way to go! No other browsers have the native features or allow the same extent of customization. And you CAN cast to Chrome cast devices. But my most favorite feature is when I click any links in any other apps, like gmail, it can save those till I open the browser. These pile up in a notification I can use to open the browser, it I can open any of the normal ways, then all the links will list in order, but not open till I choose. But, the add-ons for safety and security are why I stick with it. I do use Chrome for lots of things, but usually sites that have little or no ads. And I have many other browsers I like to play with. Most having the ad blocking built-in. So, with all the browsers, naturally I have an app that let's me choose which one to use after clicking any links. October 27, 2016 Ira Grossman I mostly use Chrome. I find some websites are not optimized for it in which case I copy the URL to Firefox. I mainly use Chrome because a) I use extensions that are not available for Firefox, b) contrary to other comments I find the bookmark more straightforward and c) the settings options are easier to understand. Chrome saves websites in order to provide a history to backtrack searches and links. Firefox does the same thing. I doubt there are a million entries in Chrome history but you can erase your history by going to Settings, Advanced settings, Privacy and click on Clear Browser Data. Make sure that Clear Browser History is checked.. October 28, 2016 Harry S Anchan You have taken the words out of my mouth. I tried IE, which is just as fast as Firefox, but I love the menu options and customization I can do with FF. I tried Chrome for a few weeks and trashed it. Firefox on my 32-bit machines and Waterfox on the 64-bit machines rarely crash. I love them. I, as well, have a soft spot in my heart for Firefox. I also love Thunderbird for email which I have used for centuries. October 30, 2016 Catalin Petrescu "In addition, it uses an awful lot of RAM, which may make it feel slow on older computers." It does. On my 6 year old notebook it took ages and a lot of error screens just to open the homepage (30 mins to be more precise). As the others have mentioned above I really don't understand why the author didn't include Opera on the list. It has an in-built battery saver and an ad-blocker (which does improve loading time and battery). October 31, 2016 Agree, I always clean after using my chrome browser. Before chrome, I used firefox because I, too, like it's corporate freedom. For now, my uses are simple and do not take up much space, so chrome is acceptable. October 31, 2016 Goran Adevik Agree about Opera. However there is one objection: I haven't found a way to stop moving, flipping animated .gif. Generally I am not disturbed by ads if they are quiet.Many have animated avatars too.Both FF and Chrome/Chromium have add-ons for example SuperStop that work fine Opera earlier had a function to stop animations, but that is for some reason removed in later versions. November 3, 2016 Allan Alessio I would truly love to see some review of striped down browsers or browsers that act like they're striped down. I'm using a Chromebook and even my desktop with Ubuntu and 4GB of ram and using Chrome is crashing on me. November 4, 2016 B E Pratt I have a Vista era Dell desktop running Windows 7. I've used Firefox for ages, but it has gotten so that 'sluggish' would be a kind word to use. Just watching Firefox attempt to shut down was taking 1-2 MINUTES (sheesh)! Someone, probably from here mentioned Pale Moon as an alternative. Tried it and it is as though I have a new computer. Pale Moon has some quirks, but I can live with them for the speed I get. Seems to beat Chrome also, in this respect. I also like the look of Vivaldi, but haven't used it that much yet. Got Feedback?

Image: fotogestoeber/Shutterstock If the internet meltdown caused by a botnet called Mirai proves anything, it is that the tech industry is still on the back foot with hackers, and it has a moral duty to step up to the plate, writes John Kennedy. “Don’t be evil.” Those words are the corporate motto of Google, now a subsidiary of a company known as Alphabet. Alphabet is so named because it harks back to Google’s policy of taking big bets or “alpha bets” on things. Past examples have included acquiring such companies as YouTube and Nest for billions of dollars, and creating operating systems like Android for 80pc of the world’s smartphones. It also makes big things on solar energy, driverless cars and internet-emitting balloons. On a rainy day in Killarney in 2009, then CEO of Google Eric Schmidt – who flew his own jet to the nearby airport for a big team meet with Google’s Irish workforce – was asked about those words. Schmidt said that if Google even just once betrayed the trust it had with its users, it was game over. That same reasoning is why I believe Apple CEO Tim Cook stubbornly resisted attempts by the FBI to unlock the encryption on the iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino killers, because it would betray a principle of privacy and an understanding between the company and its customers. And yet, as I observed the damage caused on Friday by a botnet called Mirai (which launched tens of millions of denial of service (DDoS) attacks against a hosting firm called Dyn, taking some of the biggest internet brands offline), I reflected. ‘We are now in the realm of shadow IT where the internet and devices from fridges to phones and thermostats are all connected to clouds of clouds, and organisations don’t know what apps employees are downloading, and businesses are buying services without talking to IT. The truth is IT can’t control any bit of technology anymore’ – TERRY GREER-KING The malware was the creation of a hacker known as Anna-senpai and its source code was released into the wild in recent weeks. It is known for causing the high-profile attacks on infosec writer Brian Krebs of Krebs on Security, as well as French hosting provider OVH, sending data at levels never seen before. The malware effectively finds internet of things (IoT) devices and hardware, such as insecure CCTV cameras and DVR players, and uses them to mount attacks on websites, flooding them with traffic to make them inaccessible. Imagine hundreds of thousands of people trying to enter through the front door of a single shop on Grafton Street at the same time – you get the picture. In this way, some of the biggest internet brands from Amazon to Spotify and Twitter were taken offline by an attack of machines connected to the internet. The future is scary, but we are the ones designing it We live in a tremendous era of innovation and science – a time that some people have compared to Florence during the Renaissance. Impressive advances in biotech are rivalled only by advances in technology such as artificial intelligence, big data, neural networks, machine learning; machines that can heel, see and think for themselves. However, the fact that these very machines are being enlisted to attack – due to lax security measures and components – makes the Renaissance metaphor a lie. This is more like Florence during the Great Plague and not only that, but the Golden Horde is also at the gates. The point I am making is that the tech industry is proceeding at a speed of knots; innovating and selling stuff to keep shareholders happy, but not cleaning up the bigger mess left in its wake. This is contributing to advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence undoubtedly designed to sell, sell and sell, but we should be turning those advances onto the bigger problem itself: data security. The tech industry created the products, but has not solved the security problem. Maybe it never will, but if the Mirai attack has proven anything, it is that the tech industry is inexorably pushing the world into a frightening future where the gap in the cat and mouse game between hackers and security researchers is only going to widen. All in the name of progress. Perhaps the hackers themselves are trying to tell us something. There will be 50bn IoT connected devices on the planet by 2030, according to Cisco. How many of these will be truly secure? I spoke with PwC’s global cyber leader Grant Waterfall last week and he pointed out that some medical device makers are working on products including IoT connected stents and pacemakers. If hackers can already hack vehicles like Elon Musk’s Tesla or the Cherokee Jeep and take control, jamming the brakes whilst the vehicle is in motion, what if they could stop hearts too? That might sound incredulous but I don’t think so. The new face of evil might be invisible If you read the history of the 20th century (especially the various world and proxy war), a recurrent theme is the banality of evil behind massacres and atrocities. From Ukraine in 1941 to Cambodia in 1973 and Srebrenica in 1995, many of the perpetrators were neighbours who knew their victims, and perhaps drank or ate with them in more peaceful times. The shocking truth of the violence of 20th century Earth was the perceived ordinariness of the people behind the attacks. In the 21st century world, if you are being attacked online, you may never see the face of your attacker. The commonality of a component in that attack, from a CCTV camera to a DVR or maybe even a toaster, may never cross your mind. A computer being hacked or enlisted to form a DDoS attack might not seem as big a crime as the taking of a life, but what if one day a cyberattack costs lives? A car being hacked is one example. Let’s not forget that US and Israeli secret services created the Stuxnet worm ostensibly to target the SCADA and PLC systems that managed Iranian nuclear plants. Instead, the worm went wild and threatened utility services like water and electricity plants around the world. The same systems are used to run rail services across the world. Tech firms have a moral duty to close the gap between the hackers and their old and new technologies. We now live in a world where it seems Russia is deliberately tampering with the US elections, with Russian natives allegedly behind the hacking of the Democratic National Party’s systems. We live in a world where hackers are making a fortune from ransomware, by holding systems to ransom after an individual clicks on a phishing link. According to Kaspersky Labs, 40pc of businesses targeted in this way pay out. A Data Solutions survey reported that 20pc of Irish firms hit by ransomware have also paid out. We live in a world where teenage boys are asking girls to share compromising photos of themselves via Snapchat or WhatsApp, only to later share them publicly with their friends and ultimately wider society. We live in a world where people who have shared images of themselves with strangers online have been tapped for money, and instead some took a different solution – suicide. Cybersecurity is already costing lives. Data science and the moral responsibility of the tech world My point is that the tech world is pushing out new technologies all the time, encouraging punters to buy, or sign up, or sign their rights away. And while all of this is happening, a porous world is emerging where attacks on people and things can come from any direction, on any device. Earlier this year, while we were looking at the Future of Security, Terry Greer-King, the director of cybersecurity at Cisco UK and Ireland, put it clearly: “We are now in the realm of shadow IT where the internet and devices from fridges to phones and thermostats are all connected to clouds of clouds, and organisations don’t know what apps employees are downloading, and businesses are buying services without talking to IT. “The truth is IT can’t control any bit of technology anymore.” And yet the tech industry is booming, urging companies to buy more and more platforms, get their workers better connected, and turning us all on to the promise of the digital, connected home. Greer-King pointed out the industry average for detecting a breach is 100 days, long after this damage has been done. In a world where thousands – if not millions – of devices can be marshalled on the whim of a hacker, this is not good enough. It is the job of tech companies to innovate in order to create products people want. But that should come with a moral responsibility to ensure those devices and services are better protected. Yes, advances in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence are wonderful, but perhaps they could be employed to fight the infosec fight first? Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg loves artificial intelligence, it’s his new toy. But if the same Mark Zuckerberg can be pictured with security tape over the camera and mic of his personal MacBook, should he not also be sharing these personal security tips with the 1.5bn people who use Facebook every month? What do you know Mark, that you are not telling the hundreds of millions of punters who flock to your site every day? Perhaps Zuckerberg wants a personal robot butler in five years’ time and by all means, he is welcome to achieve that – but shouldn’t those incredible advances in AI and data science be enlisted to better protect people too? If Facebook can amass 1.5bn users who willingly sign away their privacy, then with that comes a massive moral responsibility. This is true too for Microsoft, Apple, Intel and many other companies that have shaped our present. Maybe Facebook is working on an AI-based security platform that will protect people and their data in this new machine-based world. If Facebook isn’t, then it should be. The machines are coming. Ultimately, their job is to make our lives better, and augment and enhance our world. They should not take our jobs or intrude. But it seems the hackers have the upper hand, and they are doing a better job at reminding the world about that fact than the tech giants are. Evil is what happens when good people stand aside and do nothing. Remember, don’t be evil.

Vegan. Think. Eat. Thrive.™ News Food Planet Travel Buzz Avocado Tops Superfoods Google Search Queries By Anna Starostinetskaya | October 24, 2016 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Google analytics reveal avocado, kale, and turmeric are hot searches around the country. A new search report compiled by digital marketing agency Search Laboratory uncovered the most frequently searched superfoods in the United States. The report relied on data from Google trends and Google’s Keyword Planner function to determine the location and frequency of searches. With an average of 49,500 searches per month nationwide, avocado topped the list of the top 10 keyword searches, with kale and turmeric not far behind—40,500 and 33,100 searches, respectively. Coconut and almond both appear on the top 10 list, which researchers indicate is related to “a resurgence of dairy-free alternatives.” Similarly, the report places flax at number nine on the list with 5,400 monthly searches, linking its popularity to the superfood’s use as an egg replacer in vegan baking. When broken down by location, the report identified ten cities with the most searched for superfoods. Residents of Portland, OR search for superfoods the most—with turmeric being the most frequent food search in the city—followed by Seattle, WA, where the favorite superfood search is kale. Three California cities—Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco—made the list with turmeric, avocado, and flax topping the searches in those cities, respectively.

Image: Julia Kuznetsova/Shutterstock So you want to become a citizen scientist but with the minimal amount of effort expended? Well then, these five citizen science apps should be a good place to start. The power held in our pocket in the form of smartphones isn’t there solely to take a series of funny Snapchat images, but is actually an unlikely citizen scientist toolkit. After all, most smartphones these days are jam-packed full of sensors, cameras, microphones and processors that can combine to churn out valuable data, either for yourself or on your behalf for an organisation. Companies like Google and Apple have already realised the potential for their devices as mass harvesters of data – not including the information used to target you with specified advertising – with their own citizen science-like projects. One example is Apple rolling out ResearchKit to help researchers use health data obtained from iPhones for the benefit of solving medical conditions through metadata. But being a citizen scientist is not all about giving your data to major conglomerates; sometimes it can be just for you, or a voluntary research organisation. To get you started, here are five tools that you can download for your smartphone. Google Science Journal If you are an Android user, the first app you should definitely download is Science Journal. The free app was launched last May as a tool that uses sensors to measure your environment, like light and sound, so you can graph your data, record your experiments, and organise your questions and ideas. All of the information is trackable in real time and – most importantly – presents it in an easy-to-read format for beginners. If you want to make the app even more capable, you can buy a number of different kits – including additional internet of things sensors – to bring you from beginner to expert in no time. Science Journal app. Image: Google NASA GLOBE Observer Launched only last August, NASA’s latest free app on Android and iOS lets outdoorsy types make the best use of their time spent looking up at the expansive sky. In the initial release of the app, users can collect observations of clouds, which are a critical part of the global climate system. Once you collect environmental observations with the app, they are sent to the GLOBE data and information system, for use by scientists and students studying the Earth. Your observations can also be used for your own investigations and to interact with a vibrant community of individuals from around the world who care about Earth system science and our global environment. From a meteorological perspective, ground-up views from citizen scientists are valuable in validating and understanding satellite observations. It is certainly not a bad way to spend a hike. The new NASA GLOBE Observer app allows anyone to become a citizen scientist by collecting observations of clouds. Image: NASA GLOBE Observer BOINC This strange-sounding app is the one-stop shop for anyone interested in giving over some processing power to astronomers searching for alien life in the universe. Not only that, but a number of different research organisations have signed up, including Yoyo@Home, World Community Grid, PrimeGrid, Enigma@Home, OProject@Home, theSkyNet POGS, Asteroids@home, and Einstein@Home. This means that a citizen scientist can use their phone or tablet to study diseases, predict global warming or even discover pulsars. Thankfully for users, BOINC computes only when the Android device is plugged in and charged, meaning it won’t run down your battery. Also, all data is transferred over Wi-Fi, so your phone bill won’t be enormous after using it. You literally don’t have to lift a finger to use it once it’s up and running. Decodoku What if you could do your part for quantum science simply by playing a free mobile game on your smartphone? Well, then you might want to get your hands on a game called Decodoku that is free on Android, iOS and desktop browsers. Developed by Dr James Wootton, the app is aiming to be a crowdsourced solution to solving quantum error correction. It will go towards helping him and other computer science researchers to make better and more effective quantum computers. In the same way that an error or ‘bit flip’ can occur in a binary systems of one and zeros, similar bit flips can occur in quantum bits that can be one, zero or both at the same time. Thankfully, you don’t need to be a computer scientist to play the game based on making the most amount of moves possible on a board before everything seizes up. At the end of the day, you’re playing a completely free game and aiding science, so what have you to lose? Micro-litter app monitoring app While currently still in a testing phase, one interesting way you can do your part for citizen science while also getting in a nice walk along the coast is to download a micro-litter app from the organisation Coastwatch. The idea behind the app is to use peoples’ mobile phones to photograph and chart examples of micro-litter – miniaturised pieces of plastic and other litter found in the sea – and send it back to the organisation to chart its abundance. This can range from identifying plastic pellet spills at sea, to places where the sea shreds macro into micro litter. You can check out the global information gathered globally so far, however, most results have been catalogued in Ireland.

(Photo by NEC Corporation of America with Creative Commons license) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains October 24, 2016 AI, like all software, isn’t immune to being hacked. In recent months, security researchers have shown that machine learning algorithms can be reverse-engineered and made to expose user data, like personal photos or health data. So how can we protect that information? New research from OpenAI and Google shows a way to build AI that never sees personal data, but is able to function as if it had. Ian Goodfellow, a researcher at OpenAI, compares the system to medical school. “The doctors who teach in medical school have learned everything they know from decades of experience working with specific individual people, and as a side effect they know a lot of private medical histories,” Goodfellow says. “But they can show the student how to practice medicine without divulging all of that history.” The “student” algorithm, which will be exposed to the world, learns to mimic decisions of its teachers through millions of simulated decisions, but doesn’t have any of the underlying information used to inform the teacher algorithms. The teachers exist only to teach the student—they never see the light of day. The student algorithm also learns from nonsensitive, public data to fine tune results and further obscure the teachers’ data points. OpenAI and Google’s work builds on previous research that taught a student algorithm using multiple teacher algorithms, but makes the process faster and less reliant on teachers, meaning more secure. They have also released the code for others to adapt their system. What makes reverse-engineering the algorithm even harder is the fact that there’s not just one teacher. In tests, researchers trained up to 250 teachers for one student algorithm, meaning the student doesn’t rely on any one sensitive data point, but an aggregate of information. Even if the AI was reverse-engineered, the research claims, an attacker couldn’t get any information from it. Goodfellow’s medical school analogy works well because this system could be especially beneficial in developing medical AI by crowdsourcing information across hospitals, while keeping patient records private. An algorithm could learn from each individual hospital’s data, like radiology scans or patient data, and a student AI could automatically learn from the network of hospitals. Companies like Google could also use this technology to learn from their users’ photos, without ever having to see them. Now, AI is trained on each user’s photos, but that AI is limited to the user’s account. A technique similar to this research could set each user’s AI as a teacher, to train a much more accurate student for Google’s Photos app, which automatically recognizes faces and objects. This approach is a kind of differential privacy, which seeks to keep individual user information safe when it’s in a large database. For instance, anonymizing patient data in hospitals is a weaker form of differential privacy. “Differential privacy addresses the paradox of learning nothing about an individual while learning useful information about a population,” write Cynthia Dwork of Microsoft Research and Aaron Roth of University of Pennsylvania in their book on the subject. This is the tightrope that differential privacy walks: Accuracy against privacy. The better an algorithm mimics its teacher, the higher the possibility it can betray its teacher’s data. “All the research in this space explores a tension between privacy and utility, as more privacy means utility goes down,” says Thomas Ristenpart, a machine learning security researcher, in an email to Quartz. Despite this tradeoff, Goodfellow says they’ve gotten the student AI to perform within 2% of the teachers, down from 5% of the previous state of the art.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 24 October 2016 | MYT 2:30 PM Thai junta says Google removing content with royal insults Highly sensitive mourning period: Google affirmed in the meeting with the Thai Deputy Prime Minister that it would continue to help the government remove content deemed to insult the country's monarchy from YouTube, he said. — EPA BANGKOK: Thailand’s government met with representatives from Internet giant Google, amid growing calls from Thai hardline royalists to bring those who insult the monarchy to justice, as many Thais look with uncertainty to a future without their revered king.  King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s death on Oct 13 has thrown the country of 67 million into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups who say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand.  Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met with Google representatives in Bangkok on Oct 21. Google affirmed in the meeting that it would continue to help the government remove content from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, that it deemed offensive, he said.  "If any website is inappropriate they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found," Prajin told reporters.  That conforms with Google's practice around the world, Alphabet Inc's Google says.  "We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies," a Google spokesperson in California told Reuters on Friday.  "When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it’s illegal after a thorough review."  Named and shamed  Thailand's military government said on Oct 18 it was tracking people suspected of insulting the monarchy following the king’s death and would ask other countries to extradite them.  Some critics of the monarchy living abroad have been named and shamed in Thai language web forums. Outside the world of the web, some Thais who have chosen not to wear black, the official colour of mourning, have been publicly jeered at.  Thailand's military government has tried to seek tighter censorship of social media from Facebook, Google and Japan-based instant messenger service LINE since it came to power in 2014 following a coup it said was necessary to restore peace to the country following months of unrest.  Thailand's royal insult law, known as Article 112 in the criminal code, makes it a crime to insult the king, queen, heir or regent. Those who are found guilty face up to 15 years in prison.  The law has curtailed public discussion about the monarchy's role and its future following the death of King Bhumibol who ruled for seven decades and was seen as a unifying figure.  Since taking power in 2014, the junta, known officially as the National Council for Peace and Order, has taken a tough stance on dissenters.  It has come under strong criticism from the international community for lengthy and unprecedented prison sentences handed down by military courts against civilians for violating the lese-majeste law since the junta took power.  The military government has repeatedly rejected accusations of rights violations. — Reuters You May Be Interested Tech up your cooking After Airbnb and Uber, wardrobe rental services could be the next travel trend EU questions US over Yahoo e-mail scanning, amid privacy concerns Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

It is an artificial neural network — a series of simple algorithms linked together, in an approximation of the neurons in a mammal’s brain. Programmers gave Deep Dream a curious task: not to analyze photos like other recognition software, but to over-interpret the images. Google engineers likened Deep Dream to the children’s game of spotting shapes in the clouds. Where Google explored artificially intelligent reveries, MIT researchers are now wondering, just in time for Halloween, whether an algorithm could generate night terrors. The artificial intelligence is called the Nightmare Machine. And true to its name, it’s creepy. Google, like its “don’t be evil” former motto, did not aim for horror show. Under Deep Dream’s influence, photographs of trees were reworked into church steeples. The network reinterpreted leaves as birds. Faces and almost everything else became rainbow dogs, as though Timothy Leary awoke from the dead and shambled into the Westminster show. [Deep Dreaming: ‘Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas’] Because Google raised the program on a steady diet of animal photographs, the neural network was inclined to see canines, birds and walleyed fish where there were none. The patterns it produced were psychedelic and could be disturbing, though the cute critters curbed the eeriness of the computer’s hallucinations. There are no multihued puppies to redeem the hellscapes produced by the Nightmare Machine. That’s because the algorithm was trained for one purpose — horror. The Nightmare Machine goes to work on the Colosseum. (MIT Nightmare Machine. Original image via Flickr. CC 2.0 license.) This new artificial intelligence infuses images with tendrils, as though inky veins or creeping roots had taken over the world’s landmarks. The Nightmare Machine blackens skies. Human faces warp and turn blood red. A shot of the second presidential debate is remixed into Trump and Clinton standing on a dais of skeletons. Second Debate A photo posted by Nightmare Machine (@nightmare_machine) on Oct 9, 2016 at 10:33pm PDT The Nightmare Machine is one of the few, if not the first, “deep-learning” systems designed to evoke fear. The sinister features it produces are the result of what MIT Media Lab researcher Pinar Yanardag Delul called a “nightmarifying” process, she said in an email. Where Google primed Deep Dream to see animals, MIT’s training course for the Nighmare Machine was more ominous. “We use state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to learn what haunted houses, ghost towns or toxic cities look like,” Yanardag Delul said. The algorithm extracts elements — such as a bruised-black palette — from these scary templates and implants them in the landmarks. Nightmare Machine is at White House 🎃🤖🎃 A photo posted by Nightmare Machine (@nightmare_machine) on Oct 22, 2016 at 1:10am PDT The MIT scientists argued the Nightmare Machine represented more than an exercise in making bizarre photographs. “Our research group’s main goal is to understand the barriers between human and machine cooperation,” MIT’s Iyad Rahwan said in an email. “Over the past two years, we’ve seen a rising number of intellectuals and luminaries raising alarms about the potential threat of superintelligent AI on humanity. Pioneer and inventor Elon Musk famously said that as we develop AI, we are ‘summoning the demon.’” Even in the abstract, in other words, artificial intelligence can be scary. But Yanardag Delul and her colleagues, including Rahwan, wanted to know whether AI could creatively and purposefully unsettle humans. “Scholars have long commented on the phenomenon of the uncanny valley, which describes how people feel a sense of eeriness and revulsion at robots that appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings,” Yanardag Delul said. “But can AI elicit more powerful visceral reactions more akin to what we see in a horror movie?” A photo posted by Nightmare Machine (@nightmare_machine) on Oct 6, 2016 at 4:20pm PDT On the Nightmare Machine website, voters can rate images to teach the artificial intelligence to make faces even scarier. The MIT computer scientists recently analyzed the responses from 100,000 voters to discern which were the scariest. As far as the Nightmare Machine’s early success, results appear to be mixed. “Initial tallies reveal that humans quickly converge on finding some of them very scary,” MIT research scientist Manuel Cebrian wrote to The Post, “and others not at all.” You can decide for yourself. The top eight scary faces generated by the Nightmare Machine can be seen below. For those of us who admit that demonic facial expressions are unsettling — scroll down carefully. Or, as Yanardag Delul said, “Trigger warning goes here.”   (Courtesy of MIT Nightmare Machine) You can check out more of the AI’s creepy photos on the Nightmare Machine Instagram account.

Ever since their launch, the Pixel XL and Pixel, the most anticipated launches in the smartphone industry by Google, have taken the world by storm. Google has tied up with HTC to produce impressive devices that not only look premium but also have the technology arsenal to back the looks. The phones enter a heavily-contested market dominated by the likes of Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. However, what the Pixel XL brings onto the table is something consumers are eagerly waiting for. When I first unboxed the handset, the looks didn’t leave me spellbound. I was expecting a little more, like any other user does. Google has gone with a simple design with not too much cluttering on the hardware aspect. The phone has two speakers on the bottom separated by an USB-Type C charging socket in the middle. The sim slot is placed on the left, whereas the volume and power button are placed on the right. Unlike the older iPhone models, the Pixel XL does not have a homescreen button. The back panel consists of the camera on the left top corner and a fingerprint sensor in the middle.  What the device offers in terms of software is extremely fresh and enticing for any user. It keeps you hooked on for quite some time. Here are a few things to look forward to in the Pixel XL. Android Nougat Pixel XL runs on an original version of Android 7.1 Nougat. The phone is the first to have Google’s messaging service “Allo” and the video calling app “Duo” in-built. Competing with Apple’s 3D Touch, the phone has launcher shortcuts that enable a user to long-press on applications for menu options. Fingerprint sensor A fingerprint sensor is somewhat common now, with a host of Chinese smartphones having them. However, Pixel XL has the fastest sensor in my opinion. To top this, it also allows you to slide down notifications on the screen.  Camera Google has delivered impeccably when it comes to the camera. The 12.3 megapixel camera packs a punch. Ranging from landscape shots to close-up angles, from low light photos to selfies, the camera doesn’t disappoint you. The pictures have very few or no instance of pixelation, the clarity is immense and the depth is far superior to its compatriots. Google Assistance Apple has Siri, Amazon has Alexa and Microsoft brings in Cortana. So how is Google’s Assistance different? Unlike the rest, the Assistance, an artificial intelligence bot, helps you have a conversation with the phone. So if you want to find out the nearest Sushi eating joint, just ask Assistance and it’ll let you know from its vast database. And after every interaction, it suggests follow-up queries you can tap on to take the conversation forward. User Interface Google has played it simple. Unlike major android devices, the Pixel XL has a bottom-up menu with a search bar. The Google icon has been placed on the top left corner, which is different from the static Google search bar in all android devices. Specifications Backed with a 3,450 mAh Li-ion battery, the phone runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor. It has a 5.5-inch AMOLED display. The phone does not have an external memory card slot, but the 4GB RAM and 32/128GB internal storage compensates for it. Price The 128 GB model is available for Rs 76,000, while the 32GB model is for Rs 57,000 — prices as shown on e-commerce websites. Hands down, it is the best android phone ever in my opinion. Try your hand at it to believe it for yourself.

It looks like this is a year when manufacturers are inadvertently packing hardware mishaps into their devices. The main concern with the Pixel is that the microphone of the gadget stops working without notice. Tests are showing that the microphone is functional in most cases, but an unbeknownst reason causes it to fail, either right from the start or after some usage. A long Reddit thread is gathering users' experiences with the issue, and similar testimonials keep adding up. So far, it is unclear whether we are looking at a software or hardware problem. Techies are looking at hardware issues as the possible cause, since users have discovered that there are some tricks that can get the microphone to work in a predictable manner. One example would be turning the speakerphone on and off during voice calls which, some claim, makes the microphone consistently functional. Redditor CMDR_Crispies says that they had the same problem with the Nexus 6P, and speculates that the microphone issue could stem from noise cancellation going haywire. The Redditor also notes that his Google Pixel does not seem to pick up sound, except for the camera app, which works normally. It cannot be vouched that this trick will help every Google Pixel owner out there, but it is worth testing. Google says that it will offer replacement units to customers who are facing the microphone issue, so if your mic is failing more often than not, you might want to give customer support a call. Based on Redditors' experience, the company actually made good on the promise and was very prompt in sending exchange phones. "I ordered a replacement through them at 10:00 p.m. and had the phone in hand at 11:00 a.m. the next morning," Redditor wayfrae notes.

(Image: Debashis Sarkar/News18.com) After the iPhone 7 teardown, the team at iFixit has now worked their magic on the latest Google Pixel smartphone. The teardown by iFixit also revealed that the Pixel XL smartphone is a bit more difficult to repair than the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Interestingly, the Pixel XL is far easier to repair when compared to earlier Nexus 6P or the flagship Samsung Galaxy S7. Interestingly, the Google Pixel XL smartphone showcases modularity making it further easier to repair. “All of these small components can be replaced independently, and will be inexpensive replacement parts,” iFixit said.

Google’s Pixel smartphone… Good news! Google’s Pixel smartphone survives underwater longer than you can By Jon Martindale — October 21, 2016 9:24 AM Subscribe to this topic Subscribe on YouTube Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Google Pixel MSRP $649.00 DT Editors' Choice Learn More One of the more important features to come out of smartphone development in the past few years has been waterproofing. The bane of toilet droppers and careless swimmers the world over, water-sensitive electronics have always gone awry, but potential owners of Google’s Pixel phone need not worry, as it survived a 30-minute test under water without issue. The reason there was some concern with Google’s Pixel handset was because while many other smartphones are rated at IP68 or similar, the Pixel was only officially rated at IP53, which means it is almost impervious to dust, but that it is only really protected from water spray. In reality though it seems like Pixel is much better at protecting its internal hardware than that. In a test conducted by YouTuber Harris Craycraft (via Ubergizmo) we can see that the phone works fine in partial submersion, when sprayed with a hose and ultimately still worked just fine after being fully submerged for 30 minutes. Related: Google Pixel review To the original rating’s defense, the submersion was only in a couple of inches of water. To achieve the IPX7 rating for submersion, it needs to be able to handle being up to a meter below the surface for 30 minutes. It also needs to be able to withstand direct, high-pressure spray too. Even if this test doesn’t suggest that the Pixel should be rated as high as that, though, it does tell us that it is better at dealing with water than the rating suggests. If you own a Pixel or plan to in the future, you can rest assured that it should be fine if you spray it with the shower, or drop it in a puddle. It is probably still worth being careful should something like that happen — switching off the device and putting it in a bag full of absorbent material — but regardless, the Pixel is better at handling water than most people expected.

US copyright chief was assigned to shop till, tweeting BlackBerry DTEK60: An elegant flagship for grown-ups A curious story appeared overnight, one that made Samsung look very foolish. According to anti-copyright activist and blogger Mike Masnick, Google's YouTube had received a copyright takedown notice from Samsung requesting that game videos featuring the Samsung Note 7 as a weapon be removed. A few hours later the video was restored – along with many other very amusing Grand Theft videos (in this one, the gamer takes out a helicopter – very impressive work). But not before a host of sites had dutifully copy-and-pasted the story. Step forward: BBC News, The Verge, The Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph. One or two were cautious and put "blocks" in inverted commas, which meant that it may or may not be true, and they didn't know for sure. Our advice on a Mike Masnick blog post is that if it tells you the sky is blue and the grass is green, you'll still want to check for yourself. It isn't even possible to establish whether there ever was a DMCA notice, let alone – if there was – who sent it. Perhaps someone at YouTube had an itchy finger. What is certain, however, is that Google is emerging as a major rival in smartphones to Samsung, and hopes to profit from the Korean chaebol's misfortunes. Google's first Pixel phones have appeared just in time to take advantage of the Note 7 recall. The recall has seen the Note 7 flagship snuffed out and Samsung estimates the recall will incur $2.3bn in immediate costs. But it could be higher: some forty per cent of Samsung customers say they will not buy another Samsung phone. Estimates of Google's marketing expenditure for Pixel run into hundreds of millions of dollars. This raises the possibility that Google is leveraging the enormous media influence of its video monopoly to help along its consumer hardware business, which – let's face it – hasn't exactly set the world on fire (like the Note 7 tried to). And helping that cause is someone already named on Google's "shill list" – the list of people Google had paid to help the corporate cause. (The latter link provides a useful introduction to Masnick's modus operandi.) Perhaps there's an innocent explanation – and it is all a spooky coincidence. We've asked Google for more details on the takedown that may or may not exist, but which if it did, Google is ignoring anyway.

Markets had been hoping a meeting next month by producers would agree an output deal to support the sliding oil price. Opec announced plans last month to cut output, but details of how it would reach this target and how much individual producer countries would cut were expected at a meeting in Vienna in November. But comments from Iraq over the weekend added to the general uncertainty as to whether any agreement could be reached after all.

October 24, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.41pm EDT 12:41 Jennifer Rankin Here’s our report on the latest developments in the EU-Canada trade deal. Jennifer Rankin writes: The European Union’s hopes of signing a free-trade agreement with Canada this week appear to have gone up in smoke, after Belgium announced it could not sign the treaty because of opposition from regional parliaments. The collapse of the talks highlights the pitfalls that may await the British government when it seeks to negotiate a trade deal with the EU after Brexit. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, announced on Monday that Belgium was not ready to sign the EU-Canada trade pact, following emergency talks between the country’s federal and regional leaders. The Belgian stalemate means Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is expected to postpone a trip to Brussels this Thursday, when he was due to sign the treaty. Officials are assessing how the trade pact can be revived, but next steps remained unclear. Donald Tusk, the head of the European council, is due to speak to Trudeau later on Monday. Tusk had given Belgium an ultimatum of Monday night to sort out its problems, but emergency talks in Brussels in the afternoon showed the treaty remained stuck. Paul Magnette, Wallonia’s minister-president, who has led opposition to the deal, said his position had not changed. He had failed to show up for crisis talks with the European commission on Sunday, according to Michel.

But, partly due to mixed UK factory orders, the FTSE 100 has failed to hold on to early gains, and ended below the 7000 level. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE’s early gains have turned to ashes, with the index falling into the red over the course of the afternoon. Both the US and Europe have trimmed their gains, but the fall for London’s chief index is the standout feature of the day. Now that the pound has stopped its freefall (for now at least), perhaps the index as a whole is beginning to look a tad overpriced. Certainly, it has shown little inclination to get back to its recent highs, with ongoing Brexit uncertainty making the UK less attractive versus a eurozone economy that appears, on the basis of today’s PMI numbers, to be looking much more attractive. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 34.07 points or 0.49% at 6986.40 Germany’s Dax rose 0.47% to 10,761.17 France’s Cac climbed 0.36% to 4552.58 Italy’s FTSE MIB was up 0.81% to 17,305.77 Spain’s Ibex ended 1.27% better at 9216.2 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 593.13 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 76 points or 0.42%. Meanwhile the pound is down 0.25% at $1.22 and a similar amount lower against the euro at €1.1206.

Speaking in parliament she said: “I share everyone’s disappointment in the stalled talks between the EU and Canada.” But she said the problems would not have a bearing on the UK’s own negotiations about leaving the European Union, saying the UK was not seeking to replicate an existing model but build its own.

Helped by M&A deals and better than expected manufacturing data for October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 0.47% while in Europe Germany’s Dax is 0.8% higher and France’s Cac has climbed 0.65%. But after an early increase the FTSE 100 has fallen by 0.37% and is now back below the 7000 level in the wake of mixed data from the CBI. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets [are] continuing to be propelled by the day’s better than expected PMI readings. The US was the latest to chip in with a decent manufacturing release this Monday, the flash figure coming in at an 11 month high of 53.2 against the 51.6 forecast. This ended up helping out both the dollar and the Dow Jones; the former took 0.1% off the pound, while the latter jumped nearly 100 points after the bell to approach 18250. Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC held onto their morning growth, the German and French indices rising 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. The FTSE, meanwhile, remained the Western anomaly, slipping by 0.2% as investors continued to react to this morning’s troublesome CBI industrial order expectations slide. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.05am EDT 10:05 More from Reuters on Belgium’s failure to agree the EU-Canada trade deal: “We cannot give a yes,” Paul Magnette, the premier of the Wallonia region, told reporters as he emerged. He said the main problems remained not with Ottawa, which has already agreed to modifications in the deal, but with the EU authorities. Other Socialist-led regions, including bilingual capital Brussels, are ranged behind the Walloons, while Dutch- and German-speakers back Michel’s liberal-led federal coalition: “We have a Yes from the federal, Flemish and German-speaking communities and it’s a No from the others,” said Flanders premier Geert Bourgeois after the meeting at Michel’s residence lasting less than an hour. “It’s a real shame,” the center-right leader said. “We’re the laughing stock of the whole world. It’s bad for Wallonia, for Flanders, for Belgium, for Europe, for the whole world.” Michel said it was too early to say Ceta was dead and that the Walloons and he were still open to dialogue but that he must inform Tusk that Belgium was not in a position to consent now to a deal that all 27 other EU member states are ready to support... Ceta supporters say it would increase trade between the partners by 20 percent and boost the EU economy by 12 billion euros ($13 billion) a year and Canada’s by C$12 billion (US $9 billion). Walloons have concerns about the threat of surging pork and beef imports from Canada and an independent court system to settle disputes between states and foreign investors, which critics say allows multinationals to dictate public policy. Many EU leaders suspect the local government in Namur is using its devolved powers to play domestic politics. Dutch language Flemish newspaper De Morgen said on Monday that the Magnette’s stance was both a matter of principle and opportunism, a chance to boost his reputation and to become leader of the center-left in Belgium. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.55am EDT 09:55 Strong domestic demand is one key factor behind the better than expected US PMI figures, according to IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson. He said: Manufacturing showed further signs of pulling out of the malaise seen earlier in the year, starting the fourth quarter on a solid footing. Both output and new orders are rising at the fastest rates for a year amid increasingly widespread optimism that demand will pick up again after the presidential election, which has been commonly cited as a key factor that has subdued spending and investment in recent months. There are also signs that the drag from cost-cutting policies of deliberate inventory reduction is moving into reverse. Inventory-building should therefore provide an extra boost to the economy in the fourth quarter. Weak export growth, attributable to the strong dollar, and lacklustre hiring remain big areas of disappointment, and highlight an ongoing dependency on domestic demand and a need to keep labour costs low amid a still-uncertain economic and political outlook.

This is the highest manufacturing PMI figure since October 2015. The better than expected figure adds to the idea that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year, pushing the dollar higher and US Treasury bond prices lower.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google Pixel XL Review A pixel is defined as the smallest addressable element in an all points addressable display device. Essentially speaking, it is the smallest component of a much bigger picture. There’s a case to be made that Google really couldn’t have named their new phones better. Where the Nexus phones were accessible devices for developers and enthusiasts to get a taste of Google’s take on Android, the Pixel and Pixel XL are expected to be the torch bearers of Google’s vision for the future of smartphone computing. They are positioned to be hidden away in the background and behave simply like the smallest yet most important element in getting things done for you. Does it succeed at getting anywhere close to this grand dream? Much closer than you’d think.  Google Pixel XL specifications 5.5-inch  (2560×1440 pixels) AMOLED display with Gorilla Glass 4 protection 2.15 GHz Quad-Core Snapdragon 821 processor with Adreno 530 GPU 4GB RAM, 32GB / 128GB internal storage Android 7.1 (Nougat) Fingerprint sensor 12.3MP rear camera with LED flash, Sony IMX378 sensor, 1.55umpixel, f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, LDAF 8MP front camera 3 microphones, 3.5mm audio jack Dimensions: 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.6 mm; Weight: 168g 4G VoLTE, WiFi 802.11ac 2x2MIMO (2.4/5 GHz), Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, USB Type-C, NFC 3450mAh battery Video Review Design With the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google seemingly wants to take the focus away from how the phone looks and instead focus on how it feels both physically and in terms of experience. This is well emphasised in how the front fascia is quite literally a blank featureless slate. Looked at from the front, the Pixel could be any Android phone, well any HTC made Android phone. As we pointed out earlier though, that seems to be part and parcel of Google’s approach towards the phone wherein the focus is on what lies inside. The 5.5 inch Quad HD display on the Pixel XL that we have here lies within an island of white plastic. Gorilla Glass 4 protection is present to protect the phone from scratches during everyday use. An island of white plastic is a rather apt description too given the massive bezels above and to the sides of the phone. The pronounced lip below the screen in particular is somewhat off-putting as it hardly adds anything to the functionality or aesthetics of the hardware. Up above the screen is an array of sensors while the 8MP front facing camera is located at the far left corner. Being manufactured by HTC, there are more than subtle design throwbacks hidden in plain sight on the Pixel. Case in point being the thick chamfered edges that seem to take cues from the HTC 10. The edges of the phone curves over softly with delicate balance. The Pixel is not aiming to be the daintiest phone around, that crown has already been claimed by the Moto Z. No, the Pixel / Pixel XL feel chunky to the touch in a positively endearing way. The phone feels good to hold, there are no sharp corners yet there’s enough grip to make sure you won’t slip it. There’s a grippy volume power switch on the upper left side while below it is the single volume rocker. Both are metal keys with excellent feedback. The left is where the nano SIM card tray is located. No, you don’t get Dual SIM or microSD functionality. At the top of the phone, aligned to the left is the 3.5mm audio jack while the right side has an antenna band running through. The bottom of the Pixel has a centred USB Type C port with speaker port holes on either side. The stereo speaker ports are mostly for aesthetic purposes as the phone packs in only a mono speaker. iPhones stand out in a way that you can recognise them from afar. Same goes for Samsung’s phones that despite offering a degree of homogeneity in design within their own portfolio, are certainly easy to identify in a crowd. Where the front of the Pixel was borderline drab and generic, the rear kicks things up a notch. A white plastic panel seamlessly melds into the metallic rear of the phone. It’s a simple flourish but one that instantly makes the phone stand out. Beyond looks, the plastic window also acts as a way to allow RF signals to reach the internals. The Nexus Imprint fingerprint scanner lines up along the bottom edge of the plastic panel, within easy reach of your index finger. The rear camera module, dual LED flash as well as microphones line up along the top left edge of the white pane. A simple G near the bottom of the phone indicates through and through that this is a Google phone. In fact nowhere does the phone indicate that it has been manufactured by and in collaboration with HTC. This is a sharp departure from Nexus phones where the OEM of the hardware shared equal limelight. Google has clearly leveraged HTC’s know how in making ergonomic designs and that shows up brilliantly in the Pixel.The phone feels sturdy , very comfortable to hold and weighs just 168g despite its full metal build. Let’s be honest, the Google Pixel isn’t the most striking handset out there. Then again, the Pixel’s purpose is way more than just being a hardware showcase. It is supposed to become part and parcel of your lifestyle instead of becoming the focus of it. The design is utilitarian to a point and is meant to simply become a part of your daily routine. Software Stock Android. Pure & Simple. The Pixel XL & Pixel run an absolutely un-adulterated, virgin build of Android 7.1 with a few niceties thrown in for good measure. Unlike the Nexus phones which were just carriers of bleeding edge software for developers and savvy customers, the Pixel is a consumer device that Google hopes will make a dent within the Android ecosystem that it helped spawn. On that note, it is the first time where a phone blessed by Google carries features that shall remain exclusive to it. While a full run down of Android 7.1 deserves its own review (coming soon), for now we’ll focus on some key aspects of the software onboard the Pixel. Built from scratch, the Pixel phones herald the launch of the aptly named Pixel launcher. Exclusive to the phones for now, it is a different enough approach to the interface that long time Android users might be put off for a bit. Replacing the traditional app drawer is a swipe up gesture that reveals all the applications installed on the device. Thankfully it doesn’t take too long to get used to the gesture. What DOES take getting used to is the Google Now on Tap shortcut. We’ve become really accustomed to calling up Google Now by long pressing the home button. The same shortcut on the Pixel brings up the Google Assistant. The default interaction mechanic here is to use your voice to interact with Google’s all-powerful assistant and we couldn’t see any obvious way to switch this to a more inconspicuous text-based interaction. Getting to the regular card based Google Now screen requires a simple swipe to the right from the home screen. Google Assistant can also be activated by using the familiar ‘Ok Google’ command from anywhere in the UI and also when the display is switched off. The Assistant feature uses the same AI engine for conversations as Google Now or the chatbot built into Allo, so you can easily get a taste of the functionality without being on the Pixel. How well does it work? We’ve come a long way from the days of simple weather report queries. Google Assistant is capable of much more complex tasks ranging from creating and presenting calendar entries to performing essential conversions and even doing a bit of fact-finding. Google Assistant is also capable of building up conversations based on your previous query so you can ask contextual information as well. Using Google Assistant while driving to play tracks on Spotify using voice commands fast turned into a favorite function of ours. Your own mileage will vary a bit depending on how thick your accent is but for the most part, Google has does extensive work to make sure Google Now / Google Assistant works well with Indian accents. There’s support for a range of sensor based gestures built into Android and the phone but there’s one that is entirely unique to the Google Pixel. You can now swipe down / up on the fingerprint scanner to bring down or push up the notification shade. Other tweaks and additions include new round icons that are unique to the Pixel launcher. There’s a new night mode built into the phone that can automatically activate on a schedule. This operates similar to flux and cuts down blue light from the display to ease the strain on your eyes. Additionally, we’ve the addition of a feature that has been a mainstay of OEM skins for ages now. With Android 7.1, stock Android finally gets a reboot button. There are several more tweaks and additions that we’re discovering as we use the phone and we’ll be sure to update this space as and when there’s more to report on that front. Performance The Pixel XL is the fastest Android phone you can get your hands on right now. Period. Whatever you throw at it, no matter what you are doing with the device, it simply flies. That’s not all that hard to imagine either with a top of the line Snapdragon 821 processor clocked at 2.15Ghz under the hood. This is paired with 4GB of RAM, a number that might feel slightly skimpy with the recent spate of phones launching with 6GB of RAM onboard. That said, the RAM should be more than sufficient for the foreseeable future. In every day use, it is really hard to tax the device and even demanding games work smoother than we’ve experienced on any other Android phone. The bloat free software build can certainly lay claim to boosting the performance as it frees up additional computing resources. All is not hunky dory though as we observed that taxing applications can cause the phone to heat up quite a bit. Now this is part and parcel of all modern hardware and the phone cools down very quickly but we feel it is certainly worth keeping in mind. Additionally, we came across a range of applications, most notable being Apple Music, that are not entirely compatible with Android 7.1 yet. This causes wake lock errors and can also shoot up CPU usage which drains out the battery and heats up the phone too. We expect these issues to be solved over the coming weeks. Really though, the Pixel / Pixel XL is a butter smooth device. Between the highly optimised touch response, flagship grade hardware and a clean software build, the Pixel XL elegantly punches through whatever you need it to do and then some. Synthetic benchmarks don’t really do justice here since the experience is markedly improved over practically every other Android phone but we’ve included some key benchmarks nonetheless for your perusal. In the 3DMark Ice Storm benchmark, the Pixel XL scored 24613 points. In the AnTuTu 6 benchmark, the phone is very competitive with a score of 130219 points. In the Vellamo Chrome benchmark, the phone scores 4978 points. Finally in Basemark OS II, the phone scores 2237 points. It is worth mentioning again that benchmark performance is usually not very indicative of how well a phone performs in every day use. Display A 5.5inch Quad HD AMOLED display adorns the front of the Pixel XL. Characteristic of AMOLED panels, the blacks are deep, the colors are punchy and saturated and viewing angles are excellent. Compared to the likes of the iPhone, the Pixel goes for visual appeal over visual accuracy. Where the expanded gamut and IPS panel on the iPhone is all about tack sharp accuracy with the trade-off being a duller image, the AMOLED display on the Pixel looks full of life and brings to life whatever media or game you are consuming. For media consumption, we feel the contrasty colors on the display of the Pixel XL will likely be more appealing to users. There’s almost no color shift even when viewing from extreme angles. The display very bright and is easily visible even outdoors despite a bright sun right above. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we were suitably impressed by how dim the phone can go. A pet peeve of mine is that phones these days don’t go dim enough to comfortably read in dimly lit conditions. The Pixel solves that concern and the added Night Mode is like icing on the cake. Camera Every year, we take leaps and bounds forward in terms of image quality. Every smartphone manufacturer claims that their phone takes the best images possible from a phone. Google too proclaimed that they have the camera on the Pixel / Pixel HD is the best you can get on a smartphone. For once we are inclined to believe them albeit with a few caveats. Both the Pixel phones pack a 12.3MP rear camera with LED flash, Sony IMX378 sensor, 1.55umpixel and f/2.0 aperture. You also get Phase Detection as well as Laser based auto focus. Unfortunately there’s no OIS onboard. The specs are however only part of the story. A large part of why the phone takes great photos is due to the software processing behind the scenes. While any camera can take good photos in bright lighting, the Pixel phones excel at low light and to a large extent this is due to the new and improved HDR+ mode. Unlike regular HDR, Google’s take on it takes several exposures with short exposure times and then stitches it all together in post to create a bright, noise free image that is also free of motion blur. In practise, the results are almost there. In the shot above you can see that both the subject and background are captured nice and bright despite the dim ambient lighting. Zoom in closely though and there’s a hint of blur. This was consistently spotted by us across HDR+ shots. The lack of optical image stabilisation really hurts in these shots though we’re really just nitpicking here. For the most part, the Pixel XL takes fantastic shots. The ability to lock exposure and focus independently akin to iOS is well appreciated though the lack of ISO controls was perplexing. In video mode, the phones can shoot up to 4K video. There’s electronic image stabilisation on offer here and it works remarkably well. Worth keeping in mind, Google is bundling in free full resolution backup for all photos and video shots with the Pixel devices. Connectivity & Battery Life The Pixel phones tick all the boxes when it comes to connectivity options. There’s 4G VoLTE onboard as well as WiFi 802.11ac 2x2MIMO (2.4/5 GHz). The plastic window at the back has certainly helped with radio performance and the phone held a signal in places where other phones completely dropped out. The phone is equipped with the latest Bluetooth 4.2 spec in addition to the usual suspects like GPS and NFC. The phone charges and supports data transfer over USB Type C. Expect really speedy transfers here as the phone supports USB 3.0. The phone ships in two SKUs with 32 or 128GB of storage. Our 32GB unit had about 24 GB free at first boot. While the phone doesn’t support microSD expansion, you can expand it via USB OTG. In fact, the phone ships with an adaptor that allows you to connect it to an iPhone or other device over OTG to transfer all your data when you set up your device. The Pixel XL is equipped with a 3,450mAh battery that works in tandem with optimisations made in Android 7.1 to deliver outstanding battery life. With extensive messaging, camera usage and a bit of calls thrown in, we could easily last over a full day. Even with gaming thrown in for good measure, you’d be hard pressed to deplete the battery in a full work day. In fact during a one hour commute, we decided to stream music on Spotify over the cellular radio. By the end of the session, we observed a battery drop of just 6 percent which isn’t bad at all. Effectively, we’re regularly seeing screen on times between 5 to 6 hours with no change to our workflow. Conclusion So where do the Pixel phones really stand? Having spent close to a week with the phone, it is fair to say that hardware is top-notch but you wouldn’t expect any less either. Sure, they aren’t water-resistant and the design is rather dull and boring but there’s so much more to these phones. They serve as an excellent foundation to guide the future of Android as a platform. Indeed, Google would rather have you hooked onto it’s services and use the phone as gateaway. It isn’t aiming to be a Lamborghini or Ferrari with screaming fast looks, it would rather be a Tesla that has a more refined and utilitarian look yet manages to beat others in a quarter-mile drag. For once, we have a phone that simply works and it isn’t an iPhone. The Google Pixel phones start at Rs. 57,000 for the base variant and goes up to Rs. 76,000 for the top of the line version. It is available for pre-order from Flipkart and offline retailers and ships starting this week.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: October 24, 2016 5:04 pm Google Pixel, Pixel XL are harder to repair than the Apple iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, according to an iFixit teardown. Google Pixel smartphones have got a six out of 10 when it comes to repairs, scoring just under the Apple iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus which notched a score of seven, according to iFixit. iFixit is known for opening up the latest smartphones, and ranking them on how easy it would be to repair these devices. The iFixit teardown also tends to reveal the components being used inside smartphones, and in case of the iPhone this is particularly useful. According to iFixit’s teardown, in case of the Google Pixel many components are modular and can be replaced after the removing the display assembly. The battery also has a “removal tab” and changing it is a fairly “painless,” process. However, iFixit notes the “thin, poorly-supported display assembly” means opening up this device won’t be so easy and you are likely to cause some damage. Also removing the “midframe” is not so easy. The iFixit teardown reveals Google Pixel uses Samsung Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 2.0 as well as RAM from the South Korean company. In case of the processor, two cores are clocked at 2.15 GHz and two at 1.6 Ghz. In case of the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus iFixit has revealed the former comes with Samsung 2 GB LPDDR4 RAM while the bigger phone has Samsung 3 GB LPDDR4 RAM. The battery on the iPhone 7 Plus is 2900 mAh, which is slightly more than the 2750 mAh of the earlier iPhone 6s Plus. The smaller iPhone 7 has a 1960 mAh battery, which is an increase from last year’s 6s model.

Google’s Pixel smartphones don’t come with water or dust resistance. In India, Google Pixel, Pixel XL stores will be up for sale in stores from tomorrow, which is October 25. Both phones are open for pre-order on Flipkart currently. Google Pixel starts at Rs 57,000, Pixel XL costs Rs 67,000. Google is launching these phones in only two variants: 32GB and 128GB storage. There’s no microSD slot to expand memory, although Google is giving unlimited storage for photos, videos to Pixel users on the Google Photos app. Google will have a special helpline in India for Pixel, Pixel XL after sales support. The support is embedded in the settings of the Pixel smartphone. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaNo rethinking on demonetisation, 'temporary pain for larger gain': Govt after NDA meet BusinessAt least 4 months needed to replace demonetised notes, not 50 days IndiaCongress scrapped 25 paise, something of their stature, I did something of mine: PM Modi IndiaPakistan claims 7 soldiers killed at LoC; Nawaz Sharif warns India against aggression WorldBangladesh announces bounty for Hindu temple attackers EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 14: Latest News Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton tell Democrats not to despair Catholic bishops ask Donald Trump for humane immigration policies Donald Trump set to roll back President Obama’s policies on energy, environment Cash reaches ATM in remote Bastar village, over within two hours No regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Apple iPhone 7 easier to repair than Google Pixel By mid-day online correspondent | Posted 24-Oct-2016 Google Pixel XL and Apple iPhone 7 Although the Google Pixel smartphone outshines the iPhone 7 in low light photography, the former is slightly ahead in terms of repairability. According to a report by Firstpost, a detailed, step-by-step teardown of both phones revealed that the Google Pixel scores a 6 out of 10 on repairability score, while the Apple iPhone 7 scores a 7 out of 10. Also read - Comparison review: Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7 Both scores were however miles ahead of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Nexus 6P that have scored 3 and 2 in the past, respectively. However, a detailed iFixit teardown revealed that most of the components are easily replaceable, which include the battery and camera modules. Furthermore, the screws are all T5 Torx. When Google launched artificial intelligence (AI)-powered premium devices Pixel and Pixel XL earlier this month, the message was clear: The device with the personal Google Assistant built right in sounded the threat bugle for Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The comparison is natural, especially in the absence of another flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which leaves Google and Apple fighting for the premium segment.

By Agamoni Ghosh October 24, 2016 06:55 BST A boy carries a portrait of late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej as he lines up to pay respect at the Grand Palace in BangkokJorge Silva/ Reuters Google has announced that it will remove any content from its video sharing platform YouTube that insults the Thai monarchy. The decision was taken by Google after Thai hardline royalists met executives of the company requesting them to pull such offensive content. "We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies," a Google spokesperson told Reuters. The Asian country is currently in a state of mourning after their beloved King Bhumibol Adulyadej passed away on 13 October. Since then, many on social media as well as foreign media have published alleged 'offensive' content related to the crown prince and Thailand's legal heir to the throne which has not gone down well with the people. Under Thailand's royal insult law enshrined in article 112 of the country's criminal code, it is a criminal offence to insult the king, queen, heir or regent and those who are found guilty may face up to 15 years in prison. The law even curtails public discussion about the monarchy's role and its future in the country. "If any website is inappropriate Google has asked us to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found," said Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong who headed the meeting with Google. The Thai government has already started tracking people it suspects of insulting the monarchy following the king's death and is planning to ask countries where they reside to extradite them. Some critics of the monarchy living outside the country have been named and shamed in Thai language web forums.

Photograph: Sompong Sonnak/AP Oliver Holmes in Bangkok Monday 24 October 2016 03.28 EDT Last modified on Monday 24 October 2016 17.00 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Thailand has sent a high-level delegation to meet Google to push the company to remove any content that defames the royal family, a criminal offence in the south-east Asian country. King Bhumibol Adulyadej died on 13 October, aged 88, after seven decades on the throne. At a time of focused discussion on royal affairs, lèse-majesté laws mean people deemed to have offended the monarchy can face years in jail. The deputy prime minister said he met Google representatives in Bangkok on Friday and added that the company affirmed it would help the government remove videos from YouTube, a Google subsidiary. “If any website is inappropriate they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found,” Prajin Juntong told journalists. Google said this conformed with its global practices. “We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world. We have not changed those policies in Thailand,” the company said in a statement emailed to the Guardian. “We rely on governments around the world to notify us of content that they believe is illegal through official processes, and will restrict it as appropriate after a thorough review.” Google’s terms of service say it may remove or refuse to display content it “reasonably believe[s]” violates the law, providing the company with a measure of control. Sensitivity around the reputation of the monarchy is at an all-time high in Thailand and the government has been under pressure from ultra-royalists to show it is upholding the reputation of the monarchy. Authorities have announced a 30-day mourning period during which people are expected to wear black or dark clothing. Companies have also sought to show solidarity with national anguish and Google and YouTube in Thailand have changed their online logos to black. Oliver Holmes (@olireports) Google in Thailand today. pic.twitter.com/HQ3511Pdmb October 14, 2016 The visit by senior officials to Google will be seen as an attempt to publicly appease people who want a renewed crackdown on royal defamation. However, Google and YouTube searches on Monday appeared to still show online content available that is likely to be in violation of lèse-majesté laws. Google did not provide the Guardian with specific examples of content removed in Thailand but pointed to its transparency report, a quarterly statement on requests from courts and government to remove content. The latest examples are for 2015. Rights groups have criticised the country’s lèse-majesté laws. Last week, the justice minister said Thai people should “socially sanction” those who defame the monarchy. A Thai woman accused of insulting the late king on social media was forced to kneel before his portrait outside a police station in front of jeering crowds. Reuters contributed to this report.

Eighth-graders (from left) Benjamin Koelkebeck, Mykela Nunnelly and Levi Stokesbary work with technology last week at South Middle School. GLOBE | ROGER NOMER  Have you ever wondered what is the best way to use Google to research different topics? Maybe you're unsure about all those settings on Facebook? Or perhaps you just wonder what is the purpose of Twitter or Instagram? Students at Joplin South Middle School hope to answer all those questions and more next month during their first community class, which will focus on digital communication with family and friends. The class, slated from 5:30 to 7 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 17, will be open to the public and taught by members of the school's eLeaders club. "Our primary goal is just to have that connection between students and the community," said Darren Morgan, a history teacher at South and one of the club's sponsors. Students from the club said no question about Google, texting, emailing and social media platforms will be off-limits. They'll be able to walk participants through how to use sites such as Facebook and Instagram or how to use search engines safely and responsibly. "Basic things on the computer and Microsoft — we know something on all of that and can help them work through it if they have questions," eighth-grader Levi Stokesbary said. Zachary Cook, also an eighth-grader, said he looks forward to being able to help people with their technological obstacles. "That's always a nice feeling," he said. Said eighth-grade student Benjamin Koelkebeck: "It will be fun just getting to help people." Morgan said the students will be able to offer "constructive and polite" instructions to people who need help with their technological devices. "They have a service mentality that is really helpful," he said. Heather Van Otterloo, a reading/writing teacher at South and another club sponsor, said the group developed the topic for the community class after she posted an informal survey on Facebook, asking people what they would most be interested in learning from eLeaders. "We wanted to focus on communication in the first (class) because it's getting close to the holidays, and I want them to be able to connect with people," she said. Van Otterloo said the eLeaders students are adept at working with different kinds of technology and social media, but the community class will give them the opportunity to practice another kind of skill: helping others learn. "One of the biggest benefits for them will be learning how to share their knowledge with others as a teacher rather than a doer," she said. "That will be a useful skill in multiple facets." The class also could help show off the district's technology and how it's used in the classroom, Morgan said. He noted that technology often gets a bad rap in education — it distracts students, it is unreliable, it is not as good of a learning tool as textbooks and paper — and that he expects his students to show how they use it in their own learning process every day at school. "We have a group of kids who have learned how to use technology responsibly, so it's kind of a way to show, too, that the tax dollars funding these things is not a waste," he said. The class will be offered free of charge, although donations will be accepted to be put back toward maintaining and upgrading the eLeaders' equipment. Morgan said the group last year spent more than $2,000 through its own fundraisers to purchase a new computer and camera; it is looking to possibly purchase a second camera for its projects this year. About eLeaders ELeaders is an organization made up of students with advanced knowledge of computers and a desire to help and serve the school and its teachers and staff. There are currently eight to 12 students from the sixth, seventh and eighth grades who belong to the club, which emphasizes leadership, innovation and service.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube It is inevitable that with the launch of Google Assistant on the Pixel phones that we’re sure many are wondering how it compares against the competition, namely Siri since iOS is probably Android’s biggest competition. Thankfully YouTuber Marques Brownlee has decided to answer the question for us in a comparison video. In the video above, Brownlee pits Google Assistant against Siri in a head-to-head battle in which the same question is asked to both platforms. It starts off pretty simple with launching apps, setting reminders, and doing basic calculation. In fact for a brief moment it looked as though Siri was pulling ahead. However when it became to slightly more complex questions, this is when Google Assistant started to shine. For example Siri could not name the President of the United States and had to search it up online, whereas Google Assistant was able to name Barack Obama on the spot. When asked how tall was the President, Siri assumed it was a new and separate query, where Google Assistant was smart enough to figure out it was a follow-up question to the previous query, thus making it more conversational. However when asked more directly and specifically as to how tall Barack Obama is, Siri was able to answer that (along with Google Assistant). However there are some places in which Siri seems to excel in, which is by offering up more information along with the answer in case you wanted to dive deeper into the subject. That being said, it’s hard to say which is better. Google Assistant is definitely more conversational meaning that using it feels more natural. However given that both AI are exclusive to their respective platforms, it’s not as if users can choose which to use unless they don’t mind switching to completely different phones and operating systems.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday November 15, 2016 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode LG's V20 gets Australian release details Campbell Simpson 24 Oct 2016, 9:25 a.m. LG's new V20 wants to take on the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL. LG's V20 gets Australian release details The LG V20 has the same dual camera setup as the G5. Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit LG's new V20 wants to take on the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL. It's one of the first phones that'll launch with Android 7.0 Nougat in Australia, it inherits the funky dual camera setup from the G5, and it has a sizeable — and removable — battery. Here's how much you'll pay for LG's latest and greatest Android phone, and when you'll be able to pick one up in Australia. The LG V20 is a successor of sorts to the G5. It doesn't have that phone's replaceable modules, but it does have the same dual rear camera setup with a 16-megapixel wide-angle f/1.9 lens and sensor alongside a 8-megapixel f/2.4 super-wide-angle. It's a similar approach to what Apple has done with the iPhone 7 Plus, but both cameras have a wider field of view than the relatively telephoto Portrait mode of the iPhone. The V20 is powered by a relatively up-to-date Snapdragon 820 quad-core with 4GB of RAM, and all phones will be delivered into Australia with 64GB of onboard storage as well as a microSD expandable memory card slot. That processor enables 4K video recording and electronic image stabilisation from the V20's rear camera, and has chops in the audio department too with hi-fi audio recording and an ongoing partnership with B&O Play LG will sell the V20 exclusively through JB Hi-Fi in Australia, with devices going on sale from November 8 for a $1099 RRP.

When it became the “seller of record” for the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, it needed to make a few changes. Still lacking the resources, not to mention stores, to provide repair services, Google has instead partnered with uBreakiFix to offer repairs, even walk-in same-day ones, for the “Phones by Google” across the US and Canada. Smartphone OEMs outside North America, particularly those hailing from China, have a hard time breaking into that market for a couple of reasons, not the least of which is the lack of purchase subsidies as well as service centers within walking, or at least driving, distance. Some OEMs have already tried to address the former and Google is addressing the latter in this new partnership. uBreakiFix boasts of 240 stores in North America, in as much as 187 cities in the US and Canada. Pixel and Pixel XL owners are promised same-day repairs for broken screens, using OEM parts and replacements. Prices for screen replacements go for $129.99 for the Pixel and $149.99 for the larger Pixel XL. Customers who don’t have a nearby uBreakiFix store can also opt for the mail-in service instead. The Google Pixel isn’t just new in terms of “just launched”, it is also a completely new device coming from a company that has yet to prove its smartphone-making chops, independent of OEM partnerships like in past Nexus. There will naturally be some worry about the survivability of the smartphone, especially its water resistance, as it was, unofficially, noted to only have an IP53 rating. Fortunately, it was also demonstrated that it could survive for a good while under some shallow water. Don’t take it to the pool though.

How About An Hour? [Video] 23 October 2016, 7:18 pm EDT By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times Google - Five Fascinating Facts About The Search GiantNow Playing Latest News And Scoops On SmartphoneNow Playing Google Pixel and Pixel XL have IP53 ratings, but are they really water resistant? This video of the Pixel phone spending 30 minutes submerged in water may offer some clues.  ( Harris Craycraft | YouTube ) Advertisement The new Google Pixel phones are out and about and are currently among the hottest devices on the market, but how durable are they? Can they withstand water? Current smartphones generally sport at least some degree of water and dust resistance to ensure they are durable enough to be worth the investment, but the new Google Pixel hardly makes any claims in this area. In fact, the Google Pixel is quite lacking in its ability to withstand the elements, at least on paper. Google equipped the smartphone with a meager IP53 rating, which means that technically it's not really meant to withstand even splashes of water. That IP53 certification implies that it would be best to keep the device from any water, be it rain or some other source, unless it's properly wrapped up in a protective, waterproof case. That said, real world testing doesn't always agree with the claims made on paper. While some make attractive claims and the device actually performs worse, Google makes virtually no claims in terms of water resistance yet if its Pixel phone may in fact be more durable than indicated. YouTuber Harris Craycraft decided to see for himself if the Google Pixel is water resistant or not, so he put the smartphone to the test and had a pleasant surprise. After a mild start with the smartphone in a puddle, the test eventually ends up with the Google Pixel spending a 30 minutes completely submerged in water. Despite having only an IP53 rating, which should mean virtually no water resistance with submersion, the Google Pixel seems to come out unscathed from its 30-minute bath. Even after spending that time completely submerged, the smartphone works without any hiccups and doesn't show any sign of water damage at all. Both the speaker and charger worked properly after the dunk. Taking things to the next level, another YouTuber, Jonathan Morrison, kept the Google Pixel underwater for a full hour. The smartphone survived this test as well, although its speaker was affected. Needless to mention, this should not be taken as a guarantee that the Google Pixel is waterproof, so do not try this at home. These independently-conducted tests simply aims to demonstrate that should the Google Pixel find itself in a predicament involving water, it might not be the end of the world. The phone might survive a splash, spill, or bath, but this does not mean that it's fully water resistant and no water damage may ever occur. Nevertheless, the videos suggests that Google Pixel owners might get more than they bargained for - in a good way. Without further ado, check out the videos below to see the Google Pixel waterproof tests. TAG Google, Google Pixel, water resistant, Durability Test © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Taxman waging 'trench warfare' with tech giants 12:02 PM Monday Oct 24, 2016 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Company Taxation Inland Revenue Taxation Sponsor message.   Video will play in Play now Don't auto play Never auto play Inland Revenue has launched a swathe of audits into the tax arrangements of international technology firms after the taxman detected what it described as "anomalies" in their accounts. While Inland Revenue would not name the companies being scrutinised, citing secrecy provisions in tax laws, four high-profile digital companies - Apple, Google, Facebook and Uber - this week declined to answer when questioned about whether they were currently subject to audit. Of those that responded to Weekend Herald queries - Facebook, Uber and Google - all stressed they met their tax obligations both in New Zealand and abroad. News of the crackdown slipped out in a March briefing to Revenue Minister Michael Woodhouse recently obtained under the Official Information Act following a complaint to the Ombudsman. The briefing, by Inland Revenue's manager of international revenue strategy John Nash, said close monitoring of multinational companies identified "anomalies" and this sort of work had led to "current audits of technology companies". Speaking to the Weekend Herald Nash confirmed the keen interest of his department in the sector: "I wouldn't even call it a crackdown: It's very much business as usual." One tax adviser familiar with Inland Revenue's activities in the area said the sector had always been of particular interest but said recent publicity about the issue appeared to have led to increased scrutiny. "They've had a strong interest in the past few years, but it's probably stepped up in the past six months," the adviser said. Continued below.

"I can't answer your questions at this stage - our investigations people are still putting together the numbers," he said. Inland Revenue manager of international revenue strategy John Nash. Nash said audits were time-consuming affairs - "It can become fairly intense trench warfare," he said - and would take several years to resolve. As an example of the extent to which his office would drill down into audit targets, Nash said one of his offices' ongoing probes into a technology company had seen 20,000 emails sent between local and overseas offices seized for analysis. "The reason for that is we have to establish exactly what has been done in New Zealand, and what has been done in Singapore: And we have to establish the value of the stuff done in New Zealand," he said. Minister Woodhouse this week said the Government was keeping all options on the table, including whether to follow the lead of Australia and the United Kingdom and impose a diverted profits tax, also known as a "Google tax", to target multinationals unfairly shunting cash out of the country. View note "The Government plans to release a discussion document early next year canvassing a number of options for addressing transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance. A diverted profits tax is one way to counter [that]," Woodhouse said through a spokesperson. The March briefing appears to have been called by the Minister in response to publication of the Herald's Tax Gap series which identified a number of apparently highly profitable multinationals that paid relatively minuscule amounts of tax in New Zealand. The 20 companies most aggressive in moving profits out of New Zealand - a list featuring many technology firms - were found to have booked local revenues of $20 billion but paid only $1.8 million in taxes. They've had a strong interest in the past few years, but it's probably stepped up in the past six months. Tax adviser Nash's briefing said the Herald analysis - comparing the profit margins between domestic subsidiaries and multinational parents - was "fundamentally flawed", but conceded it was a "starting point for deeper analysis". The rapid growth of digital businesses - whose lack of heavy infrastructure has allowed them to relocate and compete from low- or no-tax jurisdictions - has caused concern at governments and boardrooms worldwide. Spark chief executive Simon Moutter has this year campaigned against what he characterises as unfair tax planning strategies used by online rivals. While unwilling to comment directly on Inland Revenue's crackdown, Moutter said: "In today's weightless, global economy it's critical that all companies that benefit financially from operating in New Zealand also contribute their fair share towards the tax base that pays for hospitals, schools and other vital government services." - NZ Herald Read more by Matt Nippert Email Matt Nippert Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Also, if you are not happy with Google’s speed of rolling out the Play Store updates in your country, you can also choose to manually update it. So, how do you install the Play Store? Is there a special method? Is it as simple as installing any other app? Fret not, installing the Play Store is as simple as installing any other app from outside the Play Store. Now, let us get going to know how to install the Play Store. Method #1: Update the Play Store Step #1: Open the Play Store app. Step #2: Head to the Play Store’s settings. Step #3: Scroll down and find the build version. Now, simply tap on it to start downloading the latest version of the Play Store.(if any) Method #2: Download the APK file from your Android device & Install the Play Store At first, you need to grab the APK file from the web to get started installing the Play Store. However, only a few of the sites on the web offer to download the legitimate / unmodified Play Store APK File. Moreover, APKMirror.Com seems to be the only one that you can trust right now. Note: APKMirror.com is the most trusted source for downloading original / unmodified APK files. The website is owned and managed by AndroidPolice.com. They verify the MD5 hash value (The cryptographic signature) which guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Steps to download the APK File from APKMirror.com Note: The images used for this method shows the desktop version of the website. It would be the same when using your Android device. Step #1: Head on to APKMirror.com Step #2: Type in – “Play Store” in the search field of the site as shown in the image below. Step #3: Now, tap on the search icon to start searching for it. Finally, you will get to see multiple versions of the APK file for the Google Play Store as shown in the image below. So, now you will have to decide which one to choose for your device. If you are confused, do have a look at APKMirror’s FAQ page to know which variant should you download for your device. Note: There is nothing to worry about if you accidentally install an incompatible APK variant for your device. The installation would simply fail if you do so. Step #4: Click on the version you want to download and finally tap on the Download button to start downloading the APK file as shown in the image below. Now that you have successfully downloaded the APK file to your Android device. You will have have to first allow the installation from unknown sources in order to install an APK file on your device. Steps to Allow Installation from Unknown Sources Step #1: Open the settings app. Step #2: Scroll down and click on “Security” settings. Step #3: Scroll down to find “Unknown Sources” option and enable it. Ignore the warning message because you know what you are doing already (It is safe!). Note: Do not forget to disable the installation of Unknown sources after installing the Play Store. Steps to Install the Play Store Step #1: Open the downloads manager of your device. Step #2: Click on the Play Store’s APK file. Step #3: Tap on “Install” to start installing the APK File. Method #3: Transfer the APK File from the PC to your Android device & Install the Play Store On the off chance, if you do not have an active Internet connection on your device, you can utilize a desktop in order to get the APK file. Follow the same set of steps to download the APK file from APKMirror.com as mentioned above. After you are done downloading the APK file to your computer, simply transfer the file to your Android device connecting it via a USB cable (as a storage media). You may refer to the Google’s support page if you have any problems connecting your Android device to the computer. Simply, navigate your way to the location where the APK file resides and click on it to Install the Play Store. Of course, you will have to allow installation from unknown sources here as well before installing the Play Store. Wrapping Up So, as you are now aware of various methods to install the Play Store.

Resend activation e-mail Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism Using Rowhammer bitflips to root Android phones is now a thing Permission-less apps take only seconds to root phones from LG, Samsung and Motorola. by Dan Goodin - Oct 23, 2016 11:03 pm UTC Login to bookmark 157 Enlarge / An LG Nexus 5 at the moment it is rooted using Rowhammer-induced bit flips. van der Veen et al. Researchers have devised an attack that gains unfettered "root" access to a large number of Android phones, exploiting a relatively new type of bug that allows adversaries to manipulate data stored in memory chips. The breakthrough has the potential to make millions of Android phones vulnerable, at least until a security fix is available, to a new form of attack that seizes control of core parts of the operating system and neuters key security defenses. Equally important, it demonstrates that the new class of exploit, dubbed Rowhammer, can have malicious and far-reaching effects on a much wider number of devices than was previously known, including those running ARM chips. Previously, some experts believed Rowhammer attacks that altered specific pieces of security-sensitive data weren't reliable enough to pose a viable threat because exploits depended on chance hardware faults or advanced memory-management features that could be easily adapted to repel the attacks. But the new proof-of-concept attack developed by an international team of academic researchers is challenging those assumptions. An app containing the researchers' rooting exploit requires no user permissions and doesn't rely on any vulnerability in Android to work. Instead, their attack exploits a hardware vulnerability, using a Rowhammer exploit that alters crucial bits of data in a way that completely roots name brand Android devices from LG, Motorola, Samsung, OnePlus, and possibly other manufacturers. No quick fix "Until recently, we never even thought about hardware bugs [and] software was never written to deal with them," one of the researchers, Victor van der Veen, wrote in an e-mail. "Now, we are using them to break your phone or tablet in a fully reliable way and without relying on any software vulnerability or esoteric feature. And there is no quick software update to patch the problem and go back to business as usual." So far, "Drammer," as the researchers have dubbed their exploit, has successfully rooted the following handsets: the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, and G4 from LG; Moto G models from 2013 and 2014 made by Motorola; the Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S5 from Samsung; and the One from OnePlus. In some cases, the results aren't always consistent. For example, only 12 of the 15 Nexus 5 models were successfully rooted, while only one of two Galaxy S5 were compromised. The researchers aren't certain why their results are inconsistent. They theorize that the age of a given device may play a role, since extended or intensive use may wear down cells inside the memory chips over time. Another possibility is that memory chips from some suppliers are more resilient to Rowhammer than others. (It's not uncommon for different generations of the same phone model to use different memory chips.) The researchers expect to soon publish an app that allows people to test their individual phone and anonymously include the results in a running tally that will help researchers better track the list of vulnerable devices. (Update 10/24/2016 6:10 California time: The app still hasn't gone live in Google Play. People who are willing to sideload the app can find it here.) The researchers privately reported their findings to Google engineers in July, and the company has designated the vulnerability as "critical," its highest severity rating. Google also awarded the researchers $4,000 under the company's bug bounty reward program. Google informed its manufacturing partners of the vulnerability earlier this month and plans to release an update in November, but the researchers warned it doesn't conclusively fix the underlying Rowhammer hardware bug. Instead, it only makes the vulnerability much harder to exploit by restricting an app's access to "physical contiguous kernel memory," as carried out by Drammer. "I will have to check once the patch is out, but I expect that we could still find bit flips," van der Veen told Ars. "Exploiting them would be harder, but probably not impossible." Google continues to work on a longer term solution. The researchers have published two videos that demonstrate Drammer in action against an unrooted LG Nexus 5. For test and research purposes, the phone is connected by USB to a computer, although such a pairing isn't necessary to make the attacks work. In the first video, the handset is running Android 6.0.1 with security patches Google released on October 5. Beginning around 0:15, Drammer begins hammering memory, and between 0:30 and 0:50, the exploit can be seen writing new entries to the memory's page table, 512 entries at a time. At the 0:50 mark, Drammer obtains root access and opens a shell window that gives complete control over the device. Drammer on Android 6.0.1 The second video shows how Drammer can be combined with code that exploits specific Android vulnerabilities, in this one known as Stagefright, which remains unfixed in many older handsets. By adding the Drammer privilege-escalation exploit, an existing code-execution attack can access core parts of the operating system, rather than being confined only to a small section of it, as envisioned under the Android security model. In the second video, the Stagefright exploit gives the researchers an advanced shell, but it still has only limited system privileges, as evidenced by the inability to access the phone's SD card. By running Drammer, however, the shell gains root access, starting about 3:30 into the video. Stagefright + Drammer Drammer represents a dramatic advance in what's known about Rowhammer. In 2014, researchers first demonstrated that repeatedly accessing data stored in memory chips could flip certain bits, causing certain zeros to become ones and vice versa. The bitflips were viewed by many as more of a data-corrupting threat than one with far-reaching consequences for security. In part, that was because the bit flips were possible only in limited regions of certain DDR memory chips, making it hard to surgically alter specific pieces of security-sensitive data. The road to exploitation Then in 2015, researchers for Google's Project Zero showed that in limited settings, Rowhammer could be exploited to elevate user privileges and break out of security sandboxes that protect operating systems from untrusted code. Many researchers continued to downplay the significance of the results, in part because Google responded by updating its Chrome browser to disable the CLFLUSH instruction that was required to make the sandbox escape work. Additionally, critics said error-correcting code and other protections could easily mitigate the threat. Since then, researchers have slowly advanced the capabilities of Rowhammer, showing, for instance, the bug can be exploited by the type of JavaScript code hosted on websites and can be fine-tuned to alter specific pieces of security-sensitive data using a technique known as flip feng shui. Flip feng shui, however, still relied on advanced memory-management features that aren't available in most mobile devices and other low-cost platforms. And like all the other Rowhammer exploits that preceded it, it worked only on devices that used chips with an x86 x64 architecture, which are mostly made by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Drammer was devised by many of the same researchers behind Flip Feng Shui, and it adopts many of the same approaches. Still, it represents a significant improvement over Flip Feng Shui because it's able to alter specific pieces of sensitive-security data using standard memory management interfaces built into the Android OS. Using crucial information about the layout of Android memory chips gleaned from a side channel the researchers discovered in ARM processors, Drammer is able to carry out what the researchers call a deterministic attack, meaning one that can reliably target security-sensitive data. The susceptibility of Android devices to Rowhammer exploits likely signals a similar vulnerability in memory chips used in iPhones and other mobile devices as well. "It is currently unclear to us if, and how this could be exploited," van der Veen told Ars. "I would not be surprised if it turns out that this is possible, though. Drammer shows that the requirements for reliable exploitation are provided by fundamental operating system functionality, and I expect that similar functionality is available on iOS (or even Windows Phone)." The findings are the product of a research team from VUSec at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Graz University of Technology. They will be presenting their research later this week at the 23rd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Vienna, Austria. They have published this informational page with additional details of their work. In a paper published early Monday morning Amsterdam time titled Drammer: Deterministic Rowhammer Attacks on Mobile Platforms, the researchers wrote: Not only does our attack show that practical, deterministic Rowhammer attacks are a real threat for billions of mobile users, but it is also the first effort to show that Rowhammer is even possible at all (and reliably exploitable) on any platform other than x86 and with a much more limited software feature set than existing solutions. Moreover, we demonstrated that several devices from different vendors are vulnerable to Rowhammer. To conclude, our research shows that practical large-scale Rowhammer attacks are a serious threat and while the response to the Rowhammer bug has been relatively slow from vendors, we hope our work will accelerate mitigation efforts both in industry and academia. In a statement, Google officials wrote: "After researchers reported this issue to our Vulnerability Rewards Program, we worked closely with them to deeply understand it in order to better secure our users.

They can make it more difficult, as the article states software fixes would only be a bandaid. Well, it'll be a kinda-sorta software patch. Mainly to enable memory encryption. On an SoC I worked on, we had in the memory controller a Memory Encryption Unit that scrambled both address and data lines. If you enabled it, every boot you'd load on a random number into the key registers and then enable it. (You have to be running from SRAM at this point, because obviously once enabled, everything is encrypted). The purpose of this unit was to prevent plaintext data form hitting memory so if you spied on the memory bus, you got gibberish. This technique has been used many times efore (I believe the Xbox360 has encrypted main memory as well). Even better, it's wire speed zero overhead, transparent to the SoC (inside the SoC the MEU would've decrypted the data, so no special support is needed, and this includes the DMA controller). Because of the way it works and the key, you cannot guaranteed the data or the rows are even similar from boot to boot. I'm not sure if iOS or the Apple SoCs have a MEU - in general they should, and I think I've heard they do, but no real confirmation. 965 posts | registered 7/7/2001 KonoWatakushi Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post Layer8Error wrote: The actual implementation of this exploit is way over my head, but could this be prevented using ECC?

(For more resources related to this topic, see here.) Google App Engine gives developers a NoOps (short for No Operations, indicating that developers and engineers have no work to do in order to have their code running and available) way of deploying their applications, and Go has been officially supported as a language option for some years now. Google's architecture runs some of the biggest applications in the world, such as Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, among others, so is a pretty safe bet when it comes to deploying our own code. Google App Engine allows you to write a Go application, add a few special configuration files, and deploy it to Google's servers, where it will be hosted and made available in a highly available, scalable, and elastic environment. Instances will automatically spin up to meet demand and tear down gracefully when they are no longer needed with a healthy free quota and preapproved budgets. Along with running application instances, Google App Engine makes available a myriad of useful services, such as fast and high-scale data stores, search, memcache, and task queues. Transparent load balancing means you don't need to build and maintain additional software or hardware to ensure servers don't get overloaded and that requests are fulfilled quickly. In this article, we will build the API backend for a question and answer service similar to Stack Overflow or Quora and deploy it to Google App Engine. In the process, we'll explore techniques, patterns, and practices that can be applied to all such applications as well as dive deep into some of the more useful services available to our application. Specifically, in this article, you will learn: How to use the Google App Engine SDK for Go to build and test applications locally before deploying to the cloud How to use app.yaml to configure your application How Modules in Google App Engine let you independently manage the different components that make up your application How the Google Cloud Datastore lets you persist and query data at scale A sensible pattern for the modeling of data and working with keys in Google Cloud Datastore How to use the Google App Engine Users API to authenticate people with Google accounts A pattern to embed denormalized data into entities The Google App Engine SDK for Go In order to run and deploy Google App Engine applications, we must download and configure the Go SDK. Head over to https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads and download the latest Google App Engine SDK for Go for your computer. The ZIP file contains a folder called go_appengine, which you should place in an appropriate folder outside of your GOPATH, for example, in /Users/yourname/work/go_appengine. It is possible that the names of these SDKs will change in the future—if that happens, ensure that you consult the project home page for notes pointing you in the right direction at https://github.com/matryer/goblueprints. Next, you will need to add the go_appengine folder to your $PATH environment variable, much like what you did with the go folder when you first configured Go. To test your installation, open a terminal and type this: goapp version You should see something like the following: go version go1.6.1 (appengine-1.9.37) darwin/amd64 The actual version of Go is likely to differ and is often a few months behind actual Go releases. This is because the Cloud Platform team at Google needs to do work on its end to support new releases of Go. The goapp command is a drop-in replacement for the go command with a few additional subcommands; so you can do things like goapp test and goapp vet, for example. Creating your application In order to deploy an application to Google's servers, we must use the Google Cloud Platform Console to set it up. In a browser, go to https://console.cloud.google.com and sign in with your Google account. Look for the Create Project menu item, which often gets moved around as the console changes from time to time. If you already have some projects, click on a project name to open a submenu, and you'll find it in there. If you can't find what you're looking for, just search Creating App Engine project and you'll find it. When the New Project dialog box opens, you will be asked for a name for your application. You are free to call it whatever you like (for example, Answers), but note the Project ID that is generated for you; you will need to refer to this when you configure your app later. You can also click on Edit and specify your own ID, but know that the value must be globally unique, so you'll have to get creative when thinking one up. Here we will use answersapp as the application ID, but you won't be able to use that one since it has already been taken. You may need to wait a minute or two for your project to get created; there's no need to watch the page—you can continue and check back later. App Engine applications are Go packages Now that the Google App Engine SDK for Go is configured and our application has been created, we can start building it. In Google App Engine, an application is just a normal Go package with an init function that registers handlers via the http.Handle or http.HandleFunc functions. It does not need to be the main package like normal tools. Create a new folder (somewhere inside your GOPATH folder) called answersapp/api and add the following main.go file: package api
import 
(
  "io"
  "net/http"
)
func init() 
{
  http.HandleFunc("/", handleHello)
}
func handleHello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) 
{
  io.WriteString(w, "Hello from App Engine")
}
 You will be familiar with most of this by now, but note that there is no ListenAndServe call, and the handlers are set inside the init function rather than main. We are going to handle every request with our simple handleHello function, which will just write a welcoming string. The app.yaml file In order to turn our simple Go package into a Google App Engine application, we must add a special configuration file called app.yaml. The file will go at the root of the application or module, so create it inside the answersapp/api folder with the following contents: application: YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE
version: 1
runtime: go
api_version: go1
handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: _go_app
 The file is a simple human–(and machine) readable configuration file in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language format—refer to yaml.org for more details). The following table describes each property: Property Description application The application ID (copied and pasted from when you created your project). version Your application version number—you can deploy multiple versions and even split traffic between them to test new features, among other things. We'll just stick with version 1 for now. runtime The name of the runtime that will execute your application. Since we're building a Go application, we'll use go. api_version The go1 api version is the runtime version supported by Google; you can imagine that this could be go2 in the future. handlers A selection of configured URL mappings. In our case, everything will be mapped to the special _go_app script, but you can also specify static files and folders here. Running simple applications locally Before we deploy our application, it makes sense to test it locally. We can do this using the App Engine SDK we downloaded earlier. Navigate to your answersapp/api folder and run the following command in a terminal: goapp serve You should see the following output: This indicates that an API server is running locally on port :56443, an admin server is running on :8000, and our application (the module default) is now serving at localhost:8080, so let's hit that one in a browser. As you can see by the Hello from App Engine response, our application is running locally. Navigate to the admin server by changing the port from :8080 to :8000. The preceding screenshot shows the web portal that we can use to interrogate the internals of our application, including viewing running instances, inspecting the data store, managing task queues, and more. Deploying simple applications to Google App Engine To truly understand the power of Google App Engine's NoOps promise, we are going to deploy this simple application to the cloud. Back in the terminal, stop the server by hitting Ctrl+C and run the following command: goapp deploy Your application will be packaged and uploaded to Google's servers. Once it's finished, you should see something like the following: Completed update of app: theanswersapp, version: 1 It really is as simple as that. You can prove this by navigating to the endpoint you get for free with every Google App Engine application, remembering to replace the application ID with your own: https://YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE.appspot.com/. You will see the same output as earlier (the font may render differently since Google's servers will make assumptions about the content type that the local dev server doesn't). The application is being served over HTTP/2 and is already capable of pretty massive scale, and all we did was write a config file and a few lines of code. Modules in Google App Engine A module is a Go package that can be versioned, updated, and managed independently. An app might have a single module, or it can be made up of many modules: each distinct but part of the same application with access to the same data and services. An application must have a default module—even if it doesn't do much. Our application will be made up of the following modules: Description The module name The obligatory default module default An API package delivering RESTful JSON api A static website serving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that makes AJAX calls to the API module web Each module will be a Go package and will, therefore, live inside its own folder. Let's reorganize our project into modules by creating a new folder alongside the api folder called default. We are not going to make our default module do anything other than use it for configuration, as we want our other modules to do all the meaningful work. But if we leave this folder empty, the Google App Engine SDK will complain that it has nothing to build. Inside the default folder, add the following placeholder main.go file: package defaultmodule
func init() {}
 This file does nothing except allowing our default module to exist. It would have been nice for our package names to match the folders, but default is a reserved keyword in Go, so we have a good reason to break that rule. The other module in our application will be called web, so create another folder alongside the api and default folders called web. Here we are only going to build the API for our application and cheat by downloading the web module. Head over to the project home page at https://github.com/matryer/goblueprints, access the content for Second Edition, and look for the download link for the web components for this article in the Downloads section of the README file. The ZIP file contains the source files for the web component, which should be unzipped and placed inside the web folder. Now, our application structure should look like this: /answersapp/api
/answersapp/default
/answersapp/web
 Specifying modules To specify which module our api package will become, we must add a property to the app.yaml inside our api folder. Update it to include the module property: application: YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE
version: 1
runtime: go
module: api
api_version: go1
handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: _go_app
 Since our default module will need to be deployed as well, we also need to add an app.yaml configuration file to it. Duplicate the api/app.yaml file inside default/app.yaml, changing the module to default: application: YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE
version: 1
runtime: go
module: default
api_version: go1
handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: _go_app
 Routing to modules with dispatch.yaml In order to route traffic appropriately to our modules, we will create another configuration file called dispatch.yaml, which will let us map URL patterns to the modules. We want all traffic beginning with the /api/ path to be routed to the api module and everything else to the web module. As mentioned earlier, we won't expect our default module to handle any traffic, but it will have more utility later. In the answersapp folder (alongside our module folders—not inside any of the module folders), create a new file called dispatch.yaml with the following contents: application: YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE
dispatch:
  - url: "*/api/*"
    module: api
  - url: "*/*"
    module: web
 The same application property tells the Google App Engine SDK for Go which application we are referring to, and the dispatch section routes URLs to modules. Google Cloud Datastore One of the services available to App Engine developers is Google Cloud Datastore, a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling and high performance. Its limited feature-set guarantees very high scale, but understanding the caveats and best practices is vital to a successful project. Denormalizing data Developers with experience of relational databases (RDBMS) will often aim to reduce data redundancy (trying to have each piece of data appear only once in their database) by normalizing data, spreading it across many tables, and adding references (foreign keys) before joining it back via a query to build a complete picture. In schemaless and NoSQL databases, we tend to do the opposite. We denormalize data so that each document contains the complete picture it needs, making read times extremely fast—since it only needs to go and get a single thing. For example, consider how we might model tweets in a relational database such as MySQL or Postgres: A tweet itself contains only its unique ID, a foreign key reference to the Users table representing the author of the tweet, and perhaps many URLs that were mentioned in TweetBody. One nice feature of this design is that a user can change their Name or AvatarURL and it will be reflected in all of their tweets, past and future: something you wouldn't get for free in a denormalized world. However, in order to present a tweet to the user, we must load the tweet itself, look up (via a join) the user to get their name and avatar URL, and then load the associated data from the URLs table in order to show a preview of any links. At scale, this becomes difficult because all three tables of data might well be physically separated from each other, which means lots of things need to happen in order to build up this complete picture. Consider what a denormalized design would look like instead: We still have the same three buckets of data, except that now our tweet contains everything it needs in order to render to the user without having to look up data from anywhere else. The hardcore relational database designers out there are realizing what this means by now, and it is no doubt making them feel uneasy. Following this approach means that: Data is repeated—AvatarURL in User is repeated as UserAvatarURL in the tweet (waste of space, right?) If the user changes their AvatarURL, UserAvatarURL in the tweet will be out of date Database design, at the end of the day, comes down to physics. We are deciding that our tweet is going to be read far more times than it is going to be written, so we'd rather take the pain up-front and take a hit in storage. There's nothing wrong with repeated data as long as there is an understanding about which set is the master set and which is duplicated for speed. Changing data is an interesting topic in itself, but let's think about a few reasons why we might be OK with the trade-offs. Firstly, the speed benefit to reading tweets is probably worth the unexpected behavior of changes to master data not being reflected in historical documents; it would be perfectly acceptable to decide to live with this emerged functionality for that reason. Secondly, we might decide that it makes sense to keep a snapshot of data at a specific moment in time. For example, imagine if someone tweets asking whether people like their profile picture. If the picture changed, the tweet context would be lost. For a more serious example, consider what might happen if you were pointing to a row in an Addresses table for an order delivery and the address later changed. Suddenly, the order might look like it was shipped to a different place. Finally, storage is becoming increasingly cheaper, so the need for normalizing data to save space is lessened. Twitter even goes as far as copying the entire tweet document for each of your followers. 100 followers on Twitter means that your tweet will be copied at least 100 times, maybe more for redundancy. This sounds like madness to relational database enthusiasts, but Twitter is making smart trade-offs based on its user experience; they'll happily spend a lot of time writing a tweet and storing it many times to ensure that when you refresh your feed, you don't have to wait very long to get updates. If you want to get a sense of the scale of this, check out the Twitter API and look at what a tweet document consists of. It's a lot of data. Then, go and look at how many followers Lady Gaga has. This has become known in some circles as "the Lady Gaga problem" and is addressed by a variety of different technologies and techniques that are out of the scope of this article. Now that we have an understanding of good NoSQL design practices, let's implement the types, functions, and methods required to drive the data part of our API. Entities and data access To persist data in Google Cloud Datastore, we need a struct to represent each entity. These entity structures will be serialized and deserialized when we save and load data through the datastore API. We can add helper methods to perform the interactions with the data store, which is a nice way to keep such functionality physically close to the entities themselves. For example, we will model an answer with a struct called Answer and add a Create method that in turn calls the appropriate function from the datastore package. This prevents us from bloating our HTTP handlers with lots of data access code and allows us to keep them clean and simple instead. One of the foundation blocks of our application is the concept of a question. A question can be asked by a user and answered by many. It will have a unique ID so that it is addressable (referable in a URL), and we'll store a timestamp of when it was created. type Question struct 
{
  Key          *datastore.Key `json:"id" datastore:"-"`
  CTime        time.Time      `json:"created"`
  Question     string         `json:"question"`
  User         UserCard       `json:"user"`
  AnswersCount int            `json:"answers_count"`
}
 The UserCard struct represents a denormalized User entity, both of which we'll add later. You can import the datastore package in your Go project using this: import "google.golang.org/appengine/datastore" It's worth spending a little time understanding the datastore.Key type. Keys in Google Cloud Datastore Every entity in Datastore has a key, which uniquely identifies it. They can be made up of either a string or an integer depending on what makes sense for your case. You are free to decide the keys for yourself or let Datastore automatically assign them for you; again, your use case will usually decide which is the best approach to take Keys are created using datastore.NewKey and datastore.NewIncompleteKey functions and are used to put and get data into and out of Datastore via the datastore.Get and datastore.Put functions. In Datastore, keys and entity bodies are distinct, unlike in MongoDB or SQL technologies, where it is just another field in the document or record. This is why we are excluding Key from our Question struct with the datastore:"-" field tag. Like the json tags, this indicates that we want Datastore to ignore the Key field altogether when it is getting and putting data. Keys may optionally have parents, which is a nice way of grouping associated data together and Datastore makes certain assurances about such groups of entities, which you can read more about in the Google Cloud Datastore documentation online. Putting data into Google Cloud Datastore Before we save data into Datastore, we want to ensure that our question is valid. Add the following method underneath the Question struct definition: func (q Question) OK() error 
{
  if len(q.Question) < 10 
  {
    return errors.New("question is too short")
  }
  return nil
}
 The OK function will return an error if something is wrong with the question, or else it will return nil. In this case, we just check to make sure the question has at least 10 characters. To persist this data in the data store, we are going to add a method to the Question struct itself. At the bottom of questions.go, add the following code: func (q *Question) Create(ctx context.Context) error {
  log.Debugf(ctx, "Saving question: %s", q.Question)
  if q.Key == nil {
    q.Key = datastore.NewIncompleteKey(ctx, "Question", nil)
  }
  user, err := UserFromAEUser(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  q.User = user.Card()
  q.CTime = time.Now()
  q.Key, err = datastore.Put(ctx, q.Key, q)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  return nil
}
 The Create method takes a pointer to Question as the receiver, which is important because we want to make changes to the fields. If the receiver was (q Question)—without *, we would get a copy of the question rather than a pointer to it, and any changes we made to it would only affect our local copy and not the original Question struct itself. The first thing we do is use log (from the google.golang.org/appengine/log package) to write a debug statement saying we are saving the question. When you run your code in a development environment, you will see this appear in the terminal; in production, it goes into a dedicated logging service provided by Google Cloud Platform. If the key is nil (that means this is a new question), we assign an incomplete key to the field, which informs Datastore that we want it to generate a key for us. The three arguments we pass are context.Context (which we must pass to all datastore functions and methods), a string describing the kind of entity, and the parent key; in our case, this is nil. Once we know there is a key in place, we call a method (which we will add later) to get or create User from an App Engine user and set it to the question and then set the CTime field (created time) to time.Now—timestamping the point at which the question was asked. One we have our Question function in good shape, we call datastore.Put to actually place it inside the data store. As usual, the first argument is context.Context, followed by the question key and the question entity itself. Since Google Cloud Datastore treats keys as separate and distinct from entities, we have to do a little extra work if we want to keep them together in our own code. The datastore.Put method returns two arguments: the complete key and error. The key argument is actually useful because we're sending in an incomplete key and asking the data store to create one for us, which it does during the put operation. If successful, it returns a new datastore.Key object to us, representing the completed key, which we then store in our Key field in the Question object. If all is well, we return nil. Add another helper to update an existing question: func (q *Question) Update(ctx context.Context) error 
{
  if q.Key == nil {
    q.Key = datastore.NewIncompleteKey(ctx, "Question", nil)
  }
  var err error
  q.Key, err = datastore.Put(ctx, q.Key, q)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  return nil
}
 This method is very similar except that it doesn't set the CTime or User fields, as they will already have been set. Reading data from Google Cloud Datastore Reading data is as simple as putting it with the datastore.Get method, but since we want to maintain keys in our entities (and datastore methods don't work like that), it's common to add a helper function like the one we are going to add to questions.go: func GetQuestion(ctx context.Context, key *datastore.Key)
(*Question, error) 
{
  var q Question
  err := datastore.Get(ctx, key, &q)
  if err != nil {
    return nil, err
  }
  q.Key = key
  return &q, nil
}
 The GetQuestion function takes context.Context and the datastore.Key method of the question to get. It then does the simple task of calling datastore.Get and assigning the key to the entity before returning it. Of course, errors are handled in the usual way. This is a nice pattern to follow so that users of your code know that they never have to interact with datastore.Get and datastore.Put directly but rather use the helpers that can ensure the entities are properly populated with the keys (along with any other tweaks that they might want to do before saving or after loading).

CDT October 23, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Harry Potter, Anthony Bourdain, Superman, Bill Simmons and Charles Barkley are all going to work for a phone company. AT&T’s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, the New York-based company that owns HBO, CNN, TNT and Warner Bros. film studio, is a huge domino falling in the content business. The deal, which creates a media powerhouse and comes with promises of innovation and cost-savings, will make competitors in the wireless and Internet space like T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon uneasy. The move could also set off a new wave of telecommunications companies and Internet giants, such as Google and Apple, buying or making deals with popular content programmers, further blurring the boundaries among the industries. In fact, Apple has been rumored for months to be a potential acquirer of Time Warner. And Google's interest in buying more premium entertainment content, such as the right to stream NFL games, has been widely reported. Other cable network operators that also could be potential takeover targets, to name a few, include: AMC Networks, best-known for its top-rated TV show The Walking Dead but which also owns BBC America and SundanceTV; and Discovery Communications, which owns and operates Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel, Animal Planet and OWN, in a joint venture network with Oprah Winfrey. The merger, which marries partners in distribution and content, will surely trigger multiple layers of complexity for customers, industry regulators, investors and consumer watchdogs as they sort out revenue possibilities and conflicts of interest. But competitors of Time Warner or AT&T can no longer to afford to stand by idly. Time Warner’s Chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes intimated as much, saying the deal was partly to get ahead of competitors. “You’re going to see all kinds of distributors following,” he said in a press conference call with reporters Saturday night. “And you’re going to see a kind of revolution in the TV world.” Telecom providers have been shopping for content companies to acquire as their wireless smartphone and broadband Internet service markets mature. "As upside from data usage seems to be increasingly capped, we would not be surprised if other distributors were to potentially embrace larger opportunities in the content arena over time," said Barclays Equity Research analysts Kannan Venkateshwar and Amir Rozwadowski in a recent note to investors. Ownership of Time Warner’s content – including Harry Potter movies, DC Entertainment films, whose franchises include Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, CNN, NBA basketball on TNT, MLB baseball on TBS, and HBO’s critically acclaimed shows, like Game of Thrones -- guarantees that AT&T can make those programs available on its DirecTV satellite TV service. AT&T can also stream those shows to its Net-delivered and wireless DirecTV-branded streaming services in the works. AT&T bought DirecTV last year for $48.5 billion. With more consumers streaming on their mobile devices, Bewkes, whose company had been wooed by others, pulled the trigger on the deal largely because he was drawn to the idea of delivering his content to consumers on “a multiplatform basis,” he said. Beyond that, AT&T also gets revenue by licensing those movies and TV series to other pay-TV providers and subscription Net TV services such as Netflix.  "Video and entertainment will remain the key driver for the future of consumer-oriented services," said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at Parks Associates. "Video, virtual reality, and other entertainment experiences are data hungry. They will be the experiences that push consumers to higher tiers of broadband or mobile data." Owning content also helps pay-TV providers to avoid costly conflicts over the escalating prices they pay to carry programming, he said. "With content costs continuing to increase, operators are expecting more such conflicts in the future. So, ensuring access to popular content certainly helps AT&T," Sappington said. Moreover, Time Warner's networks, particularly HBO and TNT, fetch some of the highest fees for pay-TV providers. After closing the acquisition, AT&T-DirecTV will not have to pay for Time Warner's content and will be in position to dictate the financial and legal terms of Time Warner's negotiations with other cable competitors. Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal in 2011 foreshadowed AT&T-Time Warner deal. And regulators’ approval of the deal and Comcast’s continued profitability from its business diversity have emboldened its pay-TV competitors. Since then, Comcast also acquired DreamWorks Animation in April for $3.8 billion. Verizon's announced July purchase of Yahoo for $4.83 billion -- and its May 2015 $4.4 billion deal for AOL -- involved content, as well as Internet advertising, making it "a case of buying what it needed to better monetize the data its network produces," said analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research. "Any media company without a controlling shareholder and other than Disney (because of size) could be a target," Wieser said. CBS and Viacom, despite the recent turmoil surrounding management, could be targets. The controlling shareholders of both companies – principally, billionaire media mogul Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone – have called on the two companies to merge. With a combined market cap of more than $40 billion, a CBS-Viacom would hold not only CBS' various networks including Showtime, but also Viacom's assets such as Paramount, BET, Comedy Central, MTV and VH1. If the merger occurs, it would possess the No. 1 primetime broadcast network and collectively the most number of cable TV viewers. Other standalone media companies, such as AMC, Discovery and Scripps, which owns HGTV and Food Network, will be constant subjects of merger speculation. Meanwhile, Time Warner, until the acquisition is closed, could continue to be the subject of a possible bidding war. But only a few companies have the financial wherewithal to pull it off. "It seems unlikely at the price AT&T is offering,” Wieser said. As the telecom-media landscape turns, regulators will have their hands full. AT&T's Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson told reporters that he doesn't see difficulty in passing regulatory muster since he's buying a "supplier," or in business parlance, a deal of "vertical integration." Anti-trust regulators have been typically more concerned with horizontal integration deals, in which a company buys a rival and gain greater market share. Still, given the size of the deal, regulators will hardly rubber-stamp their approval. They did put some conditions on Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal -- a similar case of vertical integration -- and the same would likely happen here, Sappington says. "The fact that AT&T is not one of the two largest pay-TV providers in the U.S. market will help," he said. "It makes it more difficult for opponents to claim a monopolistic advantage for AT&T in this merger."
