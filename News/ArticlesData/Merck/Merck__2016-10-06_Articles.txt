Since cases were first reported in March 2015, dogs in more than half of the United States [1] have been stricken by this respiratory disease. CIV H3N8 was first diagnosed in 2004 and has impacted dogs in more than 40 states. "Dogs at risk for CIRDC (canine infectious respiratory disease complex) should be vaccinated at least yearly with both influenza strains, H3N8 and H3N2, in addition to the other causes of 'Canine Cough',” said Ronald Schultz, Ph.D., professor of pathobiological sciences at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine. “The occurrence of one strain or the other is unpredictable and so dogs should be protected against both. Because dogs do not maintain long duration of immunity against influenza, it is important to vaccinate them annually.” According to clinical studies by researchers at the University of Wisconsin, the CIV H3N2 may be shed for an extended period of time – up to 24 days, which is far longer than what is seen with CIV H3N8. [2]  As a result, the infection can spread quickly among social dogs in inner cities, doggie daycares, boarding facilities, dog parks, sporting and show events and any location where dogs commingle. Clinical signs of both strains of CIV in dogs include coughing, fever, lethargy and interstitial pneumonia, [3]  and can be spread by direct contact with respiratory discharge from infected dogs, through the air via a cough or sneeze and by contact with contaminated objects, such as dog bowls and clothing or by people moving between infected and uninfected dogs. [2]  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes there is no evidence of transmission of the virus from dogs to people. Nobivac Canine Flu Bivalent is recommended for healthy dogs 7 weeks of age or older as an aid in the control of disease associated with canine influenza virus H3N8 and canine influenza virus H3N2. Primary immunization requires two vaccinations given two to four weeks apart. Annual revaccination with one dose is recommended. “Our commitment to animal health runs deeper than simply providing safe, high-quality products to our customers,” said Kathleen Heaney, D.V.M., executive director, companion animal technical services, Merck Animal Health. “It’s also our responsibility to help educate pet owners about potential health threats and the factors that put dogs at risk. We are actively collaborating with veterinarians to share information about CIV and the importance of prevention through vaccination, as well as sharing simple precautionary measures pet owners can take to help protect the health of their animals.” To learn more about CIV and the educational outreach initiative, visit doginfluenza.com and doginfluenza.com/ifthisdogcouldtalk.asp.

The &ldquo;Fast Money&rdquo; traders weigh in.</p> Billions at stake for big pharma    Thursday, 6 Oct 2016 | 5:52 PM ET | 03:25 When Bristol-Myers Squibb's mighty immunotherapy drug, Opdivo, failed in a large lung cancer trial in August, investorswiped $22 billion from the company's market value in a single afternoon. But it wasn't because they think the drug doesn't work. Most suspect it was something slightly more complicated — and they'll get much-anticipated answers this weekend. Both Bristol and Merck are set to release data on their dueling immunotherapies Sunday at a European medical conference, ESMO. The results will have important implications for how we treat lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths, as well as other forms of the disease. But the data will also answer a key question that's been bugging anyone following the immunotherapy race since Aug. 5: Did Opdivo fail simply because it was tested in patients it was unsuitable for? "We are stunned," Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a research note at the time. "We had high expectations for the study." So did a lot of people. The medicines — Merck's is called Keytruda — are considered among the biggest advancements in cancer treatment in decades, unleashing the immune system to fight cancer. And Opdivo had sailed from success to success, in melanoma, kidney cancer, blood cancer, and in lung cancer for which patients had already tried other therapies. The failed trial over the summer was in first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer, a market opportunity SunTrust analyst John Boris pegs at $7 billion to $8 billion annually. But scientists say we're still in the early days of understanding how these drugs work best, and the two companies have taken different strategies for testing them. Bristol's is broader, while Merck's involved testing patients' cancer for biomarkers that could indicate the drug is likelier to work. In first-line treatment of lung cancer, Merck's strategy has so far emerged ahead. Here's why: both drugs block a receptor on cells known as PD-1, which links with a ligand called PD-L1 on cancer cells. Cancer has ways of evading the body's natural defense systems, cloaking itself from our immune soldiers. But blocking PD-1 reveals those cancer cells to our immune system, enabling our own natural defenses to attack. Different people's cancers express different levels of PD-L1. And this is the key difference in how Bristol-Myers and Merck tested their drugs. In its failed study, Bristol-Myers included patients in whom at least 5 percent of tumor cells expressed PD-L1, or about 55 to 60 percent of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients who hadn't yet tried other treatments. Merck limited its testing to patients with at least 50 percent expression of PD-L1, or about a quarter to a third of those in the category. And that appears to work: Merck said in June that Keytruda beat chemotherapy on both progression-free survival, or the time patients live without their tumors growing, and overall survival, a measure of how long patients live, in patients with at least 50 percent PD-L1 expression. So what does PD-L1 expression mean — and why do higher levels confer a greater benefit from PD-1 blockers? "It turns out PD-L1 expression is just a marker for the presence of an immune response," explained Merck's head of research, Dr. Roger Perlmutter. "Expression of PD-L1 is increased by immune response factors." In English: PD-L1 is a signal that the immune system has been trying to fight the cancer. Or, as Perlmutter puts it, "Gee, there's already immune response going on here." Which means: the more tumor cells that express PD-L1, the more evidence the immune system is ready for a fight. And by taking away the tumor cells' invisibility cloak with PD-1 blockers, the immune system is unleashed. "Keytruda reveals the pre-existing immunity directed against the tumor in some patients," Perlmutter said. Universal Images Group | Getty Images Malignant Tumors. Visceral Metastases. X Ray. So, then, presumably, should Opdivo. So if one PD-1 blocker works for the 50 percent threshold, and one failed in the 5 percent threshold, does that mean both should work at 50 percent? That's what everyone's waiting to find out on Sunday. "At ESMO we'll finally learn why CM-026 failed," BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei wrote in a research note Friday, referring to the name of Bristol's trial, Checkmate-026 (the drugs are also referred to as "checkpoint" inhibitors). When Bristol released the results in August, they revealed only that the study didn't meet its primary goal: extending progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy. Sunday, Bristol is expected to share more detailed information on groups of patients in the trial, including those with PD-L1 expression of more than 50 percent. Most investors expect the results to be similar to Merck's, according to an investor survey from Evercore ISI's John Scotti. Though analysts caution the study was set up differently, so it may not show the same result. "Just to caveat, before everyone sees the analyses, Bristol's trial was not powered for this," Scotti told investors in a video last week. "There's probably going to be a lower amount of patients in the greater than 50 percent cutoff." The conference also will feature data from Roche's Genentech, which has another immunotherapy drug targeting PD-L1 rather than PD-1, called Tecentriq. It will have results in patients with lung cancer who have already tried other therapies. The FDA is expected to decide on whether to approve the drug in that indication later this month, after the company reported in August that it improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy. Merck has applied for approval of Keytruda in advanced first-line non-small cell lung cancer, with an FDA decision date of Christmas Eve. Bristol-Myers, because of its failed trial, is waiting for results from a study combining Opdivo with its other immunotherapy drug, Yervoy. And analysts say the field is already turning toward combination treatments for the disease. "There is still more to be learned," said Dr. Prasad Adusumilli, deputy chief of thoracic surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He's not affiliated with either company. "It's a new, novel treatment."

Merck KG, during an opening ceremony for the M-Lab collaboration center at the Techo Park IT Tower in Songdo, Incheon, Thursday. / Courtesy of Merck Korea By Yoon Sung-won SONGDO, Incheon ― Merck opened its ninth M-Lab collaboration center in Incheon, Thursday, as a channel to boost business ties with biopharmaceutical companies in Korea. At the opening ceremony, the German chemical and bio company highlighted its long-time partnership with Korean businesses and the country's aggressive drive to foster the biotechnology industry as the biggest reasons for establishing the collaboration center here. "We have run a business in Korea for more than 25 years and have closely cooperated with major businesses in their growth and success from the early stages," Merck Korea CEO Michael Grund said during a press conference in Songdo, Incheon. "Korea is looking for the next-generation growth engine from the biotechnology sector. We have opened the M-Lab center here to reenact the close cooperation that we had with the electronics and display panel industries in the past in the earliest stage of biotechnology here." The company said Korea has multiple new businesses in the bio sector with larger enterprises expanding manufacturing capacity of biopharmaceutical products such as biosimilars and vaccines. Besides the new M-Lab, Merck is operating multiple technology labs including liquid crystal display and organic light-emitting diode research facilities in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. Including Korea, Merck has a total of nine M-Lab centers in Brazil, France, India, Singapore, Japan, China, Taiwan and the United States. Merck also stressed that it has chosen Songdo as the location for its M-Lab center because of its value as one of the fastest growing biotechnology hubs around the globe. "In Korea, we recognized that Songdo embraces one of the fastest growing biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries," Merck Life Science CEO Udit Batra said. "In addition, we have made additional investments to establish the center to meet requests from our clients here. We expect to do so again in the future." Merck said the M-Lab center replaces the existing facilities in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province. According to Batra, Merck has invested about 10 million euros ($11.2 million) to upgrade the facility. "We decided to upgrade the facility after visiting Songdo two years ago to look around Samsung BioLogics' plant," Batra said. "At that time, I was impressed by spaces where I could virtually experience manufacturing facilities even without wearing a lab coat and actually going into the lines." Located on the 24th floor of Techno Park IT Tower in this city, the center will be operated by 10 Merck scientists and engineers. The new facility has actual manufacturing and testing environments to support an end-to-end production technology development. Clients will be able to test new practices and approaches in simplifying global technology transfer as well as manufacturing optimization and commercialization, the company said. "At the M-Lab Center, we are training clients' employees in development and production of bio products and we have our reservation list for this service fully booked for the next few months," Batra said. "In addition, customers can experience a demonstration of our products before deciding to buy them. They can also receive troubleshooting services if they face problems using them." Merck said M-Lab's clients will range from large enterprises to newborn businesses that develop cures for intractable diseases and tumors. In Korea, the German company has provided Samsung BioLogics and Celtrion with manufacturing technology and equipment for biopharmaceutical products. "Besides Samsung BioLogics and Celtrion, all businesses in the bio sector such as Korea Green Cross have contacted or worked with us," Batra said. "We are also closely cooperating with research and development agencies and seeking partnerships with more diverse bodies related to bio research and manufacturing." Samsung BioLogics CEO Kim Tae-han said, "The new M-Lab collaboration center will provide technological support for biopharmaceutical enterprises here and play a great role in training employees in this sector. Merck's decision to invest in Songdo is a milestone in the city's drive to foster the world's largest biopharmaceutical manufacturing hub with a total of 520,000 liters of production capacity by 2018. This will expedite the growth of both Korea's biopharmaceutical industry and Incheon's regional economy." yoonsw@ktimes.com 1. ONE MILLION protesters show people power 2.

Merck KG, during an opening ceremony for the M-Lab collaboration center at the Techo Park IT Tower in Songdo, Incheon, Thursday. / Courtesy of Merck Korea By Yoon Sung-won SONGDO, Incheon ― Merck opened its ninth M-Lab collaboration center in Incheon, Thursday, as a channel to boost business ties with biopharmaceutical companies in Korea. At the opening ceremony, the German chemical and bio company highlighted its long-time partnership with Korean businesses and the country's aggressive drive to foster the biotechnology industry as the biggest reasons for establishing the collaboration center here. "We have run a business in Korea for more than 25 years and have closely cooperated with major businesses in their growth and success from the early stages," Merck Korea CEO Michael Grund said during a press conference in Songdo, Incheon. "Korea is looking for the next-generation growth engine from the biotechnology sector. We have opened the M-Lab center here to reenact the close cooperation that we had with the electronics and display panel industries in the past in the earliest stage of biotechnology here." The company said Korea has multiple new businesses in the bio sector with larger enterprises expanding manufacturing capacity of biopharmaceutical products such as biosimilars and vaccines. Besides the new M-Lab, Merck is operating multiple technology labs including liquid crystal display and organic light-emitting diode research facilities in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. Including Korea, Merck has a total of nine M-Lab centers in Brazil, France, India, Singapore, Japan, China, Taiwan and the United States. Merck also stressed that it has chosen Songdo as the location for its M-Lab center because of its value as one of the fastest growing biotechnology hubs around the globe. "In Korea, we recognized that Songdo embraces one of the fastest growing biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries," Merck Life Science CEO Udit Batra said. "In addition, we have made additional investments to establish the center to meet requests from our clients here. We expect to do so again in the future." Merck said the M-Lab center replaces the existing facilities in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province. According to Batra, Merck has invested about 10 million euros ($11.2 million) to upgrade the facility. "We decided to upgrade the facility after visiting Songdo two years ago to look around Samsung BioLogics' plant," Batra said. "At that time, I was impressed by spaces where I could virtually experience manufacturing facilities even without wearing a lab coat and actually going into the lines." Located on the 24th floor of Techno Park IT Tower in this city, the center will be operated by 10 Merck scientists and engineers. The new facility has actual manufacturing and testing environments to support an end-to-end production technology development. Clients will be able to test new practices and approaches in simplifying global technology transfer as well as manufacturing optimization and commercialization, the company said. "At the M-Lab Center, we are training clients' employees in development and production of bio products and we have our reservation list for this service fully booked for the next few months," Batra said. "In addition, customers can experience a demonstration of our products before deciding to buy them. They can also receive troubleshooting services if they face problems using them." Merck said M-Lab's clients will range from large enterprises to newborn businesses that develop cures for intractable diseases and tumors. In Korea, the German company has provided Samsung BioLogics and Celtrion with manufacturing technology and equipment for biopharmaceutical products. "Besides Samsung BioLogics and Celtrion, all businesses in the bio sector such as Korea Green Cross have contacted or worked with us," Batra said. "We are also closely cooperating with research and development agencies and seeking partnerships with more diverse bodies related to bio research and manufacturing." Samsung BioLogics CEO Kim Tae-han said, "The new M-Lab collaboration center will provide technological support for biopharmaceutical enterprises here and play a great role in training employees in this sector. Merck's decision to invest in Songdo is a milestone in the city's drive to foster the world's largest biopharmaceutical manufacturing hub with a total of 520,000 liters of production capacity by 2018. This will expedite the growth of both Korea's biopharmaceutical industry and Incheon's regional economy." yoonsw@ktimes.com 1. ONE MILLION protesters show people power 2.

Rick Sibbel, DVM and Executive Director of Technical Services at Merck Animal Health, speaks with ThePigSite's Sarah Mikesell about antibiotic stewardship.   "At Merck, we are very interested in the prevention of disease and that solution is vaccines, and as a result, we believe the more prevention of disease that you have, the less antibiotics that you will ultimately need," said Rick Sibbel, DVM and Executive Director of Technical Services at Merck Animal Health. "To that end, one of the exciting products that we're bringing to the swine industry is Porcilis Ileitis. Ileitis is an enteric disease, a chronic problematic disease where malabsorption occurs due to the organism that causes the enteric problem." Having been on the market for about eight months, Sibbel said producers are seeing great progress in the field. "We've already seen that when our producers use our ileitis vaccine, they see less enteric disease which means less antibiotic use. That's just one example of the sort of antibiotic justification and stewardship that we believe in at Merck," he said. "We will continue to look at the prevention scene using vaccination as a tool to help with the antibiotic decision process and the antibiotic justification process." Ileitis is a finisher disease, meaning late stage finishers tend to have most of the problems with ileitis. Typically, it's the result of diet, fast growth rate and bacteria on the farm. It is a very impactful disease, and as with many swine diseases, it's not a big problem for some operations, while others must deal with it almost every day, he said. "Ileitis is in every country of the world, so it is a global issue. It's an organism that is ubiquitous in swine operations, and we expect the vaccine to have some application beyond the US borders as it gets registered in other countries," Dr. Sibbel concluded.

Located in the heart of Korea’s fast-growing biotechnology hub, Merck’s M Lab Collaboration Center is designed to provide local clients such as Samsung BioLogics, Celltrion and Green Cross with more comprehensive training and research and development guidance as well as improved after-sales services.   Merck Korea CEO Michael Grund (left) poses with Merck Life Science CEO Udit Batra (right) and Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, chairman of Merck’s family board and its parent company E. Merck KG during the opening ceremony of the M-Lab collaboration center held at the Techno Park IT Center in Songdo, Incheon, Thursday. Merck Korea “At our new center in Incheon, our clients will benefit from our deep technical expertise to develop processes for manufacturing drugs faster, safer and more effectively than ever before,” Udit Batra, CEO of Merck’s Life Sciences Division, said during a press conference held at the center Thursday. The center will also serve as a marketing space to draw new purchases and clients by showcasing Merck’s flagship products — such as base materials used in producing biologic drugs, laboratory systems and manufacturing equipment for biopharma production. The German multinational company invested some 10 million euros ($11.2 million) into building the M Lab Collaboration Center in Korea — which expands the services previously offered by its Biomanufacturing Sciences & Training Center in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province, built in 2012. It made the large-scale investment on the belief that Korea’s biotechnology sector will see robust growth in the years ahead, and in turn, boost the scale and competitiveness of Merck’s life sciences business in Korea, Batra said. The new Songdo-based M Lab also stands alongside others established by Merck worldwide — in the US, France, Brazil, India, China, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan. Looking ahead, Merck hopes to play a proactive role in supporting Korea’s new push into the biotechnology sector, similar to how it became a major supplier and partner to Korea’s top display-makers such as Samsung and LG from its early days, according to Merck Korea CEO Michael Grund. “The Korean industry is now moving in a different direction into the area of biotechnology and biopharmaceuticals, and consequently, we want to help them in the same way we did in the electronics area,” Grund said. Based in Darmstadt, Germany, Merck currently services diverse Korean clients in the field of life science, ranging from biopharma contract manufacturers and biologic drug developers to biotech start-ups, local academic institutions and research labs engaged in biotech research. The firm is also a major supplier of performance materials used for the production of liquid crystal displays as well as organic light-emitting diode panels.

(© Africa Studio/stock.adobe.com) ALLISON GATLIN 10/07/2016 Reprints BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Incyte (INCY) pulled a collective thumbs up Friday as Goldman Sachs upgraded its small cap and midcap biotech stock group to an attractive rating, citing R&D catalysts. That did little to help IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which closed down 0.1% on the stock market today but stayed above its 50-day line. The group is down 17 % for the year, but 2017 could be a turning point, says Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter. "Macro headwinds from drug pricing political rhetoric are likely to persist through year's end 2016, however, we see this group as relatively better positioned under a new administration than those relying on re-pricing of branded drugs," she wrote in a research report. Richter likes four vertical markets: central nervous system disorders, immuno-oncology, gene therapies and rare diseases. Central Nervous System Picks: AveXis, GW, Sage In the CNS circle, Richter recommends AveXis (AVXS), GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) and Sage Therapeutics (SAGE). She rates them all a buy, with respective price targets of 71, 189 and 65. CNS drugs have faced a maelstrom of challenges for FDA approval. Now, "we believe the molecular biology of the CNS is coming of age, spurred by a renewed interest in drug development in the space," Richter wrote. Bluebird (BLUE) also is active in the CNS market, working on a drug to treat congenital cerebral adreno-leukodystrophy. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Merck (MRK), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) are already in the immuno-oncology space, but Richter keys in on Incyte and Kite. A number of IO therapies work by introducing molecules to act as "brakes" on the immune system, providing a negative signal to tumor cells. Incyte, Kite Get Nod In Immuno-Oncology Incyte, too, is working on a "brake," Richter writes. "We view Incyte's epacadostat (which applies a 'brake' called IDO) as the next-generation checkpoint inhibitor," she wrote. Incyte and Merck recently yielded encouraging results by combining IDO and Keystruda to combat melanoma in a Phase 1 study. She has buy ratings on Incyte stock, which broke out on Sept. 28, and Kite stock, and respective price targets of 105 and 70. Richter recommends Bluebird and AveXis in gene therapies which "could provide potential one-shot cures in areas of high unmet need." Most drugs for genetic disorders treat symptoms vs. the actual disease, she writes. "Gene therapy is designed to address the underlying genetic defect by introducing a long-term (permanent) reservoir of functional genes into the patient," she wrote. But only two treatments have been approved — and neither in the U.S. Still, there's room for AveXis, Bluebird, BioMarin and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) to differentiate themselves as leaders in the space. All four have highly impressive clinical proof of concept, Richter wrote. Of the four, Spark stock alone get a neutral rating. The rest are rated buy. Richter expects Spark's voretigene neparvovec, a treatment for genetic blindness, to lead the way in setting regulatory, pricing and manufacturing standards as it appears prepped for FDA approval in 2017. BioMarin Said One Step Ahead In ERT BioMarin, Sanofi (SNY) and Shire (SHPG) lead on the rare disease front, but Richter only recommends the former — a midsize cap headed for large-size territory with a nearly $16 billion market cap. Incyte, too, is approaching large-cap size with its $18.2 billion market cap. Sanofi and Shire use enzyme-replacement therapies (ERT) to combat rare genetic disorders. The ERT models allows for premium pricing ($200,000 to $600,000 per year), lower expenses and regulatory hurdles, shorter development cycles, limited competition and tax incentives. But BioMarin is one step ahead, Richter says. She has a buy rating and 128 price target on BioMarin sock. "In contrast to chronic ERT drugs, gene therapy is designed to provide patients with a constant genetic source of correct protein and, in theory, no additional dosing events would be required," she wrote. IBD'S TAKE: BioMarin and Incyte are encroaching on large-cap territory, Richter says. But Amgen by far leads the space with a $125.1 billion market cap. Biogen leads IBD's 421-company group with a Composite Rating of 98, out of a best-possible 99. Get the Stock Checkup.

Further to the previously published abstract, today’s updated data show that among patients with treatment-naïve advanced melanoma (n=19), the combination of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab resulted in progression-free survival (PFS) rates of 74 percent and 57 percent at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. Median PFS has not been reached. The updated data also show an increase in the complete response (CR) rate to 26 percent. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) remained consistent with the previously published abstract data, at 58 percent and 74 percent, respectively. All responses are confirmed and ongoing (median follow-up among responders 56 plus [range of 46 to 90 plus] weeks). “We are excited to share further data with additional follow-up from the Phase 1 portion of the ECHO-202 study,” said Steven Stein, M.D., Incyte’s Chief Medical Officer. “The durable responses seen in patients with treatment-naïve advanced or metastatic melanoma reaffirm the activity of this immunotherapy combination, and we look forward to the read-out of ECHO-301, the ongoing, pivotal Phase 3 trial.” Epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab was well tolerated in the Phase 1 population (n=62). The most common (greater-than or equal to 15%) all grade treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were fatigue, rash, pruritus, arthralgia, diarrhea and nausea. Grade greater-than or equal to 3 TRAEs were observed in 19 percent of patients; the most common were rash (8%) and increased lipase (5%). Five patients (8%) discontinued treatment due to TRAEs. The ECHO-202 poster was made available to attendees at the ESMO Congress today, Friday, 7 October, and will be made available via the Events and Presentations tab of the Investor section of www.incyte.com. Incyte will host an investor conference call and webcast at 14:00 CET (8:00 a.m. ET) today, 7 October 2016, which can also be accessed via the Events and Presentations tab of the Investor section of www.incyte.com About ECHO-202 (KEYNOTE-037) The ECHO-202 study (NCT02178722) is evaluating the safety and efficacy of epacadostat, Incyte’s selective IDO1 inhibitor, in combination with pembrolizumab. Patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 therapies were excluded from this trial. Enrollment is complete for the Phase 1 dose escalation (epacadostat 25, 50, 100 mg BID + pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg IV Q3W and epacadostat 300 mg BID + pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W) and Phase 1 dose expansion (epacadostat 50, 100, and 300 mg BID + pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W) portions of the trial. Enrollment in Phase 2, tumor-specific, cohorts is ongoing. About ECHO The ECHO clinical trial program was established to investigate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat as a core component of combination therapy in oncology. Ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating epacadostat in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors collectively plan to enroll over 900 patients in a broad range of solid tumor types as well as hematological malignancies. ECHO-301 (NCT02752074), a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating pembrolizumab in combination with epacadostat or placebo for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, is also underway. ECHO-301 was initiated in June 2016 and initial data from this study are expected to be available in 2018. About Epacadostat (INCB024360) Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a key immunosuppressive enzyme that modulates the anti-tumor immune response by promoting regulatory T cell generation and blocking effector T cell activation, thereby facilitating tumor growth by allowing cancer cells to avoid immune surveillance. Epacadostat is a first-in-class, highly potent and selective oral inhibitor of the IDO1 enzyme that reverses tumor-associated immune suppression and restores effective anti-tumor immune responses. In single-arm studies, the combination of epacadostat and immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown proof-of-concept in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In these studies, epacadostat combined with the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab or the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab improved response rates compared with studies of the immune checkpoint inhibitors alone.

Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) By Tracy Seipel | tseipel@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: October 7, 2016 at 5:31 pm | UPDATED: October 20, 2016 at 4:32 pm   This is one in a series of fact-checks of ads running this campaign season. WHAT’S THE AD ABOUT? It targets Proposition 61, which would require the state to pay no more for prescription drugs than is paid for the same medication by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The federal agency negotiates drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, paying on average one-quarter less for drugs than other government agencies do. WHO’S FUNDING THE AD? The No on Prop. 61 campaign has so far raised $86.9 million, the largest war chest for a California proposition this year. The “no” side is backed primarily by pharmaceutical companies such as Merck, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Foster City-based Gilead Sciences. By comparison, the measure’s proponents have raised $14.5 million. WHAT DOES THE AD SAY? The ad begins with Mike King, a veteran of the first Gulf War, who is wearing a Veterans of Foreign Wars cap and a military shirt partially emblazoned with the American flag. “I think veterans should be taken care of across the board,” says the Sacramento County resident. While he speaks, a camera pans to U.S. troops marching in camouflage fatigues and desert boots. California VFW commander Dale Smith, an elderly San Diego County resident, takes over from there. He tells viewers that veterans get special pricing for their prescription drugs. As he speaks, the camera zooms in on a Department of Veterans Affairs building and a plaque framing a quote by President Abraham Lincoln, later adopted as the VA motto: “To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.” Smith, wearing a VFW cap and dark blazer adorned with war medals, then warns viewers: “But if Proposition 61 passes, then that would increase those medical costs for our veterans.” Finally, as an image of a little girl hugging her soldier father appears, Lamont Duncan, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who lives in Los Angeles County, says, “It would be terrible for veterans. They would have to pay more for prescription drugs. It’s not the way to go.” IS IT TRUE? The ad accurately reflects the concerns of veterans groups about Proposition 61 — namely, that it could potentially wipe out part of the steep VA drug discounts they now receive. While the measure would not affect the federally mandated 24 percent discount the VA gets on prescription drugs from pharmaceutical companies, it could put at risk additional negotiated discounts that in some cases bring the VA’s prescription drug savings to as much as 42 percent. The nonpartisan state Legislative Analyst’s Office says that to maintain drug manufacturers’ profits, the companies might decide to raise some VA drug prices. But the truth is no one knows for certain what will happen. Veterans groups point to what occurred in 1990, when the federal government factored VA pricing into state Medicaid rebate calculations. The U.S. Government Accountability Office later found that to compensate for their Medicaid losses, pharmaceutical companies in one year jacked up by tens of millions of dollars prescription drug costs for the VA and the Department of Defense. By 1992, a new federal law capped the price the VA can pay at 24 percent below the average manufacturers’ price. And price increases at the VA are now limited to the annual inflation rate. But a VA memo issued in August says if Proposition 61 passes, the department estimated it could lose $3.8 billion if pharmaceutical companies seek to recoup their losses. Proponents of the measure say that if drug prices do rise for veterans, it will have everything to do with the “the pharmaceutical industry’s punitive greed” and not Proposition 61.

Digital therapeutics -- "software as a drug" -- deploys software modules as an enhancement, or even a substitute, to a drug. It is poised to become a critical component of digital health and to substantially improve the efficiency of American healthcare. Psilos, a prominent digital health venture and growth stage investment firm, says digital therapeutics improves health outcomes by addressing chronic conditions through behavioral changes, before they become worse. The new generation of digital therapeutics is demonstrating clinical efficacy by marrying the latest developments in behavioral economics, smartphones, game-ification, biometric sensors, data analytics and artificial intelligence. The long-term goal of digital therapeutics is to bend the healthcare cost curve. Digital therapeutics is an important piece of healthcare's ongoing transition from "volume to value" to improve patients' health and complement in-office care, especially for tens of millions of patients in the early stages of chronic conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes, anxiety and stress disorders, and drug addictions. For these people, health self-management outside of a traditional medical setting is a major determinant of disease progression, as well as healthcare costs. Digital Therapeutics is a Huge Investment Opportunity The digital therapeutics market, currently a nascent, sub-$1 billion market, is poised to become a $6 billion market in five years, based on a recent research report by Goldman Sachs, supplemented by Psilos analysis. Joe Riley, a managing partner of Psilos Group and one of the authors of the report, said investments in digital therapeutics are being fueled by major healthcare players such as Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Amgen. "The potential growth of digital therapeutics is enormous and represents an incredible venture investment opportunity," Riley said. "As the moniker 'software as a drug' implies, digital therapeutics is delivering measurable and scientifically valid clinical endpoints by tying patients and health professionals together with web and phone interactions. Successful treatment of chronic diseases requires motivated, self-guided and persistent engagement, and this is where digital technology enters the picture and where we see the major investment opportunity," Riley added. Steve Krupa, another Psilos managing partner, said digital therapeutics combines proven clinical protocols and the science of behavioral economics with the collection, analysis and communication of patient data in real-time, using smart devices. "Today, the bulk of spending in American healthcare is focused on preventable, chronic diseases overwhelmingly rooted in behavior patterns," Krupa said. "This is a big piece of the overall solution to begin reversing an overwhelming problem once and for all." Companies Already Successful in Digital Therapeutics: HealthMine and Pear Therapeutics Two companies making progress in digital therapeutics include HealthMine, a Psilos portfolio investment, and Pear Therapeutics. HealthMine works behind the scenes of healthcare plans to compile data on the complete health of their members daily, including their medical and pharmaceutical histories and lab results. The information is processed through HealthMine's proprietary platform, which searches for irregularities such as abnormal heart rates, high glucose readings and high body mass indexes. For members whose health readout is suspect, HealthMine prescribes tailored programs from its 3,500 specific and actionable recommendations. Results have been impressive. A three-year HealthMine study of 120,000 people enrolled in its wellness programs found that far more than average visited doctors for preventive reasons accounting for 10 to 20 percent fewer hospital admissions, bed days and emergency room visits in the first year. Additional Validation Pear Therapeutics develops software and other products for a wide range of behavioral health disorders. Its digital therapies, called E-formulations, are mobile digital therapies that provide patients with a set of rewards linked to abstinence and completion of software modules. One such product is reSET, a treatment tool used in conjunction with face-to-face therapy to treat substance abuse disorders. More than 500 patients with substance abuse disorders in 10 treatment centers were split into two camps for 12 weeks of testing -- those who received traditional face-to-face therapy only and those who received a reduced amount of therapy plus reSET. Abstinence was measured twice weekly. Among patients who tested positive for drug use at the start of the study, 27 percent were abstinent in study weeks nine through 12, compared to only 3 percent of patients in the same period who relied on face-to-face therapy alone. Other Pear software-based clinical interventions are under development for the treatment of insomnia, traumatic brain injury, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, depression and acute and chronic pain. Excellent Growth Potential for Digital Therapeutics These commercial developments and others demonstrate that digital therapeutics, while still relatively nascent, is on a trajectory that will inevitably move up and to the right, Riley said. "Only recently has behavior modification been embraced as a first-line therapeutic alternative to pills for many of society's most challenging and costly chronic conditions," he said. "Now it's starting to get a bigger lift from digital therapy, and this is a key advance in how America can successfully combat the chronic disease epidemic." About Psilos Group Psilos Group, a digital health venture capital and growth stage investment firm, is partnering with companies that capitalize on the most disruptive trends in healthcare. The firm, founded in 1998 and headquartered in New York City, leverages the modern digital healthcare infrastructure to reduce costs and improve outcomes. Current investments include HealthEdge, HealthMine and PatientSafe Solutions. Other successful investments include ActiveHealth Management, Definity Health and Extend Health. This Outlook is the seventh for Psilos. Psilos Group's Managing Partner, Steve Krupa, also moderates a podcast called Breaking Health.

The center in Incheon, which is one of nine such centers around the world, provides biopharmaceutical manufacturers with a shared, exploratory environment. In the center, they can closely collaborate with MilliporeSigma scientists and engineers to accelerate development and production of new therapies. Udit Batra, CEO, MilliporeSigma, said, 'With a rapidly growing biopharmaceutical industry in Korea and demand for novel and cost-effective therapies worldwide, there is a clear need for innovative concepts like our M Lab Collaboration Centers.' MilliporeSigma said its decision to invest in Songdo, fast growing as world largest biologics manufacturing hub with 520 KL of plant capacity by 2018, represents a significant milestone in the development of the Songdo Bio Cluster. It is expected that the Cluster will accelerate the future growth of Incheon as well as Korean Biopharmaceutical industry.

Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Oct 5, 2016 at 9:45PM Image source: Getty Images. Drug giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is back full circle. After years of Wall Street speculation about whether the company would split into stand-alone parts, CEO Ian Read recently announced management's decision: no split. You could almost hear the collective gnashing of teeth by investment bankers, who thereby lost millions of dollars in transaction fees. But let's not waste any tears on that group, because this stock is back in the game. With Pfizer down almost 10% from its August high, shares are approaching the point where they present an opportunity for long-term investors. That's particularly true for income seekers, because Pfizer's dividend now yields 3.5%, the third-highest dividend in drug stocks. Of course, like practically every big pharma, Pfizer has struggled with the loss of exclusivity on key drugs -- notably Lipitor, once the best-selling drug of all time. But Pfizer has introduced a number of fast-selling therapies recently, and its pipeline and mergers and acquisitions provide major growth opportunities. Let's quickly review three reasons to buy as well as two near-term risks.   Appealing dividend for yield-starved investors Only two major drug manufacturers offer a higher dividend yield than Pfizer: GlaxoSmithKline at 5.1%, and Sanofi at 4.4%. But there are questions about the safety of Glaxo's superior dividend, with its lead drug Advair facing the risk of generic competition in one to three years. And Sanofi's stock is down in the dumps, with its key diabetes market franchise under pressure from heavy competition and patents on best-seller insulin Lantus having expired. Meanwhile, a 3.5% dividend is nothing to sneeze at, not in today's yield-starved world. While nothing beats Johnson & Johnson's 53-year track record of dividend increases, here's Pfizer's comparative performance on other key dividend metrics: Data source: FactSet. Table by author. Blockbuster revenue from superstar drugs Pfizer's new drugs are providing more than protection against various diseases; they are providing generous protection for Pfizer's growth and earnings as well. Pfizer's heavy-hitter breast cancer med Ibrance looks set to be a $4 billion drug. Last quarter, it generated $514 million globally, which was not too shabby for its fourth quarter of commercial availability. Assuming Ibrance can be expanded to new indications -- which seems likely based on its outsized success in its phase 3 Paloma trials -- this drug is just getting started. Also showing up strong last quarter, and likely in future quarters, was Eliquis, for stroke prevention, and Xeljanz, for rheumatoid arthritis. But it's Pfizer's Prevnar-led vaccine franchise that is doing the heavy lifting right now. Going back to full-year 2015, the franchise notched $6.25 billion in revenue. Comparatively, Merck KGaA's HPV vaccines trailed at a far-distant second place of $2.47 billion a year. Pfizer's vaccines showed huge 40% year-over-year growth (or more) each quarter in 2015. While growth slowed in 2016, Prevnar received expanded FDA approval in adults 19 to 49 this July. That could see it begin ramping back up again. Pfizer's fast-growing therapies are not just making up for patent losses; they led the new-drug division to 17% operational growth year over year in the second quarter. Overall, the division's revenue clocked in at $13.1 billion, a year-over-year change of 11% over $11.9 billion in the same period last year. Pipeline and acquisitions recharging the batteries Long-term growth in a company such as Pfizer is built around its pipeline and acquisitions. Fortunately for the drug maker, it has one of the largest pipelines in the industry, with over 90 clinical trials ongoing. Of the nine drugs in registration phase, several should provide near-term catalysts. Avelumab (co-developed with Merck KGaA) has a blockbuster sales potential of $4 billion to $6 billion, although Merck KGaA would claim the lion's share of the revenue. Meanwhile, a drug from Pfizer's buyout of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, eczema treatment crisaborole, could see sales of $2 billion, with a regulatory decision in January 2017. In terms of other acquisitions, the biggest headline in biotech in recent weeks was Pfizer's $14 billion buyout of Medivation. The prize netted was Xtandi, a prostate cancer drug which saw $2.2 billion in sales over the past year. Pfizer has a bold plan for growth in oncology, and with Xtandi's sales projected to reach $4.8 billion by 2020, the company now owns two of the top 10 leading cancer drugs.  Image source: Pfizer. And then there's Pfizer's $17 billion acquisition of biosimilars giant Hospira, which is already paying off big time. Thanks to Hospira, Pfizer's slower-growing essential health division posted 19% operational growth in the last quarter year over year. What could go wrong? Two words of caution Pfizer presents a company-specific risk in CEO Ian Read's ill-advised hunger for megadeals. Read took a proverbial pie in the face when Pfizer's 2014 leap at British-based AstraZeneca failed. Seemingly undeterred, that was followed by another ill-fated megamerger attempt with Ireland's Allergan. Fortunately, more recently, Read has been focusing on smaller bolt-on acquisitions, such as Anacor Pharmaceuticals and Medivation. But there's no guarantee he has actually learned. The other risk is that Pfizer has been fending off relentless pressure from analysts to break up for years, so we could see analyst downgrades coming. Since these tend to come in groups, that could pressure shares. On the other hand, earlier this year Pfizer approved a $5 billion accelerated stock repurchase, which could help put a floor under the share price. All in all, the catalysts for outperformance are out there for this blue chip. And for those who aren't overly concerned with the chance for more downside on the short term, I'd say -- don't dive in headfirst, for heaven's sake. But consider dipping in a toe -- the water should be fine. Cheryl Swanson owns shares of Allergan and Johnson and Johnson. The Motley Fool recommends AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson.

However, the small increase in layoffs over the month isn't considered significant by economists, especially taking into account Florida's trend of lower unemployment this year. So far in 2016, planned layoffs by employers have decreased by 29 percent to 11,916, compared with 16,729 a year ago. Of September's planned job cuts, 11 percent were in South Florida: 40 at AXA Assistance USA and 112 at Merck & Co., both in Miami, according to Challenger's data. Nationwide, employers announced plans to lay off 44,324 workers in September, a decrease of 25 percent from September 2015. Employers have announced 435,612 planned job cuts so far this year. That is 12 percent less than the 493,431 job cuts reported through nine months of 2015. "Heavy job-cutting in the energy sector defined the first half of the year. But each quarter has seen the number of overall job cuts decline, as this sector stabilized and the economy continued to improve," said John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. mpounds@sunsentinel.com or 561-243-6650 Copyright © 2016, Sun Sentinel Job Layoffs Unemployment and Layoffs John Challenger Florida's planned layoffs down 85 percent from year ago, firm says South Florida's job growth continues to be strong, state says All Sections News Sports Broward Palm Beach Entertainment Classified Obituaries 76°

The other thing that won three in a row which gets your attention they. I think Herbert strong defense team that you know it has sucked some weapons on offense but I opened the quarterback situation that soaked them I think. You know they're currently Epoch in a war over a picture prop jet to play. According back so they don't quit kicking him and it remains to be seen went off on Greek up and ready to play the other get a really good running back and talk early in America every trouble heavily black informant pinning him in that space that we could make plays. He comfortably either so that's the appropriate corporate front replica of the secrets of line including. Aron Donald a third year player commitment people think as opposed to cut square leaker. MR Marcel Barry's making his return for the bills this would be just what this does that mean for the buffalo defense. Related to reduce. On the front line there as an opportunity because they're at bell Marcel. And the way I realized he say he wasn't. Clinical policy you will be here after you support it but the ability guys can require multiple offensive players in particular Merck had mentioned that. The strength of this team is not the silly it is not drop a line and that's W queries creates some problems up and so I would that.

Our John oh win this Sunday would be the first three game winning streak in oh long long time to.

Well I mean I don't think anybody looked at like a long entry in a row order role I think we built because the start because of the to block the start with you. And so the mine. One were better than it's been true but to start second wind on top of each other. I think they're pretty much the way to approach you know just and a of work this week in and beat about the week and at the end of the week and and I looked up to regard. If you play well that you work at it and if you break them up and you got to. A two game win streak or three gangster like wrote in five years of growth.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with YHOO. Click here to check it out. ABBV 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of ABBV Peter Lynch Chart of ABBV "We identified 24 cases of HBV reactivation reported to FDA and from the published literature in HCV/HBV co-infected patients treated with DAAs during the 31 months from Nov. 22, 2013 to July 18. This number includes only cases submitted to FDA so there are likely additional cases about which we are unaware. Of the cases reported, two patients died and one required a liver transplant." (FDA) During the clinical trials, the DAA was tested on patients infected with HCV only, excluding those who were co-infected with HBV because the FDA wanted to assess the risk of developing side effects on patients with HCV only. In the clinical trials the possibility that this type of treatment could lead to a reactivation of hepatitis B virus on HCV patients who also had HBV was not taken into account. That's why the FDA is now requiring adding the boxed warning to the labels of these medications. The black-box warning refers to Sovaldi and Harvoni from Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD), Viekira Pak from AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) and Zepatier from Merck & Co. (MRK). View photos Source: FDA But what is not clear from the FDA's safety announcement is how many HCV/HBV co-infected patients were treated with these prominent and expensive medications. Twenty-four cases of HBV reactivation in 31 months seems to be a statistically insignificant number. Approximately 3% of the world's population (150 million to 200 million people) live with chronic hepatitis C and about 3.5 million new diagnoses of infection from hepatitis C virus are made every year. There are different genotypes of the virus and the World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented a classification that includes 11 genotypes. In the U.S., about 70% of hepatitis C infection cases are just related to genotype 1. Revenue from the sale of direct-acting antiviral drugs for the treatment of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) accounts for approximately 23% of total net revenues of Gilead Sciences, AbbVie and Merck combined. The figures will increase as Viekira Pak receives approval from additional geographies, and Zepatier receives approval from the EU where it is currently under review for the treatment of chronic HCV. AbbVie and Merck have gained 10% and 20% on the New York Stock Exchange year to date. Gilead Sciences has lost 21% on the NASDAQ. View photos AbbVie is trading around $62.93 versus average analysts price target of $71.28, Merck is trading around $61.97, and Gilead is trading around $76.80 versus average analysts price target of $102.94.

Administrator: Mylan Has Overcharged Medicaid For EpiPen By At Least 10% Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Administrator: Mylan Has Overcharged Medicaid For EpiPen By At Least 10% Image courtesy of Phillip Bradshaw October 6, 2016 2:21 pm EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave oh mylan-ta epipen Mylan cms medicaid drug prices Though the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment has been around for decades, the increased demand for the drug and its soaring price tag have caused Medicaid spending on EpiPen to go from around $66 million in 2011 to $365 million in 2015. All this time, claims Andrew Slavitt, Acting Administrator for the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mylan’s parent company has been shortchanging Medicaid on rebates. As we’ve mentioned in previous stories, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires drugmakers to pay back a portion of their Medicaid revenue to the states through rebates. The size of those rebates is determined by whether the drug is considered an “innovator” medication (often a newer, higher-cost drug with little or no competition) or a “non-innovator multiple source” (NIMS) drug (often an older drug with competition from generics). Since 2010, the rebate rate for a NIMS drug is 13% of the average manufacturer price during the rebate period. Innovator drugs face a significantly higher rebate, of at least 23.1%. Drug companies are effectively on their honor to properly categorize a drug with the rebate program, though any drugmaker found to have deliberately mis-categorized an innovator drug as NIMS to avoid the higher rebate rate could face significant penalties. Which brings us to EpiPen. In a letter [PDF] sent yesterday to Sen. Ron Wyden (OR), Acting Administrator Slavitt confirms earlier reports that CMS had recently determined that Mylan had inaccurately categorized EpiPen as a NIMS drug. In fact, the NIMS categorization goes back two decades, long before Mylan acquired EpiPen as part of its purchase of Merck’s generics business. Toward the end of 1997, the company that then owned EpiPen changed the classification from single-source to multiple-source, even though competition in this market has been few and far between. “EpiPen is approved under a New Drug Application by the Food and Drug Administration, has patent protection, and has no FDA-approved therapeutic equivalents,” writes Slavitt. “These facts indicate EpiPen does not meet the definition of a multiple source drug, but, in fact, meets the definition of a single source drug or brand drug.” Between 2011 and 2015, according to the letter, Medicaid has paid a total of $960 million toward EpiPen purchases. Because of the NIMS classification, Mylan has only paid a rebate rate of 13%. Medicaid’s net spending on the drug during those years was around $797 million, but should have been significantly less, claims Slavitt, who claims the CMS has expressly told Mylan that EpiPen is mis-classified. He also notes that CMS has not yet determined how much Mylan should owe because of this alleged error. “When it comes to CMS’s attention that the manufacturer’s categorization is incorrect, CMS notifies the manufacturer and tries to reach an agreement,” he explains. Manufacturers caught incorrectly categorizing drugs in the rebate program could be in violation of the False Claims Act for overcharging the government, which comes with potential financial penalties. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey has already announced that his office is actively investigating whether or not EpiPen’s apparent mis-categorization amounts to Medicaid fraud. Last week, several U.S. senators wrote to Attorney General Loretta Lynch calling for the Department of Justice to probe this matter.

The global ion-exchange chromatography market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.96% during the period 2016-2020. According to the report, rise in global expenditure on R&D is one of the drivers promoting growth. The global expenditure on R&D has shown consistent growth in the last 10 years. It went up from $522 billion in 1996 to $1.3 trillion in 2009. In 2014, it was an estimated $1.6 trillion. With the economies of developing countries growing faster than that of developed countries, these emerging countries are expected to have more research facilities and institutes being set up over the next five years. This increase in the number of research and testing facilities, particularly in the field of pharmaceutical and biotechnology, will lead to a rise in demand for laboratory analysis equipment such as ion exchange chromatography instruments, reagents, and other consumables. Further, the report states that high TCO is one of the challenges that the market is facing. On average, any chromatography instrument or system will set a user back by an estimated $3,900. The cost will increase when the system needs to be customized to the working environment, which includes adding accessories that need to be purchased with it or customizing its sample handling settings. The cost of the equipment also depends on the level of accuracy that they can provide when it comes to processing, detection, and analyzing.

The Investor talked with various corporate representatives to see how they are coping with the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act that went into effect on Sept. 28. The law limits public officials, journalists and private school teachers to giving or receiving a meal more than 30,000 won (US$26.95), a gift of more than 50,000 won and a congratulatory or condolence payment of more than 100,000 won. Any type of illicit solicitation is prohibited as well.  Industry sources say foreign companies have been preparing heavily for the law, drafting manuals and revising their internal code way ahead of the enactment. “Foreign firms sought legal advice even before the Constitutional Court upheld the new law as constitutional in July,” said Lee Kwang-wook, a lawyer and partner at local law firm Yoon & Yang. These firms, according to the attorney, were in a hurry to prepare because their Korean offices were as vulnerable to the new law as their purely domestic counterparts. “It’s true foreign firms are under strict compliance rules from their home countries, but when it comes to their operations in South Korea, such as sales and PR activities, as well as working with government officials, they are not too different from local companies because they are basically working in a Korean business environment,” he said. According to industry insiders, the automobile, pharmaceutical and financial industries, seemed likely to be most affected due to the new law. No more lavish marketing campaigns To avoid trouble, foreign automakers are cutting down on marketing campaigns. In the past, a new car launching event was usually held at five-star hotels in Seoul, complete with the media and high-profile industry figures. Sumptuous meals and expensive thank you gifts were part of the perks. But under the new law, lavish press conferences are no longer an option. A press conference held on Sept.29 -- a day after the anti-graft law went into effect -- by British supercar Rolls-Royce Motors Cars was one example of how such events will be handled in the future. Neither lunch nor gifts were offered. Although, the company did offer a bus ride to the venue, along with some finger food and soft drinks. Then there’s the issue of test-driving. In the past, automakers allowed reporters to drive their new car for a few days in return for media coverage. These cars were provided with a full gas tank that did not require to be refilled. The expense for offering such cars, however, easily exceeds the limit stipulated in the anti-graft law. But as test-drives are a big part of marketing, carmakers are contemplating how to work around the law. Mercedes-Benz, which is planning on releasing a new model later this year, said it will hold test-driving events complying with the new law.  Crackdown on pharma sector corruption The anti-graft law is also expected to deal a major blow to the pharmaceutical industry that is notorious for offering kickbacks to doctors. Just last month, former and current officials of the Korean unit of Swiss-based Novartis were indicted for paying billions of won as rebates to doctors for prescribing its products. Doctors and workers at major hospitals are now subject to the new law as they are classified as government officials, if they work at a public hospital, and as faculty members, if they work for university hospitals. Law violators can face up to 30 million won fine or imprisonment for a maximum of three years. Foreign pharma firms, such as MSD Korea -- the local affiliate of US-based Merck & Co. -- and the Korean unit of UK-based GlaxoSmithKline, are educating employees to avoid any fallout. “We are communicating with the employees, along with our legal team, to help them avoid any breach of law,” a spokesperson of MSD Korea said. But the situation is not easy, pharma firms said, because some doctors are refusing to meet with their sales representatives altogether. Major university hospitals, such as Seoul National University Hospital and Korea University Hospital, have posted notices throughout their buildings warning the staff about the new law.  Ambiguous interpretation causes confusion in financial sector In finance and banking sectors, firms are on a high alert due to the ambiguous clauses in the anti-graft law. “When the government entrusts funds or delegates authorities to financial institutions, both local and foreign, they become fiduciaries and are subject to the law,” said Yang Ho-seung, managing partner at Yoon & Yang law firm. But the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission -- the state entity in charge of the law -- hasn’t made an authoritative interpretation on the status of bank employees when they perform government services or deal with bureaucrats, causing further chaos. The Korea Federation of Banks -- the association of local and foreign banks in Korea -- is waiting for the commission’s response. In the meantime, the association has asked the banks to limit their activities so that all costs stay under the figures stipulated in the new law. Foreign securities firms that also work closely with government organizations and media outlets have become extremely prudent. “Golf outings with investors and journalists have all been canceled,” according to a senior official at a foreign security firm, who declined to be named. “Brokerage firms and financial institutions acquire government approval for new financial products,” said Lee of Yoon & Yang. “But now these processes may be delayed since bankers are reluctant to contact government officials.” By Ahn Sung-mi (sahn@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

Column: What role do point-of-care devices have in firefighter rehab? The ability to rapidly and reliably perform laboratory testing at the patient bedside has taken huge leaps in recent years. There are devices to quickly check a patient’s blood sugar, electrolytes, INR, cardiac enzymes, lactic acid and other biomarkers. Do these devices have a role in the rehab area, or are they only suited for in-hospital care? Glucometers, pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (CO) oximetry are all common in EMS, but the use of i-STAT or other point-of-care testing devices is a bit outside the norm of November 9, 2016 News Sublette County Rural Health Care District Appoints New EMS Director Sublette County Rural Health Care District Appoints New EMS Director The Sublette County Rural Health Care District (SCRHCD) is pleased to announce that it recently appointed a new Director of EMS Services.

Let’s block November 2, 2016 Home Business Just as you suspected all along: Firing middle managers is good for business Business Just as you suspected all along: Firing middle managers is good for business Tweet Pin It If you’ve spent any time working on the bottom rungs of the corporate ladder, you’ve probably wondered exactly what your better-paid supervisor does. It turns out the answer is just what you learned from “Office Space”: Middle managers do a whole lot of nothing. Today nearly 1 in 5 employees in the United States are tasked with overseeing the producers in a company — representing a ratio that’s at a historic high, according to a recent Harvard Business Review article. The layer of managers and administrators wedged between C-suite executives and rank-and-file employees is so thick yet ineffectual that if you removed most of them, according to the authors Gary Hamel and Michele Zanini, it would have no measurable impact on a company’s output and it could actually improve workplace culture. The number of company overseers, reviewers and approvers – in charge of everything from tracking employee output to filling out human resources documents – has doubled since the early 1980s. By comparison, the number of other types of positions in America has grown by 40 percent, according to an analysis of U.S. Bureau of Economic data by Hamel and Zanini, who are management consultants. These two anti-bureaucracy crusaders found that America’s workplaces have one manager or administrator for every four to five employees. It’s fair to say then, extrapolating from their report, that these 21 million middle managers are so underutilized, they would literally be more productive cleaning the restrooms. Plus, these managers, supervisors and administrators take home about 30 percent of the nation’s total compensation. According to Hamel and Zanini, redeploying these supervisory workers in jobs as productive as the ones performed by their subordinates would boost the national gross domestic product by $3 trillion, amounting to an increase in value to the economy of $141,000 per employee. Productivity in the U.S. workforce, or the amount of goods and services that workers produce over a specific period of time, has been climbing in recent decades — especially among nonsupervisory employees. From 1973 to 2014, nonsupervisory employees have become over 70 percent more productive, according to research released last year by the Economic Policy Institute. (This research doesn’t take into account that U.S. worker productivity slowed down in the first half of this year.) While some of this long-term upsurge in productivity can be attributed to technological advances, like desktop publishing and automation, lower-tier U.S. employees have also been pushed to work longer hours than ever before, often without overtime compensation. Hamel, a London Business School professor and founder of the business-innovation think tank Management Lab in Woodside, California, and Zanini, the co-founder of Boston-based Management Innovation eXchange, are challenging employers to change the way they structure their staffs. The two researchers point to examples of companies that have pared back their bureaucracies to positive effect. Among them is Nucor, a North Carolina steel producer that is run with one manager for every 10 employees. “Nucor’s revenue per employee is nearly twice that of similarly sized U.S. Steel and nearly three times that of ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel producer,” the authors wrote in another Harvard Business Review article in July. Other companies that greatly reduced the number of managers include Delaware-based W.L. Gore & Associates, producer of fluoropolymer-based Gore-Tex fabrics; California’s Morning Star, one of the world’s top tomato growers; and Washington-based computer-game developer Valve. They have done so by empowering employees working in teams that can make smarter decisions faster than an organization built on a pyramid of hierarchy. In 2013, Roger Perlmutter, the president of Merck Research Laboratories, noted that the best way for drug companies to reduce their soaring coasts was to “scrape off the top five levels of management, including myself.” Companies have been great at getting the most out of their employees, either by squeezing more hours out of them, automating or outsourcing their jobs or just good old-fashioned “restructuring,” which is corporate-speak for laying off a bunch of people. Perhaps it’s time for business owners to begin to look for ways to improve productivity and profitability before doling out pink slips to their hardest-working staff.

5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Biological drugs are typically derived from living cells and are used in the prevention and treatment of various diseases such as cancer, blood disorders, auto-immune diseases and other medical conditions. Biological drugs have more complex structures compared to that of conventional drugs. These are highly sensitive and more difficult to characterize and develop. A biological drug typically has around 250 in-process tests during manufacturing compared to around 50 tests for a conventional drug. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and growing geriatric population are the major drivers of the global biological drugs market. In addition, various government associations are also supporting the growth of the biological drugs market. Furthermore, advancements in biomedical science hold immense potential for the growth of the biological drugs market. However, high costs of biological drugs and patent expiry of blockbuster drugs impede the growth of the biological drugs market. Moreover, risks of adverse effects associated with biologic injectable drugs are also inhibiting the growth of the biological drugs market. In terms of geography, North America dominates the global biological drugs market. This is due to increasing use of biological drugs for the treatment of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. In addition, various government associations are promoting the usage of biological drugs in North America. For instance, in 2012, the American College of Rheumatology – an organization that advances rheumatology through education and research – recommended biologic agents and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In Europe, the biological drugs market is growing due to increasing aging population in the region. According to a UN report, elderly people accounted for 23.2% of the total population in Germany in 2000, and the number is expected to reach 33.2% by 2025. Aging can lead to certain disorders such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, which require biological drugs for their effective treatment. Low manufacturing costs in Asia attract biopharmaceutical companies to invest in the region. For instance, Lonza – a Switzerland-based biotechnology company – invested around US$ 350 Mn in Singapore and India, in order to encourage biological activities. This report provides in-depth analysis and estimation of the biological drugs market for the period 2014–2020, considering 2014 as the base year for the calculation. In addition, data pertaining to current market dynamics, including market drivers, restraints, trends, and recent developments, has been provided in the report. The global biological drugs market is categorized based on therapeutic protein, monoclonal antibodies (mAb), and vaccines. Based on therapeutic protein, the market segments include Enbrel, Lantus, Neulasta, Avonex, NovoLog, Rebif, Humalog, Aranesp, Epogen, Levemir, Victoza, Betaseron, Neupogen, and Eylea. Based on mAb, the report comprises Humira, Remicade, Rituxan, Avastin, Herceptin, and Lucentis. The vaccine segment is further sub-segmented into Prevnar 13, Gardasil, Fluzone, Varivax, and Cervarix. On the basis of geography, the report identifies and analyzes the market size and predictions for North America, Europe, Asia, and Rest of the World (RoW).
