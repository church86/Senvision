2017, 07:30 ET Share this article AUSTIN, Texas, April 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ClearDATA announced today that it raised $12 million to support its continued high growth. The proceeds will be used primarily to expand the company's presence in the marketplace and for continued product innovation. The financing will support a significant expansion of ClearDATA's healthcare-exclusive, HIPAA-compliant cloud. Investors include Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, Norwest Venture Partners, Excel Venture Management, Heritage Group, HLM Venture Partners, and Flare Capital Partners. Each of these investors previously participated in ClearDATA's prior $25 million financing. "ClearDATA has achieved considerable revenue and customer growth year-over-year, in parallel with—and influencing—the healthcare industry's mainstream adoption of the cloud," said Robert Abbott, Norwest Venture Partners. "As such, the company's investors are pleased to preemptively add growth capital to accelerate widespread public cloud adoption in the healthcare arena." Bill Geary, co-founder and partner at Flare Capital Partners, noted ClearDATA's penetration into multiple healthcare markets addressing a broad set of needs. "ClearDATA's solution offerings are getting impressive customer traction with leading payers, providers and life sciences organizations who no longer seek to just host their data in the cloud, although that remains key. Now organizations are seeing they can use the cloud to aggregate massive data sets for quality predictive analytics, to collaboratively conduct clinical research and to scale virtual care, patient engagement and more," Geary said. "The healthcare digital revolution is in full swing," said Darin Brannan, CEO of ClearDATA. "But mission-driven healthcare organizations want to stay focused on caring for patients, building great software, or serving their members, not on being IT security or cloud compliance experts. Combining the technology aspect of the cloud with the healthcare aspects of compliance, comprehensive security, and regulatory support has resulted in continued market traction with 98% year-over-year growth in our core subscription services. This is testament to our success in helping healthcare leverage the public cloud for agility, scale, and cost while enhancing security and compliance." Industry recognition In 2016, ClearDATA ranked 26th on Entrepreneur magazine's Entrepreneur 360™ List, an annual ranking of the best private companies in America, and was ranked the highest in the local Austin, TX market where it is headquartered. This followed closely on the heels of ClearDATA being named in the Gartner "Cool Vendors in Healthcare Payers, 2016" report. ClearDATA was also selected to participate in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Public Sector Partner Network, a credential reserved for companies that provide superior customer service and expertise in building and migrating customer solutions on AWS. Additionally, ClearDATA was one of the first to achieve AWS Healthcare Competency, a distinction that requires companies to pass a stringent healthcare competency audit. AWS introduced the credential to highlight partners with demonstrated success in building solutions for healthcare payers and providers that can securely store, process, transmit and analyze clinical information. ClearDATA has tremendous support from the healthcare technology industry's leading venture capital firms—Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, Norwest Venture Partners (NVP),  Heritage Group, Excel Venture Management,  HLM Venture Partners and Flare Capital Partners—all of whom have deep ties with the country's largest and most influential network of healthcare providers, payers and other healthcare entities. There are now more than 30 major healthcare brands indirectly supporting ClearDATA via these strategic healthcare venture capital firms, including: Intermountain Healthcare, Cardinal Health, Memorial Hermann, LifePoint Health, Health Care Service Corporation, UnityPoint Health, Trinity Health (Livonia, MI), Tenet Health, Community Health Systems and more.

Merck reports financial results Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) AUSTIN (KXAN) — A big name in healthcare could be moving to Austin and bringing 600 jobs with an average salary of $84,000. Thursday, Austin City Council decided to provide some big incentives to encourage Merck to set up shop in the city. It’s the latest big name company that has its sights set on Austin where company officials say they want to set up an information technology hub. Essentially, they want to invest $28 million in the city over 10 years to create and develop applications for better health and lifestyle decisions. City council approved a $856,000 incentive package to cover that time period. How it works is, the company would receive periodic payments for meeting certain benchmarks, like the number of people they hire, using local contractors and having a diverse staff. Merck’s proposal to the city Both Merck and city officials think a lot more than 600 jobs will be created because other companies will move to Austin to work with Merck and the company will contract with other businesses that often utilize more middle-skilled workers. One of the big commitments Merck is promising is to work with local universities to prepare students for jobs with the company. “They are looking to work with groups like Austin Community College, Huston Tillotson, St. Edwards and of course the University of Texas and how it is they can grow that local talent supply so over that ten year period of the agreement they can hire people who are in 7th and 8th grade today,” says David Colligan, Merck’s Global Business Expansion manager. K2, I-35 underpass lighting also on Thursday’s Austin City Council agenda Merck has plans to move in to the city immediately and begin constructing a permanent facility in 2018 in the central business district or the Dell Medical Innovation Zone with an expected completion of 2020. The company is, however, considering several cities across the country for their new facility. This is the second time in three years the city has voted on providing a company an incentive to expand to Austin. In 2014, Athena Health, Websense and Dropbox were part of the city’s first ever economic incentive proposal. All three moved to the city. City officials are now looking to expand Austin’s food and fashion industry – but no specific deals have been worked out yet. Merck could look to hire almost immediately.

While common, experts say these kinds of relationships raise conflict of interest concerns and must be carefully navigated. Here's a quick look at how Noseworthy, a neurologist by training, might manage his dual roles as Mayo's CEO and Merck board member. 1) How unusual it is for someone of Noseworthy's stature to serve on a pharmaceutical's board? It's not that unusual. Noseworthy will join high ranking medical professionals from Johns Hopkins, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on the Merck board. Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed 41 board members of the 50 biggest drug companies held leadership positions in American medical colleges. • Related: Dayton concerned by Mayo Clinic favoring privately insured patients Supporters of these ties say bringing people who run world renowned medical centers like Mayo Clinic together with the pharmaceutical industry can improve medicine. Drug companies, they say, can learn a lot about patient care from people like Noseworthy. And it can go both ways. In a statement, a Mayo spokesperson said that the appointment will give the hospital another lens into the "highly complex health care marketplace and to anticipate major trends in the pharmaceutical industry that may affect patients." 2) What's the concern then about a hospital CEO sitting on drug company board? Anyone who sits on the board of a drug company has a fiduciary responsibility to that company — you work for shareholders. For hospitals, where these drugs are administered and sometimes even tested in clinical trials, the relationship raises some important questions. A hospital executive who sits on a drug company board could feel pressure to get his hospital to buy the drug company's products. Hypothetically speaking, Noseworthy's presence on the board could potentially "give Merck a leg up" inside Mayo, said Dr. Eric Campbell, a Harvard Medical School professor who researches physician conflicts of interest. "It could increase the likelihood that the patients who are seen there will get Merck drugs," he said. "It could also create the impression that the Mayo Clinic is endorsing Merck." These tricky relationships aren't limited to hospital executives who sit on the boards of drug companies, he added. His research suggests that 85 percent of doctors have some form of a relationship with pharmaceutical companies. 3) What is Mayo saying about how it will handle these potential conflicts? Mayo says its board of trustees and board of governors carefully vetted the appointment and ultimately decided that the board position would raise Mayo's credibility rather than dilute it. The clinic also says a conflict of interest plan is being developed and that it will be monitored by an oversight committee. Practically speaking, Noseworthy will recuse himself from decisions involving Merck, including decisions about drug purchasing, business relationships and research initiatives. Mayo also said that Noseworthy will disclose his board membership when speaking publicly about pharmaceutical industry issues. 4) Will Noseworthy be paid? Yes, he will. His compensation for serving on the Merck board will include $110,000 in compensation and $170,000 in deferred stock per year. Mayo said this is standard practice for Merck's board members and that it adheres to Mayo policies that allow employees to be paid for board work done on personal time. Mayo says that it actually lags other prestigious hospitals that have leaders on drug and medical device company boards. So, Mayo's own Board of Trustees is interested in having more of its leaders serve in similar roles in the future. The trustees believe that these memberships will only expand the experience and insights of clinic employees.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News IntelGenx and RedHill Biopharma Announce Marketing Approval of RIZAPORT(R) for Migraines in Luxembourg /EINPresswire.com/ — SAINT LAURENT, QUEBEC–(Marketwired – Apr 13, 2017) – The national marketing approval in Luxembourg completes the current approval process of RIZAPORT® under the European Decentralized Procedure („DCP„); RIZAPORT® is also approved for marketing in Germany and a national Marketing Authorization Application („MAA„) has been submitted in Spain RIZAPORT® is a proprietary oral thin film formulation of rizatriptan for the treatment of acute migraines Commercialization agreements for RIZAPORT® were signed with Grupo JUSTE S.A.Q.F (now Exeltis Healthcare, S.L.) for Spain and Pharmatronic Co. for South Korea RedHill and IntelGenx currently expect to re-submit the RIZAPORT® 505(b)(2) New Drug Application („NDA„) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration („U.S. FDA„) in the third quarter of 2017 IntelGenx Corp. (TSX VENTURE:IGX)(OTCQX:IGXT) („IntelGenx”), a leading oral drug delivery company primarily focused on the development and manufacturing of innovative pharmaceutical oral films based on its proprietary VersaFilm™ technology platform, together with RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (NASDAQ:RDHL)(TEL-AVIV STOCK EXCHANGE:RDHL) („RedHill”), a specialty biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development and commercialization of late clinical-stage, proprietary, orally-administered, small molecule drugs for gastrointestinal and inflammatory diseases and cancer, today announced that the Ministry of Health of Luxembourg has granted national marketing authorization for RIZAPORT® (5 mg and 10 mg), a proprietary oral thin film formulation of rizatriptan benzoate for the treatment of acute migraines. The national marketing authorization was granted in Luxembourg on the basis of the DCP, in which Luxembourg served as the Concerned Member State. The approval in Luxembourg marks the completion of the current marketing approval process for RIZAPORT® under the DCP. This process requires marketing approval in at least two European states, a Reference Member State and a Concerned Member State. RIZAPORT® (5 mg and 10 mg) was previously approved for marketing in Germany, which served as the Reference Member State. Under the DCP, marketing authorization approval of RIZAPORT® in additional European countries is subject to a separate procedure to obtain additional national marketing authorizations in each country. RIZAPORT® offers an innovative and potentially advantageous therapeutic alternative for many migraine patients, primarily patients who suffer from dysphagia or migraine-related nausea, due to its convenient dosing, facile intake due to the lack of need for water and pleasant flavor. A first commercialization agreement for RIZAPORT® was signed with Grupo JUSTE S.A.Q.F (now Exeltis Healthcare, S.L.) for Spain and, subsequently, a national MAA for RIZAPORT® was submitted by Grupo JUSTE. A second commercialization agreement for RIZAPORT® was recently signed with Pharmatronic Co. for South Korea. IntelGenx and RedHill currently expect to re-submit the RIZAPORT® 505(b)(2) NDA to the U.S. FDA in the third quarter of 2017. The companies are continuing discussions with additional potential commercialization partners for RIZAPORT® in the United States, Europe and other territories. About RIZAPORT® (RHB-103): RIZAPORT® is a proprietary oral thin film formulation of rizatriptan benzoate, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist and the active drug in Merck & Co.’s Maxalt®. RIZAPORT® 5 mg and 10 mg were approved for marketing in Germany in October 2015 and in Luxembourg in April 2017 under the DCP. A NDA for RIZAPORT® was also filed with the U.S. FDA in 2013 and a Complete response letter was received in 2014. RedHill has entered into licensing agreements to commercialize RIZAPORT® in Spain (with Grupo JUSTE S.A.Q.F) and in South Korea (with Pharmatronic Co.). Rizatriptan is considered to be one of the most effective oral triptans, a class of molecules that constricts blood vessels in the brain to relieve swelling and other migraine symptoms. RIZAPORT® is based on IntelGenx’s proprietary VersaFilm™ technology. It dissolves rapidly and releases its active ingredient in the mouth, leading to efficient absorption of the drug through the gastrointestinal tract. The administration method of the RIZAPORT® oral thin film, which does not require the patient to swallow a pill or consume water, along with its pleasant flavor, presents a potentially attractive therapeutic alternative for migraine patients, specifically for patients who suffer from migraine-related nausea, estimated to be approximately 80% of the total migraine patient population and patients suffering from dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).

Recently, three middle school students were quarantined at school until a parent or guardian came to take them home. Why? Because the adolescents had not received the HPV vaccine — a questionable-at-best injection that has proven itself to be capable of grievous harm. Earlier this year, it was revealed that over 100 women and girls in Japan had launched lawsuits against their government and two HPV vaccine manufacturers — GlaxoSmithKline and Merck — due to the harmful effects the immunizations had on their health. Some of the major health conditions the women developed include chronic pain, impaired mobility and severe menstrual pain. One young woman, Erina Sonoda, reports that while she was perfectly healthy prior to receiving the Cervarix vaccine, by the end of the three rounds of injections, she needed a cane to walk. The 20-year-old says that after the second injection, she developed horrible menstrual pain — and by the third, the pain had spread to her entire body. When Sonoda is not able to walk with a cane, she uses a wheelchair. Clearly, the Rhode Island girls have good reasons to abstain from the HPV vaccine, even if their school system disagrees with them. Gardasil, the other HPV vaccine, has been attributed to a number of ill effects, including paralysis and brain damage. Last year, the coastal state came under fire for deciding to mandate that all 7th-grade children needed to have the HPV vaccine, regardless of gender. Dr. Ailis Clyne, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health’s Immunization Program, states that 7th graders need to have had one dose of the inoculation, while 8th graders will need to have had two. Unsurprisingly, a number of Rhode Island parents objected to the vaccine mandate, with concerns ranging from personal to religious reasons. Medical and religious exemptions are allowed, and at the time, schools were encouraged “not to ask questions” even if parents had not submitted exemption forms. That viewpoint, however, seems to have changed. On April 10, 2017, three girls at a Coventry middle school were removed from their first period classes and detained in the office until someone came to pick them up from school. Apparently, the children were not even allowed to use the restroom. Two of the girls claimed to have gotten the vaccine, but because the school did not have the appropriate paperwork, they were sent home anyways. One student, Savannah, did an interview with Dan Bidondi of Truth Radio Show. Savannah says that the school had sent home letters and made phone calls to tell her family that if she did not get the vaccine, she would be sent home. According to Bidondi, the Department of Health had previously stated students would not be made to miss school over the vaccine mandate. The Rhode Islanders Against Mandated HPV Vaccinations group had previously argued that there was no point in a vaccine mandate that would not be enforced, and that this was reason enough for the mandate to be revoked. It seems that at least the Coventry district has devised a response to these assertions, though it is not the answer the anti-mandatory vaccine group had hoped for. Instead of removing the mandate, students who are not vaccinated are apparently going to be removed. Savannah says that her school principal said that the order to remove her and the other two girls from class was not the school’s decision, and that the order had been handed down from the superintendent because it was a “state law.” Savannah will not be able to return to school without a doctor’s appointment or a completed exemption form. This is an obvious violation of parental rights — and a violation of children’s rights. As Bidondi points out, the state law regarding the HPV vaccine explicitly notes that children should not be made to miss school over the vaccine.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Apr 13, 2017 at 10:41AM NewLink Genetics (NASDAQ:NLNK) and Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) are racing a new class of drugs through clinical trials, and if these trials are successful, these new drugs may change how doctors treat cancer, including melanoma. IDO-what? Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a protein that suppresses the immune system that cancer cells sometimes hijack. By inhibiting IDO, NewLink Genetics and Incyte hope to restore immune system responses so that cancer cells can be more easily identified and destroyed. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. At NewLink Genetics, researchers are working on two IDO-inhibitors: indoximod, which it's developing on its own, and GDC-0919, which it's developing with Roche Holdings (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY).  Last week, NewLink Genetics unveiled updated results from a 60-person phase 2 study evaluating indoximod alongside Merck & Co.'s (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda in advanced melanoma. In this trial, 52% of patients responded to this two-drug therapy, and 73% had either a complete response, partial response, or stable disease. The response rates are intriguing in part because the FDA approved Keytruda monotherapy in advanced melanoma after 33% of Keytruda patients responded to the drug in trials. Incyte is also putting up impressive results in trials evaluating its IDO-inhibitor, epacadostat. In December, Incyte reported a 58% overall response rate in advanced melanoma patients who were given epacadostat and Keytruda. Overall, 74% of patients saw a complete response, partial response, or stable disease in this trial. Which one's better? NewLink Genetics data failed to impress investors who were hoping for a better than Incyte result, and because of that, NewLink Genetics shares have fallen. NLNK data by YCharts. However, investors might not want to draw too many conclusions between the two drugs and their efficacy. After all, these drugs are not being studied in head-to-head trials, so it's bad science to compare these trials with one another, especially since Incyte's trial included only 19 patients, while NewLink Genetics trial included 60 patients. Also, while both of these drugs target IDO, they do so differently. Epacadostat targets the IDO enzyme directly, while indoximod inhibits the effects of IDO via cell-signaling. Because of differences in trial size and mechanism of action, investors are probably best served considering the results from both of these trials as evidence that targeting IDO puts both of these companies on the right track.  What's next NewLink Genetics and Incyte are also evaluating IDO-inhibitors in solid tumors. NewLink Genetics and Roche Holdings' GDC-0919 works in a manner that's more similar to epacadostat than indoximod, and results from a phase 1b study evaluating its use alongside Roche's Tecentriq (a drug that's similar to Keytruda) in solid tumors should be available later this year. Meanwhile, Incyte's epacadostat studies include seven trials that could support FDA filings for approval, if they're successes. Of course, it's anyone's guess if these trials pan out, but if they do, then IDO-inhibitors may not only transform how we treat advanced melanoma, but also how we treat non-small lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and bladder cancer, too. And, that's potentially very big news for both of these companies.

Cancer immunotherapy is the most widely explored application of bispecific antibody. Lung, breast and colon cancer are the wider applications of BsAb. Bispecific antibody simultaneously binds to a cytotoxic cell and target tumor cell and destroys it. Bispecific antibodies are emerging a technologically advanced solution for dual targeting strategies within same molecule. Download Exclusive PDF Brochure of This Report : www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-sample/19 Due to its dual specificity, bispecific antibody can aid in redirecting T cells to tumor cells, blocking two different signaling pathways simultaneously, dual targeting of different disease mediators, and delivering payloads to targeted sites. Catumaxomab and blinatumomab are the two U.S. FDA approved bispecific antibody products, which would fuel growth of the bispecific antibodies market. Bispecific antibodies can be divided into three main classes namely, fragment, symmetric, and asymmetric antibodies. Fragment bispecific antibodies such as a nanobody DART and BiTE are currently undergoing clinical trials. Likewise, tetravalent BsAb – DVD and DAF symmetric antibodies are under research. Companies such as Sanofi S.A., Merck & Co., Inc. and Genentech, Inc. are conducting research on symmetric bispecific antibodies. BEAT, duobody, and crossmab are examples of asymmetric bispecific antibodies, which are currently being researched by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Eli Lilly and Company, and Genmab A/S. Get Exclusive Discount on this CMI Report: www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-discount/19 Catumaxomab – the first Bispecific antibody boost growth of the bispecific antibodies market As of 2015, over 60 different BsAb formats have been developed, with some making their way into the clinical trials. Bispecific antibodies market growth is increasing due to the limitation of monoclonal antibodies in drug resistance and failure to respond in treatment.

(IGX)(otcqx:IGXT) ("IntelGenx"), a leading oral drug delivery company primarily focused on the development and manufacturing of innovative pharmaceutical oral films based on its proprietary VersaFilm™ technology platform, together with RedHill Biopharma Ltd. RDHL, -2.57% (tel-aviv stock exchange:RDHL) ("RedHill"), a specialty biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development and commercialization of late clinical-stage, proprietary, orally-administered, small molecule drugs for gastrointestinal and inflammatory diseases and cancer, today announced that the Ministry of Health of Luxembourg has granted national marketing authorization for RIZAPORT® (5 mg and 10 mg), a proprietary oral thin film formulation of rizatriptan benzoate for the treatment of acute migraines. The national marketing authorization was granted in Luxembourg on the basis of the DCP, in which Luxembourg served as the Concerned Member State. The approval in Luxembourg marks the completion of the current marketing approval process for RIZAPORT® under the DCP. This process requires marketing approval in at least two European states, a Reference Member State and a Concerned Member State. RIZAPORT® (5 mg and 10 mg) was previously approved for marketing in Germany, which served as the Reference Member State. Under the DCP, marketing authorization approval of RIZAPORT® in additional European countries is subject to a separate procedure to obtain additional national marketing authorizations in each country. RIZAPORT® offers an innovative and potentially advantageous therapeutic alternative for many migraine patients, primarily patients who suffer from dysphagia or migraine-related nausea, due to its convenient dosing, facile intake due to the lack of need for water and pleasant flavor. A first commercialization agreement for RIZAPORT® was signed with Grupo JUSTE S.A.Q.F (now Exeltis Healthcare, S.L.) for Spain and, subsequently, a national MAA for RIZAPORT® was submitted by Grupo JUSTE. A second commercialization agreement for RIZAPORT® was recently signed with Pharmatronic Co. for South Korea. IntelGenx and RedHill currently expect to re-submit the RIZAPORT® 505(b)(2) NDA to the U.S. FDA in the third quarter of 2017. The companies are continuing discussions with additional potential commercialization partners for RIZAPORT® in the United States, Europe and other territories. About RIZAPORT® (RHB-103):  RIZAPORT® is a proprietary oral thin film formulation of rizatriptan benzoate, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist and the active drug in Merck & Co.'s Maxalt®. RIZAPORT® 5 mg and 10 mg were approved for marketing in Germany in October 2015 and in Luxembourg in April 2017 under the DCP. A NDA for RIZAPORT® was also filed with the U.S. FDA in 2013 and a Complete response letter was received in 2014. RedHill has entered into licensing agreements to commercialize RIZAPORT® in Spain (with Grupo JUSTE S.A.Q.F) and in South Korea (with Pharmatronic Co.). Rizatriptan is considered to be one of the most effective oral triptans, a class of molecules that constricts blood vessels in the brain to relieve swelling and other migraine symptoms. RIZAPORT® is based on IntelGenx's proprietary VersaFilm™ technology. It dissolves rapidly and releases its active ingredient in the mouth, leading to efficient absorption of the drug through the gastrointestinal tract. The administration method of the RIZAPORT® oral thin film, which does not require the patient to swallow a pill or consume water, along with its pleasant flavor, presents a potentially attractive therapeutic alternative for migraine patients, specifically for patients who suffer from migraine-related nausea, estimated to be approximately 80% of the total migraine patient population and patients suffering from dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).

(NASDAQ:RDHL)(TEL-AVIV STOCK EXCHANGE:RDHL) („RedHill”), a specialty biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development and commercialization of late clinical-stage, proprietary, orally-administered, small molecule drugs for gastrointestinal and inflammatory diseases and cancer, today announced that the Ministry of Health of Luxembourg has granted national marketing authorization for RIZAPORT® (5 mg and 10 mg), a proprietary oral thin film formulation of rizatriptan benzoate for the treatment of acute migraines. The national marketing authorization was granted in Luxembourg on the basis of the DCP, in which Luxembourg served as the Concerned Member State. The approval in Luxembourg marks the completion of the current marketing approval process for RIZAPORT® under the DCP. This process requires marketing approval in at least two European states, a Reference Member State and a Concerned Member State. RIZAPORT® (5 mg and 10 mg) was previously approved for marketing in Germany, which served as the Reference Member State. Under the DCP, marketing authorization approval of RIZAPORT® in additional European countries is subject to a separate procedure to obtain additional national marketing authorizations in each country. RIZAPORT® offers an innovative and potentially advantageous therapeutic alternative for many migraine patients, primarily patients who suffer from dysphagia or migraine-related nausea, due to its convenient dosing, facile intake due to the lack of need for water and pleasant flavor. A first commercialization agreement for RIZAPORT® was signed with Grupo JUSTE S.A.Q.F (now Exeltis Healthcare, S.L.) for Spain and, subsequently, a national MAA for RIZAPORT® was submitted by Grupo JUSTE. A second commercialization agreement for RIZAPORT® was recently signed with Pharmatronic Co. for South Korea. IntelGenx and RedHill currently expect to re-submit the RIZAPORT® 505(b)(2) NDA to the U.S. FDA in the third quarter of 2017. The companies are continuing discussions with additional potential commercialization partners for RIZAPORT® in the United States, Europe and other territories. About RIZAPORT® (RHB-103): RIZAPORT® is a proprietary oral thin film formulation of rizatriptan benzoate, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist and the active drug in Merck & Co.’s Maxalt®. RIZAPORT® 5 mg and 10 mg were approved for marketing in Germany in October 2015 and in Luxembourg in April 2017 under the DCP. A NDA for RIZAPORT® was also filed with the U.S. FDA in 2013 and a Complete response letter was received in 2014. RedHill has entered into licensing agreements to commercialize RIZAPORT® in Spain (with Grupo JUSTE S.A.Q.F) and in South Korea (with Pharmatronic Co.). Rizatriptan is considered to be one of the most effective oral triptans, a class of molecules that constricts blood vessels in the brain to relieve swelling and other migraine symptoms. RIZAPORT® is based on IntelGenx’s proprietary VersaFilm™ technology. It dissolves rapidly and releases its active ingredient in the mouth, leading to efficient absorption of the drug through the gastrointestinal tract. The administration method of the RIZAPORT® oral thin film, which does not require the patient to swallow a pill or consume water, along with its pleasant flavor, presents a potentially attractive therapeutic alternative for migraine patients, specifically for patients who suffer from migraine-related nausea, estimated to be approximately 80% of the total migraine patient population and patients suffering from dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).

Ogg April 11, 2017 10:45 am EDT Print Email Tweet Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) is one of the better pharmaceutical stocks, as far as performers in 2017 top picks at JPMorgan. Its shares were last seen up 17% year to date. Now the pharma giant was reiterated with an Overweight rating at JPMorgan. More importantly, the firm raised its price target to $100 from $85 in Tuesday’s call. What investors should know is that this is not the only positive analyst call from recent days and weeks. Eli Lilly’s closest competitor in year-to-date performance is Abbott Labs at 4%, and rival performance was seen as follows: Johnson & Johnson up 8%, Merck up 7%, Pfizer up almost 6% and Bristol-Myers Squibb down 7% so far. According to JPMorgan, Eli Lilly has a brighter future than in the past couple of years after drugs experienced patent expirations. The firm has a more bullish sales outlook for new Eli Lilly drugs. Positives include diabetes drugs Jardiance and Trulicity, and the firm talked up two drugs that are expected to be on the market quite soon: baracitinib as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and abemaciclib as a treatment for breast cancer. Tuesday’s report called Eli Lilly one of pharma’s best positioned stocks in its coverage universe. The broad scale of recently launched drugs and more later-stage pipeline assets are all adding up to an expected margin expansion for Eli Lilly. 24/7 Wall St. recently saw several other analysts and market pundits act positively toward Eli Lilly. The Thomson Reuters consensus analyst target price from sell-side analysts was listed as $85.85 at the end of January, though it was up in the $90s for most of 2016. Just last week Barclays gave positive comments to support its Overweight rating, and the firm raised its price target to $90 from $85. Two drivers were an expected FDA approval for Eli Lilly’s rheumatoid arthritis drug and the coming Phase 3 data from a cancer study due in June. Morgan Stanley talked up Eli Lilly’s Trulicity as rapidly gaining share in the GLP-1 category with the category gaining 27% year over year, but with Trulicity having growth at over 100% with a rising market share. That share price was last seen at 31%, compared with the following from peers: Novo Nordisk’s Victoza share at 47% AstraZeneca’s Byetta/Bydureon at about 17% GlaxoSmithKline’s Tanzeum at about 5% Sanofi’s Soliqua at about 1% Jim Cramer on CNBC has been positive on Eli Lilly as well, more or less noting that it was the go-to pharma stock that investors put capital into after any pullback in its share price. Back on March 9, 2017, Jefferies reiterated its Buy rating and raised its target price up to $97 from $95. Shares of Eli Lilly were last seen trading up 0.5% at $85.86 on Tuesday morning. Its 52-week range is $64.18 to $86.72, and the consensus analyst price target was $88.30. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Analysis By Mechanism of Action (Nucleotide Polymerase Inhibitor, Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor, Protease Inhibitor), By Application (HIV, Hepatitis, HSV, Influenza), By Type (Generic, Branded) And Segment Forecast 2014-2025" report to their offering. The global antiviral drugs market is expected to reach a value of USD 69.2 billion by 2025 Introduction of efficient antiviral drugs with benefits such as rapid action, increased sensitivity, and lower adverse effects is expected to serve this market as a high-impact rendering driver over the forecast period.

Further Key Findings From the Study Suggest: Reverse transcriptase inhibitors held the largest share by mechanism of action owing to availability of wide range of product portfolio and presence of new molecules in clinical trials Nucleotide inhibitors are estimated to grow at lucrative rate due to introduction of blockbuster molecules for treatment of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infections Generic drugs are anticipated to witness significant CAGR of over 7.0% over the forecast period as result of patent expiry of blockbuster drugs used for treatment of HIV and HCV Branded drugs will hold dominant position in 2025 by drug type due to brand loyalty of healthcare professions despite patent expiration and high price associated with these molecules HIV/AIDS held the dominant share in 2015. High prevalence of HIV infections and presence of favorable government initiatives for curbing them are key factors for high revenue of this segment Hepatitis on the other hand is anticipated to witness flourishing growth over the forecast period owing to introduction of new molecules and approval of novel combination treatments North America was the dominant regional market in 2015.

It produces T4 and T3 hormones. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) determines the quantity of the T3 and T4 hormones production in the body. The hormones are produced and stored in the microscopic follicles of the thyroid gland. The levels of thyroid hormones are maintained with a good network of communication between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and thyroid gland (HPT). Slight changes in the HPT axis due to any disease, damage to the thyroid, or the use of certain medicines will lead to either low or excess production of thyroid hormones, leading to hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News Global Menopausal Hot Flashes Therapy Market by Products, Growth Trends and Forecast to 2021 Hot flushes are a common symptom of the menopause experienced by most of the menopausal women as a sudden feeling of warmth or heat in the body, which are usually most intense over the face, neck and chest. Hot flushes may occur on their own but are often accompanied by night sweats or excessive sweating during the day. Other causes of hot flashes include breast and prostate cancer treatments. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective treatment for menopausal hot flashes. However, long term HRT has an increased risk of breast cancer and risk associated with increasing age such as stroke, blood clots, and other health related problems. Estrogen and progesterone are the most common hormonal regimens used to reduce hot flashes. Estrogen is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms as it reduces the severity of vasomotor symptoms, often with improvement beginning within the first week of treatment. Other drugs used for the treatment of hot flashes include combination of bazedoxifene and conjugated estrogens, certain antidepressants, and other prescription medications.

Based on these complications, sleep disorders can be classified into three categories- lack of sleep which includes insomnia, excessive sleep which includes narcolepsy and disturbed sleep which include sleep apnea and Rapid eye movement (REM) disorder. Insomnia may arise as result of unhealthy diet, emotional dreams, stress, and many other factors. Insomnia may affect reaction time towards common stimulus, hand-eye coordination, memory, and disturb daily life. A sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/5714 Narcolepsy is a disorder that causes uncontrolled sleep at time period lasting less than minute or more than an hour. It has also been found that patients with narcolepsy experience sleep attacks more often during pregnancy, stress or ill health. Usually narcolepsy is a genetic disease, but it has also been found to develop as a result of some neurological disorders or severe brain damage. REM sleep behavior disorder involves abnormal behavior in sleep. In this disorder, a patient dreaming about running, may run while still asleep. Sleep apnea is obstructed breathing during sleep. According to a press release in March 2014 by World Association of Sleep Medicine, 45% of the global population suffers from some form of sleep disorder. It also mentions that approximately 25% male and 10% females in the U.S. suffer from sleep apnea. This high prevalence suggests an opportunity for a large therapeutics market.

Glaucoma Therapeutics Market by Drug Class (Alpha Agonist, Beta Blockers, Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitor, Cholinergic, Combined Medication, Prostaglandin Analogs), End Users (Ambulatory Surgical Centers, Hospitals, Ophthalmic Clinics) and Forecast 2017-2021 Maryland Heights, MO, April 13, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy that is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Chronic progressive optic neuropathy, it can lead to severe disability and blindness. Glaucoma is classified according to whether it is congenital or acquired. Glaucoma is usually associated with an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). The mainstream glaucoma therapies include topical medications, laser treatments and surgical procedures. Ocular hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of glaucoma and current glaucoma therapy is directed at lowering intraocular pressure. The most widely prescribed glaucoma drugs include the prostaglandin analogs (PGAs) that lower IOP by increasing the aqueous drainage through the unconventional uveoscleral outflow pathway, whereas the non-PGA drug classes such as the beta blockers, alpha agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, lower IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous humor. Several new drug classes such as Adenosine A1 receptor agonists, selective Rho kinase inhibitors, melatonin agonists, and rho kinase/norepinephrine transporter (ROCK/NET) inhibitors have entered clinical development.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News Aerosol Therapy Market Outlook to 2024 Latest Industry Forecast Report Aerosol is suspension of liquid or solid particles in a carrier gas, which makes use of it for treatment of respiratory system related diseases. Different forms of drugs can be utilized for aerosol therapy such as solid particles, liquid particles, solutions, and suspensions. Until recently, aerosol therapy concentrated primarily on treatment of asthma and COPD for which, pressurized metered-dose inhaler device was used. However, the role of aerosol therapy is expanding beyond the initial focus. This expansion eliminated CFC-based traditional metered-dose inhalers devices. This will ultimately boost the market growth of aerosol therapy in the field of gene therapy, inhalation therapy and vaccination. Aerosol therapy is a natural and easiest way to treat asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and broncho pulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Aerosol therapy is also used to deliver insulin, vaccines of influenza and measles, and pain medications. Aerosol treatment therapy gives an excellent and cost-efficient drug delivery. This therapy is effective for patients who cannot use metered-dose inhalers; primary inhalation devices are produced that guarantee breath-actuated aerosol delivery with minimal side effects. Aerosol therapy provides a fast and non-invasive way for treatment of lung disorders as the drug is delivered at the receptor site. Effectiveness of the therapy depends on how deeply aerosol particles infiltrate into the bronchial track and where the particles are deposited. A particle size under 2μm is ideal and can permeate up to the peripheral airways. That is why most commercially available aerosol devices produce droplets of roughly this size.
