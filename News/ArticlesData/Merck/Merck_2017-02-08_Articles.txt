The judgments, both issued on 7 November 2016, clarify the requirement for an "objective justification" under the so-called "BMS"-criteria. The BMS-criteria were developed by the Court of Justice of the European Union ("ECJ") in an attempt to balance the principle of free movement of goods with the protection of trade mark rights and public health considerations in the case of parallel importation of pharmaceuticals from one Member State into another. The ECJ held in Bristol-Myers Squibb (Case C-427/93) that parallel imported products could be repackaged (i) if repackaging is objectively necessary to market the product in the country of importation; (ii) if the repackaging does not affect the original condition of the product inside the packaging; (iii) if the new packaging clearly states who repackaged the product and indicates the name of the manufacturer; (iv) if the presentation of the repackaged product is not liable to damage the reputation of the trade mark or of its owner; and (v) if the importer gives notice to the trade mark owner before the repackaged product is put on sale, and, on demand, supplies him with a specimen of the repackaged product. In other words, if these five conditions are satisfied, the trade mark owner cannot legitimately object to the further marketing of a repackaged pharmaceutical. Both cases before the Supreme Court concerned the parallel importation into the Belgian market of the pharmaceutical product based on the active ingredient "losartan" which is sold in Benelux under the Benelux trade marks "Cozaar" and "Loortan", both owned by Merck Sharp & Dohme ("MSD"). First Judgment The first case concerned the parallel importation from the Italian market of "losartan" under the registered trade mark "Loortan" in a dosage form of 100 mg. In Italy, this product is only sold in packaging formats of 28 tablets, while in Belgium "Cozaar" and "Loortan" 100 mg are sold in packaging formats of 98 tablets. Pi Pharma, the parallel importer, repackaged the product into a new packaging of 98 tablets and affixed the trade mark "Cozaar". MSD claimed that Pi Pharma had infringed MSD's trade mark rights. At first instance, the President of the Commercial Court granted MSD's claims and ordered Pi Pharma to cease and desist the infringements. Conversely, the Court of Appeal of Brussels dismissed the claims of MSD. The reasoning of the Court of Appeal of Brussels echoes that of the Court of Appeal of Mons in its judgment of 14 September 2015 in a case between MSD and parallel importer Impexeco (See VBB on Belgian Business Law, Volume 2015, No. 10, p. 14, available at www.vbb.com). Finally, the case was brought before the Supreme Court. In order to assess the requirement of "objective necessity" under the first "BMS" criterion, the Supreme Court reasoned that the entire Belgian market of pharmaceuticals based on the active ingredient "losartan" in a dosage of 100 mg must be considered, rather than the Belgian market for the pharmaceutical "Cozaar 100 mg" in a packaging format of 98 tablets. In addition, the Supreme Court considered that the actual circumstances at the time of importation, including national rules and practices, must be taken into account to determine whether repackaging is necessary. Based on these considerations, the Supreme Court held that repackaging and affixing a different trade mark was objectively necessary in order to gain effective access to the Belgian market since the pharmaceutical product based on "losartan" 100 mg is solely sold by MSD in packaging formats of 98 tablets. Other packaging formats are not known by prescribing doctors or pharmacists and have not obtained reimbursement status in Belgium. Accordingly, objecting to the fact that parallel imported products of "losartan" 100 mg would be repackaged to a format of 98 tablets and sold under the trade mark "Cozaar" would result in foreclosure of the Belgian market for parallel imports. Second Judgment In the second case, Pi Pharma imported from the Polish market the pharmaceutical product based on the active ingredient "losartan" under the trademark "Cozaar" in a dosage form of 50 mg and in a packaging format of 28 tablets. The pharmaceutical product Cozaar 50 mg is sold by MSD on the Belgian market in packaging formats of 28, 56 and 98 tablets. The market share of the different packaging formats of MSD with regard to Cozaar 50 mg in the third quarter of 2012 was 2%, 9% and 89%, respectively. Pi Pharma repackaged the product into a new packaging format of 98 tablets and reaffixed on the new packaging the trademark "Cozaar". MSD claimed that Pi Pharma had infringed its trade mark rights in the verbal trade mark "Cozaar". Both at first instance and on appeal, the court dismissed the claims of MSD. For its part, the Supreme Court again held that it must be determined to what extent the imported product in the packaging of the country of exportation can be sold in the entire market of the relevant product of the country of importation. The Supreme Court found that Pi Pharma was able to sell the pharmaceutical product in a dosage of 50 mg and in a packaging format of 28 tablets in only a limited part of the Belgian market, while a packaging format of 98 tablets represented most of the demand on the Belgian market. The Supreme Court thus held once more that repackaging was objectively necessary in order to gain effective access to the entire Belgian market.

With $15 million in funding from the Foundation over five years, the Alliance aims to increase timely access to patient-centered cancer care for vulnerable and underserved populations in the United States. The following organizations have been selected based on a variety of criteria, including the technical merit of their proposed programs, their organizational capabilities and experience, relationships with community partners, and ability to promote sustainable improvements in the delivery of cancer care. Grady Health System in Atlanta, Ga.; The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md.; Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Mass.; Northwestern University in Chicago, Ill.; Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio; and The University of Arizona in Tucson, Ariz. The University of Michigan School of Nursing, in Ann Arbor, Mich., will serve as the Alliance’s National Program Office. “With 1.7 million Americans newly diagnosed with cancer each year, there is a great need to improve the quality and delivery of patient-centered care to help address the significant challenges of those facing this diagnosis,” said Julie L. Gerberding, chief patient officer, Merck and chief executive officer, Merck Foundation. “These superb program sites and the National Program Office should accelerate identification and uptake of innovations that benefit patients, improve health communications, and enhance the overall coordination of care.” Through an independent cross-site evaluation, the Foundation will evaluate the impact of the Alliance and its programs. The evaluation findings and lessons learned will be disseminated to promote best practices in patient-centered cancer care.

Copyright © 2009-2016 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., U.S.A. All rights reserved. On January 20th, NYC-based drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE:BMY) and Kenilworth, NJ-based pharmaceutical firm Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) announced that the two companies had entered into a settlement and licensing agreement resolving worldwide patent litigation over a cancer treatment. As per the announced terms of the settlement, Merck will make a one-time payment of $625 million to Bristol-Myers Squibb and will also pay future royalties through 2026 on sales of Merck’s Keytruda. Keytruda, the brand name for pembromizulab, is a treatment which has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat various forms of cancer. The cancer treatment works by shutting off a chemical pathway for programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1), which in turn improves the human body’s natural ability to fight cancer through the immune system. Merck first earned FDA approval in September 2014 to market Keytruda as a treatment for advanced melanoma. Last August, the FDA granted accelerated approval for Keytruda as a treatment for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A few months later, in October, the FDA approved Keytruda as a treatment for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Sales projections from FiercePharma indicate that sales of Keytruda as an immuno-cology therapy could grow from $605 million in 2015 up to $4.5 billion in 2020. Merck’s cancer treatment is in direct competition with Bristol-Myers’ Opvido, the brand name for nivolumab. Opvido is another immuno-cology therapy which attacks cancer by shutting down the PD-1 chemical pathway in the human body. In 2016’s second quarter, sales of Opvido far outpaced sales of Keytruda by greater than $500 million. FiercePharma’s analysis predicts that Opvido sales will grow by an even greater margin than Keytruda in the years to come, from $942 million in 2015 up to $8.4 billion by 2020. The patent infringement suit involving the cancer treatments developed by these two companies was filed last January in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (D.N.J.). The plaintiff named in the case was PDL BioPharma, a pharmaceutical firm from Incline Village, NV. PDL entered into an agreement with Bristol-Myers back in August 2008 for the global development and commercialization of the immunotherapy agent known as elotuzumab. Under the terms of the agreement, Bristol-Myers would develop and market elotuzumab-based treatments in exchange for an up-front cash payment of $30 million, additional payments of up to $480 million for development and regulatory milestones and additional payments of up to $200 million for sales-based milestones of elotuzumab in multiple myeloma and other potential oncology indications. The patent-in-suit asserted by PDL BioPharma in the case is U.S. Patent No. 5693761, titled Polynucleotides Encoding Improved Humanized Immunoglobulins. The patent, which was issued to Protein Design Labs in December 1997, protect polynucleotides encoding heavy and light chain variable regions of a humanized immunoglobulin which binds to an antigen. The technology enables an improved means for the production of humanized antibodies which are specifically reactive with strong affinity to a predetermined antigen. As PDL’s complaint notes, the technology covered by the ‘761 patent enabled breakthroughs in the process of producing monoclonal antibodies for the removal of harmful cells from the human body. Nonhuman antibodies contained sequences of amino acids which the human body identified as foreign antigens. Chimeric antibodies created through genetic engineering techniques still produced negative immune responses caused by amino acid sequences from mouse antibodies. The high antigen affinity of the humanized antibodies enabled the technology covered by the ‘761 patent to produce monoclonal antibodies which attacked antigens while reducing the negative immune system response. PDL argued that the production of Keytruda involves the humanization of a murine, or rodent-related, antibody to obtain a humanized antibody using techniques covered by the ‘761 patent. Specifically, PDL believes that Keytruda manufacturing involves first and second polynucleotides encoding variable regions of the heavy and light chains of a humanized antibody infringes upon the first claim of the ‘761 patent. PDL alleges that the infringing techniques are outlined by Merck’s U.S. Patent No. 8952136, titled Antibodies to Human Programmed Death Receptor PD-1. Additional, PDL argues that Merck has known about the ‘761 patent for more than a decade going back to a licensing agreement for the patent signed by Merck back in 2005 to secure the rights of the patent for the production of potential treatments, but the scope of that agreement doesn’t cover Keytruda. Along with the up-front cash payment settling the PDL lawusit, Merck also agreed to pay royalties of 6.5 percent of net sales of Keytruda from January 1st, 2017 and December 31st, 2023. From January 1st, 2024 through December 31st, 2016, Merck will pay royalties of 2.5 percent of net sales for Keytruda to Bristol-Myers.

Life Buy/Sell Metro Close St. John officials wary of next phase of MSD project Special to the Post-Dispatch Feb 9, 2017 (…) ST. JOHN • Officials here say they are encouraged that MSD officials have indicated they will work with the city on traffic control and safety issues during an upcoming sewer replacement project that will tear up several streets, but they remain unconvinced that the district will return the streets to their original condition afterward. Officials are miffed that streets torn up by MSD in an earlier storm water sewer project were left in worse shape than before the project started and that the district has been slow to respond to complaints about it. Police Chief/City Manager J.R. “Rusty” Morris said at Monday’s council meeting he was surprised that two MSD officials showed up at a meeting last week of city and Ritenour School District officials. He said MSD officials earlier had refused his request that they attend the council meeting. The meeting with school district officials was set after someone from the school district called the city concerned about how the upcoming project would affect operations at Marvin Elementary School, Morris said. Phase 2 of the MSD project will begin in a couple of weeks and continue most of the year. Crews will install 4,209 feet of storm sewer lines and 699 feet of sanitary sewer lines east of Woodson Road, west of Roy Avenue, north of St. Louis Avenue and south of Bobb Avenue. Slated be dug up for the installation of new lines is a stretch of Gordon Avenue adjacent to Marvin Elementary. Although the school’s address is on Woodson Road, Gordon Avenue runs parallel to Woodson and is used as a staging area for parents picking up their children. Some 700 students attend the school. Morris said city officials wanted to discuss Phase 1 issues with a Sewer District representative at a meeting MSD held Jan. 25 to tell residents what to expect with Phase 2, but he was told MSD didn’t want to talk about anything but Phase 2. MSD is going to give him a traffic plan for the second phase of the project, Morris said. “It is going to impact traffic,” he said. ”We’re going to have to shut down the street for a period of time but we can make it work.” But city officials are still concerned about the shape MSD left streets in after Phase 1. “Hopefully they know we’re still not 100 percent satisfied with the Phase 1 product,” Morris said. Public Works Director James Phillips noted that he told an MSD engineer when the agency began working on the project two or three years ago that Jonell Court and the section of Gordon Avenue are “almost brand new.” He said he specified the city wanted a “full width repair on those streets.” But recently when he mentioned it to the MSD spokesman and the contractor, “it was news to them,” Phillips said. However, Phillips said, he has a dated email about the matter from that original discussion. “We’ll see if they do it,” he said. “They seem to think, ‘Well, unless it’s in the engineering specs, we’re not going to do it.’” At the meeting last month, a division inspector with MSD said a field inspector will be checking on work and residents can call MSD or the contractor if there’s an issue. Councilwoman Mary Halaska suggested MSD’s lack of response to the city’s complaints might be because St. John is “a little North County neighborhood.” “If we lived in another zip code, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation,” she said.

Using information from Statistics New Zealand’s Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI), the research found that 75 per cent of people who moved off a benefit had not returned to a benefit after two years. Of the 140,000 cases studied, after 24 months: • 33 per cent were in employment • 16 per cent had a change in life circumstances, such as retiring or moving overseas, and • 8 per cent were enrolled in education or training The study was unable to identify the main activity of 18 per cent of the former clients, and this will form a major part of MSD’s new analysis, which will use more up to date statistics. “The report also highlights how certain groups, such as those with health issues or who have been in prison, might need extra support back into employment,” says Mrs Tolley. “I’m pleased to say that Budget 2016 invested $9 million for trials to support people with health conditions and disabilities into work, alongside $15.3 million to help offenders prepare for, find and stay in employment and reduce reoffending. “Through the welfare reforms we have been focused on supporting people into education, training and sustainable employment. The proportion of the population (10.3 per cent) receiving a main benefit is now the lowest it’s been in a December quarter since before the Global Financial Crisis. “The next piece of research from MSD will analyse post-reform data and will be extremely valuable as we continue to look at new and innovative ways of helping people lead independent and successful lives.” The Superu report is available at: http://superu.govt.nz/off-benefits ends © Scoop Media   Tweet         Parliament Headlines | Politics Headlines | Regional Headlines NEW ZEALAND POLITICS > > Gordon Campbell: On The Looming Conflict Over The Iranian Nuclear Deal Just in case war breaks out over the weekend… for the past 10 days or so, the court rulings on President Trump’s travel ban have dominated the news out of the United States. At the same time, a more serious threat has been gathering in intensity. Iran and the Trump administration are on a collision course over Iran’s testing of ballistic missiles, which Iran maintains are a valid part of its domestic defence planning. The US, via Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn, has put Iran “on notice” and imposed fresh sanctions. Undaunted, Iran has continued to test more missiles.

Market Research Feb 09, 2017, 06:30 ET Share this article ALBANY, New York, February 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Global Pulmonary Drug Delivery Devices Market demonstrates a high degree of competition between GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, AstraZeneca Plc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Merck & Co. Inc. states a new research report by Transparency Market Research. With the top five players accounting for more than 67%, the market exhibits a largely consolidated structure. Analysts project this market to remain competitive over the forthcoming years, specifically the drug markets for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), thanks to the robust product pipelines of established drug-makers. According to the research report, the worldwide market for pulmonary drug delivery devices, which stood at US$32.2 bn in 2015, is expected to progress at a CAGR of 3.30% between 2016 and 2024 and reach US$43.05 bn by the end of the forecast period. The application of these devices is higher in the asthma segment and is expected to remain so over the next few years, thanks to the robust pipeline of drugs for the treatment of asthma. Download PDF Brochure of Research Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=873 North America to Continue to Lead Global Market  An analysis of the geographical presence of the global pulmonary drug delivery devices market has also been presented in this research report. As per the study, Europe, North America, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa are the prime regional markets for pulmonary drug delivery devices. North America, among these, is leading the global market with Europe trailing closely. The key factor behind the rise of both the regional markets is the increasing prevalence of COPD. With the technological advancements in pulmonary drug delivery devices, North America is likely to retain its position across the world with a share of more than 40% by the end of the forecast period. The markets for pulmonary drug delivery devices in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa are also projected to witness significant growth in the next few years, owing to the increasing prevalence of respiratory disorders. The rising level of awareness among consumers regarding health and wellness and the increase in the disposable income are also anticipated to propel these markets in the near future, states the research report. Rising Pool of Respiratory Disorder Patients to Fuel Market's Growth  "The rising pool of patients suffering from respiratory disorders is having the most prominent impact on the global market for pulmonary drug delivery devices," states an analyst at TMR. The alarming rise in air pollution and the increasing number of smokers, worldwide, are adding substantially to the already worsened situation of COPD patient pool, leading to a remarkable surge in the demand for these devices. Analysts expect this scenario to remain so over the period of forecast, resulting in a high demand pace for these devices. In addition to this, the market is anticipated to benefit from the increasing research and development in the treatments for asthma and COPD in the near future. However, the imminent patent expiry of blockbuster drugs and several regulatory hurdles may limit the growth of this market to some extent in the years to come, notes the research study. Inquire for Report Customization: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=CR&rep_id=873 The study presented here is based on a report by Transparency Market Research (TMR) titled "Pulmonary Drug Delivery Devices Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast, 2016 - 2024."

The analysis showed that Cladribine Tablets reduced the annualised rate of brain volume loss - also known as brain atrophy - compared with placebo in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). In addition, the analysis found that patients with lower rates of brain atrophy showed the highest probability of remaining free from disability progression at two years. This supports existing findings that increased brain volume loss over time is associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as increased disability progression and cognitive changes, in patients with multiple sclerosis. "Evidence shows that brain atrophy in general accumulates throughout the course of multiple sclerosis and is associated with disability progression. This analysis is important because it confirms the link between reduced brain atrophy and reduced disability progression found in the CLARITY study," said Nicola De Stefano, lead author of the publication and Associate Professor of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, University of Siena. The CLARITY study was a two-year (96-week), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study of Cladribine Tablets in 1,326 people with RRMS. The CLARITY study primary (rate of relapse at 96 weeks) and key secondary endpoints (proportion of patients who were relapse free and the time to sustained progression of disability) were met. These outcomes and safety results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The brain atrophy analysis evaluated the effect of Cladribine tablets on brain volume loss (BVL) over 2 years in RMS and the association of BVL with confirmed disability progression in 1,025 (77.3%) of the patients in CLARITY. The mean percentage brain volume loss per year was significantly reduced in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (-0.56%±0.68, p=0.010, n=336) and 5.25 mg/kg (-0.57%±0.72, p=0.019, n=351) compared with patients treated with placebo (-0.70%±0.79, n=338). The risk of disability progression was also significantly lower in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.438, 0.894; p=0.010) and 5.25 mg/kg (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.406, 0.833; p=0.003) than in those treated with placebo. After adjusting for treatment group, percentage brain volume loss per year showed a significant correlation with the cumulative probability of disability progression in the overall study population (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.571, 0.787; p&lt;0.0001). "These findings reinforce and expand on the consistent and positive effect of Cladribine Tablets in improving clinically relevant outcomes, such as reducing relapse rate and disability, and further our resolve to make this investigational therapy available for patients living with RRMS," said Steven Hildemann, MD, PhD, Global Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Medical Affairs and Safety, Merck. CLARITY study design The CLARITY study was a two-year (96-week), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international study. It randomised 1,326 patients with relapsing remitting MS according to the revised McDonald criteria. Study participants were randomised to one of three different treatment groups consisting of two different dose regimens of Cladribine Tablets or matching placebo tablets (1:1:1 ratio). The primary endpoint of the CLARITY study was the relapse rate over 96 weeks. Secondary endpoints included MRI endpoints, proportion of subjects relapse-free and disability progression at 96 weeks. Lymphopenia was the most commonly reported adverse event (AE) in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets. The incidence of infections was 48.3% with Cladribine Tablets and 42.5% with placebo, with 99.1% and 99.0% rated mild-to-moderate by investigators. About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an investigational short-course oral therapy that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. In July 2016, the European Medicines Agency [EMA] accepted for review the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) of Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. The clinical development program for Cladribine Tablets includes: - The CLARITY (CLAdRIbine Tablets Treating MS OrallY) study and its extension: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients with RRMS and its two-year extension designed to provide data on the long-term safety and efficacy of extended administration of Cladribine Tablets for up to four years. - The ORACLE MS (ORAl CLadribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients at risk of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS). - The ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding Cladribine Tablets treatment to patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough disease while on established interferon-beta therapy. - PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cladribine Tablets. The follow-up will consist of over 10,000 patient years of exposure in total, with follow-up in some patients exceeding eight years at completion. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. Although many treatments exist there is a need for an effective therapy without the risks associated with continuous immunosuppression and which reduces the need for frequent switches.

The analysis showed that Cladribine Tablets reduced the annualised rate of brain volume loss -also known as brain atrophy - compared with placebo in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). In addition, the analysis found that patients with lower rates of brain atrophy showed the highest probability of remaining free from disability progression at two years. This supports existing findings that increased brain volume loss over time is associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as increased disability progression and cognitive changes, in patients with multiple sclerosis. "Evidence shows that brain atrophy in general accumulates throughout the course of multiple sclerosis and is associated with disability progression. This analysis is important because it confirms the link between reduced brain atrophy and reduced disability progression found in the CLARITY study," said Nicola De Stefano, lead author of the publication and Associate Professor of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, University of Siena. The CLARITY study was a two-year (96-week), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study of Cladribine Tablets in 1,326 people with RRMS. The CLARITY study primary (rate of relapse at 96 weeks) and key secondary endpoints (proportion of patients who were relapse free and the time to sustained progression of disability) were met. These outcomes and safety results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The brain atrophy analysis evaluated the effect of Cladribine tablets on brain volume loss (BVL) over 2 years in RMS and the association of BVL with confirmed disability progression in 1,025 (77.3%) of the patients in CLARITY. The mean percentage brain volume loss per year was significantly reduced in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (-0.56%±0.68, p=0.010, n=336) and 5.25 mg/kg (-0.57%±0.72, p=0.019, n=351) compared with patients treated with placebo (-0.70%±0.79, n=338). The risk of disability progression was also significantly lower in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.438, 0.894; p=0.010) and 5.25 mg/kg (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.406, 0.833; p=0.003) than in those treated with placebo. After adjusting for treatment group, percentage brain volume loss per year showed a significant correlation with the cumulative probability of disability progression in the overall study population (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.571, 0.787; p<0.0001). "These findings reinforce and expand on the consistent and positive effect of Cladribine Tablets in improving clinically relevant outcomes, such as reducing relapse rate and disability, and further our resolve to make this investigational therapy available for patients living with RRMS," said Steven Hildemann, MD, PhD, Global Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Medical Affairs and Safety, Merck. CLARITY study design The CLARITY study was a two-year (96-week), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international study. It randomised 1,326 patients with relapsing remitting MS according to the revised McDonald criteria. Study participants were randomised to one of three different treatment groups consisting of two different dose regimens of Cladribine Tablets or matching placebo tablets (1:1:1 ratio). The primary endpoint of the CLARITY study was the relapse rate over 96 weeks. Secondary endpoints included MRI endpoints, proportion of subjects relapse-free and disability progression at 96 weeks. Lymphopenia was the most commonly reported adverse event (AE) in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets. The incidence of infections was 48.3% with Cladribine Tablets and 42.5% with placebo, with 99.1% and 99.0% rated mild-to-moderate by investigators. About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an investigational short-course oral therapy that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. In July 2016, the European Medicines Agency [EMA] accepted for review the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) of Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. The clinical development program for Cladribine Tablets includes: The CLARITY (CLAdRIbine Tablets Treating MS OrallY) study and its extension: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients with RRMS and its two-year extension designed to provide data on the long-term safety and efficacy of extended administration of Cladribine Tablets for up to four years. The ORACLE MS (ORAl CLadribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients at risk of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS). The ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding Cladribine Tablets treatment to patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough disease while on established interferon-beta therapy. PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cladribine Tablets. The follow-up will consist of over 10,000 patient years of exposure in total, with follow-up in some patients exceeding eight years at completion. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. Although many treatments exist there is a need for an effective therapy without the risks associated with continuous immunosuppression and which reduces the need for frequent switches.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 February 2017 by Military News Global Pain Management Therapeutics Market Segments, Share, Trends 2024 By TMR With generic medicines accounting for a more than two-thirds of the global pain management therapeutics market, several small- and medium-scale generic drug manufacturers will venture in the market and make it highly saturated in the near future, states TMR in a recent report. The segment of branded pain management therapeutics features the presence of some of the leading international pharmaceutical giants, including Merck & Co, Inc. Pfizer,Inc., Endo Health Solutions, Johnson & Johnson, and Purdue Pharma LP. In the branded drugs segment, the top two companies, Pfizer,Inc. and Purdue Pharma LP, accounted for over 50% share in 2015. Over the forecast period, the overall share of the branded drugs manufacturers in the global pain management therapeutics market will further decline. “Major vendors will lose market share to emerging vendors such as Depomed, Inc. and AstraZeneca plc. and the competition in the generic drugs segment will further intensify,” quotes a TMR analyst. Download Exclusive Brochure of This Report : www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Alarming Rise in Prevalence of Chronic Diseases Emerges as High-impact Driver The number of patients suffering from chronic pain is rising at a substantial pace globally. According to the WHO, nearly 116 mn people were suffering from chronic pain in 2011 in the U.S. alone. According to another survey, one in five people in Europe suffer from chronic pain every year. The rising prevalence of chronic diseases such as a variety of cancers and diabetes further contribute to the further contributes to the number of people suffering from chronic pain, encouraging the use of pain management drugs. Medications for alleviating the pain occurring from cancer therapy and from the intrusion of cancer cells in bones and other body parts, for instance, accounted for over 28% share of the overall pain management therapeutics market’s overall valuation in 2015. Rising Geriatric Population and Favorable Regulatory Scenario to Boost Consumption of Pain Management Drugs The vast rise in the world’s geriatric population is also expected to emerge as a key growth driver for the global pain management therapeutics market from 2106 to 2024. Aged people are more prone to diseases such as arthritis, joint or bone pain, epilepsy, depression, nerve damage, diabetic neuropathy, and a variety of injuries owing to low immunity levels or gene alteration. The global population of geriatrics (people aged more than 65 years) is expected to rise to 2 bn by 2050, accounting for nearly 22% of the projected global population by then. This demographic will lead to a substantial rise in the overall global demand for numerous pain management drugs, thereby driving the global pain management therapeutics market. Additionally, favorable regulations are playing a key role in the increased rate of development, approval, and commercialization of novel molecule combinations and drug delivery techniques in the pain management therapeutics sector. The instigation of a large number of regulatory healthcare reforms, favoring development of methods for the improved diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain, will help the pain management therapeutics tread along a promising growth path in the next few years. Patent Expiries of Blockbuster Drugs and Rising Uptake of Generics Could Pose Existential Threat to Established Players Impending patent expiries of several blockbuster pain management drugs in the global market is one of the key high-impact challenges for the global pain management therapeutics market presently. Cheaper generic versions of once high-earning drugs will deal a huge blow to the overall revenues of several established vendors in the global pain management therapeutics market in the next few years. The factor will also cause a substantial decline in the overall revenues of the global market. Moreover, the rapid influx of several new vendors with generic versions of once groundbreaking medications will lead to intense competition in the market for generic drugs for pain management therapeutics. In terms of product types, the global pain management therapeutics market is presently dominated by opioids and Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS), which collectively accounted for over 52% of the market’s overall revenues in 2015. North America dominated the market, accounting for over 56% of the overall market in the same year. Browse Research Report on Pain Management Therapeutics Market: goo.gl/iHmK2z On a whole, the global pain management therapeutics market is expected to expand at a 3.7% CAGR over the period between 2016 and 2024.

Bringing together two drugs, afatinib and pembrolizumab, which have each demonstrated meaningful activity and survival advantages in advanced stage squamous cell lung cancer patients, is an attractive strategy that needs to be further investigated as a treatment combination. The potential synergy in these agents will hopefully advance care and therapeutic options for this group of patients.' Afatinib is approved in the EU (Giotrif^(R)), US (Gilotrif^(R)) and other markets in patients with advanced SqCC of the lung whose disease has progressed on or after (EU label) / after (US label) treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab is approved in the US, EU, Japan and other markets for the treatment of previously-untreated patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours have high PD-L1 expression (tumour proportion score (TPS) >50%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations. Pembrolizumab is also indicated for the treatment of previously-treated patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumours express PD-L1 (TPS  ‰¥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. The trial is being conducted in collaboration with a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA (known as MSD outside the US and Canada) and the combination of afatinib and pembrolizumab studied in this trial is currently not an approved treatment regimen in the studied indication. Dr. Victoria Zazulina, Medical Head, Solid Tumour Oncology, Boehringer Ingelheim said, 'We are excited to collaborate with MSD and launch this trial, allowing us to gain further insights into the opportunities around treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Around the world, patients with this type of cancer are already benefitting from anti-PD-1 therapies and afatinib, the only oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in this indication. It is intriguing to combine both approaches in an attempt to improve the outcomes for patients with squamous lung cancer and equip physicians with new options.' The Phase II trial will include approximately 60 patients who have progressed or relapsed on or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy, and who have not previously received therapy with an anti-PD-1 therapy, a PD-L1/L2 antibody, or other checkpoint inhibitor or anti-EGFR targeted therapy. The trial aims to measure the decrease in tumour size (primary endpoint; objective response rate) and will confirm the dose of afatinib in combination with the standard dose of pembrolizumab, as well as the tolerability of this new regimen. In addition, it will evaluate anti-tumour activity in terms of disease control, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). SqCC of the lung is the second largest sub-type of NSCLC and represents approximately 20-30% of NSCLC cases. Patients with advanced SqCC of the lung typically have a poor prognosis and the median overall survival after diagnosis is around one year. Afatinib is also approved in over 70 countries for the first-line treatment of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and continues to be more broadly studied beyond the approved indications. *Afatinib is approved in more than 70 countries, including the EU, Japan, Taiwan and Canada under the brand name Giotrif^(R), in the US under the brand name Gilotrif^(R) and in India under the brand name Xovoltib^(R) for use in patients with distinct types of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Afatinib is also approved in the EU, US and other markets for the treatment of patients with advanced SqCC of the lung whose disease has progressed (on or) after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Afatinib is under regulatory review by health authorities in other countries worldwide. Registration conditions differ internationally, please refer to locally approved prescribing information.

Country(s) United States Australia India Hong Kong England - - - More Countries Industry News February 2017 Sa Fr Th We Tu Mo Su 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 The Pistoia Alliance and Scilligence Announce HELM Web Editor Open Source Editor for Encoding and Creating a Single Notation for Biomolecules     Spread the Word Listed Under Tags: * Biotechnology * Chemistry * Science Industry: * Biotech Location: * Cambridge - Massachusetts - USCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - Feb. 8, 2017 - PRLog -- The Pistoia Alliance and Scilligence Corporation are pleased to announce the release of the HELM Web Editor, which brings HELM's industry standard biomolecular representation to the browser, greatly enhancing the deployability of the technology for its adopters. As the therapeutic utilization of complex and unique biomolecules has become commonplace in drug discovery R&D, scientists have struggled to represent these entities in their information systems, forcing them to use various "pick and mix" approaches that include multiple nomenclatures and textual descriptions. HELM, the open biomolecular representation standard, has solved this problem by providing a means to represent various types of complex macromolecules (e.g. nucleotides, proteins, antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates) including those that contain non-natural elements such as chemically modified amino acids. The Pistoia Alliance formalized the HELM notation, originally created by Pfizer scientists as an open standard in early 2013, and publicly released the related software toolkit and editor to the Open Source community. Since its release, HELM has benefited from a growing ecosystem of global adopters and contributors including organizations such as Bristol Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, GSK, Ionis, Merck and Co, Scilligence, NextMove Software, ACD/Labs, Arxspan, BioChemfusion, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, ChemAxon, Perkin-Elmer, quattro research, EMBL-EBI, NCBI (PubChem), and RDKit. While the original HELM Applet editor, supporting HELM Notation 1.0 and developed using Java, made it easier for scientists to draw and view macromolecules, technology evolved, leaving the applet unsupported by many browsers. The new HELM Web Editor is completely built on JavaScript, which removes dependencies and increases the compatibilities with modern browsers. 2017 will see further updates to the web editor to add monomer and ruleset management, support for the HELM 2.0 ambiguity features and antibody editing. As major contributors to this project, Novartis AG and Ionis Pharmaceuticals are adopting the new HELM Web Editor. Dr. Eric Swayze, Vice President of Chemistry and Neuroscience Drug Discovery at Ionis Pharmaceuticals adds: "The new HELM Web Editor makes it easier for our scientists to adopt the HELM technologies, which helps them to more efficiently represent and register complex chemically modified biomolecules, which facilitates exchange of information within the team." Dr. Jinbo Lee, CSO of Scilligence adds: "We appreciate the opportunity working on the project. The new HELM Web Editor's zero-footprint and enhanced usability will help the scientific community including life-science, academic, and technology organizations adopt the HELM standard." About Pistoia Alliance The Pistoia Alliance is a global, not-for-profit members' organization made up of life science companies, technology and service providers, publishers, and academic groups working to lower barriers to innovation in life science and healthcare R&D. It was conceived in 2007 and incorporated in 2009 by representatives of AstraZeneca, GSK, Novartis and Pfizer who met at a conference in Pistoia, Italy. Its projects transform R&D through pre-competitive collaboration. It overcomes common R&D obstacles by identifying the root causes, developing standards and best practices, sharing pre-competitive data and knowledge, and implementing technology pilots. There are currently over 80 member companies; members collaborate on projects that generate significant value for the worldwide life sciences R&D community, using the Pistoia Alliance's proven framework for open innovation. www.pistoiaalliance.org About Scilligence Scilligence is a leading innovator of web-based cheminformatics and bioinformatics solutions designed for any device, browser, and platform.

Lundbeck's idalopirdine is a so-called 5-HT6 antagonist and is similar to another pill, called intepirdine, being developed by U.S. biotech firm Axovant Sciences. Unlike some higher profile Alzheimer's drugs from companies such as Eli Lilly and Merck & Co, idalopirdine was aimed at treating symptoms of the brain disorder, rather than halting progression of the underlying disease. The failure of Lundbeck's two latest Phase III trials is not a huge surprise, since the company and its Japanese partner Otsuka had already announced disappointing results from another late-stage trial in September. Taken together, Lundbeck said on Wednesday, the trials "do not demonstrate efficacy to support a regulatory submission". The setback casts further doubt on the 5-HT6 antagonist approach to fighting Alzheimer's, following discontinuation of another 5-HT6 antagonist last year from Pfizer that had reached mid-stage clinical testing. Shares in Lundbeck fell more than 4 percent after the company gave its update on idalopirdine alongside fourth-quarter financial results. Drugs working to block 5-HT6 are designed to promote the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter needed for normal cognition. The idea is to use them alongside the existing drug donepezil to help patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s. Cholinesterase inhibitors, like donepezil, are currently among the few medical options for treating Alzheimer's patients. Looking ahead, drugmakers hope to use new types of medicines that target the build-up of certain proteins in the brain that are thought to impair cognition. The failure of one such closely watched experimental drug from Eli Lilly in November dealt a blow to this concept but experts believe subtly different therapies could still work.

In the first three quarters of 2016, Sanofi comments included Merial for every income statement line using the term “Aggregate”. Sanofi neither presents “Aggregate” figures nor reports Animal Health business as an operating segment in Q4 2016 and in 2016 as a result of the closing early in 2017 of the swap of the Animal Health/CHC business with Boehringer Ingelheim. 2016 net sales including Animal Health(3) were €36,529 million of which €9,466 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. All Global Business Units delivered positive sales performance in the fourth quarter of 2016 Net sales were €8,867 million, up 3.3% on a reported basis (up 3.4% at CER). Sanofi Genzyme (Specialty Care) GBU increased 12.6% driven by multiple sclerosis products. Sanofi Pasteur GBU grew 3.7% due to strong pediatric combination franchise sales. Diabetes and Cardiovascular GBU sales were up 3.8%. Global diabetes franchise sales increased 1.9%. 2016 sales supported by Specialty Care and Vaccines Net sales in 2016 were €33,821 million, down 0.7% on a reported basis and up 1.2% at CER. Sanofi Genzyme GBU sales reached €5,019 million, up 17.3% while Sanofi Pasteur sales grew 8.8% to €4,577 million. Emerging Markets(4) sales increased 2.4% to €9,593 million (up 7.0% excluding Venezuela). Solid financial results in 2016 despite launch investments, supported by cost savings 2016 Business EPS(1) of €5.68 (+4.1% at CER) and IFRS EPS of €3.66 (+11.6% on a reported basis). Q4 2016 Business EPS was €1.25, down -1.5% at CER impacted by an unfavorable tax rate comparison. Q4 2016  Business operating income grew 3.7% at CER Board proposes dividend of €2.96, the 23rd consecutive annual increase. Sanofi progresses on its strategic priorities Closing of the Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) business swap elevates Sanofi into a global leadership position in CHC. Sanofi Pasteur and MSD end joint vaccines business to pursue their European vaccine strategies independently. Soliqua(TM) 100/33 launched in the U.S. and Suliqua(TM) approved in EU for type-2 diabetic patients. Kevzara(TM) (sarilumab) in rheumatoid arthritis approved in Canada and U.S. resubmission planned in Q1 2017. 5 NMEs started registrational studies in 2016: isatuximab, PD-1, sotagliflozin, olipudase alfa and NeoGAA. 2017 financial guidance Sanofi expects 2017 Business EPS(1) to be stable to -3%(5) at constant exchange rates, barring unforeseen major adverse events, consistent with its previously announced Strategic Roadmap guidance for the 2016-17 period. Applying the average December 2016 exchange rates, the currency impact on 2017 Business EPS is estimated to be +3% to +4%. Sanofi Chief Executive Officer, Olivier Brandicourt, commented: “2016 was a busy year for Sanofi as we progressed on our 2020 strategic roadmap. We successfully closed the Boehringer Ingelheim asset swap, lifting us into a leadership position in Consumer Healthcare. Our streamlined organization started to deliver and supported a stronger financial performance than initially anticipated. At the same time, we completed the filing of our breakthrough innovation Dupixent® for the first indication, atopic dermatitis, in the U.S and Europe. Separately, we recently advanced five new molecules into registrational studies.” (1) In order to facilitate an understanding of operational performance, Sanofi comments on the business net income statement. Business net income is a non-GAAP financial measure (see Appendix 11 for definitions). The consolidated income statement for Q4 2016 and 2016 is provided in Appendix 4 and a reconciliation of business net income to IFRS net income reported is set forth in Appendix 3; (2) changes in net sales are expressed at constant exchange rates (CER) unless otherwise indicated (see Appendix 11); (3) Merial information is provided in appendix 5; (4) See page 8; (5) 2016 Business EPS was €5.68.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, Company sales were €8,867 million, up 3.3% on a reported basis. Exchange rate movements had a negative effect of 0.1 percentage points. At CER, Company sales increased 3.4%. In 2016, Company sales were €33,821 million, down 0.7% on a reported basis. Exchange rate movements had an unfavorable effect of 1.9 percentage points reflecting mainly the adverse evolution of the Argentine Peso, Chinese Yuan, Mexican Peso and British Pound, which more than offset the positive effects from the Japanese Yen. At CER, Company sales increased 1.2%. 2016 performance included a negative currency impact related to the change of exchange rate applied for the translation of Venezuela operations, resulting from the evolution of the exchange system in February 2016 as well as from the persistent inability to exchange Venezuelan bolivars for U.S. dollars at the privileged official rate. In addition, in the first half of 2015, Sanofi benefited from a significant increase in product demand in Venezuela, due to buying patterns associated with local market conditions. As a consequence, sales in Venezuela were €18 million in 2016 compared to €455 million in 2015. Excluding Venezuela, Company sales increased 3.7% and 2.6% in the fourth quarter and in 2016, respectively. Global Business Units The table below presents sales by Global Business Units (GBU) and reflects the organization of Sanofi which became effective as of January 1, 2016. This structure drives deeper specialization, simplifies reporting and provides clear focus on growth drivers. Please note that in Emerging Markets, Specialty Care and Diabetes and Cardiovascular sales are included in the General Medicines and Emerging Markets GBU.

Growth of Jevtana®, Thymoglobulin® and Mozobil® was offset by lower Taxotere® and Eloxatin® sales. In 2016, Oncology sales were €1,453 million, down 2.2%. Jevtana® sales were up 8.3% to €92 million in the fourth quarter led by Europe (up 12.5% to €35 million) and Japan. Full-year Jevtana® sales were up 11.5% to €358 million. In the fourth quarter, Thymoglobulin® sales were up 10.1% to €77 million supported by the performance in the U.S. (up 16.2% to €43 million). In 2016, Thymoglobulin® sales were up 10.9% to €281 million. Fourth-quarter Eloxatin® sales were down 27.6% to €41 million reflecting generic competition in Canada. Over the same period, Taxotere® sales decreased 12.2% (to €42 million) due to continuous generic competition in Japan. In 2016, Taxotere® and Eloxatin® sales were down 17.1% (€179 million) and 21.6% (€170 million), respectively.

Fourth-quarter sales of Sanofi glargine (Lantus® and Toujeo®) increased 3.5% to €1,701 million. In the U.S., Sanofi glargine sales of €1,100 million were up 7.0%. In Europe, Sanofi glargine sales decreased 5.4% to €240 million due to biosimilar competition in several European markets. In 2016, Sanofi glargine sales were €6,363 million, down 1.8%. Over the quarter, Lantus® sales were €1,463 million down 5.1%. In the U.S., Lantus® sales decreased 1.8% to €931 million mainly reflecting lower average net price and patients switching to Toujeo®. In Europe, fourth-quarter Lantus® sales were €199 million (down 17.4%) due to biosimilar competition and patients switching to Toujeo®. In Emerging Markets, sales were stable at €243 million impacted by lower sales in Russia. In 2016, Lantus® sales were €5,714 million, down 9.4%. Fourth-quarter Toujeo® sales were €238 million of which €169 million were recorded in the U.S. and €41million in Europe. The global roll-out of this product continues and Toujeo® is available in 45 countries. In Japan, the two-week prescription limit was lifted in September 2016, resulting in a significant increase in market share (10.8% in December 2016- based on IMS basal insulin share market in value). Full-year Toujeo® sales were €649 million (versus €164 million in 2015). Amaryl® sales were €89 million, down 1.1% in the fourth quarter, of which €73 million were generated in Emerging Markets (up 4.1%). In 2016, Amaryl® sales were €362 million, down 3.8%. Fourth-quarter Apidra® sales decreased 9.6% to €95 million, reflecting lower sales in the U.S. (down 31.0% to €29 million) and Europe (down 6.1% to €32 million), which offset the performance in Emerging Markets (up 33.3% to €22 million). In 2016, Apidra® sales decreased 1.1% to €367 million. Since January 2017, Soliqua(TM) 100/33 (insulin glargine 100 Units/mL & lixisenatide 33 mcg/mL injection; lixisenatide was in-licensed from Zealand Pharma) has been available in the U.S. Soliqua 100/33 is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin (less than 60 Units daily) or lixisenatide. Sanofi is offering Soliqua(TM) 100/33 at a $0 co-pay (see press release from January 4, 2017) for eligible U.S. patients with commercial insurance and is working to secure market access from payers. Sanofi is also offering a tailored support program, Soliqua(TM) 100/33 COACH, at no cost to patients who have been prescribed the product. Cardiovascular franchise Praluent® (alirocumab, collaboration with Regeneron) was launched in the U.S., in a number of European markets and Japan in 2015 and 2016. Fourth-quarter Praluent® sales were €37 million of which €30 million were in the U.S. and €6 million in Europe. Full-year Praluent® sales were €105 million reflecting significant payer utilization management restrictions in the U.S. and limited market access in Europe. In January 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware issued an injunction that requires Sanofi and Regeneron to stop marketing, selling and manufacturing Praluent® in the U.S. starting from February 21, 2017. Until that date, Praluent® remains available in the U.S. Sanofi and Regeneron filed a motion with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to stay (suspend) the injunction pending the appeal of the judgment upholding the validity of Amgen’s patents for antibodies targeting PCSK9 as well as the injunction ruling. Fourth-quarter and 2016 Multaq® sales were €94 million (up 10.6%) and €353 million (up 3.8%), respectively.

In Emerging Markets, Established Rx Products sales increased 0.9% to €946 million driven by the performance of Lovenox®. In the U.S., Established Rx Products sales increased 22.4% (to €371 million) mainly due to the low basis for comparison from the recall Auvi-Q® in the prior period. In Europe, Established Rx Products sales decreased 3.3% to €911 million. Full-year Established Rx Products sales decreased 6.8% to €10,311 million and 4.9% excluding Venezuela. Lovenox® sales increased 0.7% to €414 million in the fourth quarter, driven by strong performance in Emerging Markets (up 12.2% to €124 million), which offset the impact of generic competition in the U.S. (down 27.8% to €13 million) and lower sales in Europe (down 1.5% to €255 million). In September, two enoxaparin biosimilars were approved in the European Union. In 2016, Lovenox® sales were €1,636 million, down 1.7%. In the fourth quarter, Plavix® sales were down 20.0% to €363 million due to generic competition in Japan that started in June 2015 (sales in Japan were down 49.3% to €82 million). In 2016, Plavix® sales decreased 18.8% to €1,544 million. Fourth-quarter Renvela®/Renagel® sales decreased 2.5% to €235 million.  In the U.S. where Sanofi expects generic competition in the first half of 2017, fourth-quarter sales were down 0.5% to €194 million. In Europe, Renvela®/Renagel® sales were down 24.0% to €19 million due to generic competition. Full-year Renvela®/Renagel® sales were down 1.1% to €922 million. Aprovel®/Avapro® sales were down 1.8% (to €163 million) and down 7.0% (to €681 million) in the fourth quarter and the full year, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Sanofi recalled Auvi-Q®/Allerject® in the U.S. and Canada. The negative impact of this recall on sales was -€122 million, which corresponded mainly to the reversal of sales of the product since the beginning of 2015. Sanofi no longer commercializes this product and no sales were recorded in 2016.  Consumer Healthcare Net sales (€ million) Q4 2016 Change (CER) 2016 Change (CER) Allegra® 86 +12.0% 417 -0.2% Doliprane® 86 +3.6% 309 +2.6% Essentiale® 45 -18.2% 145 -20.9% Enterogermina® 36 +2.9% 159 +2.5% Maalox® 22 – 85 -8.2% Dorflex® 20 – 75 -2.5% No Spa® 20 -9.1% 82 – Lactacyd® 19 -5.0% 80 -25.4% Magne B6® 18 -5.0% 73 -6.1% Nasacort® 17 -19.0% 108 -10.7% Other CHC Products 465 +6.2% 1,797 +1.7% Total Consumer Healthcare 834 +2.7% 3,330 -1.6%(a) (a) Excluding Venezuela: +1.4%; In the fourth quarter, Consumer Healthcare (CHC) sales increased 2.7% to €834 million driven by the performance in Europe, reflecting an early cough and cold season, partially offset by lower sales in Russia. Excluding the divestiture of several small products, sales of CHC were up 3.2% in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter CHC sales in the U.S. increased 4.6% to €209 million despite increased competitive environment in the allergy category. In Emerging Markets, sales decreased 3.2% to €326 million reflecting lower sales in Russia due to the challenging local economic situation. In the quarter, sales in Europe were up 9.5% to €229 million due an early start of cough and cold season, mainly in France, despite the divesture of small products. Adjusting for these divestitures, CHC sales in Europe were up 11.1% in the fourth quarter. Full-year CHC sales reached €3,330 million, down 1.6% (up 2.7% excluding Venezuela and the divestiture of several small products). Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim recently announced that the exchange of Sanofi’s animal health business (Merial) and Boehringer Ingelheim’s consumer healthcare (CHC) business was successfully closed in most markets on January 1st 2017. The closing of the disposal of Merial in Mexico and the swap of Merial and CHC in India have been delayed pending receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The transactions in both countries are expected to close early 2017. Generics In the fourth quarter, Generics sales increased 0.2% to €468 million driven by Emerging Markets (up 5.1% to €209 million) and Japan, which more than offset for the U.S. (down 6.8% to €43 million) and Europe (down 6.6% to €192 million). In 2016, Generics sales were up 0.7% to €1,854 million (up 2.5% excluding Venezuela). As announced in our 2020 strategic roadmap, Sanofi has carefully reviewed all options for our Generics business in Europe and recently made the definitive decision to initiate a carve-out process expected to be completed by the end of 2018. Importantly, Sanofi confirms its commitment to Generics in other parts of the world with a greater focus on the Emerging Markets. Vaccines Net sales (€ million) Q4 2016 Change (CER) 2016 Change (CER) Polio/Pertussis/Hib vaccines (incl. Pentacel®, Pentaxim® and Imovax®) 544 +16.5% 1,495 +12.7% Influenza vaccines (incl.

In Europe, vaccines sales were down 46.3% to €44 million mainly reflecting both (i) supply issues with Repevax® and (ii) sales from Sanofi to Sanofi Pasteur MSD deferred to 2017 in connection with the buy-back of inventory as part of the termination of Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint-venture. In 2016, sales of Sanofi Pasteur increased 8.8% to €4,577 million mainly driven by the PPH franchise, the benefits from our flu differentiation strategy and, to a lesser extent, the dengue launch. In the fourth quarter, Polio/Pertussis/Hib vaccines sales increased 16.5% to €544 million reflecting supply improvements of Pentacel® in the U.S. (€119 million versus €53 million in the fourth quarter of 2015). Customer allocations for Pentacel® were removed in December 2016 and both private and public channels have now full access to Pentacel to meet their needs. In Emerging Markets, PPH sales increased 5.1% to €304 million driven by the growth of Hexaxim®, partially offset by the impact of local market disruption in China. Full-year PPH sales were up 12.7% to €1,495 million. Fourth-quarter Influenza vaccines sales were down 5.3% to €416 million due to early shipments in the U.S. in the third quarter. Sales of Influenza vaccines were down 14.0% to €280 million in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. In 2016, Influenza vaccines sales increased 16.6% to €1,521 million, reflecting Sanofi Pasteur’s strategy to offer a portfolio of differentiated influenza vaccines. 2016 was a new record year for the Influenza franchise of Sanofi Pasteur. Adult Booster vaccines sales decreased 15.3% to €129 million in the fourth quarter, as a result of lower sales in Europe due to a Repevax® supply disruption. In the U.S. adult Booster vaccines sales were down 2.0% to €100 million. Full-year sales of Adult Booster vaccines decreased 15.5% to €417 million mainly driven by supply issues with Repevax® and increased competitive pressure towards Adacel® in the US. Dengvaxia®, the world’s first dengue vaccine, is now approved in 14 countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Thailand, Singapore Venezuela and the Philippines). As expected, sales of Dengvaxia® were limited (€5 million) in the fourth quarter as no new immunization programs were implemented. These sales were generated in the private market and by the public vaccination program launched in Paraná State in Brazil in the third quarter. In 2016, Dengvaxia® sales were €55 million. Fourth-quarter Menactra® sales were up 1.0% to €107 million, €93 million of which was generated in the U.S (up 7.1%) reflecting the market leadership of Menactra®. In 2016, sales of Menactra® increased 4.8% to €586 million. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 Travel and other endemic vaccines sales were €107 million (up 4.0%) and €368 million (down 0.8%), respectively. In the fourth quarter, Sanofi Pasteur MSD, the joint venture with Merck & Co. in Europe, sales (not consolidated) increased 25.5% (on a reported basis) to €301 million. Excluding the 2016 year-end inventories repurchase to both parent companies, sales were flat, the growth of Hexyon® (pediatric hexavalent vaccine) and travel vaccines sales being largely offset by lower Influenza and boosters vaccines sales. In 2016, sales of Sanofi Pasteur MSD were up 14.1% (on a reported basis) to €940 million (including the disposal of 2016 year-end inventories to both parent companies). As previously announced, on January 2, 2017, Sanofi Pasteur and MSD separated their vaccine joint venture in Europe in order to pursue their own vaccine strategies and integrate their respective European vaccines businesses into their own operations.

Growth in the fourth quarter also benefited from the performance of the Rare disease (up 7.7%), Oncology (up 5.0%), CHC (up 4.6%) and Vaccines (up 7.8%) franchises. The U.S. sales performance included growth of diabetes franchise (up 5.5%), aided by a low basis for comparison in the fourth quarter 2015. In 2016, sales in the U.S. increased 5.1% to €12,391 million. Sales in Emerging Markets increased 3.5% to €2,602 million in the fourth quarter driven by Rare Disease (up 23.5%), Diabetes (up 4.1%), Generics (up 5.1%) and Vaccines (up 7.3%). In the Asia region, fourth-quarter sales decreased 2.8% to €782 million reflecting lower sales in China (down 10.5% to €496 million), primarily impacted by local vaccines market disruption and inventory fluctuation. In Latin America, fourth-quarter sales increased 4.2% to €710 million driven by sales in Argentina and Brazil. Fourth-quarter sales in Brazil increased 5.6% to €244 million supported by performance of Vaccines and Established products. Fourth-quarter sales in the Eurasia region increased 8.4% to €329 million supported by strong growth in Turkey and Ukraine.

R&D update Consult Appendix 6 for full overview of Sanofi’s R&D pipeline Regulatory update Regulatory updates since the publication of the third quarter results on October 28, 2016 include the following:  In January 2017, Kevzara(TM) (sarilumab) was approved in Canada for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults. On October 28, 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the Biologics License Applications (BLA) for sarilumab for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. The CRL refers to certain deficiencies identified during a routine good manufacturing practice inspection of the Sanofi Le Trait facility where sarilumab is filled and finished, one of the last steps in the manufacturing process. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before the BLA can be approved. Based on review of Sanofi’s responses to the FDA 483 letters as well as proposed corrective actions, the FDA has classified the Le Trait ‘fill and finish’ facility as “acceptable”. Sanofi plans the re-submission of sarilumab U.S. BLA in the first quarter of 2017 subject to successful FDA pre-approval inspection of Le Trait.   In December 2016, the European Medicines Agency accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application for Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who are candidates for systemic therapy.   In November 2016, the FDA approved once-daily Soliqua(TM) 100/33 (insulin glargine 100 Units/mL & lixisenatide 33 mcg/mL injection) for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin (less than 60 Units daily) or lixisenatide. In January 2017, the European Commission also approved Suliqua(TM) in combination with metformin for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control when this has not been provided by metformin alone or metformin combined with another oral glucose lowering medicinal product or with basal insulin.  At the beginning of February 2017, the R&D pipeline contained 44 pharmaceutical new molecular entities (excluding Life Cycle Management) and vaccine candidates in clinical development of which 13 are in Phase 3 or have been submitted to the regulatory authorities for approval. Portfolio update Phase 3: Sotagliflozin, an oral SGLT-1&2 inhibitor, entered into Phase 3 in type 2 diabetes. The Phase 3 program evaluating dupilumab, an anti-IL4Ralpha monoclonal antibody, in nasal polyposis was initiated. GZ402666 (also referred as neoGAA) entered into Phase 3 for the treatment of Pompe Disease.   Isatuximab, an anti-CD38 naked monoclonal antibody, entered Phase 3 development for the treatment of relapsed refractory multiple myeloma.   In November, Sanofi and Regeneron announced that the ongoing Praluent® ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial will continue as planned, based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) after a second pre-specified interim analysis was conducted.   In November, the results of SARIL-RA-MONARCH, a Phase 3 study, demonstrated the superiority of investigational sarilumab monotherapy versus adalimumab (marketed by AbbVie as Humira®) monotherapy in improving the clinical signs and symptoms in adults with active rheumatoid arthritis. The data were presented at the American College of Rheumatology 2016 Annual Meeting. Top-line results had been announced in March 2016. Phase 2:  SAR439152, a myosin inhibitor, moved into Phase 2 for the treatment of Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.   SAR425899, a GLP-1 / GCGR agonist, entered into Phase 2 in type 2 diabetes.   SAR566658, a maytansin-loaded anti-CA6 monoclonal antibody, moved into Phase 2 for the treatment of solid tumors.   Shan6, a pediatric hexavalent vaccine from Shantha, entered Phase 2.   A vaccine entered Phase 2 against HIV infection for at risk population. Phase 1:  SAR439794, a TLR4 agonist immunomodulator, entered Phase 1 for the treatment of peanut allergy.   An inactivated Zika vaccine entered Phase 1.   Respiratory Syncytial Virus vaccine for infants entered Phase 1. Collaboration On December 28th, 2016, Hanmi and Sanofi entered into an amendment to their initial license agreement executed for the development of a portfolio of long-acting diabetes treatments. Sanofi returned to Hanmi the rights related to the weekly long-acting insulin to primarily focus on development of the weekly GLP-1 (efpeglenatide). Hanmi will take the development lead on the weekly insulin and will assume responsibility for the development of the long-acting weekly efpeglenatide/insulin drug combination for a certain period of time, after which Sanofi will re-assume responsibility for development. 2016 fourth-quarter and full-year financial results(7) Business Net Income(7) In the fourth quarter of 2016, Sanofi generated sales of €8,867 million, an increase of 3.3% (up 3.4% at CER). 2016 sales were €33,821 million, down 0.7% (up 1.2% at CER). Fourth-quarter other revenues increased 31.9% to €310 million and include VaxServe sales of non-Sanofi products (up 62.5% to €221 million) following the change in presentation as of January 1, 2016(7). 2016 other revenues increased 10.7% to €887 million of which €581 million were generated by VaxServe (up 20.5%). Fourth-quarter Gross Profit increased 4.5% to €6,221 million (up 4.5% at CER). The gross margin ratio improved by 0.8 percentage points to 70.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting mainly the positive impact of Aubagio® and rare disease franchise, the low basis for comparison in the fourth quarter of 2015 from the recall of Auvi-Q® and Medicaid delayed bills related to Lantus® as well as industrial productivity improvements. In 2016, the gross margin ratio improved by 0.7 percentage points to 71.0% versus 2015, driven by the strong performance of Sanofi Genzyme. In 2016, the gross margin ratio of Pharmaceuticals was 72.4%, an improvement of 0.9 percentage points and the gross margin ratio of Vaccines was stable at 62.0%. Sanofi expects its gross margin ratio to be approximatively 70% at CER in 2017. Research and Development expenses were up 5.4% to €1,437 million, (up 4.7% at CER) in the fourth quarter. This increase reflected the start of several Phase 3 programs especially isatuximab, as well as ongoing Toujeo® studies. In 2016, the ratio of R&D to sales was 0.4 percentage points higher at 15.3% compared to the same period of 2015. Selling general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 4.9% to €2,603 million in the fourth quarter. At CER,   SG&A was up 4.8% mainly reflecting pre-launch costs for Kevzara(TM) and Dupixent(TM), as well as one-time costs linked to the pre-integration of Boehringer Ingelheim CHC business. The ratio of SG&A to sales increased 0.5 percentage points to 29.4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2016, the ratio of SG&A to sales was 0.5 percentage points higher at 28.0% compared with 2015 mainly due to launch costs of new products. Fourth-quarter other current operating income net of expenses was -€78 million versus €24 million for the same period of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, this line included a foreign exchange loss linked to our operation in Egypt. In 2016, other current operating income net of expenses was -€127 million versus -€208 million in 2015. The share of profits from associates was €53 million in the fourth quarter versus €31 million for the same period of 2015. The share of profits from associates included Sanofi’s share in Regeneron profit as well as Sanofi’s share of profit in Sanofi Pasteur MSD (the Vaccines joint venture with Merck & Co. in Europe). In 2016, the share of profits from associates was €177 million versus €169 million in 2015. In the fourth quarter, non-controlling interests were -€32 million versus -€39 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2016, non-controlling interests were -€113 million versus -€126 million in 2015. Fourth-quarter business operating income was stable at €2,124 million. At CER, business operating income increased 3.7%. The ratio of business operating income to net sales decreased 0.7 percentage point to 24.0% versus the same period of 2015. In 2016, business operating income decreased 0.3% to €9,285 million (or up 3.1% at CER). In 2016, the ratio of business operating income to net sales increased 0.2 percentage point to 27.5%. In 2016, the business operating income ratio of Pharmaceuticals was 26.8%, 0.1 percentage points lower and the business operating income ratio of vaccines improved 1.2 percentage points to 34.4%. Net financial expenses were €125 million in the fourth quarter versus €73 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 which included disposals and reassessments of financial assets. Full-year net financial expenses were €399 million versus €381 million in 2015. Fourth-quarter effective tax rate (without Animal Health) was 24.0% compared with 17.4% in 2015. The 2015 tax reflected the effects of the modification in France of the taxation of dividend. In 2016, the effective tax rate was 23.3% versus 21.7% in 2015. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 business net income of Merial was €81 million (versus €17 million in the same period of 2015) and €476 million (versus €368 million in 2015), respectively. (7) See Appendix 4 for 2016 fourth-quarter and 2016 Consolidated income statement; see Appendix 11 for definitions of financial indicators, and Appendix 3 for reconciliation of business net income to IFRS net income reported Fourth-quarter business net income(7) decreased 6.0% to €1,606 million (down 2.9% at CER). In 2016, business net income decreased 0.9% to €7,308 million, (up 2.5% at CER). In the fourth quarter of 2016, business earnings per share(7) (EPS) decreased 4.6% to €1.25 on a reported basis and 1.5% at CER. The average number of shares outstanding was 1,282.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus 1,304.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2016, business earnings per share(7) was €5.68, up 0.7% on a reported basis and up 4.1% at CER. The average number of shares outstanding was 1,286.6 million in 2016 versus 1,306.2 million in 2015. Cost savings In 2016, Sanofi delivered approximately €650 million of cost savings which was largely reinvested to support growth initiatives. Sanofi expects that cost savings will reach €1.3 billion in 2017 and the company confirms that it remains on track to deliver at least €1.5 billion of cost savings by 2018. 2017 guidance Sanofi expects 2017 Business EPS to be stable to -3% at CER, barring unforeseen major adverse events, consistent with its previously announced Strategic Roadmap guidance for the 2016-17 period. Applying the average December 2016 exchange rates, the currency impact on 2017 Business EPS is estimated to be +3% to +4%. Dividend The Board of Directors convened on February 7, 2017, and proposed a dividend of €2.96 per share. From business net income to IFRS net income reported (see Appendix 3) In 2016, the main reconciling items between business net income and IFRS net income reported were: A €1,692 million amortization charge related to fair value remeasurement on intangible assets of acquired companies (primarily Aventis: €482 million and Genzyme: €866 million) and to acquired intangible assets (licenses/products: €142 million). A €412 million amortization charge on intangible assets related to fair value remeasurement of acquired companies (primarily Aventis: €103 million and Genzyme: €219 million), and to acquired intangible assets (licenses/products: €38 million) was booked in the fourth quarter. These items have no cash impact on the Company.   An impairment of intangible assets of €192 million (of which €119 recorded in the fourth quarter which included an impairment linked to Apleway/tofogliflozin in Japan). This item has no cash impact on the Company. The fourth quarter of 2015 included an impairment of intangible assets of €533 million mainly linked to Afrezza®, rotavirus vaccine and Auvi-Q®.   An impairment of €457 million related to Alnylam investment (of which €296 million recorded in the fourth quarter) for the difference between the market value based on the stock price as of December 31, 2016 and historical cost. On October 5, 2016, Alnylam announced the decision to end revusiran development program leading to a drop in the Alnylam stock price.   A charge of €135 million (of which €41 million in the fourth quarter) mainly reflecting an increase of Bayer contingent considerations linked to Lemtrada® (charge of €78 million, of which €17 million in the fourth quarter) and CVR fair value adjustment (charge of €58 million, of which €24 million in the fourth quarter).   Restructuring costs and similar items of €879 million (including €189 million in the fourth quarter) mainly related to the organizational transformation program in France and worldwide.   A €841 million tax effect arising from the items listed above, comprising €647million of deferred taxes generated by amortization charged against intangible assets, €95 million associated with restructuring costs and similar items, €47million associated with impairment of intangible assets and €24 million associated with fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities. The fourth quarter tax effect was €95 million, including €197 million of deferred taxes on amortization charged against intangible assets, -€139 million associated with restructuring costs and similar items, €24 million associated with impairment of intangible asset (see Appendix 3).

Boyd Woodruff / Microbiologist who paved way for antibiotics July 22, 1917-Jan. 19, 2017 February 7, 2017 11:47 PM Special Collections and University Archives, Rutgers University Libraries In an undated handout photo, H. Boyd Woodruff, right, is seen with his mentor at Rutgers, Selman A. Waksman, in 1940. By Sam Roberts / The New York Times H. Boyd Woodruff, a farmer’s son whose groundbreaking research enabled fellow scientists to harvest an arsenal of lifesaving antibiotics from ordinary dirt, died on Jan. 19 at his home in Watchung, New Jersey. He was 99. His death was confirmed by his son Hugh. Mr. Woodruff was instrumental in isolating two microbes that, while effective against tuberculosis and other infections, proved toxic to humans. But his findings in the early 1940s inspired the rapid development of streptomycin, the miracle cure used to treat tuberculosis, typhoid, plague and other diseases that did not respond to penicillin and other drugs. “This was the eureka moment in all antibiotic discovery,” Douglas E. Eveleigh, a professor emeritus of biochemistry and microbiology at Rutgers University, said of Mr. Woodruff’s research in an email Thursday. “The pharmaceutical industry caught on very rapidly, and there followed an avalanche of antibiotics,” Mr. Eveleigh said. “This was all dependent on the Woodruff proof of concept in screening for antibiotic production.” In 1942, Mr. Woodruff left his laboratory at Rutgers to join Merck & Co., the pharmaceutical giant, where he oversaw the introduction of other antibiotics, vitamins B12 and C, and riboflavin; a treatment for a rare cancer called Wilms tumor; a pneumonia vaccine; and a drug used to treat river blindness. His mentor at Rutgers, Selman A. Waksman, and his Merck colleague William C. Campbell, who developed Avermectin for river blindness, both won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. Harold Boyd Woodruff, known as Boyd, was born on July 22, 1917, in Bridgeton, New Jersey. His father, also named Harold, owned a farm, continuing a family tradition that dated to the early 18th century. His mother, the former Velma Smith, was a secretary. The family farm, which lacked electricity, could not support the Woodruffs during the Depression, so his father resorted to sharecropping and later moved the family to Buffalo, where he worked briefly in a seafood restaurant. They moved from upstate New York because Velma Woodruff suffered from the cold — first to Virginia, then to Florida and finally back to New Jersey. “She’d get sick every winter and, of course, in those days, you didn’t have antibiotics or anything to treat infections,” Mr. Woodruff recalled in a 2004 oral history for Rutgers. “The doctor finally told my dad, ‘Look, you’ve got to move out of this country or you’re not going to have her much longer.’ ” In high school, he considered becoming an architect but, he later recalled, decided he wanted to be a chemist after taking an experimental course that encouraged “unexpected smells and disruptions of nearby classes,” he wrote in the Annual Review of Microbiology in 1981. He enrolled in Rutgers, where he lived above a chicken coop on campus. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in soil chemistry in 1939 and earned a doctorate in microbiology under Waksman in what was then the New Jersey Agriculture Experiment Station (now the Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences). “For the first time,” Mr. Woodruff wrote in the Annual Review, “I realized the unity of biology and chemistry, that each biological observation has an underlying chemical cause, that in unraveling the latter, one could understand the other.” Inspired by Alexander Fleming’s experiments with penicillin and research by a former Rutgers graduate student, René Dubos of the Rockefeller Institute (now The Rockefeller University), Mr. Waksman encouraged Mr. Woodruff to investigate whether actinomycetes, threadlike bacteria found in the soil, could produce what would become known as an antibiotic. Mr. Woodruff was able to isolate two microbes, culture them and purify the antibiotics they produced: first actinomycin, which he found could inhibit tuberculosis, and later streptothricin. That advance led to the discovery of streptomycin by another Rutgers graduate student, Albert Schatz. Mr. Schatz later successfully sued to be recognized with Waksman as a discoverer of the drug and, with Waksman and his other former assistants, to share in some of the royalties. (Most of the royalties supported further research.) During that suit, Mr. Waksman said that in isolating streptothricin, Mr. Woodruff had contributed “as much as 20 times” more than Mr. Schatz to the later discovery of streptomycin, Peter Pringle wrote in his book “Experiment Eleven: Deceit and Betrayal in the Discovery of the Cure for Tuberculosis” (2012). Mr. Eveleigh of Rutgers agreed. “The studies of Albert Schatz in his discovery of streptomycin,” he said, “were dependent on the initial antibiotic demonstration by Mr. Woodruff that one could isolate soil microorganisms, culture them and recover inhibitory compounds from them.” Mr. Woodruff, who was assigned 2 percent of the royalties in the settlement of Mr. Schatz’s suit, later endowed an undergraduate scholarship fund and a microbiology graduate fellowship in soils and environmental biology at Rutgers. At Merck, he was on the team that during World War II perfected the first commercial mass production of penicillin. He was later the executive director for biological sciences and executive administrator for Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories in Japan for 10 years. He was also the founding editor of the journal Applied Microbiology. In addition to Mr. Woodruff’s many awards, a bacterium, Seleniivibrio woodruffii — isolated from sludge in a New Jersey wastewater treatment plant — was named in his honor.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 February 2017 by Military News Global Co-development Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010 to 2017 LONDON, Feb. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Summary The Global Co-development Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech & Diagnostics 2010-2017 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the co-development deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading healthcare companies. Description The Global Co-development Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2017 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the co-development deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading life science companies. This report provides details of the latest Co-development agreements announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of Co-development agreements from 2010 to 2017. There is an increasing willingness for parties to enter co-development deals; such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big product win, whereas traditional licensing deals forfeit upside for near term upfront, milestone and royalty payments. Co-development partnering allow the parties to securitize value and reduce risk, but keep a part of the potential upside should the product reach the market. Event if the licensor does not commercialize the project they can either sell those rights to the licensee partner or another partner for an amount higher than would have been achieved at an earlier stage licensing deal. There are mainly two forms of co-development deals; Either the parties agree on a certain division of ownership, or decide that one party gets the rights to commercialise the drug in a certain geographical area, and the other side gets the other geographical area rights. Typically, the ownership division applies when it is likely that the project will be licensed at a later point in time. The geographical split usually applies when the two companies are determined to commercialise the drug themselves. Another reason for co-development deals is the joint origin of a project. Drug development projects often require various scientific and technological novelties that stem from different companies. If both companies contributed to the origination of the project, then both have from the beginning a stake in the project. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner’s negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not. This report contains a comprehensive listing of Co-development deals announced since 2010 as recorded in the Current Agreements deals and alliances database, including financial terms where available, plus links to online copies of actual Co-development contract documents as submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission by companies and their partners.

Description The Global Collaborative R&D Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2012-2017 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the collaborative R&D deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading life science companies. This report provides details of the latest collaborative R&D deals announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully up to date with the latest information, the report provides details of collaborative R&D deals from 2012 to 2017. There has been a long standing willingness for parties to enter collaborative R&D deals. Such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big R&D win, whilst mitigating the risks of going it alone in the risky preclinical and clinical development stages. Collaborative R&D is a specific type of partnering deal whereby the parties to the deal agree to collaborate on the research and development and subsequently commercialize a compound, product or technology. There are several forms of a collaborative R&D deal; A traditional collaborative R&D arrangement whereby an owner of intellectual property (the licensor) provides access to its technology to another company (the licensee) in return for agreed payments and royalties on subscequent sales of product(s) derived from the intellectual property. In more recent times, licensing is often the outcome of a successful period of collaborative R&D on the research and development of a technology or compound, resulting in a product which can be commercialized. In this situation, the collaborative R&D agreement governs who has permission to commercialize and what payments are due should commercialization proceed. The report provides a detailed understand and analysis of how and why companies enter collaborative R&D deals. The majority of deals are multicomponent whereby the licensee retains either a right or option to license to comoercialize the resultant product of the research collaboration. There are also numerous pure licensing deals whereby the products originator takes on a development/commercialization partner in order to maximize a technologies/products prospects. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner’s negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms.

Collaborative R&D is a specific type of partnering deal whereby the parties to the deal agree to collaborate on the research and development and subsequently commercialize a compound, product or technology. There are several forms of a collaborative R&D deal; A traditional collaborative R&D arrangement whereby an owner of intellectual property (the licensor) provides access to its technology to another company (the licensee) in return for agreed payments and royalties on subscequent sales of product(s) derived from the intellectual property. In more recent times, licensing is often the outcome of a successful period of collaborative R&D on the research and development of a technology or compound, resulting in a product which can be commercialized. In this situation, the collaborative R&D agreement governs who has permission to commercialize and what payments are due should commercialization proceed. The report provides a detailed understand and analysis of how and why companies enter collaborative R&D deals. The majority of deals are multicomponent whereby the licensee retains either a right or option to license to comoercialize the resultant product of the research collaboration. There are also numerous pure licensing deals whereby the products originator takes on a development/commercialization partner in order to maximize a technologies/products prospects. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payment clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not.

LONDON, Feb. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Summary The Global Co-development Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech & Diagnostics 2010-2017 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the co-development deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading healthcare companies. Description The Global Co-development Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2017 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the co-development deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading life science companies. This report provides details of the latest Co-development agreements announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of Co-development agreements from 2010 to 2017. There is an increasing willingness for parties to enter co-development deals; such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big product win, whereas traditional licensing deals forfeit upside for near term upfront, milestone and royalty payments. Co-development partnering allow the parties to securitize value and reduce risk, but keep a part of the potential upside should the product reach the market. Event if the licensor does not commercialize the project they can either sell those rights to the licensee partner or another partner for an amount higher than would have been achieved at an earlier stage licensing deal. There are mainly two forms of co-development deals; Either the parties agree on a certain division of ownership, or decide that one party gets the rights to commercialise the drug in a certain geographical area, and the other side gets the other geographical area rights. Typically, the ownership division applies when it is likely that the project will be licensed at a later point in time. The geographical split usually applies when the two companies are determined to commercialise the drug themselves. Another reason for co-development deals is the joint origin of a project. Drug development projects often require various scientific and technological novelties that stem from different companies. If both companies contributed to the origination of the project, then both have from the beginning a stake in the project. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not. This report contains a comprehensive listing of Co-development deals announced since 2010 as recorded in the Current Agreements deals and alliances database, including financial terms where available, plus links to online copies of actual Co-development contract documents as submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission by companies and their partners. Contract documents provide the answers to numerous questions about a prospective partner's flexibility on a wide range of important issues, many of which will have a significant impact on each party's ability to derive value from the deal. The initial chapters of this report provide an orientation of Co-development dealmaking and business activities. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the report, whilst chapter 2 provides an overview and analysis of the trends in Co-development as well as a discussion on the merits of the type of deal. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the structure of Co-development deals. The chapter includes numerous case studies to enable understanding of both pure Co-development deals and multicomponent deals where Co-development forms a part. Chapter 4 provides a review of the leading Co-development deals since 2010. Deals are listed by headline value. Where the deal has an agreement contract published at the SEC a link provides online access to the contract via the Current Agreements deals and alliances database. Chapter 5 provides a comprehensive listing of the top 50 most active Co-development dealmaker companies. Each deal title links via Current Agreements deals and alliances database to an online version of the full deal record, and where available, the actual contract document, providing easy access to each deal record on demand. Chapter 6 provides a comprehensive review of co-development financials for deals announced since 2010, including headline value, upfront, milestone payments and royalty rates, providing both benchmark data and access to individual deal financials. Chapter 7 provides a comprehensive and detailed review of Co-development deals organized by company A-Z, therapy, technology and industry type signed and announced since 2010 where a contract document is available. Contract documents provide an indepth insight into the actual deal terms agreed between the parties with respect to the Co-development deal. The appendices to the report includes a comprehensive listing of all Co-development deals announced since 2010. Each listing is organized as an appendix by company A-Z, stage of development at signing, therapeutic area and industry type.

Description The Global Co-development Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2017 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the co-development deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading life science companies. This report provides details of the latest Co-development agreements announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of Co-development agreements from 2010 to 2017. There is an increasing willingness for parties to enter co-development deals; such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big product win, whereas traditional licensing deals forfeit upside for near term upfront, milestone and royalty payments. Co-development partnering allow the parties to securitize value and reduce risk, but keep a part of the potential upside should the product reach the market. Event if the licensor does not commercialize the project they can either sell those rights to the licensee partner or another partner for an amount higher than would have been achieved at an earlier stage licensing deal. There are mainly two forms of co-development deals; Either the parties agree on a certain division of ownership, or decide that one party gets the rights to commercialise the drug in a certain geographical area, and the other side gets the other geographical area rights. Typically, the ownership division applies when it is likely that the project will be licensed at a later point in time. The geographical split usually applies when the two companies are determined to commercialise the drug themselves. Another reason for co-development deals is the joint origin of a project. Drug development projects often require various scientific and technological novelties that stem from different companies. If both companies contributed to the origination of the project, then both have from the beginning a stake in the project. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not.

DescriptionThe Global Collaborative R&D Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2012-2017 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the collaborative R&D deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading life science companies. This report provides details of the latest collaborative R&D deals announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully up to date with the latest information, the report provides details of collaborative R&D deals from 2012 to 2017. There has been a long standing willingness for parties to enter collaborative R&D deals. Such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big R&D win, whilst mitigating the risks of going it alone in the risky preclinical and clinical development stages. Collaborative R&D is a specific type of partnering deal whereby the parties to the deal agree to collaborate on the research and development and subsequently commercialize a compound, product or technology. There are several forms of a collaborative R&D deal; A traditional collaborative R&D arrangement whereby an owner of intellectual property (the licensor) provides access to its technology to another company (the licensee) in return for agreed payments and royalties on subscequent sales of product(s) derived from the intellectual property. In more recent times, licensing is often the outcome of a successful period of collaborative R&D on the research and development of a technology or compound, resulting in a product which can be commercialized. In this situation, the collaborative R&D agreement governs who has permission to commercialize and what payments are due should commercialization proceed. The report provides a detailed understand and analysis of how and why companies enter collaborative R&D deals. The majority of deals are multicomponent whereby the licensee retains either a right or option to license to comoercialize the resultant product of the research collaboration. There are also numerous pure licensing deals whereby the products originator takes on a development/commercialization partner in order to maximize a technologies/products prospects. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms.

Photo/ELVIS OGINA (NAIROBI) FEBRUARY 9TH,2017 Germany wants to tap into Kenyan workforce as it sets sights on growing its private sector presence in Africa. Yesterday, the European powerhouse signed a joint declaration of intent on the establishment of the Eastern African-German University of Applied Sciences in Kenya at the second German-African Business Summit, which is being held on African soil for the first time. The Sh3 billion deal will see the Thika-based institution offer undergraduate, masters and vocational vocational-oriented academic training in close co-operation with industry players. This will be key in providing technical and blue-collar competence to service German firms seeking to set up shop in Kenya and the region. “I signed two agreements, one on the programme on TIVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) and another on setting up the German Technical University to train graduates in the market,” said Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich at the summit’s opening in Nairobi yesterday. The CS said the 400 German companies eying the country and Africa at large are set to invest about Sh27.8 billion (252 million euros) in Kenya over the next few years of bilateral trade.

Kenya has also attracted large German companies, such as Merck, BASF, Bosch, B Braun Melsungen and Daimler. LIMITED PRESENCE The German Business Association in Kenya has also doubled its membership in just two years, from 70 to about 140 companies. European countries are grappling with ageing populations and costly labour that is endemic in the developed world as well as smaller markets. Africa, on the other hand, will have the largest potential workforce in the world in the next decade with a half of the African countries now middle-income economies, similar to India and China. German firms have very limited presence in the continent and are playing catch up with China, America and Japan who have in the past few years renewed interest on the continent. The $3.73 trillion German economy which boasts of 400,000 companies, has less than 1,000 of them active in Africa. ALSO READ: German police raid homes and mosques, arrest Tunisian suspected of planning attack Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Gerd Müller said Africa needs investment more than ever since it is expected that Africa’s population will double by 2050 which will create the need for 20 million jobs annually.   SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Do you have something to add to this story?

Profits drive our capitalist economy. This is not limited to Wall Street, where high returns on risky investments and a degree of carelessness — among other things — drove the 2008 financial crisis. This profit motive is in everything from media to medicine, and it’s intrinsic to our capitalist economy. Pharmaceutical companies are among the worst offenders. They have massive incentives to pursue and sell drugs that people will take every day for the rest of their (hopefully long) lives. Just as razor companies want people to keep buying razor blades, pharmaceutical companies want people to keep buying drugs. Unfortunately, in the current economic climate, finding a cure for a disease is a terrible investment, regardless of its public health impact. Too many millions of dollars pour into research and development, clinical trials and production for a once-use drug. It would, frankly, leave a company penniless. Only an exorbitant price (and customers willing and able to pay over and over again), would be able to return a company’s investment. The National Institutes of Health runs the Orphan Products Clinical Trials Grant program (OOPD), which seeks to mitigate the gap between the need to cure diseases and the need for private companies to make returns on their investments. As a way to fix this problem, OOPD offers funding benefits for companies that discover new treatments for “rare” diseases (defined as diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans) that would otherwise not find funding. This has turned into an extremely viable business model. Alexion, a New Haven biopharmaceutical company founded in 1992, is a perfect example. Alexion has over 2,400 employees worldwide. In 2007, the FDA approved Soliris, Alexion’s centerpiece drug for two rare blood diseases (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome). Soliris is considered the most expensive drug in the world, costing a whopping $409,500 annually for the average patient and yielding $2.59 billion in total net sales in 2015 alone. Soliris is the first and only drug available for these rare, genetic blood disorders. And this monopoly on a cure allows and incentivizes Alexion to charge as much as it can to maximize its returns. The drug cost billions of dollars in development but only serves a community of only 8,000 Americans. And these drugs are almost always covered by insurance. High profile academics already support a similar program to the NIH’s program called the Health Impact Fund, which wants to incentivize drug companies to work on drugs that primarily affect low-income countries, such as vaccines for infectious diseases that concentrate in Africa and Asia. These diseases impact millions of people. The HIF, currently only a theoretical fund, proposes to draw on funds from governments (adjusted for national gross domestic product) as well as private individuals. Going further, the HIF would pay companies based on calculated public health impact rather than on high prices and sales. The NIH should consider expanding upon the Orphan Products Grant program and work with the model of the HIF but in addition to incentives for drugs with high public health benefit, also incentives for drugs for diseases with currently available “treatments” but not cures. Otherwise, companies with economically viable products like insulin pumps or blood testing devices have no incentive to innovate and leave profitable, functional products obsolete. These theoretical NIH grants would have to be near billions per attained “cure” drug because the top pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Gilead, Roche, Novartis, Sanofi, Merck, Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly each spend over $3 billion for R&D annually. However, with the national annual spending on healthcare at $3.35 trillion, spending in the billions to eradicate a costly disease entirely is a wise investment. And with an NIH annual budget of $30 billion in 2015 and the U.S. federal government spending at $3.69 trillion in 2015, our government would be able to supply these cure grants to pharmaceutical companies to compensate their R&D and production costs and keep prices manageable for the fortunate one-time users of the treatment. Just the promise of a cure grant so massive would spur new research projects and accelerate progress toward life-changing cures rather than just stopgap treatments. Our future doctors, scientists, entrepreneurs, government officials and investors need to consider the public good and potential to alleviate human suffering of their projects, not just easy potential profit that does not require discovery and innovation. Alexion shows how a company can be incubated out of a university (founded by former Yale physician, Leonard Bell) and bring cures to unserved patient populations and keep jobs near universities. Alexion has 1,000 of its 3,000 employees located in New Haven. Stephen Lewis is a junior in Branford College.

Note that two revisions of screening recommendations pushed the clinical practice pendulum toward longer intervals between screening although women and clinicians alike have yet to accept the newer recommendations. A consensus has emerged regarding the superiority of HPV DNA testing over Pap smear cytology as the primary approach to screening for cervical cancer but "optimal implementation" remains unsettled, the editor of a published series on the topic concluded. The facts supporting DNA testing "are beyond question," Mark Schiffman, MD, of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), said in an editorial accompanying nine other articles and commentaries in the current issue of Preventive Medicine. However, evaluation and debate continue over screening strategies to optimize the use of HPV testing. "Regardless of what prevention strategy is chosen, it should be scientifically and medically defensible," Schiffman wrote. "On the extremes, I would personally argue that continued dependence on VIA (visual inspection with acetic acid), or excessively frequent repetition of cytology and HPV co-testing, are not justified by the data. As different strategies are applied worldwide, the hope is that they will be translatable and represent different societal conclusions sharing a jointly understood scientific base." Other components of the series include reviews of the evidence, perspectives on how screening with HPV DNA testing might be implemented in various resource-defined settings, and a review of potential strategies to triage women who have positive tests. The journal editors explained the reasoning behind devoting much of an entire issue to a single topic. "Pap cytology has been a core technology in medicine and public health; that is, until it became patent that cervical cancer was the long-term consequence of a sexually transmitted infection," said Sandra D. Isidean, MD, and Gayle A. Shinder, PhD, both of McGill University in Montreal. "It has since become clear that testing for the causal agent, human papillomavirus, can bring substantial improvements and efficiency to cervical cancer screening." The transition from one technology to the other provided a rationale and served as the backdrop for the series of articles and commentaries, they added. Review of Evidence Joseph E. Tota, PhD, who has positions at McGill and NCI, and co-authors contributed an evidence-based review of HPV testing as the primary approach to cervical cancer screening. They acknowledged "overwhelming evidence from large-scale clinical trials, feasibility studies, and real-world experience" supporting the superiority of HPV testing over cervical cytology. Despite the scientific evidence, many questions about optimal use of the new technology remain unanswered, Tota and colleagues continued. These include the age at which screening should start, screening interval, and triage of patients who test positive. Noting that countries are in various stages of adopting HPV-based primary screening, the authors insisted that unanswered questions "should not be considered barriers to implementation." Authors of three articles addressed implementation of HPV-based screening in low-, lower-middle-, and upper-middle-income settings. Participants in an Italian consensus conference reviewed the evidence and rationale for recommending cervical cancer screening starting at age 30 for women who were vaccinated against HPV as adolescents, with rescreening every 5 years for women who test negative. Additionally, two specialists in women's health provide the U.S. perspective, focusing on the continual struggle to strike a balance between benefits and potential harms. Historically, many U.S. patients and their physicians have preferred annual cytology, either alone or, more recently, with HPV co-testing, said Walter K. Kinney, MD, of Permanente Medical Group in Sacramento, Calif., and Warner K. Huh, MD, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended annual screening in practice bulletins published in 1995 and 2003. Subsequently, two revisions of screening recommendations pushed the clinical practice pendulum toward longer intervals between screening. In 2004 an expert panel recommended co-testing at 3-year intervals. In 2012 another panel recommended cytology at 3-year intervals or co-testing every 5 years, which many patients and physicians considered unacceptable because "it embraced the potential compromise of cancer protection without directly admitting this potential outcome," said Kinney and Huh. Grudging Acceptance Women and clinicians alike have yet to accept the newer recommendations. "From the women's perspective, the new recommendations appear to decrease service for the purpose of saving money for insurers," said Kinney and Huh. "It is our impression that many U.S. women (and clinicians) reject the implicit claim that higher rates of colposcopy or even excision procedures of the cervix represent harms that can be balanced against prevention of invasive cancer." "We believe that patients reject the argument that resources saved by their accepting more preventable cancer can be better spent on other healthcare priorities and is often viewed as naive, paternalistic, and short sighted. We and they consider it more plausible that the savings generated by less screening and more cancer would be applied to other concerns that the patients do not share." Winning over the majority of U.S. patients and clinicians will require increased efficiency with no loss of the cancer protection afforded by annual cytology, Kinney and Huh concluded. Finally, a U.S. and a European clinician delved into the "facts, fiction, and misperceptions" surrounding HPV-based screening for cervical cancer and contributing to the varying approaches to incorporating HPV testing into cervical cancer screening. Several key questions remain unanswered: which HPV test to use; the most appropriate interval between tests; which test or tests to use in the triage of women who test positive for HPV. The ultimate solution -- and challenge -- is to integrate HPV vaccination and screening, "since increasingly vaccinated populations will have a continuous decrease of cervical cancer risk," concluded Nicolas Wentzensen, MD, PhD, of NCI, and Marc Arbyn, MD, of the Belgian Cancer Center in Brussels. Practice Evolution Two gynecologic oncologists not involved in the journal series said cervical cancer screening strategies -- and acceptance of HPV testing -- continue to evolve. "We are getting more accurate testing all the time, and in the next two decades, I believe we will have even more changes with more specific risk-identifying testing available," said Lois Ramondetta, MD, of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. " Having said that, she added, "I believe that in the future we will go back to more frequent testing, due to the reasons cited by Kinney and Huh. I and my patients are uncomfortable with every-5-year testing, and most are willing to take on more invasive testing in order to have a lower risk of 'missing' anything." Patient and provider reservations changing approach to cervical cancer screening have a history, said Mark H. Einstein, MD, of Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey in Newark. "Women who are perimenopausal or postmenopausal have been doing standard Pap tests for many years," Einstein told MedPage Today. "Pap tests are fantastic. They are at the basis of everything we have been doing for cervical cancer screening over the last 50 years. When a patient who has had a Pap every year for much of her life is told, 'You don't need one anymore. You need this different test,' she's going to have some reservations." At the same time, as the journal series indicated, HPV testing provides information about a woman's current cancer risk and her future risk, "which is very different from a Pap," he added. Clinicians also have become used to the Pap test as standard of care, Einstein continued. "It has become 'hard wired,' and it's going to take awhile, with education and flexibility, to adopt new ways of doing things into our practice," he said. "I anticipate that over time and with education, some of these barriers will be overcome." Huh disclosed relationships with InCellDx and Merck.

On the other hand, we were disappointed to announce the discontinuation of our revusiran program due to safety findings, although our investigation to date indicates the findings are unique to this program and the clinical setting,” said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. “2017 promises to be a pivotal year for Alnylam, with our first Phase 3 data read out – APOLLO for patisiran – and, if positive, our first NDA filing. In addition, we plan to advance three additional programs into Phase 3 trials. We believe all of these important milestones put us on track to meet our “Alnylam 2020” goals of becoming a multi-product, commercial-stage company with a deep and sustainable clinical development pipeline by the end of 2020.” Fourth Quarter 2016 and Recent Significant Corporate Highlights Advanced patisiran for the treatment of polyneuropathy due to hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis, with APOLLO Phase 3 data expected in mid-2017. Announced decision to discontinue development of revusiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that was being developed for the treatment of cardiomyopathy due to hATTR amyloidosis. Advanced fitusiran for the treatment of hemophilia and rare bleeding disorders (RBD), with positive new data presented at the 2016 American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting and additional data presented at the 2017 European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) meeting. Alnylam and partner Sanofi Genzyme announced that Sanofi Genzyme elected to exercise its right to co-develop and co-promote fitusiran with Alnylam in the United States, Canada and Western Europe. Sanofi Genzyme retains commercial rights for rest of world. Advanced givosiran (ALN-AS1) for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyrias with positive initial clinical activity results reported at the 2016 ASH meeting from Phase 1 study in acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) patients with recurring porphyria attacks.

In the case of patisiran, Alnylam will advance the product in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, while Sanofi Genzyme will advance the product in the ROW. In the case of fitusiran, Sanofi Genzyme has elected to opt in to co-develop (through Sanofi R&D) and co-commercialize fitusiran in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, in addition to developing and commercializing fitusiran in its ROW territories. About RNAi RNAi (RNA interference) is a revolution in biology, representing a breakthrough in understanding how genes are turned on and off in cells, and a completely new approach to drug discovery and development. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery today which was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. RNAi is a natural process of gene silencing that occurs in organisms ranging from plants to mammals. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, the creation of a major new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is on the horizon. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, target the cause of diseases by potently silencing specific mRNAs, thereby preventing disease-causing proteins from being made. RNAi therapeutics have the potential to treat disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way. About LNP Technology Alnylam has licenses to Arbutus LNP intellectual property for use in RNAi therapeutic products using LNP technology. About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines. Alnylam's pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in 3 Strategic Therapeutic Areas (STArs): Genetic Medicines, with a broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases; Cardio-Metabolic Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics toward genetically validated, liver-expressed disease targets for unmet needs in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics that address the major global health challenges of hepatic infectious diseases. In early 2015, Alnylam launched its "Alnylam 2020" guidance for the advancement and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of innovative medicines. Specifically, by the end of 2020, Alnylam expects to achieve a company profile with 3 marketed products, 10 RNAi therapeutic clinical programs - including 4 in late stages of development - across its 3 STArs. The company's demonstrated commitment to RNAi therapeutics has enabled it to form major alliances with leading companies including Ionis, Novartis, Roche, Takeda, Merck, Monsanto, The Medicines Company, and Sanofi Genzyme. In addition, Alnylam holds an equity position in Regulus Therapeutics Inc., a company focused on discovery, development, and commercialization of microRNA therapeutics. Alnylam scientists and collaborators have published their research on RNAi therapeutics in over 200 peer-reviewed papers, including many in the world's top scientific journals such as Nature, Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology, Cell, New England Journal of Medicine, and The Lancet. Founded in 2002, Alnylam maintains headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information about Alnylam's pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics, please visit www.alnylam.com.

Farah – who is married to Shirish Kunder – said they made many failed attempts of trying to have a baby naturally for two years, before opting for IVF. Now they are parents to triplets – one son and two daughters. “IVF is a blessing and I am really thankful as it has changed my life. A lot of factors today make it difficult for some couples to conceive, but we have solutions in the form of treatments. And I strongly believe in IVF…it has helped me conceive my angels,” said Farah. “Being persistent, positive and patient towards the procedure paid off. And if IVF can change my life, it could change yours too, ” added the star, who became a mother at the age of 43.

Revenue from the company’s drugs for the viral infection will be $7.5 billion to $9 billion in 2017, Gilead said in a statement Tuesday. That’s far below the $11.6 billion analysts had projected, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company sells three main hepatitis C treatments -- Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa. The shares plunged 9.6 percent to $66.10 at 9:36 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday decline since August 2015 and the lowest intraday price since April 2014. “This is a challenging situation,” Chief Executive Officer John Milligan said on a conference call with analysts Tuesday. The hepatitis C market is “declining faster this year than we would have predicted last year.” The hepatitis C pills -- which have cut treatment times and side effects compared to older medicines -- were the biggest drug launch of all time, and are still massive products for the Foster City, California, company. But competitors Merck & Co. and AbbVie Inc. have cut into Gilead’s market share, forcing prices down, and the bulk of the easiest-to-find patients may already have been treated, meaning that sales are expected to continue to decline. The average U.S. price of a one-month supply of Harvoni after discounts and rebates was less than $15,000 in 2016, Milligan said. For patients taking three months of treatment, that would be more than 52 percent off the list price of $94,500. Shorter Treatments Competition and shorter treatment duration for patients will reduce sales this year by $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion, compared to a year earlier, while fewer new patients starting on the drugs meant $2.9 billion to $3.8 billion less in 2017 sales, Gilead said in a presentation released along with the projections. Read More: How Gilead is Looking for New Hepatitis C Patients With an Army Vet While investors fret over what will replace the hepatitis C drugs, Gilead has said it wants to use acquisitions to fill its product pipeline. Yet it announced no new major deals, and instead increased its dividend by more than 10 percent. CEO Milligan acknowledged that it would be “challenging to grow without some sort of acquisition” outside of the HIV franchise, and Chief Financial Officer Robin Washington said the company will focus on pursuing external opportunities in the coming year. Fourth-quarter earnings, excluding one-time items, were $2.70 a share, beating analysts’ estimates of $2.61. Net income fell 34 percent to $3.11 billion, or $2.34 a share.

Hopkins, Robert Langreth and James Paton Published 4:50 pm, Tuesday, February 7, 2017 President Trump says drug prices are astronomical and something needs to be done. Pharmaceutical giants have an answer that doesn’t involve lowering list prices: refunding some of the money to insurers if a drug doesn’t work as expected. The concept of pay-for-performance isn’t new in the industry. But the number of such agreements between drugmakers and insurers has grown in the past year as Big Pharma seeks to defuse criticism over the soaring prices of some brand drugs, which can cost $10,000 a month or more for cancer treatments. The new administration “talks about getting more value for less,” said Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, CEO of Novo Nordisk, the world’s biggest maker of diabetes medicines. “Outcomes-based contracting could be one of the elements.” The drug industry is seeking to dodge Trump’s most drastic threats to reduce prices, including forcing companies to bid for government business. Lobbying group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America plans to propose an outcomes-based price plan this month as part of its proposals to address drug pricing concerns. Executives have touted the idea during a big investor conference and on earnings calls, and brought it up unprompted in media interviews. The topic was also discussed when a group of top pharmaceutical CEOs met Trump at the White House last week. “The buzzword of the day is value-based pricing paradigms,” Brent Saunders, CEO of Allergan, said in January. While reimbursing part of the cost for a treatment that doesn’t perform well sounds like a sensible solution, the concept is hard to execute. In conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol, results can be tracked with simple numerical measures. But it may be harder to pull off in areas like depression or cancer. There’s also little evidence that pay-for-performance will significantly lower drug prices overall. And one of the largest drug benefit managers in the country, Express Scripts, has criticized outcomes-based plans. Still, many insurance companies are intrigued. Cigna, for instance, has entered into seven outcomes-based deals since 2009, including two last year for injectable cholesterol-lowering drugs. Novo, based in Denmark, recently signed its first contract for the diabetes drug Victoza as part of a pilot project with Humana. At least five other companies have reached deals with various insurers in the past year, including Novartis, Merck, Amgen, Sanofi and Eli Lilly. Details on those agreements are proprietary, and remain scant. Swiss giant Novartis, one of the biggest boosters of the concept, has deals in place to refund four insurers, including Cigna and Humana, if its Entresto drug doesn’t keep heart failure patients out the hospital. It is considering agreements for leukemia treatment Tasigna, which costs more than $12,000 a month, and multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya, which lists for about $6,700 monthly. “We’ve been able to get the best of both worlds,” said Chris Bradbury, senior vice president of integrated clinical and specialty drug solutions at Cigna. The insurer gets competitive guaranteed discounts on prescriptions, and “the manufacturer is aligned and accountable when something doesn’t work.” So far, all the drugs have performed up to expectations. Drugmakers have defended their prices, saying it helps fund research and development of life-saving medicines. Digital data and medical records helped make pay-for-performance popular, yet tracking the results remains difficult with conditions that have subjective metrics, like those in the central nervous system. “Everyone likes the idea of outcomes-based contracting, but the contracts themselves are really complicated,” said Mark Fendrick, director of the Center for Value-Based Insurance Design at the University of Michigan. While outcomes-based pricing is useful for some drugs, the obstacles to apply the concept across the board “are nearly insurmountable,” said Peter Bach of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. It could require calling patients in for additional tests they don’t need merely to determine reimbursement. And because almost all of the details are proprietary, it is hard to know whether the programs are actually saving money, he said. “It would lower some drug prices, but the idea that this is a panacea is unfounded,” said Roger Longman, CEO of Real Endpoints, which analyzes drug reimbursements. “There is a significant amount of hype around these deals.” Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, agrees. The drug benefit manager prefers arrangements that refund money if a patient discontinues an expensive cancer or inflammation drug prematurely, rather than agreements that link discounts to hard-to-track results.

In the study, Hengchen Dai, PhD, of Washington University in St. Louis, and colleagues reminded 13,323 participants (45% men) by email to take their medication. Patients were all under commercial or Medicare Advantage insurance with Humana and had 40% to 80% medication adherence during the prior 12 months. On average, Dai's group reported online in JAMA Cardiology, people filled prescriptions covering 63.3% of the 90 days following the email, with no differences related to the timing of the reminder: Random date not close to New Year's or birthday (control) Week before birthday Week before birthday, with explicit references to new beginnings associated with the occasion 3 weeks after New Year's Day 3 weeks after New Year's Day, with explicit references to new beginnings associated with the occasion Dai and her colleagues randomized the timing of when patients receive the emails. Pharmacy claims provided data on the proportion of days covered for diabetes, cholesterol, or blood pressure pills. "Contrary to our expectations, sending reminders following fresh-start dates was not associated with increased medication adherence, and fresh-start–based framing was not associated with increased reminder effectiveness," the researchers concluded. But they weren't ready to give up on the idea. "Reminders received immediately after the target date could be more effective," they wrote. "We encourage further study before concluding that the psychology of fresh starts does not apply to medication adherence." Among the limitations of the study were the lack of a no-email group and the fact that Humana sent medication adherence reminders outside of the study, the authors noted. The study was funded by Humana. Dai reported grant support from Humana. Co-authors disclosed funding and/or employment by Humana; as well as relationships with Merck, Weight Watchers, CVS, VALHealth, and the Health Prize Academic Advisory Board. 2017-02-08T13:15:00-0500 Primary Source JAMA Cardiology Source Reference: Dai H, et al "Effectiveness of medication adherence reminders tied to 'fresh start' dates: a randomized clinical trial" JAMA Cardiol 2017; DOI: 10.1001/jamacardio.2016.5794. 0 comments More in Cardiology Unwitnessed Stroke Treatment Cath Lab Recap: Fully Percutaneous EVAR; Aneurysms Within BVS Heater-Cooler Infections Reported in Australia CardioBrief: Enormous NOAC Study Halted for 'Overwhelming Efficacy' About Help Center Site Map Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise with us Your Ad Choices The material on this site is for informational purposes only, and is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment provided by a qualified health care provider. © 2017 MedPage Today, LLC.

Trump also blasted foreign countries, which he said have been "freeloading" on the United States with price controls that limit what their own citizens can be charged for medications. "We have to get the prices down," Trump said. "We have to get the prices way down." "We have to get lower prices, we have to get even better innovation, and I want you to move your companies back to the United States," Trump said. "I want you to manufacture in the United States." Related: What's to Blame for High Drug Costs? Trump also said he wanted to make it easier for pharmaceutical companies to win regulatory approval for their products. "You're going to get your prices either approved, or not approved," the president said. "But it's going to be a quick process. It's not going to take 15 years." The meeting included the CEOs of Merck, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, as well as the head of the trade group PhRMA. In remarks to reporters while flanked by those CEOs, Trump said, "The U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the prices have been astronomical for our country."
