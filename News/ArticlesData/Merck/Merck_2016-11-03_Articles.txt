They won Best Trade Stand & The Innovation Award for Technology for Bovilis.ie 09:06 Friday 04 November 2016 0 Have your say A new web-based tool that enables veterinary practitioners to develop a customised vaccination calendar as part of the herd/flock health plans for their dairy, beef and sheep farmer clients has been developed by MSD Animal Health. Developed by Dr William Minchin, ruminants marketing manager and Sharon Magnier, veterinary advisor, with MSD Animal Health, the facility, which is the first of its kind, is available on the company’s dedicated animal health website www.bovilis.ie. Dr William Minchin MSD Animal Health receives the award for Best Trade Stand from Catriona Buckley of The Irish Examiner at the National Dairy Show 2016 held in Millstreet Co Cork Dr William Minchin said: “We believe this new facility will be of great assistance to vets and farmers in ensuring the most effective and compliant disease prevention strategies. “Many farmers forget to boost with vaccines or use products at inappropriate times for their production system. This web-based tool will ensure they have a permanent reminder of the critical dates for vaccinating against a broad range of cattle and sheep diseases.” How it works The new tool is very simple to use. All users are required to do is: Seamus Crowley (National Dairy Show), Minister Michael Creed (Department of Agriculture), Dr William Minchin MSD Animal Health, Catriona Buckley (Judge) The Irish Examiner, T J Duffy MSD Animal Health and Mrs Josephine Kiely (Judge) during the presentation of Best Trade Stand award at the National Dairy Show 2016 held in Millstreet Co Cork r Enter the farm enterprise information. r Select the diseases against which protection is required. r Provide the user’s contact details. Using a wide range of algorithms that are built into the facility, a customised calendar is then developed. Dr William Minchin (Marketing Manager MSD Animal Health), Fergal Morris (Ruminant Business Unit Director MSD Animal Health), Minister Michael Creed, Cara Sheridan (Veterinary Advisor MSD Animal Health), Mairead Pigott (President of Veterinary Ireland) and T J Duffy (Associate Product Manager MSD Animal Health) during the presentation of Best Stand Award at the National Dairy Show 2016 held in Millstreet Co Cork A text message is sent seven days before each vaccine booster is due. Where an email address is given in the contact details, a reminder email is also sent. The full calendar is also emailed to the user. This can be printed off and used as a reminder of the critical vaccination dates. There is no cost for the service. Jason Webb (National Dairy Show), Fergal Morris (MSD Animal Health), Seamus Maguire (MSD Animal Health), Dr William Minchin (MSD Animal Health), Niall ORegan (Innovation Awards Judge), T J Duffy (MSD Animal Health) and Cara Sheridan (MSD Animal Health) during the presentation for Innovation in Technology award which MSD Animal Health won for their new vaccination reminder service as a plug in tool on Bovilis.ie at the National Dairy Show 2016 held in Millstreet Co Cork While currently built for vaccines, the intention is to expand the tool for use in parasiticide treatments and routine farm husbandry. This innovation is part of a comprehensive campaign by MSD Animal Health to highlight the importance of disease prevention in order to enhance productivity in farming while also reducing antibiotic use in food producing animals. Use of vaccines to prevent disease has increased more than three-fold over the past decade and MSD is the largest supplier of preventative vaccines on the Irish market. With increasing numbers of farmers moving towards multiple disease prevention protocols, this new online tool will simplify routine vaccination, leading to healthier, more productive animals and more sustainable production systems.

ALSO READ Merck announces change in directorate Merck to hold board meeting Merck to hold board meeting Merck gains after good Q1 result Merck directors Brijesh Kapil and Ali Sleiman resign By Deena Beasley (Reuters) - Two prominent U.S. lawmakers on Thursday called on federal antitrust regulators to probe whether Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly and Co, Merck & Co Inc and Novo Nordisk A/S colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. The request by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings follows a similar letter they sent last fall calling for an investigation into 14 drug companies over price increases of generic drugs. U.S. prosecutors could file the first charges by the end of the year in their subsequent criminal investigation of generic drugmakers over suspected price collusion, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. (http://bloom.bg/2e6cZjF) A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. In their latest letter to the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, Sanders, an independent, and Cummings, a Democrat, raised questions about skyrocketing prices for insulin, and included a chart showing that many of the price spikes appeared to occur in tandem. They noted that the original patent on insulin, a hormone used by diabetics to control blood sugar levels, expired 75 years ago. Sanofi spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said in an emailed statement that "Sanofi sets the prices of our treatments independently." Novo Nordisk also said it sets prices "independently" and said it stands by its business practices. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company does not make insulin. Merck makes other products to treat diabetes. Eli Lilly, in an email, said it strongly disagrees with the accusations in the letter. "The insulin market in the U.S. is highly competitive," the pharmaceutical company said. Shares of several generic drugmakers fell on Thursday after the report of pending Justice Department charges. Mylan N.V. closed down 6.9 percent, Allergan Plc fell 4.5 percent and Endo International Plc dropped 19.5 percent. Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc Ltd, which recently acquired Allergan's generics business, fell 9.5 percent. "We do not think the major generic companies have likely participated in significant pricing collusion," A/B Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in a research note. Several generic drugmakers, including Mylan, Allergan, Endo and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, had previously disclosed that they were subpoenaed in connection with the antitrust investigation by the Justice Department. Bloomberg said the probe spans more than a dozen companies and about two dozen drugs, citing people familiar with the matter. Impax Laboratories Inc said earlier this year that the Justice Department had requested information on four drugs: blood pressure pill digoxin, asthma drug terbutaline sulfate, prilocaine/lidocaine cream and calcipotriene solution, which is used to treat psoriasis. A spokesman from Teva said the company "is not aware of any facts that would give rise to an exposure to the company with respect to these subpoenas." Officials at Endo and Lannett Company Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Aggressive drug pricing has come under intense scrutiny after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted her intent to tackle high prices last year. An August report from the Government Accountability Office found that more than 300 of 1,441 generic drugs analyzed had at least one price increase of 100 percent or more between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2015. In February, Sanders and Cummings asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' enforcement arm to investigate generic drug price increases. Recent price hikes that have drawn fire included Turing Pharmaceuticals' decision in 2015 to raise by 5,000 percent the price of a decades-old treatment for a dangerous parasitic infection. Generic drugmakers, possibly reacting to the political headwinds, reined in price hikes this year. Guggenheim Securities, citing polling of generic drugmakers, last month estimated that overall U.S. generic drug prices would dip by a percentage in the mid-single digits this year. The price erosion has been felt by drug wholesalers like McKesson Corp and Amerisource Bergen Corp, which rely on price fluctuations for part of their profit margins.

REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File PhotoMore By Deena Beasley (Reuters) - Two prominent U.S. lawmakers on Thursday called on federal antitrust regulators to probe whether Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly and Co, Merck & Co Inc and Novo Nordisk A/S colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. The request by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings follows a similar letter they sent last fall calling for an investigation into 14 drug companies over price increases of generic drugs. U.S. prosecutors could file the first charges by the end of the year in their subsequent criminal investigation of generic drugmakers over suspected price collusion, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. (http://bloom.bg/2e6cZjF) A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. In their latest letter to the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, Sanders, an independent, and Cummings, a Democrat, raised questions about skyrocketing prices for insulin, and included a chart showing that many of the price spikes appeared to occur in tandem. They noted that the original patent on insulin, a hormone used by diabetics to control blood sugar levels, expired 75 years ago. Sanofi spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said in an emailed statement that "Sanofi sets the prices of our treatments independently." Novo Nordisk also said it sets prices "independently" and said it stands by its business practices. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company does not make insulin. Merck makes other products to treat diabetes. Eli Lilly, in an email, said it strongly disagrees with the accusations in the letter. "The insulin market in the U.S. is highly competitive," the pharmaceutical company said. Shares of several generic drugmakers fell on Thursday after the report of pending Justice Department charges. Mylan N.V. closed down 6.9 percent, Allergan Plc fell 4.5 percent and Endo International Plc dropped 19.5 percent. Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc Ltd, which recently acquired Allergan's generics business, fell 9.5 percent. "We do not think the major generic companies have likely participated in significant pricing collusion," A/B Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in a research note. Several generic drugmakers, including Mylan, Allergan, Endo and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, had previously disclosed that they were subpoenaed in connection with the antitrust investigation by the Justice Department. Bloomberg said the probe spans more than a dozen companies and about two dozen drugs, citing people familiar with the matter. Impax Laboratories Inc said earlier this year that the Justice Department had requested information on four drugs: blood pressure pill digoxin, asthma drug terbutaline sulfate, prilocaine/lidocaine cream and calcipotriene solution, which is used to treat psoriasis. A spokesman from Teva said the company "is not aware of any facts that would give rise to an exposure to the company with respect to these subpoenas." Officials at Endo and Lannett Company Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Aggressive drug pricing has come under intense scrutiny after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted her intent to tackle high prices last year. An August report from the Government Accountability Office found that more than 300 of 1,441 generic drugs analyzed had at least one price increase of 100 percent or more between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2015. In February, Sanders and Cummings asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' enforcement arm to investigate generic drug price increases. Recent price hikes that have drawn fire included Turing Pharmaceuticals' decision in 2015 to raise by 5,000 percent the price of a decades-old treatment for a dangerous parasitic infection. Generic drugmakers, possibly reacting to the political headwinds, reined in price hikes this year. Guggenheim Securities, citing polling of generic drugmakers, last month estimated that overall U.S. generic drug prices would dip by a percentage in the mid-single digits this year. The price erosion has been felt by drug wholesalers like McKesson Corp and Amerisource Bergen Corp, which rely on price fluctuations for part of their profit margins.

Verubecestat, which is currently under clinical trial, is said to halt the beta amyloid plaque formation in brain.  ( Sean Gallup | Getty Images ) Advertisement One of the drugs developed by Merck, which is currently undergoing clinical trials, reportedly shows promise in treating Alzheimer's disease. Merck's Verubecestat For Alzheimer's The drug verubecestat has been found to be effective against the formation of beta amyloid plaque, the protein buildup in the brain, reports a team from Merck Research Laboratories. However, whether halting the sticky protein buildup could slow down the mental decline in Alzheimer's patients is yet to be studied. If Merck's verubecestat is found effective in treating cognitive decline in the major clinical trials, which are currently underway, it would be the first drug approved for use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in more than a decade. Matt Kennedy, who led the trial, noted that the therapeutic options currently available for Alzheimer's disease improve cognitive symptoms to a small extent but don't treat the underlying causes. Therefore, there is big need for a therapy that targets the root cause of the disease. Merck's Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trial According to the study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine on Nov. 2, the researchers tested verubecestat in 32 patients with early stage Alzheimer's disease. While all the patients received the drug for seven days, the healthy controls were asked to take the drug for two weeks. Though no difference in plaque accumulation was seen in MRI scans, the amount of plaque-forming components in the cerebrospinal fluid samples taken from patients were found to have been reduced. Mechanism Of Action Of Verubecestat Verubecestat blocks the enzyme BACE1, which plays a role in the production of two molecules that link together to form the amyloid plaque. It is noted that people with BACE1 gene mutation are observed to be resistant to Alzheimer's disease. However, this is not the first drug to target BACE1, since a number of attempts made earlier aimed at inhibiting the enzyme failed as a result of side effects that included eye problems and liver toxicity. The clinical trial by Merck involving verubecestat is the first large-scale trial conducted for Alzheimer's by far and the drug is also said to have fewer side effects than those previously tested. It is reported that the drug is being tested in 1,500 patients in very early stages of Alzheimer's disease and 2,000 patients suffering from mild to moderate levels of dementia. The results of first phase of these trials are expected to be out in July 2017. "People are excited," said John Hardy, a neuroscientist at University College London who first reported the role of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer's disease, reported The Guardian. "This is a very nice drug and I'm sure Merck are feeling very pleased with themselves." TAG Alzheimer's Disease, Verubecestat, Merck © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Merck (MerckGroup.com), a leading science and technology company, today announced the kick off of “Merck More than a Patient” which is a new initiative of “Merck Cancer Access Program” in Africa. Merck in partnership with “Women for Cancer” started this initiative with the aim to empower women cancer survivors in Africa through supporting them to establish their own small business so that they can lead an independent and productive life. African Press Organization / APO Merck will also help in raising awareness about Cancer prevention and early detection and tackling the myths and stigma associated with the disease with special focus on women. “I am very happy that “Merck More than a Patient” has this positive impact on these women’s lives. Therefore, this initiative will be launched in other African countries in 2017. Through our collaboration with cancer patients associations and cancer institutions across Africa, we aim to help uplift women cancer survivors to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy – and by doing so, they can now give back to the society through their new businesses. They will become more than cancer patients. In addition to our efforts to raise awareness about early detection and prevention specially addressing Cancer in Women” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer of Merck Healthcare. Benda Kithaka and Co-Founder and Chairperson of”Women for Cancer” emphasized: “We are grateful to Merck for the continued support towards “Women 4 Cancer” survivors and our recent collaboration through the “Merck More than a Patient” initiative. The cancer patients are also appreciative that Merck is assisting them to make strides in gaining financial independence beyond their cancer survivorship. Merck will also help raising awareness about Cancer and tackling myths and stigma associated with the disease, I am hoping we can together empower our communities to access accurate cancer information, which should result in behaviour change coupled with adoption of health seeking behaviour for quality cancer prevention and care”. Read about The women cancer survivors: “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Rose Chiedo, a cervical cancer survivor – read her story … Rose Atieno Chiedo, a 46 year old mother of one who lives in Nairobi, Kenya, is a cervical cancer survivor. Rose used to make and sell samosas before her cancer diagnosis and after her recovery she started to make jewellery in a small scale to cover some of her needs. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Rose to expand her jewellery business enabling her to generate a better and steady income to meet her needs and re-build her life. Below is Rose’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Rose used to complain of lower backaches and suffered from spotting. She went to Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi for further investigation where she found out that she had cervical cancer Stage 2B. “When I was diagnosed with cancer in July 2013 the first thing that came to my mind was death,” Rose says as she narrates her painful journey. “Basically that is what anyone would think. People have a negative attitude towards cancer. The perception is that it cannot be treated” Rose added. Rose corrected the misconception about Cancer saying “Some people think Cancer is as a result of a curse or witchcraft. The truth, Cancer is NOT caused by witchcraft. Although some cancers run in the family and others result from exposure to certain chemicals and infections, many cancers may be due to preventable behavior and dietary risk factors. Many think that once diagnosed with cancer, one can only expect death. The truth is Cancer is NOT a death sentence. One can have good quality of life after cancer diagnosis, they need to seek treatment early, follow medical advice and join a cancer support group. Paying attention to signs and symptoms increases the chance and benefits of early detection and treatment; including better recovery and more affordable treatment costs.” Rose added “I shared the news with my brother and he was shocked. He became very worried about my health and where the money to cater for my treatment would come from as we are orphans. There was no one who could help me other than him. It was a big blow to him because he knew the whole burden would be on him of which he actually took up,” Rose explains. Sad journey of treatment: “From the beginning to the end of my treatment it was just sad because I didn’t have money and I was depending on someone else for support. Before my illness, I used to sell samosas (a fried flour shell filled with minced meat or vegetables and spices) at that time at Ksh 5 per piece. So for 100 samosas I would get Ksh 500 (USD 5) in a day. But I was not able to manage the business as I would get weak and they are very heavy to carry and deliver for customers. So I stopped the business,” Rose says sadly. Rose was able to get treatment (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) in March 2014 after waiting for eight months. In August of the same year there was a recurrence and Rose had to go for further treatment. Women4Cancer a charitable organisation in Kenya supported her to cover her treatment in 2015. Speaking of her treatment Rose says: “The queues are so long at the hospital. It seems like one is fighting a losing battle. But I realized it was not a losing battle when I finished my treatment. And that is when I started fighting to survive.” After recovery, Rose has been making jewellery but on a very small scale to sell and support herself and other needy women. Rose had a dream to expand the business and train other women to generate income so that they become productive members in society. Rose’s jewellery business expanded: “Merck More than a Patient” is a new initiative of Merck Cancer Access Program with the aim to empower women cancer survivors to re-build their shattered lives after the devastating cancer experience. It will help them to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Rose to expand her jewellery business. Moreover, it has enrolled her in the Kenya Chamber of Commerce – Women in Business body, which will help her network with other entrepreneurial women, thus giving her a platform to generate even more business. “What Merck has done is really going to help me to improve my business from small-scale to large-scale. I make my jewelry at home and sell it to my neighbors and friends. This business is something I can do at my convenience. I can carry the beads wherever I am going and I can sit anywhere and do my bead work,” Rose says with confidence and joy. “I would really want to thank “Merck More than a Patient” and really appreciate them because this will help me to improve my life and will also enable me to use better quality materials because I can now be able to afford to buy them,” Rose adds. I am not a patient anymore. I am a survivor and I am a victor! Rose concludes. “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Esther Muthike, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Esther Wakabari Muthike is a 75 year old widow from Kirinyaga in eastern Kenya and is a cancer survivor. Her husband passed away 25 years ago. Before she fell ill, Esther was a farmer who also reared cows for milk. She had to sell her cow to cater for her cancer treatment expenses. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Esther to get a cow from which she is able to get milk to sell to cover her needs. This has enabled Esther to get a steady income to become independent and re-build her life. Below is Esther’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Esther found out that she had cervical cancer in May 2015 at a medical camp organised by Women4Cancer. She was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital for further investigations and treatment in July 2015. She started radiotherapy and chemotherapy in September 2015 and finished treatment in November 2015. “When I was told I had cancer, I knew I would die even if I was being treated. The doctors told us that cancer is incurable,” Esther says. Stigmatised by family and community for having cancer: Esther explains how she was stigmatised by her family and community: “When people heard that I had cancer, they told me to sell all my property because the disease is incurable. People in the community avoided me because they thought I would infect them with cancer. It is only one of my daughters – Susan who stood by me. She is the only one who used to wash my clothes. I had a foul smell and so people avoided me. I could not even go to visit my neighbours either. I could only visit Susan my daughter.” “I used to be a small-scale farmer and I also had a cow that provided me and family with milk to sell some for an income. But I had to sell my cow when I fell ill with cancer. My daughter also sold her goats to help with the expenses,” Esther explains. Esther also stopped farming for a while due to the health issues and treatment procedures. However, after treatment, she went back to farming and hoped for help to buy a cow that would enable her to generate a steady income from the sale of milk to cater for her needs. Esther empowered and independent again: “Merck more than a Patient” initiative aims to empower women cancer survivors in Africa. This initiative has supported Esther to buy a cow to replace the one she sold to cover her treatment and to enable her to meet her needs and become independent again,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. “Merck has really changed my life by giving me a cow. I now feel better. I now get milk to drink and sell. I have money in my hands from the sale of the milk. Previously I was not getting any money. I have named this cow Wambui because of its beauty. Before I used to borrow milk from my neighbours. But now I am enjoying milk from Wambui. Since I got Wambui, I pray for Merck every day that they bless others the way they have blessed me. I am a victor, I am not sick anymore,” Esther says with a smile. “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Margaret Njenga, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Margaret Wanjiku Njenga is a cervical cancer survivor from Kiambu, Kenya. Margaret who is 47 years old is married with six children. She was diagnosed with cancer in August 2013 at a medical camp run by Women4Cancer. She was an active business woman who used to make and sell soap and disinfectants to schools. She also had a cow whose milk she used to sell. She could not continue with the business after she fell ill and she also had to sell her cow. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Margaret to get a cow which is about to give birth and she will have two. Margaret will be able to get a steady income from the sale of milk and be able to educate her children. Below is Margaret’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Margaret explains: “My mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2010. My sisters and I were advised to go for regular cancer screenings as we could also get it as it could be in our genes. I was screened four times and the doctors kept saying they could see something. In each of these times I was given medication. I went for a fifth check-up and the results showed an anomaly. I was advised to go to hospital and I was diagnosed with cancer.” Diagnosed with cancer and stops doing business and farming: At the hospital, Margaret was told she would need to have her uterus removed. “I went home and told my husband that I had cancer. Remembering how much pain my late mother had gone through and the amount of money she had spent on treatment and she still died, I told him it would be better to have my uterus removed so that I can raise my children,” she explains. “It didn’t mean that I would not die but I would have a few more years to live,” she adds. “I would lock myself in the house after my children go school. I would think a lot and cry. I always saw myself dying. Who would take care of my children? I asked myself. My heart was very troubled,” Margaret narrates sadly. “Before I became sick I used to make and sell home-made soap. I would go to schools to look for orders to supply them with the soap. I also started supplying the schools with toilet disinfectant. When I was diagnosed with cancer, I had to stop this job as it required walking long distances,” says Margaret. “A friend who also had her uterus removed loaned me Ksh 10,000 (USD 100) to book for treatment at the hospital. I also had a cow whose milk I used to sell. I had to sell my cow so that I could raise money for my treatment as I did not have the Ksh 30,000 (USD 300) required for the treatment all at once. I was also too stressed such that I could not work,” Margaret adds. Margaret empowered and uplifted: When Margaret came from hospital she was unable to continue with the business she used to do before and they were struggling financially as a family. Their children were sent away from school for lack of fees as the money was not enough as she still had to buy medicine. “Merck More than a Patient” is a new initiative of Merck Cancer Access Program with the aim to empower women cancer survivors to re-build their shattered lives after the devastating cancer experience. It will help them to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. Merck through “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Margaret to buy a cow that will enable her financially through selling milk. “I am very happy because “Merck More than a Patient” has come to my aid and bought me a cow that will help me to continue raising my children. They have uplifted me and I am very happy and may God bless them,” Margaret says with joy. “My cow has a few days before it gives birth. I might be lucky and get a heifer and I will have two cows. From this I will get more milk, have enough to drink and to sell and more money to educate my children. I can now move on with my life and with a grateful heart. We have named the cow Joy because of the joy it has brought back to this home. Merck has really uplifted me and now my life is moving on as I had hoped. I feel strong and able to continue with my life,” Margaret says with satisfaction. “Merck more than a Patient” empowers Loise Njenga, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Loise Wambui Kimani from Dagoretti, Nairobi was diagnosed with cervical cancer in August 2015. Loise who is 45 years and is married with five children has been struggling to take care of her family ever since as she had to stop working as a house help for a living. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Loise to establish a shop from which she is able to get a steady income to cater for her needs and that of her family. Below is Loise’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” “I used to work as a house-help and used to be paid Ksh 6,000 (USD 60) per month which helped me cater for my children’s needs. When I was diagnosed with cancer I continued working but had to stop as I could not cope with the work load,” Loise explains. “I heard that anyone with cancer dies. I imagined I would die. I was in shock. I told my friends I had cancer but most of them told me when you have cancer you don’t live for long that someone just dies. I thought my life had come to an end,” Loise says. Rejected by community and life becomes hard: “People around me rejected me and thought I would infect them with cancer,” Loise says with sadness. “I eventually had my uterus removed and started radiotherapy in January 2016. When I came back home from the hospital, life became very hard. My husband became the sole breadwinner unlike before when we used to help each other. Our combined income used to help sustain the family,” she adds. Loise empowered and is now a victor: Merck through “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Loise establish a shop which is giving her a steady income and enabling her to take care of her family’s needs. “Merck has been very helpful because they have opened a shop for me and I am already enjoying the benefits.

I thank them because they have done great things and God bless them very much. I am doing well, I am healed and I am a victor,” she says. “Merck More than a Patient initiative aims to empower women cancer survivors by helping them to establish a small business in order to generate a steady income to cater for their needs and enable them to re-build their lives,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer Merck Healthcare.

Print Share All News Consumer Pharma New Drugs Pipeline Clinical Trials FDA Alerts Merck Scientists Publish New Research Detailing the Early Development of Verubecestat, an Investigational BACE1 Inhibitor in Science Translational Medicine Tweet KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE) November 2, 2016 --Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the publication of research conducted by Merck scientists on the discovery and development of verubecestat, an investigational small molecule inhibitor of the enzyme beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), for the potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The research was published online in the latest edition of the peer-reviewed journal Science Translational Medicine and includes results from the Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers and people with AD. The efficacy and safety of verubecestat is currently being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, EPOCH and APECS, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD and prodromal AD, respectively. “The development of a potential disease modifying therapy for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease has long been a focus of biomedical research,” said Dr. Michael Egan, vice president, clinical development neurosciences, Merck Research Laboratories. “We believe this research has the potential to contribute important evidence regarding the amyloid hypothesis, a leading scientific theory for what causes Alzheimer’s disease, and we look forward to seeing the data from our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.” BACE1 is an important enzyme in the initiation of the toxic Aβ peptide production in the brain. Researchers believe that sustained, selective inhibition of BACE1 leading to a significant decrease in the toxic Aβ peptide production is a promising means for therapeutic intervention. This hypothesis has not yet been demonstrated in clinical studies. Historically the development of selective BACE1 inhibitors with properties allowing oral absorption and the ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier to the site of action in the brain proved technically challenging. Detailed analysis of the BACE1 protein structure and function by Merck scientists over many years was used to design a series of drug-like compounds with an ability to inhibit the protein, both in vitro and in the central nervous system (CNS) of preclinical animal models. This process yielded the lead compound verubecestat. Verubecestat produced significant CNS Aβ lowering in rodents and non-human primates treated for 6- to 9-months. Verubecestat’s preclinical safety and tolerability profile supported its progression into human clinical testing for chronic use. Subsequent evaluation of once-daily doses of verubecestat in Phase 1 studies of healthy volunteers and in people with AD for a duration of one week demonstrated significant decreases in the levels of Aβ peptide production, a key marker of BACE1 activity, in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of up to 80 percent. Data from patients with AD were initially presented at the 2013 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC). Results of the Phase 1 trial of patients with Alzheimer’s disease The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple dose study evaluated the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profile of verubecestat in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease (n=32). Patients were randomized to receive one of three doses (12 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg) of verubecestat or placebo orally once-daily for seven days. Samples of CSF were collected over 36 hours via a lumbar catheter and analyzed for levels of amyloid β 40 (Aβ40), amyloid β 42 (Aβ42) and soluble amyloid precursor protein β (sAPPβ) as biomarkers of BACE1 activity. In this study, verubecestat at doses of 12, 40 and 60 mg caused a dose-dependent and sustained reduction in the levels of Aβ40 from baseline in the CSF, a measure of BACE1 activity, of 57, 79 and 84 percent, respectively. No study discontinuations due to adverse events were recorded. Analysis of vital signs and laboratory assessments, including liver function tests, showed no statistically significant changes related to the administration of verubecestat. Verubecestat was generally well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and individuals with AD. No dose-dependent increase in the incidence of adverse events was observed. Adverse events included headache, nasal congestion and dizziness. About the EPOCH Study EPOCH is a Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind study evaluating efficacy and safety of two oral doses of verubecestat (12 mg and 40 mg) administered once-daily versus placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate AD currently using standard of care treatment. The primary efficacy outcomes of the study are the change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) score, as well as the change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) score, following 78 weeks of treatment. For more information about the EPOCH study, visit www.merck.com/clinical-trials/infographics/P07738.html. About the APECS Study APECS is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of verubecestat in subjects with prodromal AD. The study is designed to enroll 1,500 participants. Patients will be randomized to receive placebo, or 12 mg or 40 mg verubecestat, once-daily. The primary efficacy outcome of the study is change from baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score following 104 weeks of treatment.

"The ones that are really serious about research, they are going to pay off big time, very big," he said in an interview with "Power Lunch." Specifically, Merck has the right game plan and names like Amgen and Gilead Sciences have done well, although they've been hit recently, the Harvard Business School senior fellow and CNBC contributor noted. The industry has faced sharp criticism about its drug pricing practices. Notably, Mylan has faced Congressional scrutiny over the price hike on its anti-allergy device, EpiPen. Several other companies are under the microscope, as well. Getty Images This week, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings called on federal antitrust regulators to prove whether Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly, Merck and Novo Nordisk colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. The request follows a similar letter they sent last fall calling for an investigation into 14 drug companies over prices increases of generic drugs. The Department of Justice could file charges by the end of the year in its subsequent criminal investigation of generic drugmakers over suspected price collusion, according to Bloomberg. The uproar has taken its toll on the sector, with the key biotech ETF down more than 25 percent in 2016. George said the drug companies can't continually jack up prices and are not in business just to serve shareholders. They are in business to serve consumers, he noted. If they do that well, he believes profits will follow. "The key to making money in pharma is very straightforward," George said. "It is through innovation, through breakthroughs." David Maris, specialty pharmaceutical analyst with Wells Fargo, believes the pricing debate is only in its early stages. He agrees that collusion should certainly be addressed, and companies who raise prices too much should be looked at. However, Maris said the public should not lose sight of the fact that pharma is the best industry in America, employing 4.5 million people. "The pharmaceutical industry actually spends more in R&D than both the aerospace and the tech industry combined. So you go after these, what might happen is … fewer innovations," he told "Power Lunch." — Reuters contributed to this report.

The request by US Senator Bernie Sanders and US Representative Elijah Cummings follows a similar letter they sent in autumn last year calling for an investigation into 14 drug companies over price increases of generic drugs. US prosecutors could file the first charges by the end of the year in their subsequent criminal investigation of generic drugmakers over suspected price collusion, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. In their latest letter to the US Department of Justice and the US Federal Trade Commission, Sanders and Cummings raised questions about skyrocketing prices for insulin and included a chart showing that many of the price spikes appeared to occur in tandem. They noted that the original patent on insulin, a hormone used by diabetics to control blood sugar levels, expired 75 years ago. “Sanofi sets the prices of our treatments independently,” Sanofi spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said in an e-mailed statement. Novo Nordisk also said it sets prices “independently” and that it stands by its business practices. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company does not make insulin. Merck makes other products to treat diabetes. Eli Lilly, in an e-mail, said it strongly disagrees with the accusations in the letter. “The insulin market in the US is highly competitive,” Eli Lilly said. Several generic drugmakers, including Mylan, Allergan, Endo and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, had previously disclosed that they were subpoenaed in connection with the antitrust investigation. Bloomberg said the probe spans more than a dozen companies and about two dozen drugs, citing people familiar with the matter. Impax Laboratories Inc said earlier this year that the department had requested information on four drugs: blood pressure pill digoxin, asthma drug terbutaline sulfate, prilocaine/lidocaine cream and calcipotriene solution, which is used to treat psoriasis. A Teva spokesman said the company “is not aware of any facts that would give rise to an exposure to the company with respect to these subpoenas.” This story has been viewed 1039 times.

Officials at Endo and Lannett Company Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Aggressive drug pricing has come under intense scrutiny after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted her intent to tackle high prices last year. An August report from the Government Accountability Office found that more than 300 of 1,441 generic drugs analyzed had at least one price increase of 100 percent or more between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2015. In February, Sanders and Cummings asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' enforcement arm to investigate generic drug price increases. Recent price hikes that have drawn fire included Turing Pharmaceuticals' decision in 2015 to raise by 5,000 percent the price of a decades-old treatment for a dangerous parasitic infection. Generic drugmakers, possibly reacting to the political headwinds, reined in price hikes this year. Guggenheim Securities, citing polling of generic drugmakers, last month estimated that overall U.S. generic drug prices would dip by a percentage in the mid-single digits this year. The price erosion has been felt by drug wholesalers like McKesson Corp and Amerisource Bergen Corp, which rely on price fluctuations for part of their profit margins.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:00 AM, November 4, 2016 Updated: 11:10 AM, November 4, 2016 Two prominent U.S. lawmakers on Thursday called on federal antitrust regulators to probe whether Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly and Co, Merck & Co Inc and Novo Nordisk A/S colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. The request by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings follows a similar letter they sent last fall calling for an investigation into 14 drug companies over price increases of generic drugs. U.S. prosecutors could file the first charges by the end of the year in their subsequent criminal investigation of generic drugmakers over suspected price collusion, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. (http://bloom.bg/2e6cZjF) A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. In their latest letter to the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, Sanders, an independent, and Cummings, a Democrat, raised questions about skyrocketing prices for insulin, and included a chart showing that many of the price spikes appeared to occur in tandem. They noted that the original patent on insulin, a hormone used by diabetics to control blood sugar levels, expired 75 years ago. Sanofi spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said in an emailed statement that "Sanofi sets the prices of our treatments independently." Novo Nordisk also said it sets prices "independently" and said it stands by its business practices. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company does not make insulin. Merck makes other products to treat diabetes. Eli Lilly, in an email, said it strongly disagrees with the accusations in the letter. "The insulin market in the U.S. is highly competitive," the pharmaceutical company said. Shares of several generic drugmakers fell on Thursday after the report of pending Justice Department charges. Mylan N.V. closed down 6.9 percent, Allergan Plc fell 4.5 percent and Endo International Plc dropped 19.5 percent. Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc Ltd, which recently acquired Allergan's generics business, fell 9.5 percent. "We do not think the major generic companies have likely participated in significant pricing collusion," A/B Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in a research note. Several generic drugmakers, including Mylan, Allergan, Endo and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, had previously disclosed that they were subpoenaed in connection with the antitrust investigation by the Justice Department. Bloomberg said the probe spans more than a dozen companies and about two dozen drugs, citing people familiar with the matter. Impax Laboratories Inc said earlier this year that the Justice Department had requested information on four drugs: blood pressure pill digoxin, asthma drug terbutaline sulfate, prilocaine/lidocaine cream and calcipotriene solution, which is used to treat psoriasis. A spokesman from Teva said the company "is not aware of any facts that would give rise to an exposure to the company with respect to these subpoenas." Officials at Endo and Lannett Company Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Aggressive drug pricing has come under intense scrutiny after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted her intent to tackle high prices last year. An August report from the Government Accountability Office found that more than 300 of 1,441 generic drugs analyzed had at least one price increase of 100 percent or more between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2015. In February, Sanders and Cummings asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' enforcement arm to investigate generic drug price increases. Recent price hikes that have drawn fire included Turing Pharmaceuticals' decision in 2015 to raise by 5,000 percent the price of a decades-old treatment for a dangerous parasitic infection. Generic drugmakers, possibly reacting to the political headwinds, reined in price hikes this year. Guggenheim Securities, citing polling of generic drugmakers, last month estimated that overall U.S. generic drug prices would dip by a percentage in the mid-single digits this year. The price erosion has been felt by drug wholesalers like McKesson Corp and Amerisource Bergen Corp, which rely on price fluctuations for part of their profit margins.

Both have exciting CAR-T therapies in development. Only one deserves consideration for your portfolio. Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Nov 3, 2016 at 11:41AM Image source: Getty Images. Immunotherapy, or using the body's immune system to fight diseases and cancers, has become a sizzling investment opportunity for biopharma companies and investors alike. While there's been interest in everything from DNA vaccines to checkpoint antibodies, the real frenzy has surrounded CAR-T therapies, in which a patient's immune cells are engineered and reinjected as a personalized treatment. One darling of the CAR-T boom has been Juno Therapeutics (NASDAQ:JUNO), which will be among the first companies to submit an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval. Investors are widely expecting it will be one of the first to successfully gain approval, too, with speculative launch dates in the first half of 2018.  And although it hasn't been as closely associated with CAR-T as Juno Therapeutics, Ziopharm Oncology (NASDAQ:ZIOP) is part of a collection of entities (including Intrexon, Merck, and MD Anderson) developing a therapeutic pipeline in the same class, in addition to programs for various other indications. The company was a little late to the party, but its investors are excited about the potential in immunotherapy all the same. Both companies are down 50% in the last year. Both are pusuring CAR-T immunotherapies. Those similarities make for a fun question: Which company is the better buy, Ziopharm Oncoloy or Juno Therapeutics? As it turns out, the two are actually quite different -- and only one deserves consideration for your portfolio. ZIOP data by YCharts. The matchup Let's begin with a head-to-head immunotherapy comparison. Juno Therapeutics has an astounding 10 clinical trials in its pipeline -- all of which use CAR-T. Eight have initiated at least phase 1 trials, while two are making headway in phase 2 trials. The most advanced program, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), posted a complete remission rate of 89% in its phase 1 trial. Data like that are what have investors so excited about the stock's potential.  On the other hand, Ziopharm lists eight clinical trial categories on its website for CAR-T therapeutics, but has only begun enrolling patients in two phase 1 trials for advanced lymphoid malignancies, including ALL. That means it doesn't (yet) have the same data as Juno Therapeutics. The difference in pipeline maturity can be chalked up to the fact that Ziopharm was relatively late to the party: it's developing a technology licensed from MD Anderson in early 2015. That makes it highly unlikely the company will be first to market with a CAR-T therapeutic if approval comes its way, which could severely limit its future market potential considering the torrid pace of Juno Therapeutics and Kite Pharma in the same indications.  Unfortunately, things don't get better for Ziopharm the deeper investors dig. Here's how the company stacks up against Juno Therapeutics in several leading financial metrics: Metric Juno Therapeutics Ziopharm Market cap, current $2.53 billion $744.1 million Cash and short term investments, 6/30/2016 $956.9 million $109.0 million Revenue, TTM $43.1 million $7.5 million Major partners Celgene Intrexon, Merck Serono Data sources: Press releases and Google Finance.  Revenue may be the least important metric for either development-stage company, but it highlights major differences in the commitment levels of partners. So does each company's cash balance. Juno Therapeutics has significantly more cash padding its research and development efforts than Ziopharm. The bulk of the company's total came in summer 2015 from a $1 billion investment from Celgene, which included the purchase of 9.1 million shares of common stock and jump-started a collaboration. Ziopharm touts a partnership with Merck Serono, but it's not even close to being on the same level as Celgene. Merck Serono's partnership allows it to select two CAR-T targets, sit back as Ziopharm and Intrexon take care of all development expenses, and then take the goods and run if they reach investigational new drug status. In other words, Ziopharm doesn't benefit from the partnership in a meaningful way. Now, investors may point out that Ziopharm is pursuing programs outside of CAR-T, but none provide a strong case for investment. The company is partnered with or dependent on technologies licensed from Intrexon for every single clinical trial. Literally every technology (there are seven) used in a clinical trial on Ziopharm's website has been licensed from Intrexon. Worse, the pair have discontinued at least one clinical trial for a lack of efficacy and have struggled to show safety or efficacy in all others developed to a point they merit public reporting. It appears the company has a data problem. The verdict On the surface, the similarities between Juno Therapeutics and Ziopharm may make it appear as if the head-to-head matchup is close for individual investors. However, after a little more investigation, it becomes clear that the better buy is Juno Therapeutics. The company has more and better data, a boatload of cash to fund development and commercialization, and serious partners willing to throw down serious capital. There are still questions investors need to consider -- will regulatory approvals from phase 2 results face unexpected obstacles in later-stage trials? Will CAR-T prove to be too toxic to be safe? -- but this particular matchup isn't even close.  Maxx Chatsko has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Drug companies and a pharmaceutical industry trade association based outside the state have provided 86 percent of the $109 million raised to defeat Proposition 61. The measure would limit the price California pays for prescription drugs. Two New York-based pharmaceutical firms, Pfizer and Merck, and New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson have each contributed more than $9 million. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is based in Los Angeles, has provided $16.7 million of the nearly $17 million raised for Proposition 61. The California Nurses Association has given $56,000. Plastic bag and other plastics manufacturers outside California have contributed 99 percent of the money raised — over $6 million — against Proposition 67 and for Proposition 65. Proposition 67 would ban the use of plastic bags; Proposition 65 would direct proceeds from the sale of carryout bags to a state-run environmental fund, a move opposed by grocers and environmental groups. Supporters of Proposition 67 have raised over $1.8 million; more than 80 percent of that money has come from individuals and groups in the state, including environmental organizations and the California Grocers Association. Proposition 65 has no financial opposition. While Californians have provided nearly 60 percent of the $24 million raised to support Proposition 64, a measure that would legalize marijuana use, the No campaign has relied heavily on out-of-state contributions. One person — Julie Schauer, a Pennsylvania retiree — has given almost $1.4 million to fight the initiative. Contributions from outside California make up 85 percent of the $1.6 million raised to defeat the measure. Methodology: MapLight analysis of contributions to committees supporting or opposing ballot measures using data available from the California Secretary of State as of Nov. 2, 2016.

A slew of earnings updates also delivered a mixed picture. U.S. lawmakers urged an inquiry into whether Sanofi , Eli Lilly, Merck and Novo Nordisk had colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. Sanofi and Novo Nordisk were down 1 percent and 3.2 percent respectively. Top faller was Hikma, down 6.8 percent after HSBC cut its price target citing broader market concerns over a separate U.S. Department of Justice investigation into price collusion in the pharma market. The sector has been hit recently by worries that Hillary Clinton could seek tougher pricing regulation if she wins the race for the White House next week. "A Clinton victory could be unhelpful for health care stocks," Citi analysts said in a strategy note. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.8 percent at its close, marking its biggest weekly fall since February. The index has been hit by growing jitters ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday and has been trading near its lowest levels since July. "As the presidential election race appears to (be) getting tighter with only a few days left until Americans are going to the polls, many traders (are) continuing to reduce their risk exposure further, which is also weighing on stocks," Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets, said in a note. Elsewhere market action was driven by earnings updates. France's Richemont rose 5.2 percent after the luxury goods group announced a management revamp in the wake of a drop in net profit in the six months to September, driven by one-off restructuring charges and product buy-backs. Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx said the key figures were above expectations while other analysts welcomed management comments that sales in October were modestly positive. The company had issued a profit warning in September. Among outstanding gainers, Ubisoft soared 8.6 percent to top the STOXX 600, as Kepler Cheuvreux upgraded the French game developer to "buy" after the company lifted its operating profit target. Shares were boosted at Cosmetics giant L'Oreal, whose sales growth beat expectations, and gambling firm Paddy Power, which lifted its full-year profit forecast citing a boost in the sterling value of its euro revenue, as well as this year's merger and favourable sporting results. But French outdoor advertising company JC Decaux fell nearly 10 percent after it said organic revenue growth would turn negative in the final quarter of the year and affect margins.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker European shares fall as pharma stocks come under fire; Richemont rallies Reuters   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Milan, Nov 4:   European shares fell on Friday, weighed down by weaker drugmakers after two US lawmakers called on federal antitrust regulators to open a probe for possible price fixing. A slew of earnings updates also delivered a mixed picture. The US lawmakers had on Thursday called for a probe into whether Sanofi, Eli Lilly, Merck and Novo Nordisk colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. Sanofi and Novo Nordisk were down 1.6 and 2.9 per cent respectively. Top faller was Hikma, down 7 per cent after HSBC cut its price target citing broader market concerns over a separate US Department of Justice investigation into price collusion in the pharma market. The sector has been hit recently by worries that Hillary Clinton could seek tougher pricing regulation if she wins the race for the White House. “A Clinton victory could be unhelpful for health care stocks,” Citi analysts said in a strategy note. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 1 per cent and on track for its biggest weekly fall since February. The index has been hit by growing nervousness before the US presidential election. “As the presidential election race appears to (be) getting tighter with only a few days left until Americans are going to the polls many traders continuing to reduce their risk exposure further which is also weighing on stocks,” Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets said in a note. Elsewhere market action was driven by earnings updates. France’s Richemont rose 6 per cent after the luxury goods group announced a management revamp after sales and core net profit in the six months to September, hit by one-off restructuring charges and product buy-backs. Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx said the key figures were above expectations while other analyst welcomed management comments that sales in October were modestly positive. The company had issued a profit warning in September. Among outstanding gainers, Ubisoft soared 9.5 per cent, topping STOXX gainers, as Kepler Cheuvreux upgrade the French game developer to “buy” after the company lifted its operating profit target. Shares were boosted at Cosmetics giant L’Oreal, whose sales growth beat expectations, and gambling firm Paddy Power, which lifted its full-year profit forecast citing a boost in the sterling value of its euro revenue, this year's merger and favourable sporting results. But French outdoor advertising company JC Decaux fell 7.3 per cent after it said organic revenue growth would turn negative in the final quarter of the year and affect margins.

A slew of earnings updates also delivered a mixed picture. The U.S. lawmakers on Thursday called for a probe into whether Sanofi, Eli Lilly, Merck and Novo Nordisk colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. Sanofi and Novo Nordisk were down 1.6 and 2.9 percent respectively. Top faller was Hikma, down 7 percent after HSBC cut its price target citing broader market concerns over a separate U.S. Department of Justice investigation into price collusion in the pharma market. The sector has been hit recently by worries that Hillary Clinton could seek tougher pricing regulation if she wins the race for the White House. "A Clinton victory could be unhelpful for health care stocks," Citi analysts said in a strategy note. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 1 percent and on track for its biggest weekly fall since February. The index has been hit by growing nervousness before the U.S. presidential election. "As the presidential election race appears to (be) getting tighter with only a few days left until Americans are going to the polls many traders continuing to reduce their risk exposure further which is also weighing on stocks," Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets said in a note. Elsewhere market action was driven by earnings updates. France's Richemont rose 6 percent after the luxury goods group announced a management revamp after sales and core net profit in the six months to September, hit by one-off restructuring charges and product buy-backs. Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx said the key figures were above expectations while other analyst welcomed management comments that sales in October were modestly positive. The company had issued a profit warning in September. Among outstanding gainers, Ubisoft soared 9.5 percent, topping STOXX gainers, as Kepler Cheuvreux upgrade the French game developer to "buy" after the company lifted its operating profit target. Shares were bosted at Cosmetics giant L'Oreal, whose sales growth beat expectations, and gambling firm Paddy Power, which lifted its full-year profit forecast citing a boost in the sterling value of its euro revenue, this year's merger and favourable sporting results. But French outdoor advertising company JC Decaux fell 7.3 percent after it said organic revenue growth would turn negative in the final quarter of the year and affect margins.

(AFP) Two reports have warned of an explosion in cancer deaths among women, with a toll, mainly from breast cancer, of some 5.5 million per year by 2030 -- roughly the population of Denmark. This represented a near 60-percent increase in less than two decades, said an analysis conducted by the American Cancer Society (ACS), released Tuesday at the World Cancer Congress in Paris. As the global population grows and ages, the highest toll will be among women in poor and middle-income countries, it said, and much of it from cancers which are largely preventable. "Most of the deaths occur in young- and middle-aged adults,", placing a heavy burden on families and national economies, said Sally Cowal, senior vice president of global health at the ACS, which compiled the report with pharmaceutical company Merck. A second report, published in The Lancet medical journal on Wednesday, said the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer alone could almost double to 3.2 million a year by 2030 from 1.7 million in 2015. For cervical cancer, the number of diagnoses could "rise by at least 25 percent to over 700,000 by 2030," mainly in low- and middle-income countries, said a statement from The Lancet. Cancer is already killing one in seven women around the world, said the ACS report -- the second highest cause of death after cardiovascular disease. All four of the deadliest cancers -- breast, colorectal, lung and cervical cancer -- are mostly preventable or can be detected early, when treatment is more successful. In poorer countries, a much smaller proportion of cancer cases are diagnosed and treated than in rich ones, while a much bigger group dies. The relative burden is growing for developing countries as people live longer due to better basic healthcare. Women in these countries are also increasingly exposed to known cancer risk factors "associated with rapid economic transition," said Cowal, "such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors" such as postponing motherhood. "Due to these changes, cancers that were once common only in high-income countries are becoming more prevalent," said the report entitled "The Global Burden of Cancer in Women." Regional differences According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 6.7 million new cancer cases and 3.5 million deaths among women worldwide in 2012. Of these, 56 percent of cases and 64 percent of deaths were in less developed countries. "These numbers are expected to increase to 9.9 million cases and 5.5 million deaths among females annually by 2030 as a result of the growth and ageing of the population," said the ACS report. The biggest concentration is in eastern Asia, with 1.7 million cases and a million deaths in 2012, mainly in China. The highest ratio of cancer cases per population group are still reported in high-income countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia, but this was partly due to better access to screening and detection. Deaths, however, were proportionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries with reduced access to diagnosis and treatment. The countries with the highest death rate were Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Mongolia and Papua New Guinea. Breast and lung cancer are the two most common types in both rich and poor nations, with colorectal cancer the number three killer in developed countries and cervical cancer in less developed ones. Cervical cancer can be staved off by vaccination against the cancer-causing Human papillomavirus (HPV) and can be easily detected through regular Papanicolaou (pap) test screens. The Lancet report, comprised of three research papers, said a basic cancer control package could be introduced in low- and middle-income countries for as little as $1.72 (1.55 euros) per person -- the equivalent of just three percent of current health spending in these countries. Universal HPV vaccination of all 12-year-old girls could prevent 420,000 deaths worldwide over their lifetime. "The global community cannot continue to ignore the problem -- hundreds of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily every year," said Richard Sullivan of King's College London, who co-authored The Lancet report. "Not only are the costs of essential cancer services for women lower than expected, but scale-up of diagnostic, surgical and treatment services are a highly effective investment compared the devastating economic cost to countries, communities and families."

Job cuts in South Florida included 125 at nonprofit Gulfstream Goodwill Industries in West Palm Beach, 51 at computer services company NTT America in Boca Raton, and 112 at pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. in Miami Lakes. For the nine months of 2016, Florida had 11,169 planned layoffs, a 17 percent decrease from 13,426 in the same period in 2015. Nationally, planned job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers fell 39 percent to the second-lowest level of the year: 30,740 job cuts in October, compared with 50,504 job cuts a year ago. The lowest level was 30,157 job cuts announced in May. The October total was the lowest since 1999, when 22,814 job cuts were announced in the first month of the fourth quarter, Challenger said. CEO John Challenger said he doesn't think the upcoming U.S. election is resulting in employers holding off on staffing decisions.

Alzheimer’s theory suggests the plaque kills the healthy neurons, leading to memory loss. Results from a small Phase 1 study confirm that the drug verubecestat can reduce levels of beta-amyloid, a protein fragment that accumulates in sticky deposits or "plaques" in the brains of Alzheimer's sufferers. The trial was primarily seeking to determine safety of verubecestat , but found it worked to prevent the production of enzymes that cause plaque on the brain’s neurons. Researchers may have discovered how to slow brain aging https://t.co/gFjGAy7DZg— RT (@RT_com) October 14, 2016 A study published in Science Translational Medicine by Merck Research Laboratories details the results of the verubecestat trial, which found promising results and importantly, no severe side effects. However, conclusions won’t be drawn until phase III of the clinical trial has been completed, which tests effectiveness and safety on a larger scale. “It represents well over a decade of investment in this project by many, many scientists,” team leader Matthew Kennedy told Scientific American. “Today there are very limited therapeutic options available for people with Alzheimer’s disease, and those that exist provide only short-term improvement to the cognitive and functional symptoms. They do not directly target the underlying disease processes. There is an urgent need for [these].” #GeneWilder, star of ‘Blazing Saddles’, dies at 83 https://t.co/nXphuln12ypic.twitter.com/jmcUATqODh— RT America (@RT_America) August 30, 2016 The trial involved giving 32 early-stage Alzheimer’s patients the drug for seven days, with some taking it for two weeks. The short term trial couldn’t render visible changes to the plaques, but fluid samples show reduced levels of the compounds that make up the proteins. Verubecestat inhibits BACE1 (Beta-site Amyloid precursor protein Cleaving Enzyme 1), an enzyme which produces a protein (amyloid beta) that clumps together and forms the plaques around the neurons, causing Alzheimer's. Phase III is trialling 2,000 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s and 1,500 in the early stage of the disease. The results are expected in July 2017.

Is Plunging Today The specialty pharmacy's shares tumbled after management reported weak quarterly results and lowered guidance. Brian Feroldi (TMFTypeoh) Nov 3, 2016 at 1:01PM What happened Shares of Diplomat Pharmacy (NYSE:DPLO), a distributor of specialty biotechnology and pharmaceutical products, dropped by 37% as of 11:55 a.m. EDT on Thursday after the company reported disappointing third-quarter results. Image source: Getty Images. So what Diplomat continued to rapidly grow its top line during the quarter, producing total revenue of $1.18 billion, which was up nearly 25% year over year. However, this figure was still quite a bit shy of the $1.26 billion that Wall Street was expecting, especially in light of the fact that more than half of the company's growth came as a result of acquisitions.  Management stated that its revenue growth was held back by a handful of factors, including direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees that were paid to Medicare Part D plans and pharmacy benefits managers, as well as a general shift from older hepatitis C drugs to newer ones that generate less revenue. The latter point shouldn't have been all that surprising to investors, as drugmakers Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, and Merck have been engaged in a pricing war in an effort to build market share. If that wasn't bad enough, Diplomat also struggled to translate its revenue growth into profits. Net income from continuing operations plunged by 66% during the period, to $5.4 million, which produced earnings per share (EPS) of only $0.08. However, if EPS were normalized for the DIR fees, then it would have actually been $0.25, according to management. In light of the specialty pharmacy's disappointing quarterly results, management decided to pour cold water on its full-year guidance. Revenue is now projected to land between $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion, which is down from a prior outlook of $4.5 billion to $4.9 billion. The company believes that it will generate between $0.83 and $0.87 in adjusted earnings per share for the year, which is also below its previously announced range of $0.90 and $0.95. Now what It's been a difficult few months to be a long-term Diplomat shareholder. In late October, shares dropped after news broke that two of the company's executives would be leaving at year-end. With today's huge drop, shares have now fallen more than 59% since the start of the year and are currently trading at an all-time low.   With pessimism for Diplomat Pharmacy running so high, management did its best to remind investors that there are some positive trends working in its favor. The company's oncology business is growing rapidly, which should continue as new drugs come to market. In addition, the company still plans on using its financial might to make bolt-on acquisitions that should drive additional growth. Finally, there is legislation in Congress right now that, if it passes, could potentially limit the company's future exposure to DIR fees. Overall, this report leaves investors with both bullish and bearish takeaways. However, given the added uncertainty surrounding the DIR fees and management's lowered guidance, it is hard to blame the markets for knocking down shares today.

The other report adds that women afflicted with breast cancer alone could nearly double from 1.7 million diagnosed last year to 3.2 million by 2030, the Guardian reports. The first report, compiled by Merck and the American Cancer Society and released at the World Cancer Congress in Paris on Tuesday, says the predicted surge in cancer deaths would amount to a 57% increase, per a press release. The same report notes all four top cancers—breast, lung, colorectal, and cervical—are mostly preventable or easily detected early on, aiding treatment. The second report, based on three papers in the Lancet, adds cervical cancer may rise by as much as 25% by 2030, leading to 700,000 diagnoses. That report also notes women in low- and middle-income countries carry much of the burden of breast and cervical cancers, with less access to quality care and a greater likelihood of dying from their illnesses than women in richer nations. Perhaps a bit ironically, some of the cancers in the lower-income countries used to be prevalent only in higher-income ones, but as the poorer countries started going through "rapid economic transition," the women there began experiencing risk factors like their more affluent counterparts, including "physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors" like putting off having kids, per an ACS VP. "The global community cannot continue to ignore the problem—hundreds of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily every year," Richard Sullivan, co-author of the Lancet report, says in the release.

No exceptions except if trauma or crime or war is the cause but still: fear, pain, dread, death. Certain from long before the moment you conceived them. When you lie ill and dying, no joy of the past will make it all see perfectly acceptable. And you will not give expression to your pain or fear or dread because you know that those who die silently are said to have died bravely! At the final moment, all that sickness and pain stuffed up inside you like constipation because no one wants to hear or know the truth. But read on and find distraction in the form of undying, immortal, optimism, Pollyannaism and genetic cheerfulness.

Interestingly these are ones that we don't get enough of. Iodine, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K2 all cause cancer when you don't get enough. Iodine and selenium particularly cause breast cancer when deficient.

Dr. Len Yaffe of Stoc*Doc Partners sheds light on the issues in this analysis of drug price negotiation policy, and focuses in on one California ballot proposition that aims to rein in costs. One issue of focus in the election rhetoric is Medicare drug price negotiation, which is specifically precluded in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Furthermore, a noninterference provision was included: "In order to promote competition under this part and in carrying out this part, the Secretary (of Health and Human Services): (1) may not interfere with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and PDP sponsors; and (2) may not require a particular formulary or institute a price structure for the reimbursement of covered Part D drugs." Additionally, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsequently made into law that Part D drug plans give nearly full access to drugs in six therapeutic categories: anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antineoplastics, antiretrovirals and immunosuppressants, effectively eliminating price negotiations. A Millman study found that these six protected classes represent 17–33% of Part D drug costs by Part D plan administrators. Also, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) examined the effect of striking the noninterference provision and estimated that it would have a negligible effect on spending versus what private plans negotiate. It should be noted that a repeal of this provision would require action by both Houses of Congress. "The recent weakness in pharmaceutical stocks affords an excellent buying opportunity in select names with promising pipelines, includingDURECT Corp." California's Proposition 61 would require state agencies to pay the same price as the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) for prescription drugs. California spent $3.8 billion on prescription medicines in fiscal year 2014–2015, and almost 83% of that was for Medi-Cal and the Public Employees Retirement System. It should be understood that many programs are excluded, including Medi-Cal Managed Care, local school district employees and local government employees, as well as the majority of Californians with private insurance. Included are the 3.0 million low-income people covered by Medi-Cal Fee for Service, prison inmates, Department of State Hospital patients and some state employees and retirees. As it relates to Medi-Cal, the table above lists the price discounts afforded to various government health programs. The VA pays the lowest price, and also directly negotiates even greater discounts with manufacturers. It has this ability due to assured volume based on compliance, and very aggressive formulary management. This can result in total discounts approximating 40%, versus the 23% for Medicaid. However, Medicaid, in exchange for this discount, agrees to cover most drugs. For example, an analysis by the Lewin Group showed that, of the 300 drugs most prescribed to senior citizens, 35% are not included in the VA formulary, versus 6% in Medicare Part D formularies. A separate analysis by Einthoven and Fong stated that fewer than 33% of the 4,300 drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries are on the VA national formulary. Furthermore, according to Frank Lichtenberg, only 38% of drugs approved by the FDA in the 1990s, and 19% of the drugs approved since 2000, are on the VA national formulary. The first issue for consideration is the disclosure of VA pricing. Without additional discounts, the VA and Medi-Cal should be charged similarly for prescription medicines. If the VA is not forced to disclose the incremental discounts it receives for market share guarantees through compliance and formulary control (neither of which is robustly permitted by Medicaid), then Medi-Cal's savings would be minimal. If Medi-Cal were to receive the full VA discount, then I would expect the drug companies to lower the incremental discount to the VA to strike a balanced price, and perhaps even raise prices to the private sector (20 million Californians). Therefore, in the aggregate, Californians would end up paying more for their drugs. This is in no way intended to justify the high cost of prescription pharmaceuticals. As I have previously written, I maintain that there are more appropriate methods to control these costs. Additionally, it is critical to understand that the drug spend represents only 12% of total U.S. healthcare dollars. I forecast healthcare costs to grow at an average annual rate of 6% through 2030, at which time they will exceed $7 trillion, or 25% of GDP. I have provided a means of bending the cost curve in my article, "Solving America's Health Care Crisis." From an investment standpoint, I think the recent weakness in pharmaceutical stocks (iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index [IBB] and VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF [PPH] down 10% and 9%, respectively, in the last month) affords an excellent buying opportunity in select names with promising pipelines. In this group I include Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK:NYSE), Celgene Corp. (CELG:NASDAQ), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (REGN:NASDAQ), Tesaro Inc. (TSRO:NASDAQ), Ardelyx Inc. (ARDX:NASDAQ)and DURECT Corp.

By Olivia Lerche PUBLISHED: 09:29, Thu, Nov 3, 2016 | UPDATED: 10:31, Thu, Nov 3, 2016 GETTYAlzheimer's disease: Drug could treat disease The drug, verubecestat, is one of a number being trialled by pharmaceutical companies in a race for the first treatment that can halt or reverse the disease. A study carried out at Merck Research Laboratories in New Jersey, USA, describes early tests of the drug - full name BACE1 inhibitor verubecestat (MK-8931) - safely reduced the production of amyloid beta in 32 people with Alzheimer’s disease. Dr Clare Walton, Research Manager at Alzheimer’s Society, said: “Amyloid plaques are a key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease and most recent efforts to find new dementia treatments focus on reducing the production of amyloid or clearing plaques out of the brain. “This study describes a new drug that reduces the production of amyloid in people with dementia and, importantly, it appears to be safer than similar drugs that have come before. This finding has paved the way for much larger clinical trials that are currently underway, and we very much look forward to the results of these in the coming years.” Related articles Palliative care: GPs warning over care of terminally-ill Sickness and diarrhoea: Symptoms of 'dangerous' winter bug explained Experts found the drug appeared to produce no severe side effects. Earlier experiments with drugs that work the same way, by targeting an enzyme linked to beta-amyloid build-up, were abandoned when they were found to cause liver and nerve damage. The publication of the trial findings comes as two much larger international trials testing the effectiveness of verubecestat in more than 3,000 patients nears completion. Depending on the outcome of these studies, one of which is taking place in the UK, the drug could be licensed in the next two to three years. Verubecestat, made by drug giants Merck, is not alone -  two other medicines with the potential to modify Alzheimer's progression, solanezumab and aducanumab, are also undergoing Phase III trials. GETTYAlzheimer's disease: Successful drug trials could lead to new treatment Dr Rosa Sancho, from the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "It has been over a decade since a new drug was licensed for the treatment of dementia, so we urgently need new medicines that can provide real benefit for people living with dementia. "There is a wave of potential new treatments currently being tested for dementia, with the results of these studies hotly anticipated over the course of the coming months and years. "In this small Phase I clinical trial, verubecestat was able to reduce the levels of a key Alzheimer's protein, but it remains to be seen whether this translates into slower memory decline for people with the disease." Participants involved in the trial had mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease but were otherwise healthy. Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's Tue, August 23, 2016 There are more than 520,000 people in the UK with Alzheimer's disease. Here are 10 early signs and symptoms including memory loss and problem-solving to look out for.

Results showed that doses of verubecestat could lower levels of the harmful peptide without serious side effects. Dr Sancho added: "As verubecestat works differently to other drugs currently being tested for Alzheimer's, if it proves successful, it could be an important weapon in the arsenal for doctors treating the disease in future. "Alzheimer's is a complex and devastating disease and so a multi-pronged approach may give us the best chance of tackling it in the coming years. As the first BACE1 inhibitor to reach the final stages of testing in people, the ultimate test will be whether these ongoing trials show verubecestat can provide tangible benefits for people with Alzheimer's. "Scientists have reflected on past lessons in Alzheimer's drug development and it is promising to see an increasing number of drugs now entering Phase III clinical testing in the disease, giving us renewed hope in the hunt for new treatments." More than 850,000 people in the UK suffer with dementia.

("Delivra", or "the Company") (DVA) announced today the Company has successfully completed its first phase pre-clinical research into transdermal berberine for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease related to high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Berberine is a natural plant extract that has been used in eastern medicine for thousands of years, and more recently also in the western world. There is an abundance of research on berberine, and its effectiveness in reducing cholesterol and triglycerides is well-established. The main challenges with the use of berberine in its traditional oral format are exceptionally low bioavailability (< 2%) and highly adverse gastrointestinal events. Transdermal berberine from Delivra overcomes these challenges, showing 8-times higher concentration levels in the blood than oral, with no gastrointestinal side effects, and proved significantly more effective than oral in reducing cholesterol and triglycerides in a model of metabolic disease. This achievement represents a first-in-class platform that may prove effective in reducing cholesterol, triglycerides, and other hallmarks of cardiovascular disease. Delivra's research and development includes formulations, compounding, stability testing, and measurement of systemic penetration and delivery of topical berberine and the closely related natural product, dihydroberberine (DHB). Delivra-berberine and Delivra-DHB achieve circulating blood levels 8-times higher than an oral equivalent treatment, which overcomes a key limitation of this natural compound. With increased berberine blood levels is an expected increase in this compound's effectiveness to reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels, with Delivra-DHB achieving a profound reduction in cholesterol by 34% and reduction in triglycerides by 85%, as compared to control. While this is pre-clinical data, it is very promising in the context of published rates for leading statin drugs in the range of 20-35% reduction in cholesterol and 10-30% reduction in triglycerides. In certain cases, this treatment may provide a natural alternative to the use of statin drugs, the most prescribed drug class in the world, and most commonly recognized by the trade names Lipitor™ (Pfizer Inc.), Zocor™ (Merck & Co. Inc.), and Crestor™ (Astra Zeneca Limited). A Delivra berberine therapy could avoid the side effects associated with statin drugs, including muscle pain, liver damage, stomach upset, increased blood sugar, and a range of neurological issues. Interestingly, preliminary data suggests the Delivra transdermal berberine may also function synergistically to enhance the performance of statin drugs, potentially allowing greater benefits while taking less drug. "These strong results demonstrate the potential for a break-through natural product to address a globally prevalent health issue," said Dr. Joe Gabriele, founder and CEO of Delivra. "To bring to market a natural product that works as well or better than some of the world's most commonly prescribed drugs, without the side effects, would be a game changer for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. We will continue to advance our research, through further pre-clinical work and then into clinical trials, and we look forward to continuing to report to shareholders on our progress." Delivra has filed a provisional US patent to protect its unique berberine formulations. ABOUT DELIVRA CORP. Delivra Corp. is a developer of transdermal technologies for the delivery of pharmaceutical and natural molecules through the skin, rather than via pills. Delivra manufactures and sells a growing line of natural topical creams under the LivRelief™ brand, for conditions such as joint and muscle pain, nerve pain, varicose veins, wound healing, and sports performance. LivRelief™ products are available in pharmacies, grocery chains, and independent health food stores across Canada, and on-line at livrelief.com. LivRelief™ products are also available on-line and on Amazon in the United States. In parallel with its consumer products business, Delivra also has a mandate to license its unique, proven, and patent-pending delivery platform to global pharmaceutical companies for the transdermal delivery of third party active ingredients to treat a broad range of conditions. With a global transdermal drug delivery market forecast to grow to USD $40 billion by 2018 (source:Kelly Scientific), Delivra believes the licensing opportunity is robust. Delivra is headquartered in Burlington, Ontario and has a research and development laboratory in Charlottetown, PEI.

"The problem is, no one has this on their radar," so patients are not routinely checked for it, said Dr. Javid Moslehi, head of a Vanderbilt University clinic specializing in heart risks from cancer therapies. He led a report Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine describing two patients who died of heart trouble two weeks after receiving their first doses of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, for the deadly skin cancer melanoma. Two similar drugs also are on the market, and the study leaders believe they might pose heart risks, too. "My sense is that this is a class effect, not limited to one drug," Moslehi said. The risks do not negate the huge benefits of these relatively new types of drugs, doctors stress. Called checkpoint inhibitors, they have transformed treatment of several types of cancer by helping the immune system see and attack tumors. In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumor but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. Patients need to be told of the risks, monitored closely and treated quickly with medicines to quell the immune response if trouble develops. Besides melanoma, the Opdivo-Yervoy combination is used to treat some lung cancers, though at different doses. Other checkpoint inhibitors include Genentech's Tecentriq, for bladder cancer, and Merck & Co.'s Keytruda, which former President Jimmy Carter received for melanoma that spread to his brain. Many more are in testing. More on this... Immunotherapy improves survival in head and neck cancer patients, study finds Heart attacks are linked to patients' activity level, emotional state UCLA study finds why some cancers stop responding to immunotherapy There have been occasional, previous reports of heart troubles with these drugs. After the two recent deaths, doctors asked Bristol-Myers to check patient safety records on Opdivo and Yervoy. As of April, 18 cases of serious heart inflammation were found among 20,594 patients receiving either or both drugs, a rate of 0.09 percent. It was more severe and more common among people on both drugs, affecting 0.27 percent of those patients. Bristol-Myers scientists helped write the journal report, and some other authors consult for the company. Studies have shown that the drug combination gives a stronger anti-cancer effect than either drug alone, but "we've known this is a double-edged sword" because of the risk of over-stimulating the immune system, said Dr. Jeffrey Sosman of Northwestern University in Chicago, who treated the two patients who died. "The big question is, is there enough advantage to using the combination, which is much more toxic, than a single drug," he said. That's a larger question facing the cancer field, not just with immune therapies. Some of the newer gene-targeting drugs also have produced major side effects when used in combination. Yet many doctors believe that combos may be the best way to get cancer to go into remission and stay there longer, by shutting down multiple pathways the tumor employs at once. Dr. Michael Atkins, deputy director of the Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes the heart problems with checkpoint inhibitors will turn out to be treatable in most patients. "It just gives us a moment of pause," said Atkins, who led a study that included one of the two patients who died. "This is a rare event ... but it's a particularly serious one."

This study, carried out at Merck Research Laboratories in New Jersey, USA, describes early tests of a new drug, (full name BACE1 inhibitor verubecestat (MK-8931)) found to safely reduce the production of amyloid beta in 32 people with Alzheimer’s disease. Responding to this research, Dr Clare Walton, Research Manager at Alzheimer’s Society, said: 'Amyloid plaques are a key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease and most recent efforts to find new dementia treatments focus on reducing the production of amyloid or clearing plaques out of the brain. 'This study describes a new drug that reduces the production of amyloid in people with dementia and, importantly, it appears to be safer than similar drugs that have come before. This finding has paved the way for much larger clinical trials that are currently underway, and we very much look forward to the results of these in the coming years.'

In the highly competitive multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment market, prescription barriers helped 5 of the 10 brands we surveyed eke out narrow market share gains while the other 5 lost out. Which barriers had the biggest impact? Are they the ones that helped the most prescribed brand gain three times as much market share as its closest rival? Find out in Market Access Impact: MS. Request sample pages The report covers 10 major MS drugs from Bayer, Biogen, EMD Serono, Genzyme, Novartis, and Teva. You'll learn which barriers cost your brand the most share, and see which competitors you're losing share to and taking it from—insight you can use to improve your market access strategy. Not your market? Click here to see the EU report Top Takeaways Highly competitive market: More than two thirds of the doctors surveyed prescribe eight of the ten brands covered in the report. Nearly all doctors prescribe the top two brands. Half of brands benefit from barriers: But the most prescribed brand benefits the most, with a barrier-related gain three times as high as any competitor's. Market access is the #1 issue: Barriers related to market access affect nearly as many prescriptions as all other barriers combined. Excellent brand awareness and perception: Nearly all doctors surveyed are aware of the brands covered, and most of them are willing to consider brands they don't currently prescribe. Clear market loser: More doctors experience barriers with one brand in particular. Not surprisingly, that brand is least prescribed, and sees a net share loss to all of the others.

Posted 04 Nov 2016 05:10 Updated 04 Nov 2016 06:04 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Nov 3, 2016 in New York City. (Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: The S&P 500 fell for the eighth straight session on Thursday (Nov 3) as stocks continued to price in a potential win by Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump, who is seen by many investors as an unpredictable wildcard, continues to trail Democrat Hillary Clinton in most polls, but has significantly narrowed the gap in the last 10 days. "This election is causing jitters for investors," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. "An increasing number of investors would prefer to watch this election from the sidelines and not have the full exposure that they've got." The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 28.97 points (0.16 per cent) to 17,930.67, its sixth straight decline. The broad-based S&P 500 fell 9.28 points (0.44 per cent) to 2,088.66, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 47.16 points (0.92 per cent) to 5,058.41, its eighth straight fall. Signs of nervousness showed in the Vix volatility index, which measures market fear. The index vaulted about 14 per cent to 22.08, the highest level since it hit 25.76 after Britain's shock vote in June to exit the European Union. Th Vix was up more than 40 per cent since Oct 27. Facebook sank 5.6 per cent despite reporting a 166 per cent jump in third-quarter profits to US$2.4 billon. Analysts said investors were unnerved by a warning of weaker revenue growth in 2017 and a plan to beef up investment in engineers and data-centres. Shares of generic drug makers plunged after Bloomberg reported that US antitrust investigators could unveil criminal charges of price-fixing by the industry before year-end. These included Mylan, down 6.9 per cent, and Teva, down 9.6 per cent. Other pharmaceutical stocks were also under pressure, with Dow members Pfizer falling 2.4 per cent and Merck 0.7 per cent. Insurer AIG fell 4.0 per cent after reporting third quarter operating earnings of US$1.00 per share, below the US$1.21 expected by analysts. The results included US$622 million in expenses because of increased costs in payments for customers who are living longer, particularly those on disability. Media-entertainment group 21st Century Fox surged 7.3 per cent as it reported a 22 per cent rise in net profit to US$821 million for the quarter ending Sep 30, bolstered by its Fox News Channel amid a busy US election campaign. Some other media stocks were also strong, with CBS rising 0.6 per cent and Dow member Disney 1.6 per cent. Other companies with major moves after earnings included Fitbit, down 33.6 per cent, Marathon Oil, up 10.7 per cent and US Steel, up 7.7 per cent. - AFP/ec Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

He led a report Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine describing two patients who died of heart trouble two weeks after receiving their first doses of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, for the deadly skin cancer melanoma. Two similar drugs also are on the market, and the study leaders believe they might pose heart risks, too. “My sense is that this is a class effect, not limited to one drug,” Moslehi said. The risks do not negate the huge benefits of these relatively new types of drugs, doctors stress. Called checkpoint inhibitors, they have transformed treatment of several types of cancer by helping the immune system see and attack tumors.   In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumor but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumor but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. Patients need to be told of the risks, monitored closely and treated quickly with medicines to quell the immune response if trouble develops. Besides melanoma, the Opdivo-Yervoy combination is used to treat some lung cancers, though at different doses. Other checkpoint inhibitors include Genentech’s Tecentriq, for bladder cancer, and Merck & Co.’s Keytruda, which former President Jimmy Carter received for melanoma that spread to his brain. Many more are in testing. There have been occasional, previous reports of heart troubles with these drugs. After the two recent deaths, doctors asked Bristol-Myers to check patient safety records on Opdivo and Yervoy. As of April, 18 cases of serious heart inflammation were found among 20,594 patients receiving either or both drugs, a rate of 0.09 percent. It was more severe and more common among people on both drugs, affecting 0.27 percent of those patients. Bristol-Myers scientists helped write the journal report, and some other authors consult for the company. Studies have shown that the drug combination gives a stronger anti-cancer effect than either drug alone, but “we’ve known this is a double-edged sword” because of the risk of over-stimulating the immune system, said Dr. Jeffrey Sosman of Northwestern University in Chicago, who treated the two patients who died. (Brian A. Jackson/iStock) “The big question is, is there enough advantage to using the combination, which is much more toxic, than a single drug,” he said. That’s a larger question facing the cancer field, not just with immune therapies. Some of the newer gene-targeting drugs also have produced major side effects when used in combination. Yet many doctors believe that combos may be the best way to get cancer to go into remission and stay there longer, by shutting down multiple pathways the tumor employs at once. Dr. Michael Atkins, deputy director of the Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes the heart problems with checkpoint inhibitors will turn out to be treatable in most patients. “It just gives us a moment of pause,” said Atkins, who led a study that included one of the two patients who died. “This is a rare event … but it’s a particularly serious one.” Editor’s Picks ‘Human Rights is Part of the DNA of America’: An Interview with Gary Locke on Hillary Clinton, China, and the 2016 Election Trump Elected President: Here’s How He Plans to Change America Honoring Veterans Today, Preparing Our Young to Do So Tomorrow Receive Our Epoch 10 Newsletter Important stories from around the world, in your inbox daily.

The punishment, based on Sharia law, comes less than a month after the kingdom executed another prince for murder a Saudi newspaper reported. It said the prince had been sentenced to flogging and jail without specifying the charges. It was unclear how many lashes he received. However, the brief report in Okaz daily did not disclose the offence for which he was being punished. The unidentified prince was also ordered to serve a prison sentence, the newspaper added. Last month, Saudi authorities executed Prince Turki bin Saud al-Kabir in a highly unusual case involving one of the thousands of members of the royal family. He was condemned to death for shooting dead Adel al-Mahemid, a Saudi, during a brawl. Most people put to death in Saudi Arabia are beheaded with a sword.

November 03, 2016 07:00 ET Delivra Advances Revolutionary Treatment for Cardiovascular Disease TORONTO, ON--(Marketwired - November 03, 2016) - Delivra Corp. ("Delivra", or "the Company") (TSX VENTURE: DVA) announced today the Company has successfully completed its first phase pre-clinical research into transdermal berberine for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease related to high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Berberine is a natural plant extract that has been used in eastern medicine for thousands of years, and more recently also in the western world. There is an abundance of research on berberine, and its effectiveness in reducing cholesterol and triglycerides is well-established. The main challenges with the use of berberine in its traditional oral format are exceptionally low bioavailability (< 2%) and highly adverse gastrointestinal events. Transdermal berberine from Delivra overcomes these challenges, showing 8-times higher concentration levels in the blood than oral, with no gastrointestinal side effects, and proved significantly more effective than oral in reducing cholesterol and triglycerides in a model of metabolic disease. This achievement represents a first-in-class platform that may prove effective in reducing cholesterol, triglycerides, and other hallmarks of cardiovascular disease. Delivra's research and development includes formulations, compounding, stability testing, and measurement of systemic penetration and delivery of topical berberine and the closely related natural product, dihydroberberine (DHB). Delivra-berberine and Delivra-DHB achieve circulating blood levels 8-times higher than an oral equivalent treatment, which overcomes a key limitation of this natural compound. With increased berberine blood levels is an expected increase in this compound's effectiveness to reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels, with Delivra-DHB achieving a profound reduction in cholesterol by 34% and reduction in triglycerides by 85%, as compared to control. While this is pre-clinical data, it is very promising in the context of published rates for leading statin drugs in the range of 20-35% reduction in cholesterol and 10-30% reduction in triglycerides. In certain cases, this treatment may provide a natural alternative to the use of statin drugs, the most prescribed drug class in the world, and most commonly recognized by the trade names Lipitor™ (Pfizer Inc.), Zocor™ (Merck & Co. Inc.), and Crestor™ (Astra Zeneca Limited). A Delivra berberine therapy could avoid the side effects associated with statin drugs, including muscle pain, liver damage, stomach upset, increased blood sugar, and a range of neurological issues. Interestingly, preliminary data suggests the Delivra transdermal berberine may also function synergistically to enhance the performance of statin drugs, potentially allowing greater benefits while taking less drug. "These strong results demonstrate the potential for a break-through natural product to address a globally prevalent health issue," said Dr. Joe Gabriele, founder and CEO of Delivra. "To bring to market a natural product that works as well or better than some of the world's most commonly prescribed drugs, without the side effects, would be a game changer for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. We will continue to advance our research, through further pre-clinical work and then into clinical trials, and we look forward to continuing to report to shareholders on our progress." Delivra has filed a provisional US patent to protect its unique berberine formulations. ABOUT DELIVRA CORP. Delivra Corp. is a developer of transdermal technologies for the delivery of pharmaceutical and natural molecules through the skin, rather than via pills. Delivra manufactures and sells a growing line of natural topical creams under the LivRelief™ brand, for conditions such as joint and muscle pain, nerve pain, varicose veins, wound healing, and sports performance. LivRelief™ products are available in pharmacies, grocery chains, and independent health food stores across Canada, and on-line at livrelief.com. LivRelief™ products are also available on-line and on Amazon in the United States. In parallel with its consumer products business, Delivra also has a mandate to license its unique, proven, and patent-pending delivery platform to global pharmaceutical companies for the transdermal delivery of third party active ingredients to treat a broad range of conditions. With a global transdermal drug delivery market forecast to grow to USD $40 billion by 2018 (Source: Kelly Scientific), Delivra believes the licensing opportunity is robust.

The research published in the journal Science Translational Medicine on the basis of a small 32-person sample gave rise to two broader clinical trials that are now underway with more than 3,000 subjects. The treatment uses a compound called verubecestat, developed by US pharmaceutical firm. It reduces levels of proteins called beta amyloids by blocking an enzyme known as BACE1. In people with Alzheimer's disease, the proteins clump into plaques that damage the brain, affecting cognitive abilities, especially memory. The enzyme plays a key role in production of the proteins. The 32 people who participated in the first clinical trial had been diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's. Pharmaceutical labs are working to develop compounds that can stop or even reverse the formation of these plaques. Until now, products developed to neutralise the BACEI enzyme had very toxic side effects, such as liver damage or further neuro-degeneration. But verubecestat does not, said Dr Matthew Kennedy of the Merck research lab in northeastern state of New Jersey. Researchers found that one or two doses of the compound were enough to lower protein levels without causing side effects. The two so-called phase 3 clinical trials now under way to evaluate how well verubecestat works will conclude in July 2017. If the results are good, the compound could be marketed as a pill in two or three years. The number of people in the United States suffering from mind-wasting Alzheimer's could surpass 28 million by 2050 after the entire baby boomer generation gets past age 80, according to projections. The World Health Organization says 36 million people around the world suffer from some form of dementia, most of them with Alzheimer. The figure is expected to double by 2030 to exceed 65.7 million, and triple by 2050 to 115.4 million, if no effective treatment is found in the next few years. ― AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Cut genetic risk of heart attack with a healthy lifestyle says new research Rihanna and Manolo Blahnik team up on winter shoe collection World Diabetes Day: Five dietary tips for diabetics Historic gems to star at Geneva jewel auctions Michael Kors: How the new Singapore flaghsip store is better than online shopping Elephants kneel to pay respect to late Thai king Bhumibol ‘Rose Gold’ is this winter’s hottest hair trend What it is like being a 24-year-old female farmer in Singapore Blood pressure spike around doctors might point to heart problem Hilarious Singaporean take on BBC’s ‘Iguana vs Snake’ documentary (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Debu bauksit beri ancaman Alzheimer, kata penyelidik Eye movement link to Alzheimer’s (VIDEO) Pengarah muzik tersohor Ooi Eow Jin dikenang RTM dalam konsert khas (VIDEO) Kajian: Sambung belajar di hari tua kurangkan risiko nyanyuk Scientists identify protein key to Alzheimer’s treatment Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Global Market Study on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Treatment: North America Likely to Emerge as the Dominant Market in 2016 LONDON, Nov. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — In a newly published report on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Drugs, Persistence Market Research analyzes the PCOS drugs market over an eight-year period from 2016 to 2024 and studies the key drivers and trends impacting the market. The primary objective of the report is to provide updates and information related to market opportunities and useful insights into factors that are significantly transforming businesses and enterprises in the global PCOS market. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) – also known as Stein-Leventhal Syndrome – is a common hormonal endocrine disorder that affects women of child bearing age i.e. 15 to 49 years. This disease is characterized by the formation of cysts on the ovaries leading to an insufficiency of the ovulation initiating hormone in the female body. PCOS mainly occurs due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors, which cause an abnormal function of the hormones present in the pituitary gland that regulate ovulation. Few of the symptoms of PCOS include irregular menstruation, excess facial and body hair, infertility, and acne and other skin problems. PCOS is also associated with diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart diseases, acute depression, and obstructive sleep apnea. Currently, there are no specific diagnostic tests available for the detection of PCOS; however, blood tests, physical examination, vaginal ultrasound, and medical history analysis are widely recommended by general physicians and gynecologists. While there is no cure for PCOS, its symptoms and associated conditions can be managed with the help of lifestyle modification activities, weight loss management, and medications. Currently, no drugs are approved by the FDA and EMA for PCOS. However, oral contraceptives, insulin sensitizing agents, and aromatase inhibitors are used as first line agents for the treatment of irregular menstruation, diabetes, and facial hair growth respectively. This report covers the global PCOS drugs market performance in terms of revenue contribution from various segments. Included in the report is a detailed impact analysis of key trends, drivers, restraints, and opportunities influencing the growth of the global polycystic ovary syndrome drugs market. The report begins with an overview of the polycystic ovary syndrome drugs process and the main reasons why patients worldwide are adopting this process. This section also underlines factors influencing the growth of the global polycystic ovary syndrome drugs market along with detailing of the key trends, drivers, restraints, opportunities, and regulations. The report also provides strategic recommendations for key players in the market to strengthen their footprint and ensure their business stays sustainably profitable. The next few sections provide a detailed analysis for every segment and sub-segment of the global PCOS drugs market in terms of market size, Y-o-Y growth rate, absolute $ opportunity, market Attractiveness Index, and BPS analysis. The report further highlights the growth trends of the polycystic ovary syndrome drugs market by region and presents a market outlook for 2016–2024 – showcasing key regional trends contributing to the growth of the polycystic ovary syndrome drugs market worldwide, as well as an analysis into the extent to which drivers are influencing this market in each region. The final section of the report includes detailed company profiles with company-specific long-term and short-term strategies, key offerings, and recent developments in the polycystic ovary syndrome drugs market. Some of the leading companies profiled in the report are Sanofi, Novartis, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited, Addex Therapeutics Ltd., BIOCAD, Merck KGaA, and AstraZeneca Plc. Research Methodology The report considers 2015 as the base year and provides data for the forecast period 2016–2024.

A small trial of the drug was primarily aimed at assessing safety, but the findings suggest it effectively “switched off” the production of toxic amyloid proteins that lead to the sticky plaques seen in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. If the tablet, produced by pharmaceutical giant Merck, is also shown to slow the pace of mental decline – a crucial question that a major clinical trial should answer when it reports next year – it could be the first treatment for Alzheimer’s to be licensed in more than a decade.

Smoking a pack a day causes 150 mutations in every lung cell, research shows Scientists have found that smoking a pack a day of cigarettes can cause 150 damaging changes to a smoker's lung cells each year. The findings come from a study of the devastating genetic damage, or mutations, caused by smoking in various organs in the body. Gua sha therapy may offer some relief in perimenopause A Chinese medicine technique using a smooth-edged instrument to scrape or rub certain areas of the body may relieve troublesome symptoms women experience in the years leading up to menopause, according to a new study. Perimenopause can begin eight to 10 years before menopause, as estrogen levels fluctuate and start declining but menstrual cycles continue. During this time, and for another year or more after menstruation stops, women may experience hot flashes, insomnia, tiredness, mood swings, forgetfulness, aches and pains, vaginal dryness and pain during sex. Stronger muscles may mean sharper minds for kids Making sure kids have good muscle fitness might also benefit their school performance, according to a recent U.S. study. Aerobic fitness has already been linked to better thinking abilities in pre-teen children, but the current study found an independent link between muscle fitness and kids' performance on memory tests as well as their math and reading skills. Study finds gene markers for drug-resistant malaria in Cambodia Scientists have discovered genetic markers in malaria parasites linked to resistance to the key anti-malarial medicine piperaquine, and say their work could help doctors and health officials monitor and limit the spread of such resistance. In research published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, the team also said a simple test using blood taken from a finger pinprick could show whether a malaria patient has parasites with the genetic markers - allowing doctors to prescribe an alternative treatment. U.N. chief Ban honored by Elton John AIDS Foundation United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has been honored by the Elton John AIDS Foundation with its Founder's Award, which recognizes "extraordinary contributions to the global effort to end AIDS". The non-profit organization, founded by veteran singer Elton John, gave away the award at its 15th annual "An Enduring Vision" Gala in New York on Wednesday night. Accurate Facebook posts about Zika virus were plentiful, not popular (Reuters Health) - Social media is an important source of news for many Americans, but the health stories that are most popular may also be the least accurate, suggests a study of Facebook posts about Zika virus. In May and June 2016, a period of heavy media coverage of the Zika virus epidemic spreading in the Americas, about four out of five popular posts on Facebook about Zika contained accurate information, researchers found. But the ones containing inaccurate information or conspiracy theories were far more popular on the social networking website. Trauma burden and services not equally distributed across U.S. (Reuters Health) - The more surgical trauma centers there are in an area, the lower death rates tend to be, according to a study that finds the density of trauma centers varies widely by state. States like Maine, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Michigan and North Dakota had the highest density of surgical critical care (SCC) providers, while Alaska, Georgia, Oklahoma and New Mexico had the lowest density, based on 2013 data. Exclusive: Tobacco treaty leaders propose barring delegates linked to state firms The leadership of a World Health Organization (WHO) treaty on tobacco control has proposed barring delegates with ties to state-owned tobacco firms from its conference next week, tightening its application of rules to shut out the industry from policy making. That would include delegates employed by state-owned tobacco companies or those otherwise "working to advance the interests of the tobacco industry," according to an internal communication document seen by Reuters. Drugmakers under fire for possible U.S. price fixing Two prominent U.S. lawmakers on Thursday called on federal antitrust regulators to probe whether Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly and Co, Merck & Co Inc and Novo Nordisk A/S colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. The request by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings follows a similar letter they sent last fall calling for an investigation into 14 drug companies over price increases of generic drugs. Weight loss surgery may reduce risk of developing gout Obese people who have weight loss surgeries like gastric bypass are much less likely than those who don't have surgery to develop gout, a painful type of arthritis, according to a Swedish study. People who chose to get weight loss surgery are also less than half as likely to develop hyperuricemia, too much uric acid in urine, which can be a precursor to gout, the study team writes in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.

Login Register Public Release: 3-Nov-2016 Insulin resistance reversed by removal of protein University of California - San Diego Share  Print  E-Mail IMAGE: Jerrold Olefsky, M.D., is a professor of medicine in the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at UC San Diego School of Medicine. view more Credit: UC San Diego Health By removing the protein galectin-3 (Gal3), a team of investigators led by University of California School of Medicine researchers were able to reverse diabetic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in mouse models of obesity and diabetes. By binding to insulin receptors on cells, Gal3 prevents insulin from attaching to the receptors resulting in cellular insulin resistance. The team led by Jerrold Olefsky, MD, professor of medicine in the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at UC San Diego School of Medicine, showed that by genetically removing Gal3 or using pharmaceutical inhibitors to target it, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance could be returned to normal, even among older mice. However, obesity remained unchanged. "This study puts Gal3 on the map for insulin resistance and diabetes in mouse model," said Olefsky, associate dean for scientific affairs and senior author of the study. "Our findings suggest that Gal3 inhibition in people could be an effective anti-diabetic approach." Olefsky and other researchers have been studying how chronic tissue inflammation leads to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. In the paper, published in the journal Cell on November 3, researchers explain that inflammation requires macrophages -- specialized cells that destroy targeted cells. In obese adipose tissue (fat), for example, 40 percent of cells are macrophages. Macrophages in turn secrete Gal3, which then acts as a signaling protein attracting more macrophages, thus resulting in the production of even more Gal3. Furthermore, investigators identified bone marrow-derived macrophages as the source of Gal3 that leads to insulin resistance. More importantly, researchers found that Gal3 is secreted by macrophages, and can then cause insulin resistance in liver, fat cells, and muscle cells independent of inflammation. Gal3 has previously been connected to other diseases. Olefsky will continue to study Gal3 depletion as a possible therapeutic target for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis as well as heart and liver fibrosis. ### Study co-authors include: Pingping Li, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College and UC San Diego; Shuainan Liu, Zhufang Shen, Bing Cui, Lijuan Kong, Shaocong Hou, Xiao Liang, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College; Min Lu, UC San Diego, and Merck Research Laboratories; Gautum Bandyyopadhyay, Dayoung Oh, Andrew M.
