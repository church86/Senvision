Inc. MRK, +0.32% said premarket Friday that a late-stage clinical trial comparing its cancer drug Keytruda to Bristol-Myers Squibb's [: BMY] cancer drug Yervoy found patients on Keytruda had better results. The trial, which enrolled 834 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who were either new to treatment or had received one prior treatment, found that treatment with Keytruda was associated with a 30% improvement in survival. About half of patients on Keytruda remained alive nearly three years after starting the therapy, the company said, compared with 39% of patients on Yervoy. The company also reported that Keytruda nearly doubled the progression-free survival rate at nearly three years, with 31% of patients on Keytruda surviving without disease progression, compared to 14% of patients on Yervoy. The results are scheduled to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting on Sunday. Merck shares were not active in premarket trade.

Liquid Biopsy Panel that Includes MSI Testing-- --Learn More about PGDx's Advanced Cancer Genomic Testing at 2017 ASCO Booth #2078-- News provided by Personal Genome Diagnostics Inc. 02 Jun, 2017, 07:00 ET Share this article BALTIMORE, June 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Personal Genome Diagnostics Inc. (PGDx), a pioneer in cancer genomic testing, today highlighted its patent-pending microsatellite instability (MSI) testing technology following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) accelerated approval of Merck's immuno-oncology agent Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) for children and adults whose advanced solid tumors are marked by microsatellite instability (MSI). This is the first approval of a cancer drug based on the genetic make-up of the tumor rather than its location in the body. Patients will likely be tested for MSI status before receiving Keytruda under the expanded indication. Tumors that display MSI have lost the ability to repair errors in their DNA as a result of a condition known as mismatch repair deficiency (MMR). Researchers from The Johns Hopkins University, PGDx and other institutions have shown that tumors displaying MMR deficiency and MSI are more susceptible to successful treatment with Keytruda and other immuno-oncology drugs. MSI tumors have been identified in colorectal, endometrial, gastric and other types of cancer. "This landmark FDA approval codifies the need to determine whether cancer patients potentially eligible for immuno-oncology therapy have microsatellite instability present in their tumors," said Doug Ward, CEO of PGDx. "It is particularly fitting that the approval involves MSI, a genomic condition whose relevance to cancer therapy was first uncovered by researchers at Johns Hopkins, with assistance from researchers at PGDx.  We were thrilled to license rights to the patent-pending MSI measurement technology for immuno-oncology applications developed at Johns Hopkins, and are proud to be the first to offer it in both tissue and liquid biopsy formats. PGDx is also planning to submit a tissue-based MSI assay for FDA review later this year." PGDx's MSI testing is incorporated in the company's tissue-based CancerSELECT® 125 pan cancer genomic profiling assay and its non-invasive PlasmaSELECT™ 64 pan cancer assay that analyzes circulating tumor DNA in patient plasma. The company also recently received grant funding from the National Cancer Institute to advance liquid biopsy tests for determining a related biomarker known as tumor mutational burden.  PGDx was an early leader in identifying the importance of MSI, contributing to a study on MMR and immune checkpoint blockade presented at the 2015 ASCO Annual Meeting. In that study, researchers found that colorectal cancer patients who had tumors with MSI/MMR deficiency had a much greater therapeutic response to pembrolizumab. The analysis showed that cancer patients with MSI/MMR deficiency on average had more than 20 times the number of mutations in their tumors as similar patients who were not mismatch repair deficient. This finding is consistent with other studies showing that PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockers are most effective against tumors containing many mutations. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  "We established PGDx to advance technology invented at Johns Hopkins based on our belief that greater understanding of tumor genomics would ultimately enable more effective and less toxic treatments for cancer," noted Victor E. Velculescu, MD, PhD, a co-founder of PGDx. Dr. Velculescu also is Professor of Oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. "This breakthrough approval from the FDA is an important milestone in the realization of that vision. I am proud that PGDx has played a significant role in this advance and that the company will help many more patients realize the benefits of immuno-oncology approaches for cancer treatment." PGDx representatives will be attending the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting and are available at Booth #2078 to discuss the company's MSI testing and its complete range of cancer genome analysis tools for researchers and clinicians. Research services include exome and targeted approaches for tissue specimens, targeted approaches for plasma samples and a variety of custom tissue and plasma-based options designed to address the specific research needs of cancer researchers and drug developers. PGDx's service offerings for researchers and testing labs are complemented by the clinical services it provides to patients and physicians through its CLIA-certified laboratory, including its CancerSELECT 125 pan cancer genomic profiling assay and the non-invasive PlasmaSELECT™ 64 pan cancer profiling assay, both of which include MSI testing.

PGDx's MSI testing is incorporated in the company's tissue-based CancerSELECT [®] 125 pan cancer genomic profiling assay and its non-invasive PlasmaSELECT™ 64 pan cancer assay that analyzes circulating tumor DNA in patient plasma. The company also recently received grant funding from the National Cancer Institute to advance liquid biopsy tests for determining a related biomarker known as tumor mutational burden.  PGDx was an early leader in identifying the importance of MSI, contributing to a study on MMR and immune checkpoint blockade presented at the 2015 ASCO Annual Meeting. In that study, researchers found that colorectal cancer patients who had tumors with MSI/MMR deficiency had a much greater therapeutic response to pembrolizumab. The analysis showed that cancer patients with MSI/MMR deficiency on average had more than 20 times the number of mutations in their tumors as similar patients who were not mismatch repair deficient. This finding is consistent with other studies showing that PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockers are most effective against tumors containing many mutations. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  "We established PGDx to advance technology invented at Johns Hopkins based on our belief that greater understanding of tumor genomics would ultimately enable more effective and less toxic treatments for cancer," noted Victor E. Velculescu, MD, PhD, a co-founder of PGDx. Dr. Velculescu also is Professor of Oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. "This breakthrough approval from the FDA is an important milestone in the realization of that vision. I am proud that PGDx has played a significant role in this advance and that the company will help many more patients realize the benefits of immuno-oncology approaches for cancer treatment." PGDx representatives will be attending the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting and are available at Booth #2078 to discuss the company's MSI testing and its complete range of cancer genome analysis tools for researchers and clinicians. Research services include exome and targeted approaches for tissue specimens, targeted approaches for plasma samples and a variety of custom tissue and plasma-based options designed to address the specific research needs of cancer researchers and drug developers. PGDx's service offerings for researchers and testing labs are complemented by the clinical services it provides to patients and physicians through its CLIA-certified laboratory, including its CancerSELECT 125 pan cancer genomic profiling assay and the non-invasive PlasmaSELECT™ 64 pan cancer profiling assay, both of which include MSI testing.

There is a lot of discussion across biopharma about the increasing complexity in the design and management of clinical trials. Recent estimates suggest the cost of bringing a drug to market is as high as $3 billion, and only 1 in 10 drugs successfully navigate the process and make it to market. These trends are not sustainable, and the use of targeted clinical strategies are being seen as a critical step towards improving success rates. Historically, drug approvals sought to maximize the potential market opportunity both in the initial indication and later line extensions. The rising average duration of trials suggests that a change in strategic approach is valuable, particularly after the recent successes with drugs like Imatinib and Keytruda. Keytruda developed by Merck is indicated for patients with metastatic or advanced non-small cell lung cancer who test positive for TPS>1% PD-L1 expression and negative for EGFR and ALK mutations. This new drug has a mechanism of action that is so tightly understood and critically linked to a clear biomarker strategy that development professionals had the confidence to carefully select patients from specific sub-groups from the earliest trials and demonstrate efficacy from the earliest opportunity, leading to a uniquely accelerated approval and ultimately benefiting both patients and Merck with the granting of a Marketing Authorization. To determine whether these celebrated successes reflect the beginning of a new stage of therapeutic evolution, we wish to understand how deep the shift has occurred towards personalized therapies and how widespread such an approach is across the therapeutic areas within clinical development. By comparing the two periods, 2007-2011 vs. 2012-2016, we can identify a number of trends in the application of specific biomarker roles (therapeutic effect marker, toxic effect marker, disease marker) within active clinical trials. The speakers demonstrate an increase in both the application of specific biomarker types and also highlighting some areas where there are opportunities to increase our knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms.

The trend builds on immuno-oncology drugs, an important new approach that harnesses a patient’s immune system to fight cancer by combining them with other cancer treatments, ranging from another immunotherapy drug to chemotherapy to radiation. Arguably, it has already reached fever pitch: There are nearly 800 ongoing and completed trials, according to a search of the federal database of clinical studies, up from about 200 such studies in the fall of 2015, according to a new EP Vantage/ Evaluate Ltd. report. Immuno-oncology drugs are being paired with “actually, literally anything,” with the intent of boosting drugs’ effectiveness, said investor Brad Loncar, who developed the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF CNCR, +2.25% “That’s one of the reasons why people believe immunotherapy is so promising — they think it might be able to be used as the backbone of many different approaches,” Loncar said. “If you can just get the immune system to kick in a little bit, you would think it would amplify everything you’re doing.” One drug that’s being closely watched in the space is Incyte Corporation’s INCY, +1.72%  epacadostat, Loncar said. Earlier this month, the company reported positive results from a mid-stage combination trial with Merck & Co.’s MRK, +0.32%  blockbuster drug Keytruda, with more detail expected at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s (ASCO) upcoming annual meeting. Earlier this year, Incyte and Merck announced that they would expand the program to late-stage trials for four additional types of tumor, which bolstered investor confidence in the combination and raised hopes that it’ll be one of the first successes. Though epacadostat has given Incyte a high valuation, “I’m not sure that it’s warranted based on the data we’ve seen so far,” Loncar said, since most of the data is very preliminary. “In fact, I’m sure it’s not. We need to see some more data that backs up one, the rationale for making it into so many pivotal studies and two, for the huge valuation.” Incyte shares have climbed 29% in 2017 and are up 52% in the last 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $26 billion. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.37% has gained 8% in 2017 and 15% in the last 12 months. Courtesy of Evaluate Ltd. Merck’s Keytruda has overtaken Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo in clinical trials studying cancer drug combinations, according to a new EP Vantage/Evaluate Ltd. report. Still, despite the staggering number of clinical trials in progress, few drugs have proven their effectiveness in combination. NewLink Genetics Corp. NLNK, -1.25% which is developing the same type of drug as Incyte and is also testing its drug with Merck’s Keytruda, saw its stock plunge in early April after investors questioned how much of an effect its indoximod had relative to Keytruda alone. There are also questions about immunotherapy drugs’ side effects. For example, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s BMY, +0.81%  Yervoy and Opdivo were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the fall of 2015 for advanced melanoma. Results released in April suggested that the combination worked better than either drug on its own, though the company said the clinical trial was not designed to make that comparison. But Yervoy on its own can cause “serious side effects in many parts of your body which can lead to death,” according to the Food and Drug Administration prescribing information. That makes adding another drug even more fraught with risk. For its part, Bristol-Myers says it has extensively studied the drugs on their own and in combination and believes “the safety profile with the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen is tolerable and well-managed.” There are about 75 combination trials studying Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo and Yervoy drugs in various cancer types. And broader concerns have been raised about the effects these drugs have on the immune system, which may manifest some time after the treatment. One type of immunotherapy, anti-PD-(L)1 drugs, work to block proteins on cells so the body can fight tumor cells. But anti-PD-1 drugs can cause serious immune-related side effects, noted one scientific paper, that affect the endocrine system, liver, gastrointestinal tract, skin and other organ systems. A Bristol-Myers spokesperson said that “we have and continue to work closely with oncologists to ensure they are prepared to manage possible side effects using established algorithms in either the combination or monotherapy treatment settings.” Then, of course, there’s the question of price. The already-high cost of cancer treatment has risen over the years, and immunotherapy combinations could more than double those prices, experts say. Bristol-Myers’ Yervoy and Opdivo combination, for example, costs about $147,400 for patients with metastatic melanoma taking the median number of doses. The price varies by patient and length of treatment, with a wide range of possible doses, a company spokesperson said. Newer combinations could make prices a multiple of what they once were, said Raymond James analyst Chris Raymond, since they would include the cost of two expensive drugs and patients would likely be taking them for longer periods. “You don’t see a ton of people asking if [the cost of cancer treatment] is worth it because patients are, you know, alive,” he said. “We haven’t really seen people at this point take the debate to ‘what is the price for life?” But “I think you could see some people asking the question,” he said, though they’re unlikely to manifest at ASCO, which as a medical conference focuses on science and trial results. By way of contrast, Loncar said he expects drug combinations to be priced as a cocktail like HIV or hepatitis C drugs, rather than add the price of two or three drugs together, an approach which “is going to be unsustainable.” The ASCO’s annual meeting will take place in Chicago from Friday through June 6. Incyte and NewLink were not immediately available for comment.

The trend builds on immuno-oncology drugs, an important new approach that harnesses a patient’s immune system to fight cancer by combining them with other cancer treatments, ranging from another immunotherapy drug to chemotherapy to radiation. Arguably, it has already reached fever pitch: There are nearly 800 ongoing and completed trials, according to a search of the federal database of clinical studies, up from about 200 such studies in the fall of 2015, according to a new EP Vantage/ Evaluate Ltd. report. Immuno-oncology drugs are being paired with “actually, literally anything,” with the intent of boosting drugs’ effectiveness, said investor Brad Loncar, who developed the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF CNCR, +2.25% “That’s one of the reasons why people believe immunotherapy is so promising — they think it might be able to be used as the backbone of many different approaches,” Loncar said. “If you can just get the immune system to kick in a little bit, you would think it would amplify everything you’re doing.” One drug that’s being closely watched in the space is Incyte Corporation’s INCY, +1.72%  epacadostat, Loncar said. Earlier this month, the company reported positive results from a mid-stage combination trial with Merck & Co.’s MRK, +0.32%  blockbuster drug Keytruda, with more detail expected at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s (ASCO) upcoming annual meeting. Earlier this year, Incyte and Merck announced that they would expand the program to late-stage trials for four additional types of tumor, which bolstered investor confidence in the combination and raised hopes that it’ll be one of the first successes. Though epacadostat has given Incyte a high valuation, “I’m not sure that it’s warranted based on the data we’ve seen so far,” Loncar said, since most of the data is very preliminary. “In fact, I’m sure it’s not. We need to see some more data that backs up one, the rationale for making it into so many pivotal studies and two, for the huge valuation.” Incyte shares have climbed 29% in 2017 and are up 52% in the last 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $26 billion. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.37% has gained 8% in 2017 and 15% in the last 12 months. Courtesy of Evaluate Ltd. Merck’s Keytruda has overtaken Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo in clinical trials studying cancer drug combinations, according to a new EP Vantage/Evaluate Ltd. report. Still, despite the staggering number of clinical trials in progress, few drugs have proven their effectiveness in combination. NewLink Genetics Corp. NLNK, -1.25% which is developing the same type of drug as Incyte and is also testing its drug with Merck’s Keytruda, saw its stock plunge in early April after investors questioned how much of an effect its indoximod had relative to Keytruda alone. There are also questions about immunotherapy drugs’ side effects. For example, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s BMY, +0.81%  Yervoy and Opdivo were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the fall of 2015 for advanced melanoma. Results released in April suggested that the combination worked better than either drug on its own, though the company said the clinical trial was not designed to make that comparison. But Yervoy on its own can cause “serious side effects in many parts of your body which can lead to death,” according to the Food and Drug Administration prescribing information. That makes adding another drug even more fraught with risk. For its part, Bristol-Myers says it has extensively studied the drugs on their own and in combination and believes “the safety profile with the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen is tolerable and well-managed.” There are about 75 combination trials studying Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo and Yervoy drugs in various cancer types. And broader concerns have been raised about the effects these drugs have on the immune system, which may manifest some time after the treatment. One type of immunotherapy, anti-PD-(L)1 drugs, work to block proteins on cells so the body can fight tumor cells. But anti-PD-1 drugs can cause serious immune-related side effects, noted one scientific paper, that affect the endocrine system, liver, gastrointestinal tract, skin and other organ systems. A Bristol-Myers spokesperson said that “we have and continue to work closely with oncologists to ensure they are prepared to manage possible side effects using established algorithms in either the combination or monotherapy treatment settings.” Then, of course, there’s the question of price. The already-high cost of cancer treatment has risen over the years, and immunotherapy combinations could more than double those prices, experts say. Bristol-Myers’ Yervoy and Opdivo combination, for example, costs about $147,400 for patients with metastatic melanoma taking the median number of doses. The price varies by patient and length of treatment, with a wide range of possible doses, a company spokesperson said. Newer combinations could make prices a multiple of what they once were, said Raymond James analyst Chris Raymond, since they would include the cost of two expensive drugs and patients would likely be taking them for longer periods. “You don’t see a ton of people asking if [the cost of cancer treatment] is worth it because patients are, you know, alive,” he said. “We haven’t really seen people at this point take the debate to ‘what is the price for life?” But “I think you could see some people asking the question,” he said, though they’re unlikely to manifest at ASCO, which as a medical conference focuses on science and trial results. By way of contrast, Loncar said he expects drug combinations to be priced as a cocktail like HIV or hepatitis C drugs, rather than add the price of two or three drugs together, an approach which “is going to be unsustainable.” The ASCO’s annual meeting will take place in Chicago from Friday through June 6.

Meet the Contributors → In Maine, Making Cancer DNA Tests Free—And Asking Tough Questions Alex Lash May 31st, 2017 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  Has the era of genetic oncology arrived? Last week, the biomedical world took a notable step in that direction when the FDA said Merck’s drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda), already one of the world’s most successful cancer immunotherapies, could now treat any tumor with a particular genetic fingerprint. It was the first time a drug has been approved strictly for a genotype—a tumor’s genetic profile—regardless of the organ or body part where the tumor is growing. But the commercial tests used to decipher cancer’s genetic fingerprints are still an elite tool, often reserved for clinical studies and major cancer centers, and are only grudgingly reimbursed by insurers for rank-and-file patients. And when the tests are employed, they often raise more questions than answers—especially for doctors who don’t have the resources of cancer centers like New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Boston’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, or Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto. Edmund Tai, who treats people with blood cancers at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation in Mountain View, CA, referred to a “knowledge gap” in a recent talk at a precision medicine conference. “Not everyone goes to ASCO”—the annual American Society for Clinical Oncology meeting taking place this weekend—“or reads the literature as soon as it comes out,” said Tai. There are efforts underway to help so-called community doctors grapple with cutting-edge genetic testing of tumors. One is using the entire state of Maine, which has America’s oldest average population. Its 1.3 million people are spread out over some 35,000 often extremely remote square miles. Mainers get 9,000 new cancer diagnoses a year, with fewer than 100 oncologists in the state to treat them. The Maine Cancer Genome Initiative, which is run by the private nonprofit Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, ME, aims to provide up to 1,800 free sequencing tests over the next three or four years, turning the raw DNA data into a report for the participating doctors. It has an $8.5 million philanthropic gift to get started. Along with the free DNA tests, the initiative will provide doctors layers of education and training, some of it to help with basic questions: Which patients are right for these tests? What’s supposed to happen when you send a test to the lab? To give doctors the same feedback and support that big medical centers provide, the initiative is also creating a virtual statewide “tumor board”—regular sessions to discuss puzzling cases with colleagues and specialists. “We want to pioneer community genomic medicine,” says Edison Liu, president and CEO of the sprawling, 88-year-old Jackson Lab—also known as JAX. Commercial sequencing tests, sold by companies like Foundation Medicine (NASDAQ: FMI), Guardant Health, and others, are meant to guide doctors who are making treatment decisions for patients already diagnosed with cancer—for example, when a cancer once in remission has returned. But the test reports are often more complicated than a simple recommendation of one drug or another. “There are a lot of data, and it’s hard to know what to do with the results,” says Julia Moukharskaya, an oncologist at MaineGeneral Medical Center, which is in Augusta, one of Maine’s more populous regions, but also has rural clinics for patients who aren’t able to travel. Jens Rueter, the medical director of the Maine initiative and an oncologist himself, says he’s had test makers come by his office “trying to sell you on the new assay.” That leads to doctors testing patients without understanding why. After a year of participation, Rueter hopes that “clinicians will order the tests with a better understanding of which patients are appropriate for testing.” (The Maine initiative will use certified tests developed at JAX, not commercial tests, but Rueter says the lessons should apply broadly.) Rueter says JAX won’t advocate for testing for testing’s sake. “Is knowing more actually better?” Rueter asks. Put another way: It seems that knowing the genomic pattern of a patient’s tumor is a good thing. But does every cancer patient need sequencing? You can’t answer that question without easier access to testing, which is why the Maine initiative offers it free of charge. Better answers will also require much more data than what Maine can provide, says oncologist Kevin Knopf. Knopf has left his practice at Sutter Health in San Francisco to focus more on Cancer Commons, a nonprofit online service to help community doctors decode tumor DNA test results. “To help all patients we think an open-source database has the most utility,” says Knopf. Instead of current tests that list a patient’s mutations and potential drugs to use, a report should rank therapies the way online travel sites rank best options. There are other reasons to make community doctors more sequencing-savvy. One big reason is uncertainty. Genetic testing is in its infancy. Despite occasional cures that come after the sequencing of a desperate patient’s tumor DNA—what Dana-Farber’s chief scientific officer Barrett Rollins described in late 2015 as “Lazarus cases”—there is no rock-solid evidence that sequencing people’s tumors leads to better outcomes. At the time, a consortium of seven cancer centers including Dana-Farber announced a cancer-data consortium called GENIE; in pooling their data, Rollins hoped one of their first efforts would study this problem. Nothing so ambitious has begun, says a spokeswoman for the American Association for Cancer Research, but the pooled data have spawned several narrower studies examining outcomes. And this study, unrelated to GENIE, lent momentum to the idea that sequencing patients improves their chances of survival, but it was not a randomized trial. Adding to the uncertainty is a growing realization that the two main tests—Guardant360 from Guardant Health and FoundationOne from Foundation Medicine—sometimes provide conflicting or overlapping results from the same patient. The evidence has so far come from small sample sizes. The most recent (and smallest sample) was a nine-patient study published last December in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Of the nine patients in the study, one showed no genetic mutations with either test. The other eight had 45 mutations; only 10 of the mutations (or 22 percent) were identified by both tests. For those eight patients, only nine of 36 recommended drugs showed up on both reports. When both tests identified the same mutations in a patient, the recommended drugs were a tighter but not perfect fit: eight of 13 drugs came up on both reports. The results, added to other studies, are raising useful questions. Researchers at the University of California, San Diego published a 168-patient study on discordance in early 2016, and they hope to publish soon two more studies with about 300 patients combined. Both studies continue to show overlap between tissue and liquid biopsy, as well as differences, says Razelle Kurzrock, director of the Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy at UC San Diego. For example, tumors evolve. The longer the gap between the two tests, the less overlap is likely, says Kurzrock. (Like Knopf’s Cancer Commons, Kurzrock wants to provide an interpretive service for doctors; she has helped form a startup from UCSD called CureMatch. Unlike Cancer Commons, it’s a for-profit venture.) Doctors are eager for more light on the subject. “This genomic discrepancy is certainly a clinical challenge that needs to be solved,” said Joshua Schiffman, a pediatric oncologist at the University of Utah. The hesitation to rely on the tests is clear from Foundation’s financial numbers. Its revenues from selling tests to practitioners fell last year to $38 million, a 22 percent drop from $49 million in 2015. Foundation received more cash last year from its majority owner Roche, which bought a nearly 60 percent stake in Foundation in 2015 and pays Foundation for R&D and other costs. Its founding CEO Michael Pellini shifted roles earlier this year, with a Roche executive taking over as CEO. Guardant is privately held and does not report sales figures, but officials say they are processing about 20,000 tests a year. It recently raised $360 million, bringing its total to $550 million. Guardant CEO Helmy Eltoukhy acknowledged in a recent interview the “challenge” convincing insurers to cover the tests for cancer patients whose doctors want … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Alex Lash is Xconomy's National Biotech Editor.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dynavax Presents Updated Data for SD-101 in Combination with KEYTRUDA(R) (pembrolizumab) Highlighting an ORR in 7 out of 7 Patients Naive to an Anti-PD-1 or Anti-PD-L1 Therapy Data Presented at 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting BERKELEY, CA–(Marketwired – June 02, 2017) – Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: DVAX) announced the presentation of findings in patients with metastatic melanoma in the dose escalation phase of an ongoing Phase 1b/2 study investigating SD-101, Dynavax’s intratumoral TLR9 agonist, in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada. Results evaluating 19 patients for efficacy and 22 patients for safety were presented in a poster at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in Chicago: In 7 anti-PD-1/L1-naïve patients, SD-101 used in combination with KEYTRUDA resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 100%, with a complete response (CR) rate of 29%. This is a meaningful increase over use of KEYTRUDA alone, which has already shown a 33% ORR, with a 6% CR.(1) In 12 patients with advanced (stage IIIc/IV) melanoma who had previously failed on anti-PD-1 treatment, introduction of SD-101 resulted in tumor shrinkage in 42% of patients, with 17% having a partial response (PR), indicating an anti-tumor immune response generated by SD-101. The combination of SD-101 and KEYTRUDA in this study, mobilized both innate and adaptive immune response in study participants. Tumor shrinkage was observed in non-injected visceral lesions. „Having 7 out of 7 patients naïve to anti-PD-1/L1 treatment responding is very encouraging,” said Antoni Ribas, M.D., Ph.D., of the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, and lead investigator. „These results are supported by tumor shrinkage in patients who had previously progressed on anti-PD-1 treatment and by confirmatory laboratory biomarker assessments in tumor biopsies. If these clinical results are sustained in the ongoing trial, this combination, which mobilizes both innate and adaptive immune responses in patients, could represent an important advancement in immuno-oncology.” SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA generally was well-tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicities of the combination were observed in any dose cohort, and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not identified. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were injection site reactions and transient grade 1 to 2 flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and myalgia. The study also includes biomarker assessments, suggesting that treatment with SD-101 and KEYTRUDA resulted in increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and decreased Th2 in tumor biopsies, consistent with induction of an antitumor immune response. About MEL-01 (KEYNOTE-184) The dose-escalation and expansion study of SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA includes patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable Stage IIIc/IV melanoma. The primary endpoints of the trial are MTD and evaluation of the safety of intratumoral SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA. In addition, the trial is investigating response as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, biomarker assessments and duration of response. Patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies are included. About SD-101 SD-101 is Dynavax’s proprietary, second-generation, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG-C class oligodeoxynucleotide. SD-101 is being studied for its multiple anti-tumor activities in innate immune cells and activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to stimulate T cells specific for antigens released from dying tumor cells. TLR9 agonists such as SD-101 enhance T and B cell responses and provide potent Type 1 interferon induction and maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to antigen-presenting cells. SD-101 is being evaluated in several Phase 1/2 oncology studies to assess its safety and activity.

This is known as the world’s largest clinical cancer conference and it always delivers new results on clinical trials and updated treatments in the field. Not to mention, this conference has the potential to make or break companies in the space, depending on their results. The theme for this year’s conference is making a difference in cancer care with you, which puts emphasis on a more personalized method of treating cancer. This year is expected to see over 30,000 attendees counting among them the world’s best oncologists, researchers and scientists. Many of the abstracts for ASCO have already been released and stocks have moved in anticipation. However, there are still more abstracts that will be released the day of the presentation. 24/7 Wall St. takes a look at the ASCO annual meeting each year and picks out the companies that could have the biggest boom or bust at the conference. Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) is reporting more data on executing on I-O/chemo, and an update on the progress with Keytruda+IDO. Data from Keytruda in combination with epacodastat from Incyte Corp. (NASDAQ: INCY) could be compelling from the Incyte perspective. Keytruda is used in immunotherapy across multiple cancer designations. This particular partnership is being investigated in patients across five tumor types: metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Shares of Merck were trading at $65.21 on Friday, in a 52-week range of $55.10 to $66.80 and with a consensus analyst price target of $69.30. Over the course of the past month, the stock has risen 4%. Incyte shares were last seen at $130.06. The stock has a consensus price target of $146.60 and a 52-week range of $71.75 to $153.15. Over the past month, the stock is up 5%. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) focused on ABT-414 in its abstract, and according to analysts early data looks promising, but they are curious for the update that concerns side effects. ABT-414 is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and only release the potent cytotoxic agent once inside targeted cancer cells. In this case it is targeting glioblastoma or malignant tumors affecting the brain or spine. AbbVie shares were trading at $66.93. The 52-week range is $55.06 to $68.12, and the consensus price target is $72.28. Over the past month, the stock has stayed relatively flat. Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) will be presenting further details on abemaciclib with the MONARCH-2 data in abstract 1000. This study looked at abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy. Shares were trading at $80.43, with a consensus price target of $89.10 and a 52-week range of $64.18 to $86.72. Over the past month, the stock has dropped a little more than 1%. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY) is looking to provide an update on the Opdibo+Yervoy combination. The abstract given by the company focuses on longer-term follow up from the high-profile combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy from the CheckMate-012 study in 1L NSCLC. The efficacy data in the abstract, however, is essentially the same as last year, with updated data to come at the presentation. Shares were trading at $54.75, with a 52-week range of $46.01 to $77.12 and a consensus price target of $57.18. Over the past month, the stock has dropped 2%. 24/7 Wall St. 7 Speculative Biotech and Pharma Stocks That Could Still Double (or More) Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi (NYSE: SNY) are expected to give out an extended cut of data from REGN2810, which focuses on the treatment of advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or in simpler terms skin cancer. The company plans to begin its Phase 3 in NSCLC in the second half, as well as into a registrational study in this rare skin cancer. Shares of Regeneron were trading at $482.55, in a 52-week range of $325.35 to $483.28. The consensus price target is $441.05. Over the past month, the stock has risen 20%. Sanofi shares recently traded at $50.11, with a 52-week range of $36.81 to $50.24 and a consensus analyst target of $51.75. Over past month, the stock has risen 4%.

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were injection site reactions and transient grade 1 to 2 flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and myalgia. The study also includes biomarker assessments, suggesting that treatment with SD-101 and KEYTRUDA resulted in increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and decreased Th2 in tumor biopsies, consistent with induction of an antitumor immune response. About MEL-01 (KEYNOTE-184) The dose-escalation and expansion study of SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA includes patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable Stage IIIc/IV melanoma. The primary endpoints of the trial are MTD and evaluation of the safety of intratumoral SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA. In addition, the trial is investigating response as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, biomarker assessments and duration of response. Patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies are included. About SD-101 SD-101 is Dynavax's proprietary, second-generation, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG-C class oligodeoxynucleotide. SD-101 is being studied for its multiple anti-tumor activities in innate immune cells and activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to stimulate T cells specific for antigens released from dying tumor cells. TLR9 agonists such as SD-101 enhance T and B cell responses and provide potent Type 1 interferon induction and maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to antigen-presenting cells. SD-101 is being evaluated in several Phase 1/2 oncology studies to assess its safety and activity.

Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up PD-1/L1 inhibitors are so-called immune-oncology (IO) drugs that help unleash the body's immune system on cancers. And now five drugmakers -- Merck & Co. Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Roche Holding AG, AstraZeneca PLC, and Pfizer Inc. -- have one on the market. These companies are running hundreds of clinical trials for new uses and combinations of these medicines, and many of these trial results will be revealed at this weekend's American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago.  But the market has yet to reckon with how much this crowding might impact its sky-high expectations for these medicines. Wall Street analysts forecast annual sales of the five big drugs alone to more than double by 2020 from $8.4 billion this year: As of this writing, there were 1,315 clinical trials ongoing for the big five PD-1/L1 medicines, according to clinicaltrials.gov, the U.S. government's repository. And 1,102 of them were open, meaning they may be actively recruiting patients and are thus relatively new -- an indicator of how rapidly the number of trials is expanding. A slide from Merck's annual report suggests the number of trials has roughly doubled over the past year. Merck's lead IO drug Keytruda is being tested across 30 tumor types.  It's important to note these numbers count only U.S. trials -- there are many others going on elsewhere in the world. And many more companies beyond the big five are working on similar medicines. A huge number of these trials overlap. Four different companies are running trials combining their drug and Incyte Corp.'s epacadostat, for example. There's also significant overlap for the drugs already on the market, with three or more IO drugs approved to treat lung and bladder cancers. All this crowding will be bad for drugmakers -- though a potential boon for patients and insurance companies covering their prescriptions. An increasingly fragmented market will drive prices down and leave companies with ever-shorter periods of market exclusivity.  This may ultimately come as a shock to investors in some of these firms, given that not all of Wall Street's sales forecasts reflect this crowding. Estimates for market-leading drugs Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo certainly don't. Don't expect to hear many such warnings over the din of trial results being hyped at this weekend's ASCO. But companies and investors inspired to follow the IO stampede should bear the potential consequences in mind. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Results evaluating 19 patients for efficacy and 22 patients for safety were presented in a poster at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in Chicago: In 7 anti-PD-1/L1-naïve patients, SD-101 used in combination with KEYTRUDA resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 100%, with a complete response (CR) rate of 29%. This is a meaningful increase over use of KEYTRUDA alone, which has already shown a 33% ORR, with a 6% CR.(1) In 12 patients with advanced (stage IIIc/IV) melanoma who had previously failed on anti-PD-1 treatment, introduction of SD-101 resulted in tumor shrinkage in 42% of patients, with 17% having a partial response (PR), indicating an anti-tumor immune response generated by SD-101. The combination of SD-101 and KEYTRUDA in this study, mobilized both innate and adaptive immune response in study participants. Tumor shrinkage was observed in non-injected visceral lesions. "Having 7 out of 7 patients naïve to anti-PD-1/L1 treatment responding is very encouraging," said Antoni Ribas, M.D., Ph.D., of the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, and lead investigator. "These results are supported by tumor shrinkage in patients who had previously progressed on anti-PD-1 treatment and by confirmatory laboratory biomarker assessments in tumor biopsies. If these clinical results are sustained in the ongoing trial, this combination, which mobilizes both innate and adaptive immune responses in patients, could represent an important advancement in immuno-oncology." SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA generally was well-tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicities of the combination were observed in any dose cohort, and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not identified. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were injection site reactions and transient grade 1 to 2 flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and myalgia. The study also includes biomarker assessments, suggesting that treatment with SD-101 and KEYTRUDA resulted in increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and decreased Th2 in tumor biopsies, consistent with induction of an antitumor immune response.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman NeoGenomics Announces Expansion of Immuno-Oncology Profiling Tests /EINPresswire.com/ — FORT MYERS, FL–(Marketwired – June 02, 2017) – NeoGenomics, Inc. (NASDAQ: NEO), a leading provider of cancer-focused genetic testing services, announced today an expansion of its Immuno-Oncology profiling test menu to reflect recent advances in immunotherapy. The Company has expanded its NeoTYPE® cancer profiles to include Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing. TMB is a new genomic biomarker that is designed to predict response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies targeting the PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins. Studies in lung, melanoma and bladder cancers showed that objective response to checkpoint immunotherapy was predicted by the presence of high TMB. TMB tests will be available on a standalone basis, and in combination with the various cancer-specific NeoTYPE® Profiles offered at NeoGenomics. MSI testing is being added to our profiling in response to the FDA’s announcement(1) on May 23rd that Merck’s Keytruda drug was approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as being MSI-high or mismatch repair deficient (MMR). NeoGenomics offers MSI and MMR testing as part of its comprehensive testing services. Dr. Maher Albitar, the Company’s Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer and Director of Research and Development, commented, „Despite the significant success of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, not all patients respond to therapy and there is a need to identify the subset of patients that are more likely to respond. NeoGenomics provides a broad range of cancer immuno-profiling tests, including TMB, MMR, MSI, and PD-L1 expression testing, to more precisely determine which patients are good candidates for immunotherapy. This immuno-profiling is combined with genomic profiling for comprehensive multimodality cancer profiling.” Douglas VanOort, NeoGenomics’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, „This timely expansion of our state-of-the-art testing services will help physicians better identify which patients will respond to new advanced immunotherapies. The FDA’s announcement last week that it has now approved a drug based on a tumor’s biomarkers without regard to the tumor’s original location is a major development in the fight against cancer, and it aligns well with our extensive menu of tests that examine cancer biomarkers. Our combination of immuno-oncology testing and genomic profiling using a variety of advanced test methodologies is a demonstration of our commitment to be a leader in precision medicine.” (1) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Press Release, 5/23/2017, FDA Approves First Cancer Treatment for any Solid Tumor with a Specific Genetic Feature.

(NASDAQ: NEO), a leading provider of cancer-focused genetic testing services, announced today an expansion of its Immuno-Oncology profiling test menu to reflect recent advances in immunotherapy. The Company has expanded its NeoTYPE® cancer profiles to include Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing. TMB is a new genomic biomarker that is designed to predict response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies targeting the PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins. Studies in lung, melanoma and bladder cancers showed that objective response to checkpoint immunotherapy was predicted by the presence of high TMB. TMB tests will be available on a standalone basis, and in combination with the various cancer-specific NeoTYPE® Profiles offered at NeoGenomics. MSI testing is being added to our profiling in response to the FDA’s announcement(1) on May 23rd that Merck’s Keytruda drug was approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as being MSI-high or mismatch repair deficient (MMR). NeoGenomics offers MSI and MMR testing as part of its comprehensive testing services. Dr. Maher Albitar, the Company’s Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer and Director of Research and Development, commented, „Despite the significant success of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, not all patients respond to therapy and there is a need to identify the subset of patients that are more likely to respond. NeoGenomics provides a broad range of cancer immuno-profiling tests, including TMB, MMR, MSI, and PD-L1 expression testing, to more precisely determine which patients are good candidates for immunotherapy. This immuno-profiling is combined with genomic profiling for comprehensive multimodality cancer profiling.” Douglas VanOort, NeoGenomics’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, „This timely expansion of our state-of-the-art testing services will help physicians better identify which patients will respond to new advanced immunotherapies. The FDA’s announcement last week that it has now approved a drug based on a tumor’s biomarkers without regard to the tumor’s original location is a major development in the fight against cancer, and it aligns well with our extensive menu of tests that examine cancer biomarkers. Our combination of immuno-oncology testing and genomic profiling using a variety of advanced test methodologies is a demonstration of our commitment to be a leader in precision medicine.” (1) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Press Release, 5/23/2017, FDA Approves First Cancer Treatment for any Solid Tumor with a Specific Genetic Feature.

Xconomy Xperience EXOME National Regions Channels Events Boston Angel Investors → EXOME all the information, none of the junk | biotech • healthcare • life sciences Want EXOME sent to you daily? Meet the Contributors → Bio Roundup: ASCO Combo Frenzy, Maine’s Free DNA Tests, Sema4 & More Ben Fidler June 2nd, 2017 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  Over the next four days, the Second City will be the center of the biomedical world. The American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting in Chicago brings together thousands of researchers from across the globe to discuss the latest progress in the war against cancer. On tap this year: the crush of immunotherapy drug combinations, the latest in cell therapy, advances in targeted cancer drugs and much more. Xconomy has some prep work to get you ready for ASCO below, along with all the rest of the week’s biotech headlines. Let’s get to it. ASCO PREP WORK —When ASCO kicks off today, immunotherapy combinations—experimental cocktails of drugs that fight tumors by boosting the immune system—will be in the spotlight. But with the frenzy to test as many combinations as possible, experts worry that the field is moving too fast, and that the glut of combination trials is bound to provoke a backlash. —Another ASCO theme to watch: drugs that target tumor mutations, and acceptance of the commercial tests needed to find the right patients for them. Xconomy delved into the hurdles these tests face, and one of the high-profile efforts underway in Maine to help increase their adoption among community doctors. —ASCO will also provide the latest updates on CAR-T cellular immunotherapy. One of the main players, Novartis (NYSE: NVS), posted encouraging early results in a study testing its CAR-T treatment, CTL119, along with blood cancer drug ibrutinib (Imbruvica) in leukemia patients. Novartis will divulge more information from the study at ASCO on Monday. —Last week, the FDA approved Merck’s pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for all tumors with a specific genetic signature—a first for the agency. Speaking at the Precision Medicine World Conference at Duke University, top FDA drug evaluator Janet Woodcock explained how the Merck approval, as well as some other recent decisions, show how the FDA is changing the way it reviews drugs. —A new report from QuintilesIMS (NYSE: Q) took a close look at the rising price of oncology care, and found that the global costs of cancer drugs and supportive therapies rose from $91 billion in 2012 to $113 billion in 2016. —Lastly, The Wall Street Journal reported that Waltham, MA-based Tesaro (NASDAQ: TSRO), one of the cancer drugmakers unveiling data at ASCO this year, is now exploring a sale with a price tag that could top $9 billion. FRESH STARTS —Sema4, a 300-employee genomics startup Eric Schadt has been incubating within the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, officially spun out of the New York institution this week with plans to raise cash to boost its capabilities. —Kevin Bitterman, the founding CEO of Editas Medicine among other companies and a longtime partner at Boston-area venture capital firm Polaris Partners, was named a partner at nearby Atlas Venture. OPIOIDS & CRISPR —According to Reuters, Ohio Attorney General Mike deWine sued five drug makers, blaming them in part for his state’s worsening epidemic of opioid addiction. The five pharmas named in the suit are Purdue Pharma; Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals; a unit of Endo International (NASDAQ: ENDP); Cephalon, a unit of Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE: TEVA); and Allergan (NYSE: AGN). —Stock prices of Editas Medicine (NASDAQ: EDIT), CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP), and Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NTLA) dropped sharply after the publication of a Nature Methods article that described unintended effects stemming from the use of CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology. But as Xconomy noted two years ago, the possibility of “off-target effects” from use of these tools have long been a concern. NEW FDA REVIEWS & APPROVALS —Positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for a Teva migraine drug now put the Israel-based drugmaker on track to file for FDA approval later this year. A rival drug from Amgen is already under FDA review, and Alder Biopharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly are also in the hunt with similar therapies. — Sunnyvale, CA-based Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) won FDA clearance for the da Vinci X Surgical System, the latest iteration of its robotic-assisted surgery platform, and will launch it the U.S. later this year. DEALS & FUNDINGS —Mid-size drug developer Bicycle Therapeutics raised $52 million in a Series B round to bring an experimental cancer therapy into clinical trials. —Menlo Park, CA-based Grail, which is developing a blood test to detect cancer at its earliest stages, announced a merger with Cirina, a China-based company founded by blood diagnostics pioneer Dennis Lo. —Newark, CA-based Protagonist Therapeutics (NASDAQ: PTGX) inked a deal with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) subsidiary Janssen Biotech to develop a drug treating inflammatory bowel disorders such as Crohn’s disease. —ImmunoGen (NASDAQ: IMMU) got $30 million from Sanofi (NYSE: SNY) to amend a 2003 deal and give up its right to co-promote a group of experimental cancer drugs in the U.S.. —Array Biopharma (NASDAQ: ARRY) will get $31.6 million up front in a deal with Ono Pharmaceutical for partial rights to two of the Boulder, CO, biotech’s cancer drugs.

The data showed sustained superior survival outcomes for patients receiving KEYTRUDA (monotherapy) compared to ipilimumab in patients who were treatment-naïve or received one prior line of therapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma. The survival benefit was sustained in patients who completed the planned two years of treatment with KEYTRUDA. These data will be presented in an oral session at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago on Sunday, June 4, from 9:12 to 9:24 a.m. CDT (location:Arie Crown Theater) (Abstract #9504). In the longer-term findings to be presented, treatment with KEYTRUDA was associated with a 30 percent improvement in survival: 50 percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA group (based on a pooled analysis of the two doses studied:10 mg/kg every two weeks or 10 mg/kg every three weeks)(based on a pooled analysis of the two doses studied:n=556) were alive nearly three years (33.9 months) after starting treatment with KEYTRUDA, compared to 39 percent of patients in the ipilimumab group (n=278) (hr:0.70 [95% CI)(hr:0.58-0.86]). In addition, KEYTRUDA nearly doubled the rate of progression-free survival (PFS) at 33.9 months: 31 percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA group were alive and their disease had not progressed, compared to 14 percent of patients in the ipilimumab group. “KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate improved overall survival compared to ipilimumab, and the findings to be presented at ASCO reinforce the benefit of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of advanced melanoma,” said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. The KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) clinical development program includes more than 30 tumor types in more than 500 clinical trials, including more than 300 trials that combine KEYTRUDA with other cancer treatments. Today, KEYTRUDA is approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma in more than 50 countries, including the United States and throughout Europe. “With longer-term follow-up in this study, we are continuing to see superior survival with KEYTRUDA, including in patients whose treatment has concluded,” said Dr. Caroline Robert, head of dermatology at Gustave Roussy, Villejuif and Paris-Sud University Cancer Campus, Grand Paris. “Importantly, these findings also continue to reaffirm the established safety profile for KEYTRUDA.” Key Findings from the KEYNOTE-006 Study KEYNOTE-006 is a global, open-label, randomized, pivotal, phase 3 study evaluating KEYTRUDA compared to ipilimumab in patients with unresectable stage III or IV advanced melanoma who had either not been treated previously (first-line treatment setting) or who had received one prior therapy (in the KEYTRUDA arm 34% received prior therapy; in the ipilimumab arm, 35% received prior therapy). The study randomized 834 patients to receive KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every three weeks, KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every two weeks, or four cycles of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every three weeks. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression; patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. The co-primary endpoints were PFS and OS; secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), duration of response and safety, with an exploratory analysis for health-related quality of life (QoL). Tumor response was assessed at week 12, then every 6 weeks until week 48, then every 12 weeks thereafter per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 by independent, central, blinded radiographic review and investigator-assessed, immune-related response criteria. The findings to be presented at ASCO were based on a pooled analysis of data from patients receiving the two doses of KEYTRUDA (10 mg/kg every two weeks or 10 mg/kg every three weeks; n=556). Analyses of these data continued to show superior OS, PFS and ORR compared to ipilimumab with follow-up of nearly three years (33.9 months). Specifically, long-term OS data showed 50 percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) treatment arm (n=556) were alive at 33.9 months after starting treatment, compared to 39 percent of patients in the ipilimumab arm (n=278) (hr:0.70 [95% CI)(hr:0.58-0.86]). The PFS endpoint showed that 31 percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm were alive and were disease progression-free at 33.9 months, compared to 14 percent of patients receiving ipilimumab (hr:0.56 [95% CI)(hr:0.47-0.67]). ORR, as assessed by investigator, was 42 percent for patients in the KEYTRUDA arm (range:38-46), compared to 16 percent for patients receiving ipilimumab (range:12-21). In patients in the KEYTRUDA arm, the complete response rate was 13 percent (95% CI, 11-16) and the partial response rate was 29 percent (95% CI, 25-33); in patients in the ipilimumab arm, the complete response rate was 3 percent (95% CI, 1-6) and the partial response rate was 14 percent (95% CI, 10-18). The responses achieved continue to be durable, as the median duration of response has not been reached. Further analyses were conducted to assess the outcomes in patients who had completed 94 or more weeks of treatment with KEYTRUDA (n=104/556) and stopped treatment as planned per protocol. After a median follow-up of 9.7 months since stopping treatment, the estimated PFS was 91 percent (95% CI, 80-96). With longer follow-up, adverse events have remained consistent with previously reported safety data. There was one treatment-related death in the KEYTRUDA arm. In patients treated with KEYTRUDA, immune-mediated adverse events observed in more than 2 percent of patients were hypothyroidism (11%), hyperthyroidism (5%), colitis (3%), skin disorders (3%), and pneumonitis (2%). About Melanoma Melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The incidence of melanoma has been increasing over the past four decades – approximately 232,000 new cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2012. In the U.S., melanoma is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed and is responsible for the vast majority of skin cancer deaths. In 2016, an estimated 76,380 people are expected to be diagnosed and an estimated 10,130 people are expected to die of the disease in the U.S. alone. The five-year survival rates for advanced or metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) are estimated to be 15 to 20 percent. About KEYTRUDA [®] (pembrolizumab) Injection KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Studies of KEYTRUDA – from the largest immuno-oncology program in the industry with more than 500 trials – include a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand factors that predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including the exploration of several different biomarkers across a broad range of tumors. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single-dose vial. KEYTRUDA [®] (pembrolizumab)Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may occur in any organ system. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (greater-than or equal to 1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs ipilimumab were fatigue (28% vs 28%), diarrhea (26% with KEYTRUDA), rash (24% vs 23%), and nausea (21% with KEYTRUDA). Corresponding incidence rates are listed for ipilimumab only for those adverse reactions that occurred at the same or lower rate than with KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-002, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 12% of 357 patients with advanced melanoma; the most common (greater-than or equal to 1%) were general physical health deterioration (1%), asthenia (1%), dyspnea (1%), pneumonitis (1%), and generalized edema (1%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 14% of patients; the most common (greater-than or equal to 1%) were dyspnea (1%), diarrhea (1%), and maculopapular rash (1%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs chemotherapy were fatigue (43% with KEYTRUDA), pruritus (28% vs 8%), rash (24% vs 8%), constipation (22% vs 20%), nausea (22% with KEYTRUDA), diarrhea (20% vs 20%), and decreased appetite (20% with KEYTRUDA). Corresponding incidence rates are listed for chemotherapy only for those adverse reactions that occurred at the same or lower rate than with KEYTRUDA. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose.

NEO, +1.04% a leading provider of cancer-focused genetic testing services, announced today an expansion of its Immuno-Oncology profiling test menu to reflect recent advances in immunotherapy. The Company has expanded its NeoTYPE® cancer profiles to include Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing. TMB is a new genomic biomarker that is designed to predict response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies targeting the PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins. Studies in lung, melanoma and bladder cancers showed that objective response to checkpoint immunotherapy was predicted by the presence of high TMB. TMB tests will be available on a standalone basis, and in combination with the various cancer-specific NeoTYPE® Profiles offered at NeoGenomics. MSI testing is being added to our profiling in response to the FDA's announcement(1) on May 23rd that Merck's Keytruda drug was approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as being MSI-high or mismatch repair deficient (MMR). NeoGenomics offers MSI and MMR testing as part of its comprehensive testing services. Dr. Maher Albitar, the Company's Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer and Director of Research and Development, commented, "Despite the significant success of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, not all patients respond to therapy and there is a need to identify the subset of patients that are more likely to respond. NeoGenomics provides a broad range of cancer immuno-profiling tests, including TMB, MMR, MSI, and PD-L1 expression testing, to more precisely determine which patients are good candidates for immunotherapy. This immuno-profiling is combined with genomic profiling for comprehensive multimodality cancer profiling." Douglas VanOort, NeoGenomics' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "This timely expansion of our state-of-the-art testing services will help physicians better identify which patients will respond to new advanced immunotherapies. The FDA's announcement last week that it has now approved a drug based on a tumor's biomarkers without regard to the tumor's original location is a major development in the fight against cancer, and it aligns well with our extensive menu of tests that examine cancer biomarkers. Our combination of immuno-oncology testing and genomic profiling using a variety of advanced test methodologies is a demonstration of our commitment to be a leader in precision medicine."

June 02, 2017 07:00 ET NeoGenomics Announces Expansion of Immuno-Oncology Profiling Tests FORT MYERS, FL--(Marketwired - June 02, 2017) - NeoGenomics, Inc. (NASDAQ: NEO), a leading provider of cancer-focused genetic testing services, announced today an expansion of its Immuno-Oncology profiling test menu to reflect recent advances in immunotherapy. The Company has expanded its NeoTYPE® cancer profiles to include Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing. TMB is a new genomic biomarker that is designed to predict response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies targeting the PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins. Studies in lung, melanoma and bladder cancers showed that objective response to checkpoint immunotherapy was predicted by the presence of high TMB. TMB tests will be available on a standalone basis, and in combination with the various cancer-specific NeoTYPE® Profiles offered at NeoGenomics. MSI testing is being added to our profiling in response to the FDA's announcement(1) on May 23rd that Merck's Keytruda drug was approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as being MSI-high or mismatch repair deficient (MMR). NeoGenomics offers MSI and MMR testing as part of its comprehensive testing services. Dr. Maher Albitar, the Company's Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer and Director of Research and Development, commented, "Despite the significant success of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, not all patients respond to therapy and there is a need to identify the subset of patients that are more likely to respond. NeoGenomics provides a broad range of cancer immuno-profiling tests, including TMB, MMR, MSI, and PD-L1 expression testing, to more precisely determine which patients are good candidates for immunotherapy. This immuno-profiling is combined with genomic profiling for comprehensive multimodality cancer profiling." Douglas VanOort, NeoGenomics' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "This timely expansion of our state-of-the-art testing services will help physicians better identify which patients will respond to new advanced immunotherapies. The FDA's announcement last week that it has now approved a drug based on a tumor's biomarkers without regard to the tumor's original location is a major development in the fight against cancer, and it aligns well with our extensive menu of tests that examine cancer biomarkers. Our combination of immuno-oncology testing and genomic profiling using a variety of advanced test methodologies is a demonstration of our commitment to be a leader in precision medicine."

When asked what his hair and eye color is by an officer, Woods takes a long pause before saying 'I don't know'.  'Mostly brown and fading and brown,' he adds.  He then agrees to submit to a breathalyzer test and slowly walks over to sit in a nearby chair to take it.

Scroll down for video  Jupiter police have released surveillance video showing Tiger Woods (above) in jail attempting to take a breathalyzer test after he was arrested early Monday morning The video shows the 41-year-old golfer barefoot inside of the jail - he appears to be completely disoriented and slightly swaying A few minutes later, a female officer asks the father-of-two to stand up and walk a few steps towards her to take the breathalyzer test, to which he complies.  She instructs him to blow into the test several times, as it appears as though he is confused about how to do so.  'Take a deep breath in and now blow out,' she tells Woods. 'Blow out. Good there you go, keep going keep going.' She then instructs him to take a seat again, but he just continues to stand in front of her for a few moments before she says he can just stand there if he wants to.  He stands there for the next few minutes slightly swaying as his arms are behind his back in handcuffs, before he tries to walk towards the officers in the jail who tell him to keep standing in the same position and to not move. Woods can be heard asking if they can 'take off his two bracelets', as he turns around showing them the handcuffs. The female officer tells the golfer that he has to keep them on for the moment but they will be taken off soon.  Moments later he takes another breathalyzer test and is told again that he can sit down in the chair.  He then agrees to submit to a breathalyzer test and slowly walks over to sit in a nearby chair to take it. While sitting in the chair, he appears to fall asleep briefly as his head is slightly nodding before he leans it completely against the wall A few minutes later, a female officer asks the father-of-two to stand up and walk a few steps towards her to take the breathalyzer test, to which he complies. She instructs him to blow into the test several times, as it appears as though he is confused about how to do so He doesn't move, so the female officer comes to turn him around and lead him back over to the chair that's only a few steps away.    The female officer can be heard telling Woods that he blew .000 on the breathalyzer tests and that it did not detect any alcohol on his breath.  Woods had 'extremely slow and slurred speech' as shown in the disturbing video during his arrest A male officer can be heard asking Woods if he will submit to a urine test for controlled or chemical substances, to which he agrees. Woods then appears as though he's trying to get up from the seat, but the officers tell him that he can remain seated for the moment.  He appears confused as to how he can carry out the task, and asks 'How am I going to hold it?'  Officers then reassure him not to worry and they will get to that eventually and that they have to read him his rights before the 11 minute video ends. On Wednesday, Jupiter police released the shocking video of Woods moments after they found him asleep in his Mercedes Benz with the engine running in the early hours of Monday morning. Jupiter police took off his baseball cap as they administered field sobriety tests At one point he took off his sneakers and placed them under the police car and he was barefoot when trying to walk a straight line In more than an hour and a half of video, Woods is seen swaying, rolling his eyes and falling asleep as police administer field sobriety tests before he was arrested for DUI and taken into police custody. Slurring his words as he tried to answer questions from police, Tiger could barely stand up and kept weaving and bobbing, failing to walk a straight line barefoot after removing his sneakers. Police also released photos of Woods' bashed up $220,000 Mercedes Benz. The 41-year-old golfer had to be woken up by an officer and stated that he did not know where he was after first claiming he had driven from California. His speech was 'extremely slow and slurred' and he failed four field sobriety tests. He was arrested for DUI after failing four sobriety tests. He admitted he had taken prescription drugs He was handcuffed and taken away in the back of police car Woods' Mercedes had two flat tires and 'fresh damage' on the driver's side when cops found him asleep behind the wheel.  Both tire rims on the driver's side of the Mercedes had some small but visible damage, while the front and rear tires on that side were flat. There was also some minor damage to the bumper on the driver's side, and scuffs and scratches on the rear bumper. The passenger side rear taillight was also not working, according to the documents.  Woods failed four field sobriety tests according to the Probable Cause Affidavit, which was obtained by DailyMail.com - which also revealed Woods was on four prescription drugs - although he tested negative for alcohol. Cops Jupiter police have released the radio 'chatter' after discovering Tiger Woods asleep in his Mercedes with the engine running in the wee hours of Monday morning. They have also released photos of the beleaguered golfer's bashed up $220,000. Mercedes Benz Both tire rims on the driver's side of the Mercedes had some small but visible damage, while the front and rear tires on that side were flat Woods failed four field sobriety tests according to the Probable Cause Affidavit, obtained by DailyMail.com - which also revealed Woods was on  prescription drugs  The passenger side rear taillight was also not working, according to police documents The 41-year-old golfer had to be woken up by an officer and stated that he did not know where he was after first claiming he had driven from California The affidavit states that at 2:03am, Eldrick T. Woods was approached by a member of the Jupiter Police Department, who found him wearing his seat belt while sound asleep at the wheel of his $222,000 Mercedes. The star's car was idling in the middle of Military Trail about one mile from police headquarters, a deserted stretch of road at night but an extremely busy traffic artery during the day. Both his brake lights and flashers were on. After he was woken by cops, Woods - who was alone in the car - told them he had no idea where he was, according to the paperwork. 'I asked Woods where he was going to which he stated he did not know, he just likes to drive,' the arresting officer's affidavit states. Another officer said that Woods was falling asleep even after police had come to investigate his car.  There was also some minor damage to the bumper on the driver's side, and scuffs and scratches on the rear bumper Dashcam footage shows police stopping at Woods' car at the side of the road The golfing pro was ordered to get out of the car by Jupiter cops who asked him to perform sobriety tests  The affidavit states Woods was struggling to keep upright and was 'swaying and nearly lost his balance' when he got out the car The golfer later stated 'he was coming from LA California from golfing,' reads the report. 'Woods stated that he did not know where he was. Woods had changed the story of where he was was going and where he was coming from.' He then asked 'how far from his house he was,' according to the affidavit. When asked again where he was coming from and heading to, he told police he was leaving LA and 'that he was on his way down to Orange County.'  Wearing athletic shorts and a t-shirt, Woods was actually driving south, away from his home on Jupiter Island, the report notes. After a fellow cop, who was interviewing the suspect, returned to his car, he observed 'the driver fell asleep with his eyes closed and his head up against the headrest.'  Woods was described as cooperative and confused at first in the reports, which goes on to reveal that he agreed to a breathalyzer despite earlier reports. Wearing athletic shorts and a t-shirt, Woods was actually driving south, away from his home on Jupiter Island, according to police, who were not aware of what happened to the tires The affidavit also states that there were no odors coming from Woods or the car, this also despite earlier reports claiming that Woods' breath smelled like liquor according to one officer on the scene. Police say that when he exited his car, he was struggling to keep upright and was 'swaying and nearly lost his balance.' He leaned down to tie his shoes, resting his foot on the police patrol car, and 'nearly lost his balance.' 'I asked Woods if he wished to takeoff his shoes. Woods removed his shoes and left them under the front end of my patrol vehicle,' the officer said in the report. Woods appeared confused and seemed to struggle during the sobriety tests. At one point, when Woods was asked to say the alphabet backwards to check if he might be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, he instead offered to 'recite the entire national anthem backwards.' 'When asked if he understood the directions he stated, "yes, recite the entire national anthem backwards." Only after the instructions were repeated did he eventually get it right.  Woods was described as cooperative and confused at first in the reports, which goes on to reveal that he agreed to a breathalyzer and blew .000 One officer said that Woods was falling asleep even after police had come to investigate his car Eldrick T. Woods was approached by a member of the Jupiter Police Department, who found him wearing his seat belt while sound asleep at the wheel of his pricey Mercedes seadan seen in better days 'After several times of explaining the instructions he competed the task correctly,' the officer said in the report. Woods was also asked to perform a Walk & Turn first according to the affidavit, but 'could not maintain starting position,' 'missed heel to toe each time,' 'stepped off line several times' and 'used arms for balance.' Woods also 'stopped walking to steady self' at one point notes the report. He next was asked to perform a One Leg Stand, and was unable to raise his leg off the ground six inches, placing his foot down 'several times' while he tried to complete the test. The Finger To Nose seemed to confuse Woods, who despite having the instructions explained to him multiple times and claiming he understood what was being asked of him failed to complete the task as ordered according to the report. Woods also did not complete the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus as he 'did not follow the stimulus.' In total, six members of law enforcement were involved in the arrest, five of whom were on the scene of the incident at some point on Monday.  'Based on all my observations, Woods SFSTs, and statements made by Woods, I believed I had probably cause to arrest and charge Woods with DUI.' The golf pro was placed in handcuffs, placed under arrest and transported to the station where at 4am, a little less than two hours after the arrest, Woods was observed by one of the officers on the scene for 20 minutes prior to submitting to a breathalyzer. The affidavit notes that Woods' speech was 'slow, sluggish, very slurred' and his attitude was described as 'sluggish, sleepy, unable to walk alone.' Scene: The 41-year-old golfer had to be woken up by an officer and stated that he did not know where he was after first claiming he had driven from California (site of Woods' DUI arrest above) Bad news: The Probable Cause Affidavit from Tiger Woods' DUI arrest reveals that the golfer was asleep at the wheel when he was approached early Monday (Woods above in March) Woods was 'cooperative as much as possible' but 'very droopy, extremely sleepy' and had trouble keeping his eyes open.  The breathalyzer was agreed to the report notes, and the results were explained to Woods after he blew a .000 twice in the span of three minutes. He then agreed to the urine test, which was drawn at 4:40 am according to the report, and was read his rights. The results of which have not been released at the time. VICODIN Vicodin is a powerful painkiller prescribed for moderate to severe pain. It contains a mix of hydrocodone (an opioid) and acetaminophen (a less potent painkiller, like Tylenol, that accentuates the effects of hydrocodone). Hydrocodone can slow or stop breathing. Too much acetaminophen can damage the liver. The FDA warning for Vicodin says it 'may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery; patients should be cautioned accordingly.' Users are warned not to take Vicodin if: - they have taken a MAO inhibitor in the last 14 days - they have recently taken a sedative - they have a history of alcohol problems  The affidavit, which also reveals that Woods was on four prescription drugs - Soloxex [sic], Vicodin, Torix and Vioxx. The affidavit notes that Woods has not taken Vioxx this year.    Woods refused however to complete the question and answer section of the form, which involves a mix of general questions about the current date and time along with personal questions about physical aliments or any prescription drugs an individual is taking at the time.  In the Notice to Appear, Officers state that there was no indication of alcohol influence during Woods' arrest, but under drug influence marked 'unknown.' Woods, who occupation is listed as 'athlete,' is facing a traffic misdemeanor for his driving under the influence arrest and will make his first appearance in court later this summer. That appearance is a mandatory one for Woods, who must be in attendance on that date according to the notice he received on Monday. He could be facing up to six months in prison if convicted on the charge, and be ordered to pay $1,000 in fines while performing up to 50 hours of community service. Woods could also walk free if test show he took no more than the recommended dosage of his medication, which was prescribed by a medical professional. It was hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations. Woods' first knee surgery occurred back in 1994 while he was still in college, with the teenager having a benign tumor removed from his knee. His Achilles injuries meanwhile all came around the same time his career began to spiral back in 2008, with the four operations he underwent occurring between then and 2012.  Not noted on the report is the fact that Woods has also had four procedures done on his back as well, the most recent being the fusion procedure he underwent in April.  Performing under pressure: After failing four field sobriety tests, Woods did manage to successfully recite the national anthem backwards (report above) Family: Wodds and ex-wife Elin Nordegren share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7 (Woods and Nordegren with Sam in 2009 above) 'The surgery went well, and I'm optimistic this will relieve my back spasms and pain,' Woods said shortly after the operation.  'When healed, I look forward to getting back to a normal life, playing with my kids, competing in professional golf and living without the pain I have been battling so long.' His most recent blog post was just six day ago, and the typically laconic Woods wrote in depth about how happy he was with his surgery and his excitement about a possible return to golf. 'It has been just over a month since I underwent fusion surgery on my back, and it is hard to express how much better I feel. It was instant nerve relief. I haven't felt this good in years,' wrote Woods.  He went on to say that while it was a difficult decision to make, he ultimately agreed to the surgery so he could 'have a life with his kids.' VIOXX Woods said he has not taken this in the past year. Vioxx was withdrawn from the US market in 2004 over safety concerns that it increases risk of heart attack and stroke. A major report published by the journal Lancet found that 88,000 Americans had heart attacks from taking Vioxx, and 38,000 of them died. It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (known medically as rofecoxib) that was once prescribed to treat osteoarthritis, acute pain conditions and period pains. Last year, manufacturer Merck & Co had to pay $830 million to resolve a class action suit with shareholders. The company has reserved $4.85 billion to settle legal claims with patients. Here is a brief timeline: - May 1999: First approved by the FDA in 1999, Vioxx was sold by Merck & Co. - December 1999: within months, a safety panel found that scores of patients had suffered serious heart problems or died - double the rate of those on a similar drug with different properties. - In the ensuing years, numerous studies found similar issues - but in that time, 20 million Americans took the drug - September 2004: Merck withdraws the drug after a large study found the clearest evidence that Vioxx increases the risk of heart attacks Woods then wrote about his career moving forward, stating: 'As for returning to competitive golf, the long-term prognosis is positive. My surgeon and physiotherapist say the operation was successful. It's just a matter of not screwing up and letting it fuse. I'm walking and doing my exercises, and taking my kids to and from school. All I can do is take it day by day. There's no hurry.' He added: 'But, I want to say unequivocally, I want to play professional golf again.' The golfer closed out the post as if it would be his last for some time, writing: 'That's about it for now. Have a great summer.'  Should he return, Woods would still be in striking distance of the two biggest PGA records, with his 79 wins just three shy of Sam Snead's record 82 and his 14 Majors four shy of record-holder Jack Nicklaus. Not one to weigh in on the personal matters of his fellow athletes, Nicklaus was forced to speak about Woods' situation due to the fact that he had a previously scheduled press conference on Tuesday afternoon ahead of the  Memorial Tournament, which he founded over four decades ago. When asked if he wanted to comment, Nicklaus responded: 'Not really.' He then added however: 'I feel bad for Tiger. Tiger's a friend. He needs all our help.'  Woods also owns a restaurant near his home in Jupiter, The Woods. The establishment offers classic American fare and drinks along with a lengthy list of bourbons, ryes, cognacs and cigars.    He released a book this past March as well,   Forbes estimated Woods' net worth to be $740million in 2016, with the golfer making $45.5million just that year in endorsements despite his lackluster play on the links.  Time will now tell if any of those big name sponsors, including Nike and Rolex, opt out of their relationship with the golfer.  Woods resigned with Nike back in 2013, but the company stopped making golf equipment last year, meaning that the athlete is being paid to wear their clothing. Work in progress: It was also hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations (surgeries above) Rough time: Woods had difficulty signing his name (top left) and then writing in print (bottom right) on his Notice to Appear at 7:30am on Monday morning  And that is something he will not be doing for some time after his surgery.  That personal fortune meanwhile comes after Woods handed over $750million to first wife Elin Nordegren in their 2010 divorce. The couple share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7, with the exact details of their arrangement unknown due to a seal on the court documents, It is unclear if this arrest might impact the agreement between Woods and his ex-wife. Woods apologized for his actions in a statement late Monday, while claiming that he had not been drinking prior to his arrest and believed that he had suffered a reaction to a prescription medication.

The US-based pharma group said its RANGE study of Cyramza (ramucirumab) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) - the most common form of bladder cancer - could support possible filings next year. The trial is the first to show improved PFS compared to chemotherapy in mUC patients who have previously been treated with a first-line platinum-based regimen said Lilly, but it thinks it will have to demonstrate a benefit on overall survival to be able to file for approval of Cyramza in this indication, setting back a possible approval into 2019. If all goes according to plan however, Cyramza - a VEGF receptor 2 inhibitor that works by blocking blood vessel growth in tumours - could join the increasing list of immuno-oncology drugs that are starting to transform the treatment of bladder cancer after decades of stagnation. To date Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) have been approved for first- and second-line treatment of mUC, while three other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors - Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab), Merck KGaA/Pfizer's Bavencio (avelumab), and AstraZeneca's Imfinzi (durvalumab) - are licensed as second-line therapies for this type of cancer. Roche had a setback after a confirmatory trial for Tecentriq in this indication failed, but overall the new agents have achieved compelling results in mUC. Adding to its potential RANGE included some patients who were previously treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting it could become a key part of the emerging medicine armamentarium in bladder cancer adding another line of attack along with immuno-oncology and chemotherapy agents. "While there have been several recent advancements to treat this type of cancer, most patients progress despite treatment with existing therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors," said Lilly in a statement on the data. The new indication would be a big boost for Cyramza, which has been a big earner for Lilly since its launch in 2014 but saw sales in the US for indications such as lung cancer fall back as a result of a switch to immuno-oncology drugs last year and pricing pressures. It's still posting good growth overall however, bringing in $614m last year and up 60% thanks to big gains in Japan in the stomach cancer category. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

If I had been asked how far back that went, after some thought, I would have suggested sometime in the mid- to late-70s after Michael Killeen took over as chief executive of the IDA. There have been many announcements in the last few weeks involving pharmaceutical companies investing in new jobs here, including Merck’s MSD in Cork and Carlow. I was pleasantly surprised the other day to discover that Abbott Laboratories has been in Ireland since 1946. It now has six manufacturing sites in Ireland and four other offices located in various parts of Ireland. It is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world. It has been a major success story. So much for those folk who ridiculed Ireland’s efforts at attracting foreign direct investment by suggesting they came only for 10 years until as the critics would insist “they used up the grants and then vanished”. Abbott is not the only company which has been in Ireland contributing to the economy for decades rather than just years. Abbott was back in the news again the other day with the announcement that Abbott intends to invest around €10m in its Irish nutritional devices business in Sligo. All of this is good news for the economy, for its employees and, of course, for those companies which supply goods and services to the company. However, it’s not just the investment of cash that is important, although that always helps. It’s another vote of confidence in an Ireland outside of Dublin. As the IDA said: “Multinational companies contribute significantly to Ireland in terms of direct employment, capital spend, and developing Ireland’s skill base.” Of course, they also pay taxes. The strength of the contribution of these multinational companies was a key factor in our ability to withstand the worst effects of the recent recession when much of the Irish domestic economy was seriously hammered. Indeed, we should not underestimate that contribution of the multinationals, even if at times little incidentals like Apple’s €13bn in back-taxes EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has ruled it pay back to the Irish Government leads to serious debate. Multinational companies accounted for about the vast bulk of all corporation taxes collected by the Government. Economist John FitzGerald estimates the multinationals accounted for 16% of total employment over the years 2012 to 2015. While the tax take from such companies, particularly coupled with the tax take from its employees, makes for a considerable part of the cash that we require to fund the day to day running of the economy, its importance to the economy has in fact lessened. That is to be welcomed as ultimately we must be able to support ourselves. Yet, foreign direct investment is still mobile investment. Its objective is to find a location where it can consistently make money. It will not establish an operation in any country without considerable thought. Likewise, it will not leave a location on a whim, nor will it do it lightly. But it will pull out its investment if makes sense for it to do so. Abbott has been in Ireland for over 70 years and has expanded its operations. This proves that such companies can and will become part of the local economy and remain so for a very long time. However, it makes it even more important we establish our own sustainable industrial base in what is an ever and rapidly changing global economy. Ultimately, we should not be totally dependent on decision makers who have no vested interest in the sustainable success of the Irish economy.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Veterinary Vaccines Market Research Report: Market Trends and Key Developments Veterinary Vaccines Market Global Veterinary Vaccines Market: Overview Veterinary vaccines often prove themselves to be live-savers for animals against diseases that are generally fatal or leave them impaired or handicapped. Veterinary vaccines thus offer protection to animals similar to the way humans are vaccinated against potentially incurable diseases. The way veterinary vaccines work may be different than human vaccines however. It is often encouraged for pet owners to vaccinate their pets regularly as it is much cheaper than opting for the treatment of a sick animal. It also helps reduce the transmission of germs and bacteria within animals and thus ensures a healthier environment for all animals and pets in an area. In the case of livestock, vaccination promotes a healthier output and prevents the transmission of harmful microorganisms to humans upon consumption of meat of animal products. The common diseases for which pets and livestock are vaccinated include brucellosis, pinkeye, E. coli, and rotavirus. The report on the global veterinary vaccines market offers a descriptive analysis of the factors that have been – and will be – responsible for the progress rate of the market. These factors are dissected based on the various segments available in the market for study and player diversity. The report uses all current and recent data to effectively pinpoint the situation the global veterinary vaccines market is in currently and what it will look like in the near future. The analysis of the global veterinary vaccines market is performed using tried and tested industry standards such as Porter’s Five Forces analysis and the SWOT analysis. The report also provides a highly in-depth view of the competitive landscape of the global veterinary vaccines market and its predicted future tense. Global Veterinary Vaccines Market: Trends and Opportunities: The primary driver boosting the global veterinary vaccines market is the growing consumption of animal products across the world. With a large human population associated with the demand for dairy, meat, fish, and eggs, it is necessary for the animal husbandry industry to spruce up its vaccination policies and rates. In the case of pets, the amount of pet owners in the world has also gone up considerably over the past few years. Market research points to an even higher number of pet owners by 2024. At the same time, the expenditure made by each pet owner for the health and happiness of their pets has risen significantly, further pointing to a progressively inclined rate of veterinary vaccination. The problem of high restrictions still persists in the global veterinary vaccines market as players are often barred from commercial entry due to the high market standards, regulatory restriction, and the high cost of research and development efforts. Many governments have stepped in, providing incentives and awareness initiatives for the sake of getting a larger population of the domesticated animal kingdom to be protected from harm. This exhaustive report includes 24 data tables and 50 figures to give readers a 360° view of the Veterinary Vaccines Market. Browse through this 185-page report to know what factors will shape the market during the period 2016-2024 www.transparencymarketresearch.com/veterinary-vaccines-ma… Global Veterinary Vaccines Market: Region-wise Outlook: The global veterinary vaccines market is expected to reach US$11.4 bn by 2024, after being projected at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2016 to 2024. Regionally speaking, a large chunk of this current growth rate is attributed to the high demand shown by North America and its growing populations of pet owners and livestock. The emerging economies from Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East are simultaneously showing a very high growth rate in their consumption of veterinary vaccines owing to greater awareness and an increasing demand for animal products.

Landgraf as Next President June 2, 2017 by Washington College News Service Leave a Comment CHESTERTOWN—The Washington College Board of Visitors and Governors today announced the appointment of Kurt M. Landgraf as the next President of the college. President-elect Landgraf, who was determined to be an exceptional and highly qualified candidate during the Board’s most recent national search in 2015, will begin his tenure July 1. Kurt M. Landgraf – New President of Washington College “Throughout his remarkable career, Kurt Landgraf has set himself apart from his peers as an exceptional leader and an exemplar of the values we seek to instill in our students, faculty, and community here at Washington College,” said Board Chair H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. “We believe his collaborative leadership style, his ability to craft ambitious and integrated strategies, and his operational experience will be an asset to Washington College. “We are thrilled that such an exceptional candidate was available to lead our College in support of the groundbreaking work of our students and faculty,” Culp continued. “I am deeply honored by the opportunity to join the Washington College community, and to continue the work of my predecessors in providing students with the best possible education,” said Landgraf. “To join the ranks of this storied and historic institution is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I’m certain that by working with the faculty, staff, student body, and board, as well as others in the community, we will be able to accomplish extraordinary things. And while new leadership always brings change, rest assured that President Sheila Bair’s exceptional work to address the national student debt crisis and to launch a comprehensive campaign will not only continue, but I hope will be energized and invigorated.” Landgraf is well known to both the Washington College Board of Visitors and Governors and the most recent presidential search committee. In 2015, that search committee— proportionally comprised of faculty, senior staff, and board members—began its national search for a new president, considering nearly 400 candidates and seriously vetting nearly 60 contenders. During that process, Landgraf proved himself to be an outstanding candidate. Landgraf comes to Washington College with a decades-long résumé as a senior executive with DuPont (including serving as Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chairman of DuPont Europe Middle East and Africa, Chairman and CEO of DuPont Pharmaceutical Company and CEO of DuPont Merck Company), and a 13-year tenure as President and CEO of ETS, one of the world’s leading providers of measurement programs and evaluations for schools, including both the K-12 and higher education communities. Currently, Landgraf serves as a member of the boards of directors for Corning Incorporated and the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation. He has also served as President of the National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and Science, and was nominated, confirmed, and served as Vice Chairman of the Higher Education Commission for the State of New Jersey, the state’s governing body for higher education institutions. “Kurt Landgraf’s vision of cooperative co-governance will be a strong foundation from which to work together as a campus, and he has already shown a willingness to embrace the Washington College strategic plan. I’m certain his leadership will lend our campus and community essential guidance, and assist us in every facet of operations, from helping fight the national student debt crisis, to accomplishing our unprecedented fundraising goals as part of our Forge a Legacy campaign,” said Jonathan McCollum, Chair of the Washington College Faculty Council and Chair of the Department of Music. “It is a pleasure to welcome President-elect Landgraf to campus, and I look forward to working with him to continue instilling in our students the core values of Washington College: critical thinking, effective communication and deep, abiding moral courage.” “Kurt is an exceptional leader who has an impressive record of success in higher education and the corporate world. At ETS, he did a remarkable job advancing its social mission, reimagining the future of the organization, and building a strong organization and culture,” said Robert Murley, who served as Chair of the ETS Board of Directors for four years during President Landgraf’s tenure as CEO, and who has been an ETS board member for nearly 18 years. “As a result of his leadership and his commitment to diversity and to ensuring fairness and equity in assessment, promising students have been able to realize their dreams to attend college and graduate school regardless of their financial circumstances. Washington College is fortunate to have him as its next president.” About Washington College Founded in 1782, Washington College is the tenth oldest college in the nation and the first chartered under the new Republic. It enrolls approximately 1,450 undergraduates from more than 35 states and a dozen nations. With an emphasis on hands-on, experiential learning in the arts and sciences, and more than 40 multidisciplinary areas of study, the College is home to nationally recognized academic centers in the environment, history, and writing.

Rising Pool of Respiratory Disorder Patients to Fuel Market’s Growth “The rising pool of patients suffering from respiratory disorders is having the most prominent impact on the global market for pulmonary drug delivery devices,” states an analyst at TMR. The alarming rise in air pollution and the increasing number of smokers, worldwide, are adding substantially to the already worsened situation of COPD patient pool, leading to a remarkable surge in the demand for these devices. Analysts expect this scenario to remain so over the period of forecast, resulting in a high demand pace for these devices. In addition to this, the market is anticipated to benefit from the increasing research and development in the treatments for asthma and COPD in the near future. However, the imminent patent expiry of blockbuster drugs and several regulatory hurdles may limit the growth of this market to some extent in the years to come, notes the research study.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Vaccines market based on technology and indication captures the global market very fast | AMR Vaccines Market According to a new report published by Allied Market Research, titled, „Vaccines Market by Technology, Indication, and End Use: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2017-2023”, the global vaccines market was valued at $31,216 million in 2016, and is projected to reach $65,148 million by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 10.9% from 2017 to 2023. The conjugate vaccines segment accounted for more than one-third of the global market in 2016. Vaccination administration employs antigenic components, which aid in strengthening an individuals immune system. This process assists in development of adaptive immunity to a pathogen, and thereby prevents morbidity from infection. Vaccination plays an important role in the prevention strategies of infectious diseases adopted by several countries. Demand for vaccines is high in countries susceptible to epidemic diseases, contributing to the significant market growth. Access Full Summary at: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/vaccines-market High prevalence of diseases requiring administration of vaccines and emerging vaccines for different infectious diseases, such as, HIV, dengue, and Zika virus infection, and different technologies employed in the development of effective vaccines are expected to drive growth of the global vaccines market in the future. In addition, focus of governments on immunization programs aids in creating awareness among people about safety and availability of vaccines. However, it takes approximately 11-12 years for a single vaccine to be introduced in the commercial market. This prolonged procedure of vaccine development restrains the development of new vaccines, thereby hampering the market growth. In addition, high monetary inputs in the development of vaccines decrease their adoption, limiting the growth further. The pneumococcal disease segment is anticipated to maintain its dominance during the forecast period, accounting for maximum market revenue throughout forecast period, owing to the fact that Streptococcus pneumoniae (a pathogenic bacteria) is the leading cause of infectious diseases globally. In addition, high prevalence of these diseases in pediatric and geriatric population and growth in demand for varied serotype coverage propel growth of this segment. However, human papilloma virus (HPV) indication is growing at the highest CAGR of 12.4% from 2017 to 2023, as it is the most common type of sexually transmitted disease, specifically in women, which causes cervical cancer, the fourth most common type of cancer prevailing in women. The pediatric vaccine segment dominated the end use market, accounting for about half of the total share in 2016, due to the high immunization rate among infants and adolescents. Moreover, active government participation for amending vaccination to all children has augmented the market growth. Key Findings of the Vaccines Market: 1. The recombinant vaccines segment is anticipated to grow at the highest growth rate during the forecast period. 2. The human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines segment is expected to grow at a rapid rate, registering a CAGR of 12.4% from 2017 to 2023. 3. North America dominated the global vaccines market, accounting for maximum share of overall market in 2016. 4. Asia-Pacific is exhibited to grow at a high growth rate of 12.0%, owing to the high demand for vaccination in densely populated area, such as India and China. 5. The pediatric vaccines segment generated highest revenue in 2016, and is expected to continue its dominance in the future as well. 6. The traveler vaccines segment is expected to exhibit high growth rate during forecast period, attributed by international travelers and mandated vaccination for immigrants before traveling. Asia-Pacific has witnessed highest growth rate for vaccines, and is expected to continue this trend. This is attributed to increase in sizeable population, rise in incidence of HIV & cancer cases, healthcare infrastructural development, and huge market potential, owing to the new arrival of preventive, therapeutic, and adult vaccines by key players focusing on the emerging markets. Key players operating in the vaccines market have adopted product launch as their key developmental strategy, and focus on launching innovative products to cater to the consumer requirements and strengthen their market share.

Anti Infectives are the agents which inferring with different mechanisms such as DNA synthesis, cell wall synthesis or by slowing the growth of infective agents. To prevent the rapidly spreading infectious disease, anti-infective vaccines are the most prevailing health measure taken by healthcare system. Due to rising resistance to antibiotics, majorly companies are focusing on developing vaccines for infectious disease. Hepatitis (Recombivax HB, Havrix, Engerix-B), influenza (Fluarix, Fluzone, FluMist), polio (IPOL), malaria (RTSS), tuberculosis (BCG) are the some examples of anti-infective vaccines available in market.

According to International OCD Foundation, approximately 2-3 million adults are living with OCD in the United States. The International OCD Foundation also states that nearly 500,000 American children have OCD. A large number of cases of OCD go unreported as many people are not aware that there is any such specific disease. Also, many people hide their illness in order to avoid embarrassment. Global Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Market: Overview Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be defined as an anxiety disorder that is characterized by unreasonable and uncontrollable thoughts and fears that lead an individual to perform repetitive behaviors. Obsessive-compulsive disorder compels a person to get stuck on a particular thought or fear. For example, a person afraid of contamination may wash his/her hands repetitively in an order to make sure his/her hands are clean. Likewise, a person may check a gas stove multiple times to be sure that it’s really turned off. Usually people affected with obsessive-compulsive disorder possess both obsessions as well as compulsions; however, in many cases individuals may have either obsessions or compulsions. Some common thoughts that usually pop up in mind of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder are fear of being contaminated by germs or dirt, excessive thinking about religious or moral ideas, superstitions, having things orderly or symmetrical, doubts that stove is turned off and thoughts of hurting oneself or others. These thoughts cause people with obsessive-compulsive disorder to perform actions like repeatedly checking of things such as locks and switches; repeatedly reciting certain words with intent to reduce anxiety, ordering or arranging things and accumulating wastes like newspaper, wine bottles or empty food containers. The exact causes of OCD are not known, however, some possible reasons may include differences in brain structure and genetic factors. The treatment involves psychotherapy as well as medication. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a specific type of psychotherapy that has been useful in treating people with OCD. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) teaches a person multiple ways of thinking, reacting and handling a particular situation. Most commonly used medications for treating OCD include antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications. A child suffering from PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections) is prescribed antibiotics for treating strep infections and SSRI medicines (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine). View Report- www.transparencymarketresearch.com/obsessive-compulsive-d… Global Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Market: Regional Outlook Geographically, the market for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World (RoW).

Technavio analysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global HAP drugs market: Unmet demand due to lack of available treatment for MDR microorganisms Lack of proper treatment options available for the treatment of HAP because of MDR microorganisms is a major challenge for the healthcare providers. MDR microorganisms are those microorganisms that have developed antimicrobial drugs resistance. The resistance among various microorganisms to various antimicrobial drugs has emerged as a serious threat to public health across the globe. Sapna Jha, a lead infectious and rare diseases research analyst at Technavio, says, “VAP patients have a very high chance of getting affected from MDR. There is a lack of proper treatment for these microorganisms; however, this can prove to be a big threat for the general population.” Growing cases of surgeries Nosocomial infections are one of the major challenges faced by the healthcare industry today. HAP is the second major type of nosocomial infections after urinary tract infections. The disease has the highest mortality rate of all other nosocomial infections and the rate ranges between 35% and 50%. “Organ transplant is done with the aim of restoring the functions of the body. Organ transplantation is many times the only treatment left at the end stage of organ failures such as heart or liver failure. The organ transplant process has rapidly increased during the last few years,” adds Sapna. The inadequate healthcare infrastructure in the developing countries Inadequate healthcare infrastructure and lack of proper hygiene are some of the major problems faced by the healthcare system of the developing countries. As a result, healthcare-associated infection is a point of concern for the developing countries. In most of the hospitals in the developing countries, infection control procedure and other hygienic necessities get influenced due to several factors such as poor infrastructure, lack of financial resources and overcrowded hospitals.

recently published a report on the  North America Hormone Replacement Therapy Market  which estimates the market to grow from USD 6.77 billion from 2016 to USD 9.55 billion with a high CAGR of 7.12%. In women, after menopause, there is a fall in hormone levels wBlood Pressure Mhich leads to uncomfortable conditions like hot flashes, vaginal dryness and sometimes osteoporosis and heart conditions and also reduces the risk of diabetes by 30% in younger women. HRT's main purpose is to replace hormones that your body can no longer produce which is one of the reasons why it is the most efficient treatment for menopause. Estrogen Therapy is mainly recommended to women who have had a hysterectomy and experiencing the menopause symptoms. This is mainly due to the fact that though Estrogen helps during pregnancy, it also controls how your body controls calcium and raises good cholesterol in the blood. Estrogen/Progesterone/Progestin Therapy is prescribed to women who still have their uterus owing to the fact that taking Estrogen without Progesterone raises the risk of cancer of the endometrium, the lining of the uterus.

Few factors analysed in the section are growing awareness on post-menopausal hazards, reimbursement policies, novel formulations, rise in unmet medical needs which require the employment of hormone therapy as well as benefits like lower risk of fractures. However, based on research studies, hormone replacement therapy can cause severe side effects, such as bleeding, breast tenderness or enlargement, bloating, mood changes, headaches, and nausea, risk of breast cancer, heart disease, and stroke.

Further, women with high susceptibility to coronary diseases are advised to stay away from hormone replacement therapy thereby decreasing the size of target audience.

billion with a high CAGR of 6.14%. There are many ways that normal cells in the lungs change into cancer. Research into how cancer develops has led to therapies that target cancer in some very specific ways. To understand targeted therapies, it helps to look at how cells work and how they can change into cancer. Until the mid-2000s, treatment options were mostly limited to surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Now, people diagnosed with lung cancer often have newer, more personalized treatment options. The goal of targeted therapy is to accurately target your individual tumour, which hopefully leads to more effective treatments and less side effects. The purpose of this brochure is to help you understand targeted therapies and what they mean for you. Targeted therapies work in similar ways in all cancers but certain drugs are more effective in certain subtypes of lung cancer.

The company has grown from the entrepreneurial dream of founder and President, Allan Evora to a Southeast leader in control systems integration that's completed over 800 projects in industries as diverse as utility-scale solar farms, data centers, and biogas plants. Among its recent accomplishments, Affinity Energy won the 2017 Minority Business Crown of Enterprise award (http://www.affinityenergy.com/charlotte-crowns-enterprise-mbe-award/) and Grant Thornton 2016 North Carolina 100 (http://www.affinityenergy.com/control-system-integrator-affinity-energy-north-carolinas-top-100/). "Much has changed over 15 years, but one thing has not," said Evora. "We're still absolutely and unequivocally dedicated to our customers and their energy projects. We couldn't have reached this milestone without their continued support." Evora originally founded Affinity Energy in 2002 as a systems integration firm involved in the design and installation of electrical power management systems (EPMS) for a wide variety of industries. The company took advantage of the switch to digital during the transformation of how electrical swtichgear and power reliability equipment were monitored, controlled, and protected. Initially attracting companies such as Bank of America, CREE, and Merck, the company formed the basis of its expertise in power and energy. Since then, they've adjusted their focus to include mission critical facilities, but have maintained focus on power and energy systems. Many successes integrating systems at manufacturing plants and critical facilities resulted in the quick growth of the company's size and services.

Under the license, Surface will be able to use the OmniRat®, OmniMouse® and OmniFlic® platforms to discover fully human mono- and bispecific antibodies. Ligand is eligible to receive annual platform access payments, development and regulatory milestone payments, and tiered royalties for each product incorporating an OmniAb antibody. Surface will be responsible for all costs related to the programs. “This agreement allows Surface Oncology to join a growing roster of companies with access to OmniAb, our novel transgenic rodent technology that goes beyond a transgenic mouse technology, adding a transgenic rat and a separate transgenic rat with fixed light chain antibodies to enable bispecific antibody discovery,” said John Higgins, Chief Executive Officer of Ligand. “This is the second OmniAb partnership announced within a week, further demonstrating the significant partnership interest that exists for this important, novel technology.” About Surface Oncology Surface Oncology is an immuno-oncology company developing next-generation immunotherapies targeting the tumor microenvironment. Surface’s novel cancer immunotherapies are designed to treat tumors that are unresponsive to currently available therapies, and would be used in combination with currently available therapies to enhance the overall efficacy of the treatment. The Company has a pipeline of seven novel immunotherapies, including programs targeting CD47 and CD73, supported by a broad strategic collaboration with Novartis focused on up to four next-generation immunotherapies. Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., Surface was founded by Atlas Venture and is also supported by leading biotechnology venture investors F-Prime Capital Partners, Lilly Ventures, New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and Amgen Ventures.

OmniRat® is the industry’s first human monoclonal antibody technology based on rats. It has a complete immune system with a diverse antibody repertoire and generates antibodies with human idiotypes as effectively as wild-type animals make rat antibodies. OmniMouse® is a transgenic mouse that complements OmniRat and expands epitope coverage. OmniFlic® is an engineered rat with a fixed light chain for development of bispecific, fully human antibodies. The three platforms use patented technology, have broad freedom to operate, and deliver fully human antibodies with high affinity, specificity, expression, solubility and stability.

The trend of pet adoption as companions has been rising all over the world, fueling the demand for veterinary products. A recent study conducted by Future Market Insights (FMI) reveals that revenues from the worldwide sales of companion animal specialty drugs are expected to reach US$ 29,151.5 Mn by 2017-end. The global companion animal specialty drugs market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.9% in terms of revenue between 2017 and 2027.       (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161020/430874LOGO ) FMI’s report titled “Companion Animal Specialty Drugs Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment 2017-2027” also projects that sales of animal specialty drugs will remain high in regions such as North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ) during the forecast period. In 2016, North America accounted for around 33% revenue share of the market mainly due to the adoption of innovative service delivery models by most retailers in the region. In addition, the companion animal specialty drugs market in North America will continue to be highly lucrative over 2027.

Among all the product types, demand for parasiticides will continue to gain the highest traction over the next couple of years. Moreover, expansion of distribution networks, especially in emerging countries is anticipated to further boost the sales of such companion animal specialty drugs. Manufacturers are also laying greater emphases on product and process innovation in order to improve their product portfolio as well as to offer better drug options. The market is dominated by top four players, Elanco, Merial, Zoetis, Inc. and Bayer AG, which collectively account for nearly two-third of the market share in terms of revenue.

Of late, higher importance to animal health and welfare has been observed in developing countries. This, in turn, is positively influencing the demand for compounded medication. Also, the need for easy access to services and affordable veterinary drugs is a major factor that is increasing the popularity of compounded drugs across the globe. The arrival of new technologies, especially in biologics such as recombinant DNA vaccines for dogs are expected to eventually drive demand for specialties in veterinary medicines in 2017 and beyond. On the basis of distribution channels, veterinary clinics account for more than one-third of the market share. Around US$ 12,446.3 Mn worth companion animal specialty drugs are expected to be distributed through veterinary clinics in 2017.

Insights 01 Jun, 2017, 09:00 ET Share this article VALLEY COTTAGE, New York, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Rapid urbanisation and commonness of isolated family units in the modern world are two of the major reasons that have led to increasing humanization of animals. The trend of pet adoption as companions has been rising all over the world, fueling the demand for veterinary products. A recent study conducted by Future Market Insights (FMI) reveals that revenues from the worldwide sales of companion animal specialty drugs are expected to reach US$ 29,151.5 Mn by 2017-end.

Manufacturers are also laying greater emphases on product and process innovation in order to improve their product portfolio as well as to offer better drug options. The market is dominated by top four players, Elanco, Merial, Zoetis, Inc. and Bayer AG, which collectively account for nearly two-third of the market share in terms of revenue.

Also, the need for easy access to services and affordable veterinary drugs is a major factor that is increasing the popularity of compounded drugs across the globe. The arrival of new technologies, especially in biologics such as recombinant DNA vaccines for dogs are expected to eventually drive demand for specialties in veterinary medicines in 2017 and beyond.

Mr Murrin, who has been a leading voice in highlighting the measures the Irish Government needs to take to ensure agri jobs are protected post-Brexit, believes preserving the UK market is "deliverable". "I genuinely believe and want the UK to be as important to my company five and 10 years from now as it is today. I believe that is possible with very careful movements from the Government and all stakeholders. "I've no doubt some people will say I'm mad, but I think it is deliverable," he said. "We need to defend, protect and maintain the British market. We spent 50 years developing that market, moving it from the hacking and packing stage, and in the absence of positive policies coming forward that all stakeholders can engage in, protection and maintenance is really crucial and we also need to step up our diversification networks." Speaking at a major MSD Animal Health conference focused on Sustainable Irish Food production in 2025, Mr Murrin said he has explained to Government the actions, steps and policy variations required to achieve this goal. "The Government must take positive, industry-wide measures to make long-term, very low-cost and very appropriate condition finance available to the Irish food industry in all its guises so that we can scale up, invest in our own competitiveness and take whatever steps we need," he said. "It's not a pipe dream, it is deliverable, the money in sitting there." ‘The longer you keep it bottled up the worse it’s going to get’  Irish rugby star Jack McGrath said dealing with his brother’s suicide was incredibly tough. Sponsored by Mr Murrin also revealed that Dawn Farms, Europe's largest multi-species business-to-business cooked meat producer, cooked enough ham to cover the Aviva stadium 5,000 times last year. The company, with plants based in Naas, Co Kildare and Northampton, UK, also produced enough pepperoni and salami to "circle the world five times," Mr Murrin claimed. Meanwhile, at the same conference, MEP Mairead McGuinness said a recent dinner between British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker intended to pave the way for formal Brexit talks went "worse than was reported". "I don't know what they had for dessert but I think there was salt on it," she said. "We're not really in a place where both sides are able to go into a room and come out with a deal. That's doesn't say we won't be there… but the politics are just not right at the moment I would have to say."

Infectious Diseases of the Developing World This announcement demonstrates the continued leadership and commitment of the Government of Japan, leading life sciences companies, international foundations and other partners to combat neglected diseases; with this replenishment, which marks a doubling of previous commitments, GHIT will accelerate and expand its development of new tools while ensuring they are accessible and delivered to the world's most vulnerable News provided by Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund) 01 Jun, 2017, 04:00 ET Share this article TOKYO, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund), which has been dedicated to leveraging Japanese expertise and capacity for health innovations to save lives in the world's poorest countries, announced today that it has secured commitments of over US$200 million* to its replenishment for its next phase of work, allowing it to move the most advanced tools out of the lab, and into the hands of those who need them most. GHIT's funding partners, including the Government of Japan (GOJ), private companies, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust have committed over US$200 million in a significant vote of confidence in the institution's work. The new commitment for GHIT's second phase is double the initial US$100 million investment GHIT received when it was created in 2013. The GOJ will contribute roughly half of the replenishment, with other partners splitting the remaining half. Leveraging Japan's historic leadership in global health and innovation, along with the unique technology and knowhow of its domestic and global partners, GHIT invests in R&D projects to develop new medicines, vaccines and diagnostics to address a range of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). It is the first public-private partnership of its kind for global health research and development (R&D), involving government, private companies, and private foundations. "In just four years, the GHIT's unique public-private partnership model has dramatically increased the global health community's capacity to develop technologies that can effectively battle the infectious diseases that afflict roughly one-third of the world's population," said GHIT Fund CEO BT Slingsby. "This work is moving us closer to achieving universal health coverage and human security goals." GHIT has moved quickly to fill a gap in R&D of new tools for malaria, tuberculosis and NTDs. In just four years, GHIT has broadened its funding partnerships substantially from eight core members in 2013 to almost twice that number today. The fund has invested approximately $100 million in 61 global product development partnerships that leverage Japanese innovation and capacities in pharmaceuticals. Eight of GHIT's 23 novel screening programs have advanced into the next stage of development; 6 clinical trials are under way in the developing world; and 2 projects have achieved proofs-of-concept (Phase II trials). GHIT's portfolio is characterized by products that are not only novel, but transformative for global health. This includes the first-ever pediatric formulation of the gold-standard drug for schistosomiasis, a water-borne parasitic disease linked to numerous acute and chronic health conditions. Other innovations include malaria drugs and vaccines, a TB vaccine that prevents initial TB infection—not just the later stages of active disease—and a new treatment strategy for Chagas disease, a tropical parasitic disease that can lead to heart failure. "Japan has shown strong leadership in accelerating scientific advances that save lives and have the potential to help millions escape the cycle of poverty," said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "From investments in research and development for neglected tropical diseases, to support for the Global Fund's progress in combatting AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and now through a continued commitment to GHIT, Japan continues to play a critical role in improving the lives of the world's poorest." "Fighting the world's most neglected diseases has long been a priority for Japan," said Minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. "We believe in universal health coverage where all have access to the medicines and treatment they need. Given our scientific and technological strength, it is Japan's responsibility to work with others to eliminate some of the world's most intractable diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, Chagas disease, and schistosomiasis." As GHIT prepares to enter the second five-year phase of its work, it plans to broaden its role in advancing R&D product development to include additional partnerships that further facilitate access to and delivery of the tools that emerge from its pipeline. To reinforce the bonds between R&D, access and delivery, and strengthen health systems, GHIT will be strengthening its collaboration with global health entities, such as Japan's Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), as well as the Global Fund, Gavi, WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, and others. GHIT's prioritization of access and delivery in its investment decision-making, coupled with Japan's priority on universal health coverage, will continue to foster partnerships committed to meeting critical unmet needs in global health. "GHIT is a really important innovation in and of itself," said Mark Dybul, former Executive Director of the Global Fund. "It is a great example of a public-private partnership that was created to foster R&D in a way that advances the goals of achieving universal health coverage and human security, which are cornerstone policies of Japan's health and foreign policies." Because these products are extraordinarily expensive and high-risk to develop and low-middle income countries are unable to pay for them, there is little financial incentive for for-profit companies to invest limited R&D resources into malaria, tuberculosis, and NTDs. Yet the full engagement of the private sector is critical to developing these tools and bringing them to market. GHIT's model is a solution to the market failure and enables the private sector to contribute to global health financially and by bringing their pharmaceutical expertise and capabilities to the R&D table to create affordable and accessible new products. "Over 700 million people live in absolute poverty, and 14 percent of children worldwide are not getting basic vaccines," said Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Affordability and access of vaccines are key to filling these gaps. "GHIT's investment in the development of needed vaccines—and to making affordability and access a priority throughout the R&D process—is critical." Throughout its first phase, GHIT has been instrumental in helping to speed the discovery and development of a significant number of innovative technologies in record time. "With this replenishment of GHIT, Japan is further cementing its legacy as a leader in global health innovation," said Professor Kiyoshi Kurokawa, Chair of the GHIT Fund Board of Directors. "The success of GHIT is catalyzing Japan's engagement with other new initiatives and transforming global health partnerships. This is good for Japan and for the world." * All amounts listed at the exchange rate of USD1 = JPY100. Quotes from GHIT Funding Partners Koichi Aiboshi, Director-General for Global Issues, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: "Japan has a long history in global health. In 2000, we promoted the inclusion of infectious diseases to the G8 agenda, and during the most recent summit, the first G7 summit after the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), global health was highlighted. I am glad that the GHIT was introduced in the Summit outcome document as a well-coordinated Public-Private Partnership for R&D. Our investment in GHIT, as well as other partnerships, is a clear signal that Japan has a sustained commitment to global health." Naoko Yamamoto, Assistant Minister for Global Health, Minister's Secretariat, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, said: "By leveraging GHIT's new platform, we have been able to demonstrate at home and abroad that Japanese pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and universities possess technologies and capabilities which can not only contribute to the nation's health, but to global health as well. Based on these successful experiences, I am hoping that many companies and research organizations in Japan become motivated to help address the challenges of global health, and this will lead to further advancing Japan's global health R&D." Trevor Mundel, President, Global Health, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said: "Japan is a leader in global health, and GHIT is a primary example of Japan's commitment to transforming the global health landscape with a partnership that brings together the unique resources of governments, pharmaceutical companies, and the philanthropic sector to develop products that can turn the tide against the greatest burdens of disease in low- and middle-income countries." Stephen Caddick, Director, Innovations Division, Wellcome Trust, said: "Japan has an outstanding science base and an exceptional culture of innovation, which, along with its excellent pharmaceutical industry, makes it ideal for the rapid advancement of new ways to diagnose and treat disease. We're proud to support GHIT and to work with the partners to develop drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics as quickly as possible and to put them in the hands of the billions of people around the world who need them most." Yoshihiko Hatanaka, Representative Director, President and CEO, Astellas Pharma Inc., said: "GHIT catalyzed a mindset shift for the Japanese pharmaceutical industry vis-à-vis solving global health issues. More specifically, it created a mechanism for Japanese pharmaceutical companies to take leadership roles in solving global health issues by combining their R&D expertise and capabilities in cooperation with those of governments, international organizations and nonprofits." Osamu Nagayama, Representative Director, Chairman and CEO, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., said: "In order for the global society to develop further, the realization of global health becomes increasingly important. GHIT Fund is the world's first public-private partnership which involves governments, private companies and foundations. The fund specializes in product development aiming for global health and engages in the critical mission. Chugai will contribute to the benefit for the medical community and human health around the world with its proprietary antibody engineering technologies and its compound library which is useful for drug discovery." George Nakayama, Representative Director, Chairman and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, said: "GHIT helps build bridges between our business and corporate social responsibility. We have significant resources to bring to bear on global health, including technologies, insights and experiences gained through the process of product development. It means a great deal to our company if we can leverage our technologies for global health and help develop and deliver products to patients in need." Haruo Naito, Representative Corporate Officer and CEO, Eisai Co., Ltd., said: "Our mission as a pharmaceutical company is to create new medicines and to deliver those medicines to all the people who need them. In order to eliminate neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and tuberculosis, which are a source of suffering to the people in developing countries, it is essential to both accelerate the development of new medicines and to improve access through partnerships, and we applaud the GHIT Fund's new endeavors on this front. Eisai is proactively engaged in contributing to global health, which we consider to be a long-term investment in creating a healthy and prosperous middle-income class." Isao Teshirogi, President and CEO, Shionogi & Co., Ltd., said: "Japanese pharmaceutical companies have always played a major role as innovators and producers of lifesaving medicines, vaccines and diagnostics. We can play a stronger role in seriously expanding the supply and accessibility of these medicines and improve overall health in poor countries." Christophe Weber, Representative Director, President and CEO, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, said: "GHIT is an innovative model for creating medicines and vaccines against diseases for which there is a lack of R&D funding, and I think it has been very successful. Investing in it and contributing to its work makes sense for Takeda not only because of our global health interests, but also because of the strong capabilities in Japan that can help make GHIT successful." Magdy Martínez-Solimán, Assistant Secretary-General, Assistant Administrator and Director, Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, United Nations Development Programme, said: "UNDP is proud to partner with Japan and GHIT, including through its Access and Delivery Partnership, which helps low- and middle-income countries address critical bottlenecks within their health systems so that GHIT-funded innovations can reach more people, faster." Shigetaka Komori, Chairman and CEO, FUJIFILM Corporation, said: "Partnering with the GHIT Fund has great significance for the delivery of solutions in developing countries where many unsolved infectious diseases exist. By utilizing its accumulated technologies, Fujifilm will create innovation in fields such as in-vitro diagnosis and therapeutic medications, and contribute to enhancing the quality of healthcare in developing countries." Tatsuo Higuchi, President and Representative Director, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., said: "Our multi-decade commitment to develop new treatments for tuberculosis resulted in the creation of delamanid, one of the first new anti-multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis agents in almost half a century. Our partnership with the GHIT Fund enables us to further contribute to new drug development for the health of people across the world." Hisashi Ietsugu, Chairman and CEO, Sysmex Corporation, said: "We look forward to cooperating with the GHIT Fund to strengthen R&D capability for diagnostics against infectious diseases prevalent in developing countries. Through collaboration with the GHIT Fund, we will accelerate the creation of diagnostic technologies with advanced medical value for people suffering from infectious diseases." Kihito Takahashi, Vice President and Senior Managing Director, Development and Medical Affairs Division, GlaxoSmithKline K.K., said: "As a science-led global healthcare company, we are committed to taking on some of the world's biggest healthcare challenges. GHIT Fund is contributing to accelerating the development of innovative medicines and vaccines to save the patients who are suffering from neglected diseases in developing countries. We are proud of being a member of GHIT Fund and of supporting the same mission to overcome global healthcare challenges by harnessing the partnership." Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson, said: "We, at Johnson & Johnson, know that good health drives human progress. However there remain critical public health challenges such as HIV and tuberculosis, which limit people's potential and could be addressed through innovation and collaboration. We are therefore proud to continue supporting GHIT's work to help develop innovative health solutions for people facing significant public health challenges." Nobuo Hanai, President and CEO, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., said: "We share GHIT's sense of urgency about the need to deliver new tools to those suffering from diseases with no adequate treatments. Partnering with GHIT, which focuses on global partnerships, will advance the "CSV* management" based on Our Unique Business Structure." (CSV stands for "Creating Shared Value" and refers to realizing improved corporate value through both the creation of social value and the creation of economic value by addressing social issues.) Belén Garijo, Member of the Executive Board & CEO Healthcare, Merck KGaA, said: "We at Merck are strongly committed to the fight against schistosomiasis in Africa and just celebrated 10 years of our Praziquantel Donation Program. Our leadership on the Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium, which is partially partnered by GHIT, makes me confident that this engagement with GHIT is bringing us ever closer to a potential treatment solution for the most vulnerable patients—very young children." Masayuki Mitsuka, President & Representative Director, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, said: "We are honored to make our chemical compound library available to global health R&D through GHIT.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman GHIT Fund Secures Commitments of Over US$200 Million to its Replenishment for the Acceleration of Japanese Innovation for Infectious Diseases of the Developing World TOKYO, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — The Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund), which has been dedicated to leveraging Japanese expertise and capacity for health innovations to save lives in the world’s poorest countries, announced today that it has secured commitments of over US$200 million* to its replenishment for its next phase of work, allowing it to move the most advanced tools out of the lab, and into the hands of those who need them most. GHIT’s funding partners, including the Government of Japan (GOJ), private companies, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust have committed over US$200 million in a significant vote of confidence in the institution’s work. The new commitment for GHIT’s second phase is double the initial US$100 million investment GHIT received when it was created in 2013. The GOJ will contribute roughly half of the replenishment, with other partners splitting the remaining half. Leveraging Japan’s historic leadership in global health and innovation, along with the unique technology and knowhow of its domestic and global partners, GHIT invests in R&D projects to develop new medicines, vaccines and diagnostics to address a range of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). It is the first public-private partnership of its kind for global health research and development (R&D), involving government, private companies, and private foundations. „In just four years, the GHIT’s unique public-private partnership model has dramatically increased the global health community’s capacity to develop technologies that can effectively battle the infectious diseases that afflict roughly one-third of the world’s population,” said GHIT Fund CEO BT Slingsby. „This work is moving us closer to achieving universal health coverage and human security goals.” GHIT has moved quickly to fill a gap in R&D of new tools for malaria, tuberculosis and NTDs.

GHIT's funding partners, including the Government of Japan (GOJ), private companies, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust have committed over US$200 million in a significant vote of confidence in the institution's work. The new commitment for GHIT's second phase is double the initial US$100 million investment GHIT received when it was created in 2013. The GOJ will contribute roughly half of the replenishment, with other partners splitting the remaining half. Leveraging Japan's historic leadership in global health and innovation, along with the unique technology and knowhow of its domestic and global partners, GHIT invests in R&D projects to develop new medicines, vaccines and diagnostics to address a range of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). It is the first public-private partnership of its kind for global health research and development (R&D), involving government, private companies, and private foundations. "In just four years, the GHIT's unique public-private partnership model has dramatically increased the global health community's capacity to develop technologies that can effectively battle the infectious diseases that afflict roughly one-third of the world's population," said GHIT Fund CEO BT Slingsby. "This work is moving us closer to achieving universal health coverage and human security goals." GHIT has moved quickly to fill a gap in R&D of new tools for malaria, tuberculosis and NTDs. In just four years, GHIT has broadened its funding partnerships substantially from eight core members in 2013 to almost twice that number today. The fund has invested approximately $100 million in 61 global product development partnerships that leverage Japanese innovation and capacities in pharmaceuticals. Eight of GHIT's 23 novel screening programs have advanced into the next stage of development; 6 clinical trials are under way in the developing world; and 2 projects have achieved proofs-of-concept (Phase II trials). GHIT's portfolio is characterized by products that are not only novel, but transformative for global health. This includes the first-ever pediatric formulation of the gold-standard drug for schistosomiasis, a water-borne parasitic disease linked to numerous acute and chronic health conditions. Other innovations include malaria drugs and vaccines, a TB vaccine that prevents initial TB infection—not just the later stages of active disease—and a new treatment strategy for Chagas disease, a tropical parasitic disease that can lead to heart failure. "Japan has shown strong leadership in accelerating scientific advances that save lives and have the potential to help millions escape the cycle of poverty," said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "From investments in research and development for neglected tropical diseases, to support for the Global Fund's progress in combatting AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and now through a continued commitment to GHIT, Japan continues to play a critical role in improving the lives of the world's poorest." "Fighting the world's most neglected diseases has long been a priority for Japan," said Minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. "We believe in universal health coverage where all have access to the medicines and treatment they need. Given our scientific and technological strength, it is Japan's responsibility to work with others to eliminate some of the world's most intractable diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, Chagas disease, and schistosomiasis." As GHIT prepares to enter the second five-year phase of its work, it plans to broaden its role in advancing R&D product development to include additional partnerships that further facilitate access to and delivery of the tools that emerge from its pipeline. To reinforce the bonds between R&D, access and delivery, and strengthen health systems, GHIT will be strengthening its collaboration with global health entities, such as Japan's Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), as well as the Global Fund, Gavi, WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, and others. GHIT's prioritization of access and delivery in its investment decision-making, coupled with Japan's priority on universal health coverage, will continue to foster partnerships committed to meeting critical unmet needs in global health. "GHIT is a really important innovation in and of itself," said Mark Dybul, former Executive Director of the Global Fund. "It is a great example of a public-private partnership that was created to foster R&D in a way that advances the goals of achieving universal health coverage and human security, which are cornerstone policies of Japan's health and foreign policies." Because these products are extraordinarily expensive and high-risk to develop and low-middle income countries are unable to pay for them, there is little financial incentive for for-profit companies to invest limited R&D resources into malaria, tuberculosis, and NTDs. Yet the full engagement of the private sector is critical to developing these tools and bringing them to market. GHIT's model is a solution to the market failure and enables the private sector to contribute to global health financially and by bringing their pharmaceutical expertise and capabilities to the R&D table to create affordable and accessible new products. "Over 700 million people live in absolute poverty, and 14 percent of children worldwide are not getting basic vaccines," said Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Affordability and access of vaccines are key to filling these gaps. "GHIT's investment in the development of needed vaccines—and to making affordability and access a priority throughout the R&D process—is critical." Throughout its first phase, GHIT has been instrumental in helping to speed the discovery and development of a significant number of innovative technologies in record time. "With this replenishment of GHIT, Japan is further cementing its legacy as a leader in global health innovation," said Professor Kiyoshi Kurokawa, Chair of the GHIT Fund Board of Directors. "The success of GHIT is catalyzing Japan's engagement with other new initiatives and transforming global health partnerships. This is good for Japan and for the world." * All amounts listed at the exchange rate of USD1 = JPY100. Quotes from GHIT Funding Partners Koichi Aiboshi, Director-General for Global Issues, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: "Japan has a long history in global health. In 2000, we promoted the inclusion of infectious diseases to the G8 agenda, and during the most recent summit, the first G7 summit after the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), global health was highlighted. I am glad that the GHIT was introduced in the Summit outcome document as a well-coordinated Public-Private Partnership for R&D. Our investment in GHIT, as well as other partnerships, is a clear signal that Japan has a sustained commitment to global health." Naoko Yamamoto, Assistant Minister for Global Health, Minister's Secretariat, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, said: "By leveraging GHIT's new platform, we have been able to demonstrate at home and abroad that Japanese pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and universities possess technologies and capabilities which can not only contribute to the nation's health, but to global health as well. Based on these successful experiences, I am hoping that many companies and research organizations in Japan become motivated to help address the challenges of global health, and this will lead to further advancing Japan's global health R&D." Trevor Mundel, President, Global Health, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said: "Japan is a leader in global health, and GHIT is a primary example of Japan's commitment to transforming the global health landscape with a partnership that brings together the unique resources of governments, pharmaceutical companies, and the philanthropic sector to develop products that can turn the tide against the greatest burdens of disease in low- and middle-income countries." Stephen Caddick, Director, Innovations Division, Wellcome Trust, said: "Japan has an outstanding science base and an exceptional culture of innovation, which, along with its excellent pharmaceutical industry, makes it ideal for the rapid advancement of new ways to diagnose and treat disease. We're proud to support GHIT and to work with the partners to develop drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics as quickly as possible and to put them in the hands of the billions of people around the world who need them most." Yoshihiko Hatanaka, Representative Director, President and CEO, Astellas Pharma Inc., said: "GHIT catalyzed a mindset shift for the Japanese pharmaceutical industry vis-à-vis solving global health issues. More specifically, it created a mechanism for Japanese pharmaceutical companies to take leadership roles in solving global health issues by combining their R&D expertise and capabilities in cooperation with those of governments, international organizations and nonprofits." Osamu Nagayama, Representative Director, Chairman and CEO, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., said: "In order for the global society to develop further, the realization of global health becomes increasingly important. GHIT Fund is the world's first public-private partnership which involves governments, private companies and foundations. The fund specializes in product development aiming for global health and engages in the critical mission. Chugai will contribute to the benefit for the medical community and human health around the world with its proprietary antibody engineering technologies and its compound library which is useful for drug discovery." George Nakayama, Representative Director, Chairman and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, said: "GHIT helps build bridges between our business and corporate social responsibility. We have significant resources to bring to bear on global health, including technologies, insights and experiences gained through the process of product development. It means a great deal to our company if we can leverage our technologies for global health and help develop and deliver products to patients in need." Haruo Naito, Representative Corporate Officer and CEO, Eisai Co., Ltd., said: "Our mission as a pharmaceutical company is to create new medicines and to deliver those medicines to all the people who need them. In order to eliminate neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and tuberculosis, which are a source of suffering to the people in developing countries, it is essential to both accelerate the development of new medicines and to improve access through partnerships, and we applaud the GHIT Fund's new endeavors on this front.
