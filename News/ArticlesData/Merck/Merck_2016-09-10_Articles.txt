Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Sep 11, 2016 at 7:25AM Image source: Getty Images. If you're looking for a long-term winner as a retiree, it's hard to beat a stock that not only pays growing dividends, but whose shares are in the bargain bin because of short-term disappointments. Even the highest-quality companies suffer setbacks, which can present a golden opportunity to buy beaten-down shares and watch them rebound. In addition, with the stock having taken a hit, your investment dollars buy more shares, meaning a juicier yield and a bigger income stream for decades -- perhaps even the rest of your life. Remember that no stock is without risk, and there are no guarantees. But if you have some patience and don't mind a little risk, these three companies have a long history of solid performance and could make great choices for a retirement portfolio. Bristol-Myers Squibb: management flubbed it, but the stock will be back Blame Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) for being overly ambitious. The Big Pharma company motored to a 17-year high in July, only to take a sharp plunge in August. The stock is now down about 25%, meaning Bristol-Myers' dividend yield is a more attractive 2.7%. At the pre-plunge price, shares were yielding only 2%. But what caused the drop? Chalk it up to an unexpected clinical trial failure for the company's PD-L1 inhibitor, Opdivo, the world's best-selling cancer drug. In a first-line non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) trial, Opdivo failed to outperform conventional chemotherapy. Since Merck & Co.'s PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, succeeded in a somewhat similar trial, Opdivo's failure shocked the market. In fact, the biotech twittersphere went nuts. "The failure is a MAJOR SURPRISE -- possibly the biggest clinical surprise of my career," wrote Mark Schoenbaum of research firm Evercore ISI. Actually, it wasn't so much a surprise as an overreach. What the headlines missed was that the trials were designed differently. Bristol-Myers' trial included a broad group of patients, while Merck played it safe by including only patients whose tumors expressed a lot of PD-L1, making them more likely to benefit from PD-L1-inhibiting drugs. Short-term, management's decision really hurt this stock, but the market appears to have punished Bristol-Myers enough. And it should be remembered that Opdivo has been outselling Keytruda 2-to-1, thanks in part to a management team that's often gone for the wider market approval in its clinical trials.  For instance, in second-line NSCLC treatment, Opdivo is approved for all patients, while Keytruda is approved only for those with high PD-L1 levels.  Bristol-Myers will have another shot at the first-line NSCLC market with a late-stage study testing Opdivo and another drug called Yervoy. Results are expected by January 2018. Meanwhile, this company's growth engine is firing on all cylinders, with last quarter showing 17% growth in revenue to $4.9 billion, compared with the year-ago quarter. U.S. revenues increased an eye-popping 46% to $2.7 billion, as compared with a year ago. Looking forward, the company's top-line forecast is to grow by double digits for the rest of 2016 and by high single digits heading into 2017 and beyond. At the end of last quarter, Bristol-Meyers had $7.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, giving it financial flexibility. In short, the August sell-off put this pharma in the sweet spot to generate a solid income stream while investors wait for it to recover. Image source: Getty Images. CVS Health Corporation: a prescription for success CVS Health Corporation's (NYSE:CVS) 1.8% dividend may not seem like much at first, but CVS offers great dividend growth. The company has raised its dividend for 13 straight years. In fact, management raised the dividend 21% just last year and has boosted it 750% over the past 10 years. In addition, the company's payout ratio is still a low 33%, meaning there's plenty of room to keep raising the dividend. Companies that are able to aggressively grow their dividends usually do so because earnings are accelerating. In the second quarter, CVS's adjusted EPS increased 8.3% year over year. Combining all of its sales data, net revenues were up 17.6% to a record $43.7 billion last quarter, compared with the year-ago quarter. While most people think of CVS as a drugstore operator, it's also the country's second-largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), with more than 80 million members. The larger you are in the PBM business, the better deals you can negotiate on drug prices, which clearly is important, with drug pricing a growing concern in the U.S. In terms of its retail pharmacy business, revenue increased $2.8 billion to $20 billion, or 16% year-over-year, in the most recent quarter, thanks to the addition of long-term care pharmacy operations from its acquisition of Omnicare, Inc, as well as the addition of clinics and pharmacies from its deal with Target Corporation. Add in the company's 1,100 Minute Clinic urgent-care facilities, with plans to open another 400 in the next few years, and this stock looks poised for fast growth in the coming decades. Despite turning in solid financial results in the first and second quarters of 2016, CVS has seen its stock declined 6% since the beginning of the year. Add it all up, and this currently lagging stock could be just what the doctor ordered to revitalize your retirement portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. Abbott Labs: Grace Groner shows the way If you're looking for a great stock that's paid increasing dividends decade after decade, look no further than Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT). Having spun off its biotech department back in 2013 into AbbVie, the parent company has paid increasing dividends for an amazing 44 years. The global healthcare products company now offers a shareholder payout of 2.5%, after raising its dividend 7% in the past year. Abbott's stock price has dropped about 6% over the past 12 months, but the long-term trajectory of this company is not only intact but also likely to be reignited by recent acquisitions. In fact, last quarter's results were a standout, with every single segment delivering mid- to high-single-digit operational growth. Point-of-care diagnostics saw an 11.5% jump, emerging-market pharmaceuticals grew 15.9%, and vascular medical devices grew 8.9%. In addition, with its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which should close before the end of the year, investors should see continued growth far into the future. One story any retiree can appreciate is that of Grace Groner, who was a secretary at Abbott Labs 80 years ago. Groner bought three shares of Abbott Laboratories in 1935 for $60 each. She held on to the stock and reinvested her dividends in more shares, while Abbott split dozens of times and grew into a healthcare behemoth. By 2010, she owned more than 100,000 shares valued at $7 million. I can't tell you where this company will be in another 80 years, but taking into account its highly diversified revenue stream -- which is a stabilizing factor for any company -- as well as its rich and stable history and an above-average dividend yield, it's a good option for retirement investors. Buy on the dip and let it rip One of my favorite rules of thumb for successful stock investing is to buy greatness on sale. All three of these companies offer the kind of growth potential, safety, and expanding dividends that create long-term champs. And best of all, they're in the bargain bin.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Sep 10, 2016 at 8:01AM Image source: Getty Images. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a global healthcare giant that's well known for top-selling consumer brands like Band-Aid, but it also generates billions of dollars in sales annually from the rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade. In fact, Remicade is Johnson & Johnson's best-selling drug, with U.S. sales of $4.4 billion last year, and Q2  U.S. sales of $1.2 billion. Remicade's tailwinds, however, could be about to end because Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is finalizing plans to launch a Remicade biosimilar before year's end. Pfizer's biosimilar to Remicade, Inflectra, isn't an exact copy of Remicade, but it works similarly to it, and importantly, it's going to cost less -- something that could result in billions of dollars in Johnson & Johnson sales heading Pfizer's way over the next few years. What's at stake Remicade won FDA approval in August 1998 as a Crohn's disease therapy. Since then, its label has expanded to include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis. and ulcerative colitis, too. The drug is sold globally, with Johnson & Johnson owning the U.S. rights, and Merck & Co. and Mitsubishi Tanabe owning rights to it outside the United States. Merck and Mitsubishi pay J&J a royalty on Remicade's ex-U.S. sales. Remicade is a biologic drug, which means that it's a complex medicine that's created in living organisms, and it's not easily replicated. Remicade's patent has already expired, but until now, its complexity has kept competitors at bay in the United States. Remicade biosimilars, however, are already available in Europe. Over the past three years, Remicade's sales in the U.S. total $12.5 billion, and in Q2, Remicade's U.S. sales accounted for 55% of Johnson & Johnson's U.S. immunology revenue and nearly a quarter of Johnson & Johnson's total U.S. drug sales. Preparing to launch Pfizer's Inflectra won unanimous support for approval by a Food andl Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee in February. In April, the FDA officially gave Pfizer the green light to begin marketing it as a Remicade biosimilar in the United States.  Although the FDA's decision to approve Inflectra was announced months ago, Pfizer decided to delay launching Inflectra while it awaited a ruling on some patents that Johnson & Johnson argues still protects Remicade. Unfortunately for Johnson & Johnson, a federal judge in Boston recently ruled against it in that case.  The judge's ruling helps assuage fears Pfizer may have that it could be exposed to penalties if it launches Inflectra too soon. Previously, Pfizer has said it wouldn't launch Inflectra until Oct. 3, at the earliest. In Pfizer's Q2 conference call, executive John Young said, "We're moving ahead with launch preparations, and launch timing will be impacted by the upcoming court decision." Pfizer's top in-house legal beagle Douglas Lankler added, "If the court rules in our favor, there would be no legal restriction on our ability to launch." Given those comments and the judge's ruling, it would appear that a launch of Inflectra can be expected soon. Looking ahead Inflectra is already available in many European markets, and biosimilar competition overseas is a big reason why Johnson & Johnson's Remicade royalty stream is shrinking. In Q2, J&J's U.S. export sales of Remicade slumped 23%, to $185 million.  Pfizer has said it expects price discounting for biosimilars in the 30% to 50% range, which is better than the 80% to 90% discounting typical for traditional generic drugs. No one knows how much of the Remicade market share Inflectra can capture, or how quickly it can capture it. However, with that pricing, it wouldn't be shocking if Inflectra rapidly can  become a nine-figure drug for Pfizer in the U.S. This would all come at Johnson & Johnson's expense.

Recently news bulletin broke that Mylan – an American giant pharmaceutical company and the exclusive maker of EpiPen in America, has hiked the prices from $57 (in 2007) to $600 for a package of two in 2016. Genesis of the EpiPen EpiPen is a functional device for those suffering from stern allergies. The EpiPen provides injections of epinephrine in cases of serious and acute allergy attacks. Factually, Sheldon Kaplan designed this auto-injection for Survival Technology, Inc. In 2007, Mylan bought the generic drugs division of Germany’s Merck KGaA. Thus it got hold of the EpiPen brand of auto-injectors. Moreover, under Merck, the injectors cost just about $7 each. For the last seven years, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch has been resorting to federal government in Washington for help. Alongside patient groups, Mylan insisted for federal legislation cheering states to stock epinephrine injections in schools. In 2010, when the Food and Drug Administration introduced new federal policies relevant to epinephrine prescriptions, Mylan stopped selling single pens and swopped to twin-packs. These policies besieged persons who were suffering acute allergic reactions. By late 2011 Bresch considered the rule changes as big events to begin harvesting on. ‘EpiPen in America’ - Success Story In the event of a 7 year old dying due to an allergic reaction to nuts, Congress passed a law insisting states to ensure its schools had epinephrine injections handy at all times. In that particular year, Mylan spent around one million dollars in lobbying. Moreover with this EpiPen popularization plan strategy, Mylan started giving out complimentary EpiPens to approximately 60,000 schools in 2012. In 2014, the company spent 35 million dollars on commercial ads. Furthermore, in 2015, Mylan marked a deal with Walt Disney, supplying theme parks and cruise ships with auto-injections. The only other company that got close to competing with Mylan’s EpiPen was Auvi-Q. However, later it was driven out of the market. Over the years, Bresch’s determination and power-driven attitude fuelled the company spread the EpiPen in America far and wide. Ultimately it caused its use to grow by 67 percent in the United States. Now, “EpiPen prescriptions are so ordinary that pediatric allergist Robert Wood from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine remarks the EpiPen in America as the latest Kleenex”. Even recently, when Mylan CEO Heather Bresch recently spoke with the New York Times, she stated the federal law passed in 2010 amongst her top accomplishments. With the recent price hike, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton issued a statement on Mylan to ardently reduce the price of the auto-injections. Furthermore, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles Grassley, expressed his concerns on the hikes. The Verdict Nevertheless, if Mylan didn’t have to incur money on Washington politics, it could have managed to sell the EpiPens for a reasonable price. A widespread analysis of pharmaceutical companies is that they splurge much money on commercial marketing. Furthermore, it causes higher medicine prices, higher health insurance premiums and higher levels of skepticism amongst natives about government. It will be far better if the way to make money in the pharmaceutical business is to discover a new cure, rather than appoint political heads to exploit the most money possible out of a medicine that already exists.

Sep 11th 2016, 9:00 PM 66,065 Views 210 Comments Share4628 Tweet Email22 Updated: 12 September AS THE SCHOOL year begins, tens of thousands of girls in the first year of secondary school will be offered the HPV vaccine in Ireland. But a campaign called Regret has come to prominence, questioning the safety of the vaccine, and claiming it caused illness in 400 Irish teenage girls and young women after they took it. Jacqui Madden in Co Roscommon and Deirdre Lally in Co Wicklow asked us to look into their claims, and assess the safety of the HPV vaccine, so we did. (Remember, if you see a social media campaign you’re not sure about, email factcheck@thejournal.ie or tweet @TJ_FactCheck). Claim: The side effects of the HPV vaccine outweigh the benefits Verdict: FALSE (by a very wide margin) Repeated studies and clinical trials have shown HPV vaccines like Gardasil to be very effective in preventing the virus which leads to most cervical cancers Repeated studies and clinical trials have shown HPV vaccines to be very safe, and potential allergic reactions and possible side effects to be extremely rare What little scientific research has been done contradicting this overwhelming consensus, has consistently been shown to be flawed and unreliable There is no evidence to show that the illnesses highlighted by the group Regret were caused by the HPV vaccine THE FACTS Source: Associated Press The Basics HPV stands for Human Papillomavirus, which is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections, with almost all men and women contracting it at some point in their lives. According to the HSE, 80% of women contract HPV, usually in their late teens or 20s. In most cases, the virus clears on its own and does not have any symptoms, but in some cases, it can lead to genital warts. In women, HPV can cause changes in the cervix (the lower part of the uterus, or womb) which can lead to cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine used in the school programme is called Gardasil, and protects against four out of 170 types of the virus: numbers 6, 11, 16, 18. However, 16 and 18 alone are responsible for 70% of cervical cancers, as well as 75-80% of anal cancers, according to the manufacturer’s package leaflet and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. This fact wasn’t taken into account in the misleading claim made by Regret this week, that: The HPV vaccine will not save any lives on its own merit, as it only protects against 4 strains out of more than 100 HPV infections. The fact is that two of those four strains account for 70% of cervical cancers, and an immunisation against them therefore necessarily prevents some cervical cancer development, and therefore saves lives. The rate of cervical cancer among women in Ireland is one in 115 (0.87%), according to the latest figures (for 2013). In Irish schools, the HSE began administering a program of HPV vaccination for free in May 2010, in schools and in clinics, to girls in first year of secondary school, and later began a “catch-up” programme for sixth years. This previously involved three injections separated by six months each, but since the 2014/2015 academic year, has been decreased to two injections, six months apart. Parents and guardians are given this HSE information booklet, and asked to sign a consent form, before the vaccine can be administered. In the 2014/2015 academic year, 55,121 vaccine doses were administered. Gardasil is manufactured by Merck and was authorised by the Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in September 2006, after being licensed by the European Medicines Agency. The other HPV vaccine licensed in Ireland is Cervarix, which is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. Both are “prophylactic” medicines, which means they prevent HPV for a number of years after being administered, but do not cure it in existing cases. Effectiveness of the HPV vaccine There is an exceptionally large volume of scientific research on the efficacy of HPV vaccines, which include Gardasil. A good place to start is this World Health Organisation (WHO) review of studies, which reported the vaccines had an efficacy rate of between 90% and 100% in preventing HPV infection. A 2011 meta-analysis evaluated the results of seven separate randomised control tests, and found – for various groups of women over various time periods – the efficacy rate of the vaccines was 96%, 90%, 53%, 84%, 94%, 95%, 85%, 76%. A 2014 meta-analysis evaluated the results of 15 previous scientific studies – 10 randomised control tests and five observational studies. It found the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing HPV 16 and 18 (the two most serious strains) ranged from 83% to 94%. Another 2014 meta-analysis, on the long-term effectiveness of Gardasil, found that in one study of more than 1,000 vaccinated boys and girls aged 9-15, there wasn’t a single HPV infection up to nine years later. And in another study where women aged 16-23 were vaccinated, there wasn’t a single HPV infection five and nine years later. Finally, the original clinical trials which were the basis for Gardasil being licensed, found the vaccine was effective in 88.7% of cases (page 12/13, here). Safety of the HPV vaccine Source: Associated Press Ireland From 2010/2011 to 2014/2015, some 590,694 doses have been administered to first and sixth-year female secondary school students in Ireland, according to FactCheck’s analysis of data collected by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). The total number of girls who took the full set of Gardasil doses available was 201,410. Between 2010 and 2015, a total of 948 “adverse reactions” to Gardasil were reported to the HPRA. Adverse reactions are, essentially, negative symptoms perceived to be side effects from a drug. According to a parliamentary question response by then Health Minister Leo Varadkar, in January: The vast majority of reports received have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects associated with use of Gardasil, as described in the product information. These include reactions associated with the administering of the vaccine itself (an injection) like fainting, dizziness, headaches, skin rashes, but also include: Chronic fatigue, nausea, swollen joints, gastrointestinal problems, drowsiness, menstrual disorders. 958 reports of negative reactions (of varying degrees of severity) out of 590,694 doses constitutes 0.16%. If we plot those figures on a chart, the number of adverse reports is actually invisible compared to the scale of the doses administered. And it’s important to note that these are simply reports of adverse reactions – they do not, by any means, constitute proof that the administering of the vaccine was the cause of the symptom. Furthermore, some of the 108 adverse reports in 2015 would have related to the 2015/2016 vaccination programme, which is not included in the number of doses. Europe In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency published the results of a major review of the safety of HPV vaccines including Gardasil and Cervarix, examining an alleged link to two conditions. They were: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a chronic pain syndrome which affects limbs; and POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), which involves rapid heart rate increases on sitting or standing up, along with fatigue, dizziness and other symptoms. The largescale EMA review concluded that there was no causal relationship between the HPV vaccines and the two conditions, and that, essentially, the prevalence of those two conditions was no greater among those treated with the vaccines, than among the general population. It recommended no change to the licensing terms or product information requirements of Gardasil and Cervarix. Package information The manufacturer’s leaflet, which is reviewed by the HPRA, states the following possible side effects of Gardasil: Very common (more than 10% of patients) – Pain, swelling, redness at the injection site, headaches Common (more than 1%) – Bruising, itchiness at the injection site, fever and nausea Rare (less than 0.1%) – Hives Very rare (less than 0.01%) – Wheezing, difficulty breathing Scientific research Source: Associated Press Once again, very many scientific studies and reviews have been conducted on this, and have found HPV vaccines like Gardasil to be extremely safe. One of the 2014 meta-analyses mentioned above evaluated a 2013 study of almost one million 10-17 year-old girls in Denmark and Sweden. It found no difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated girls in the rate of what have been claimed to be serious adverse effects – various autoimmune and neurological conditions, as well as venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis. Another study from 2014 analysed 42 completed or ongoing clinical trials of Cervarix and found that the rates of symptoms were almost identical between vaccinated and control groups. In fact, the rates of “medically significant conditions” and “serious adverse events” were slightly lower among the vaccinated groups, not that any particular conclusion should be drawn from that. This summary of nine separate studies involves research into possible associations between HPV vaccines and a wide range of conditions and symptoms, including serious ones like stroke, appendicitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune disorder that causes weakness and even paralysis, and has been claimed to be caused by HPV vaccination. In almost all cases, the research found no difference between vaccinated and control groups in the prevalence of the conditions, with the exception of temporary problems like fainting and skin irritation. In one case, a lower “odds ratio” (essentially a lower risk) of multiple sclerosis was observed among the vaccinated group. In the case of Guillain-Barré syndrome, the rate of reported cases was 0.2 per 100,000 doses of Gardasil. That’s one in half a million, or 0.0002%. And that rate was no higher than is typical of other vaccines. Yet another 2011 systematic review of existing research concluded that the prevalence of serious adverse events was not different between vaccinated and control groups. And finally, another 2011 systematic review found the same results. Regret’s evidence Source: Associated Press FactCheck asked the group Regret to provide evidence to support the contention that the HPV vaccine caused the health problems suffered by the 400 young women it represents, and that the HPV vaccine is not safe. A spokesperson for the group confirmed it was their view that “on balance, the risks of taking the HPV vaccine outweigh the benefits”. On the question of a cause-and-effect relationship, the group told us: We question the safety of the vaccine, but without the appropriate independent investigative tools, we cannot establish the causation link [sic]. They did not provide any evidence showing that Gardasil caused the health problems observed among the girls in question. On the wider question of the safety of Gardasil in general, Regret directed us to articles reporting decreasing uptake of the vaccine in various jurisdictions, and criticism of it, but only one scientific study. The fact that uptake of the vaccine is decreasing in a small number of countries, or that its safety has been questioned, does not, of course, constitute evidence that it is not safe. And in reality, the Canadian study highlighted by Regret does not give any support to their contention – quite the opposite. Its authors even expressly stated that the rate of side effects following HPV vaccination was “low”. The research, published in April, tracked the rate of AEFI (adverse events following immunisation), as well as hospitalisation and emergency department admissions within 42 days of vaccination, among women and girls aged nine and older in the Canadian province of Alberta, between 2006 and 2014. In 99.2% of cases, the HPV vaccine administered was Gardasil. The study found: Out of 528,913 doses of a HPV vaccine, 198 adverse events (side effects) were reported. That’s 0.04% Out of 195,270 girls and women vaccinated, 192 reported adverse events. That’s 0.1% Of those 192, four reported an adverse event serious enough to warrant hospitalisation within 42 days Therefore, four out of 195,270 vaccinated individuals experienced a serious side effect following vaccination. That’s 0.002% Of the 198 adverse events reported, the outcome was known for 171. All 171 ended in full recovery Of the 195,270 patients vaccinated, 958 (0.49%) visited the hospital within 42 days – 35.3% within two weeks, and 64.7% after two weeks Only four of these had reported a side effect from the vaccination Of the 195,270 patients vaccinated, 19,351 visited the emergency department (ED) within 42 days. That’s 9.9% Regret presented the fact that almost 10% of those vaccinated visited the ED within 42 days as evidence supporting the risks of the HPV vaccine. But this ignores the fact that only 0.002% of those vaccinated reported a serious side effect (one warranting a trip to the hospital). In other words, those hospital and emergency department visits were not linked to the vaccination, not even in the minds of the women and girls themselves. The “Research” page of the group’s website contains mostly op-ed articles, speeches or interviews criticising the vaccines, but among the more substantive items listed are: An article which claims clinical trials of Gardasil and Gardasil 9 showed a rate of serious side effects of 2.5% and 2.3%. On even cursory examination, this is very misleading. In reality, between one month and four years after vaccination, only four out of 15,705 individuals had a side effect that was determined to be vaccine-related. That’s 0.03%. Once again, vaccinated people getting sick in the normal course of events (including up to four years after vaccination) is falsely being presented as caused by vaccination. A Danish study which described a pattern of “autonomic dysfunction” (problems with breathing, heartrate and digestion) among 53 vaccinated patients. It noted that it could not confirm or dismiss a causal link with the vaccine, but called for further research. However, the consistency of the symptoms observed is surely due to the fact that: This was a retrospective analysis based on 75 patients consecutively referred to the Syncope [Fainting] Unit from May 2011 to December 2014 for a head-up tilt test due to  orthostatic intolerance and symptoms compatible with autonomic dysfunction as suspected side effect following vaccination with the Q-HPV vaccine. In other words, the study found a strong pattern of autonomic dysfunction among a few dozen patients who were referred to a specialised unit, with symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. Which is hardly shocking. A 2012 study which concluded that certain HPV vaccines “pose an inherent risk for triggering potentially fatal autoimmune vasculopathies [blood vessel disease]“. That alarming conclusion was based on autopsy analysis and tissue samples taken from the brains of two young women (19 and 14), who had died six months and two weeks after HPV vaccination. The study was so alarming that the US government’s Centers for Disease Control (CDC) established a working group to examine it. In a public response, they found several serious flaws: The authors’ diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis (blood vessel inflammation in the brain) was invalid The way they tested for the presence of vaccine-related proteins lacked proper controls and was “questionable” The authors did not use the right equipment to properly identify vaccine particles, and did not use control samples, so the relevance of what they did find “cannot be determined” They did not present enough information to be able to examine possible alternative causes of death. And for the record, out of the many millions of HPV vaccine doses administered in the US over the years, the CDC working group found one report of cerebral vasculitis (the disease the article claims is caused by the vaccine), 45 days after a vaccination. And that was in a woman who already had immune system difficulties and several medical problems to begin with. In the medical literature, they found two cases of vasculitis after vaccination (neither of them in the brain, which is the focus of this study), and both of them attributed to a blood vessel disorder called Henoch-Schonlein Purpura. Conclusion A very large number of clinical trials and scientific studies, some outlined above, have proven HPV vaccines, including Gardasil, to be highly effective in preventing the virus that causes 70% of cervical cancer These trials and studies have also proven HPV vaccines, including Gardasil, to be very safe, with extremely low rates of serious possible side effects What little scientific research has been done contradicting this overwhelming consensus, has consistently been shown to be flawed and unreliable There is no evidence whatsoever that HPV vaccination caused the health difficulties observed among the 400 young women represented by the group Regret The claim that “On balance, the risks of taking the HPV vaccine outweigh the benefits” is FALSE by a very wide margin. In fact, the evidence is unequivocal.

After obtaining final approval in Europe in May, Boston-based powerhouse Biogen took charge of selling the medicine under the brand name Flixabi. "The U.K. is not the first European country where SB2 commercially debuted. It also went on sales in other places in Europe," a Samsung official said. But she refused to disclose details. Janssen's Remicade has been a blockbuster as the U.S. company had a turnover of $4.5 billion in the United States and $9.9 billion in total last year from the autoimmune disorder drug. Earlier this year, Samsung Bioepis applied for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell SB2 in the world's largest pharmaceutical market in an alliance with Merck. Celltrion might not be happy with the news as the cross-city rival of Samsung Bioepis is also betting its future on Remsima, its own biosimilar version of Remicade. Celltrion, the largest-capitalized corporation in Korea's tech-heavy KOSDAQ, introduced Remsima in Europe in 2013 and now has a 30 percent market share. The firm is seeking to raise this to more than 40 percent in the near future and is poised to market the drug in the U.S. in partnership with Pfizer after getting FDA approval in April. It sent the first batch of the drugs to the U.S. last month. Considering its potential, many global players have invested in the company. Some major investors are Singapore's sovereign wealth fund Temasek and One Equity Partners, an internal fund at JP Morgan. Samsung Bioepis also gained regulatory approval for another biosimilar medicine called SB4 in Europe in January and commercialized it under the trade name Benepali. It copies Enbrel from U.S. pharmaceutical company Amgen, and treats rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis. Samsung Bioepis was set up in 2012 as a joint venture between Samsung BioLogics and Biogen. The firm is responsible for developing and producing products as well as global clinical trials and regulatory registration. Marketing, distribution and sales are carried out by Biogen and Merck, with whom Samsung Bioepis signed commercialization deals. Merck is known as MSD in Korea. Samsung Group has shelled out big bucks on Samsung BioLogics as Korea's No. 1 conglomerate regards the bio segment as one of its main next-generation growth engines. voc200@koreatimes.co.kr 'Lohengrin' resonates with Korea's pol...

Brian Feroldi (TMFTypeoh) Sep 10, 2016 at 7:41AM Image source: Getty Images. What Investors in Xencor (NASDAQ:XNCR), a small-cap clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, enjoyed a healthy amount of share price appreciation in August. Thanks in large part to the company reporting a surprise quarterly profit, traders bid up the company's stock more than 11% during the month, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. XNCR data by YCharts. So what Xencor reported second-quarter revenue of $66 million, which was much higher than the $58.6 million that Wall Street had expected. As a clinical-stage biotech, Xencor earns its revenue primarily through collaboration agreements and milestone payments, and this quarter the company's top line was supported primarily by its partnerships with Novartis and Amgen.   Xencor's quarterly spending on research, development, and corporate overhead were substantially higher than in the year-ago period, but those numbers were quite modest when compared to the company's revenue. Those factors allowed Xencor to book a strong quarterly profit of $47.2 million, or $1.13 per share. That was far better than the $0.18 per share loss that analysts had projected. Xencor looks to be on solid financial footing, too. The company ended the quarter with $168.8 million in cash on its balance, but that number doesn't yet include the $150 million up-front payment that it just received from Novartis. Adding those numbers together gives the company well over $300 million in cash and equivalents, which the management believes should be enough to fund operations beyond 2019. Given the surprise quarterly profit and the huge financial runway it's easy to see why shares moved higher in August. Now what Xencor has done a great job at convincing some of the biggest healthcare companies on the planet to sign on as partners. Currently the company has agreements with the likes of Novartis, Amgen, Johnson & Johnson, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Merck, Novo Nordisk, and others to develop compounds based on the company's XmAb antibody technology. In total, Xencor believes that it should have 13 company-owned or partnered antibodies in the clinic by 2018, which could give Xencor's investors several shots on goal in the years ahead for indications including Lupus, Asthma, and cancer. There's no doubt that Xencor exhibits many of the qualities that clinical-stage biotech investors find attractive, but potential shareholders should remember that this company's most advanced compound is still just in phase 2 clinical trials. That means that it will still be several years of additional development work before the company could start generating revenue from product sales. For that reason, I personally plan on keeping Xencor as just a watch list candidate, but I must admit that I'll be following this company with great interest.
