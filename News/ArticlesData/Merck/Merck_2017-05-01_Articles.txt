Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Merck Shutterstock photo Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Merck & Co Inc (Symbol: MRK). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the May expiration for MRK. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $61 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 84 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.4% return against the $61 commitment, or a 20.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ). Selling a put does not give an investor access to MRK’s upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Merck & Co Inc sees its shares decline 1.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $60.16 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 84 cents from $61), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 20.1% annualized rate of return. Worth considering, is that the annualized 20.1% figure actually exceeds the 3% annualized dividend paid by Merck & Co Inc by 17.1%, based on the current share price of $62.17. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 1.95% to reach the $61 strike price. Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Merck & Co Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for MRK below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annualized dividend yield. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the May expiration, for shareholders of Merck & Co Inc (Symbol: MRK) looking to boost their income beyond the stock’s 3% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $62.50 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.22 bid, annualizes to an additional 28.6% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 31.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $62.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MRK shares would have to climb 0.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 2.4% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Merck & Co Inc, highlighting in green where the $61 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $62.50 strike in red: The chart above, and the stock’s historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the May put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Merck & Co Inc (considering the last 251 trading day MRK historical stock prices using closing values, as well as today’s price of $62.17) to be 20%.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Is Merck a Great Pick for Your Dividend Portfolio? Keeping a portion of your portfolio dedicated to stocks of solid, dividend-paying companies is a wise strategy for building wealth for the long term while maintaining some relative safety. Stocks of large pharmaceutical companies come into favor in times of economic uncertainty because of their ability to maintain margins and typically healthy cash flows during downturns. Does pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE: MRK) merit a spot in a conservative dividend portfolio? A solid, but not stellar dividend history Merck, with its current 3% yield, has proved itself a company that makes shareholder returns a high priority, having paid a dividend continuously without ever cutting it since at least 1970. The dividend has grown at an annualized rate of 3.6% since 2010 — well ahead of inflation — but was flat from 2004 to 2010. Image source: Getty Images. In recent years the company has also been returning capital to stockholders in the form of share buybacks, having reduced the number of shares outstanding at an annualized rate of 2.5% over the last four years. The total shareholder yield — dividends plus buybacks — of 5.5% is a very healthy rate in today’s environment of low interest rates. There is no guarantee that buybacks will continue over the long term, but they are a good indication that the company can meet its needs for growth investments and dividend payments with substantial cash left over. A sustainable dividend One measure of the sustainability of dividends payouts is the payout ratio, which is the percentage of the company’s GAAP net profit that is being paid out in dividends. The payout ratio should ideally be no more than about 60%, Merck’s dividend looks a little risky in that for the last two years, it’s paid out more in dividends than it has made in profit. However, the company has had a lot of non-cash charges related to acquisitions, and when the dividends payments are compared to free cash flow, the situation looks much better. It appears the company is having no trouble paying dividends from its cash, giving us some confidence that it can continue to do so in the future. Year Payout Ratio Dividend % of Free Cash Flow 2012 82% 64% 2013 114% 51% 2014 43% 93% 2015 115% 46% 2016 130% 59% Data source: Merck financial reports. Growth prospects are improving Growth has been a challenge for Merck in the last few years, as generic competition has eaten away at sales and the company has had some major missteps with its drug development program. 2016 revenue grew 3% before currency exchange losses, and the company is guiding to a gain of only 1% excluding currency in 2017. Patent expirations are affecting Merck’s blockbuster drugs Cubicin, Nasonex, Zetia, and Remicade, and will soon be taking a big chunk out of Vytorin. Adding to its own woes, the company had a surprising number of expected blockbuster drugs fail in late stage trials in recent years. Rolofylline, vorapaxar, telcagepant, tredaptive, and odanacatib are all drugs you’ll never hear of but represent billions of lost investment and future sales. Fortunately the company has had just enough successes — and cost-cutting — to make up for the losses, keeping dividend payments coming and the stock price rising. The stock price has appreciated at an annualized rate of 9.5% over the last four years, giving dividend investors a very nice total return. Recently launched blockbuster drugs Januvia for diabetes, Isentress for HIV, Zepatier for hepatitis C, and the Gardasil vaccine for HPV have helped maintain growth, but the big news for growth going forward is Keytruda. Keytruda is a PD-1 inhibitor drug for fighting various types of cancer that Merck first launched in 2014 for metastatic melanoma and has since been approved for head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. The latter approval was a huge win for Merck, in that it took the valuable first line treatment position over Bristol-Myers Squibb ‚s megablockbuster Opdivo. The contrast between results for Opdivo and Keytruda opens up the possibility that Keytruda is actually a better molecule than Bristol’s, which is currently selling at a rate of over a $1 billion per quarter. The drug has huge potential to be used for a wide variety of cancers, and is currently being tested in over 400 different studies. With three expected approval dates coming up in the first half of 2017 alone, the drug will help Merck overcome its weak spots this year and turn up the growth in future years. A solid pick There are companies that have a stronger history of growth, both in the dividend and in earnings. But Merck’s payout is likely secure, its growth prospects are improving, and it sells for 16 times its 2017 earnings — less than the average stock in the S&P 500. For conservative, long-term investors, Merck could be good medicine for an income portfolio. 10 stocks we like better than Merck & Co.

These results will be presented today at The International Liver Congress™ 2017. “Despite the significant progress made to address the worldwide epidemic of chronic hepatitis C infection, there remains a need for additional treatment options,” said Dr. Heiner Wedemeyer, lead study investigator and research group leader in the department of gastroenterology, hepatology and endocrinology at Hannover Medical School, Germany. “We are encouraged by the high virologic cure rates in the difficult-to-treat patients observed in the C-SURGE study and look forward to further evaluation of this investigational triple-combination therapy.” The Phase 2 C-SURGE study enrolled 94 patients who were randomized to receive a once-daily regimen of MK-3682B for either 16 weeks with RBV (n=45) or 24 weeks without RBV (n=49); one patient in the 16-week arm withdrew prior to starting treatment. Of the 93 patients who received treatment (full analysis set), 57 had previously received a regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) for 12 to 24 weeks, 14 had previously received LDV/SOF for 8 weeks and 22 had previously received ZEPATIER® (elbasvir and grazoprevir) for 12 weeks. Seventy-eight patients who received treatment had at least one baseline NS5A resistance-associated substitution (RAS) at positions 28, 30, 31 or 93. Eighty patients who received treatment in C-SURGE had GT1a infection, and 40 patients had compensated cirrhosis. In the full analysis set, 98 percent of patients who received MK-3682B for 16 weeks with RBV (43/44) and 100 percent of patients who received MK-3682B for 24 weeks without RBV (49/49) achieved SVR12. Results from the modified full analysis set, which excludes one patient in the 16-week arm who withdrew after three doses of treatment, show that 100 percent of patients receiving treatment with MK-3682B for 16 weeks with RBV (43/43) and 100 percent of patients receiving treatment with MK-3682B for 24 weeks without RBV (49/49) achieved SVR12. Across the combined treatment arms, the most common adverse events (AEs) reported in the full analysis set were fatigue (35%), headache (13%), diarrhea (9%), rash (9%) and pruritus (5%). There were no drug-related serious AEs, and no patients discontinued treatment due to a drug-related AE. SVR8 results from the C-SURGE study were previously presented at The Liver Meeting® 2016. About MK-3682B MK-3682B is Merck’s investigational triple-combination therapy in Phase 2 development for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. MK-3682B combines an HCV nucleotide analogue NS5B polymerase inhibitor (MK-3682), an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor (grazoprevir, MK-5172) and an HCV NS5A inhibitor (ruzasvir, MK-8408).

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman MilliporeSigma’s Mobius(R) 2,000-liter Single-use Bioreactors to Expand Avid Bioservices’ Manufacturing Capabilities /EINPresswire.com/ — BILLERICA, MA–(Marketwired – May 1, 2017) – MilliporeSigma and Avid Bioservices, Inc., today announced that Avid will upgrade its Myford clinical and commercial manufacturing facility with multiple Mobius® 2000-liter single-use bioreactors from MilliporeSigma. The new bioreactors, to be installed in mid-2017, provide Avid with the latest technology while expanding the company’s manufacturing capacity. Avid is a wholly owned subsidiary of Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: PPHM) (NASDAQ: PPHMP). „An integral part of our complete single-use offering, Mobius® bioreactors help companies like Avid move toward the goal of fully disposable manufacturing,” said Udit Batra, Member of the Executive Board, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and CEO, MilliporeSigma. „We will continue to support Avid as it upgrades its facility to help customers advance molecules into the clinic and to market so that patients have better access to life-enhancing drugs.” Single-use technology is becoming increasingly popular in the industry. The market for single-use bioprocessing is estimated to reach $5.9 billion by 2024, according to Transparency Market Research. More than 90 percent of biopharma facilities use single-use technologies, according to Bioplan Associates. „We ran a competitive process and chose the MilliporeSigma Mobius® 2,000-liter single-use bioreactor system because it offers technical and ease of use advantages over competing single-use systems,” said Steven W. King, President, Avid Bioservices. „The confidence in the choice has only been further reinforced by our experience to date with the Mobius® system up to the 1000-liter scale as part of a pilot program. Adding the Mobius® technology to expand Avid’s Myford biomanufacturing capacity highlights our commitment to offer customers the latest single-use equipment and flexible solutions.” King added that the first 2,000-liter pilot batch is planned for later this month. Traditionally, biopharmaceutical companies used large stainless steel vessels in multi-story buildings, requiring substantial investment and rigorous setup. With single-use disposable equipment, customers get improved batch turnaround times, reduced risk of product cross-contamination, decreased capital costs and have less equipment to clean. MilliporeSigma’s single-use technology helps accelerate customers’ molecules to market, improve productivity, and ensure supply continuity. „The planned installation of MilliporeSigma’s Mobius® 2000-liter bioreactors opens new opportunities for current and future Avid customers who require greater manufacturing capacity,” King added. „We have already secured customer commitments for the 2,000-liter capacity as soon as it is installed in our Myford facility and believe the advanced technology it offers will be a key factor in continuing to grow our Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization business.” Avid has installed the appropriate systems at its Myford facility in Orange County, California to allow integration of MilliporeSigma’s Mobius® bioreactors. The 40,000-square foot Myford facility was designed to accommodate a fully disposable biomanufacturing process for late Phase III clinical and commercial biologics production. The facility can operate multiple bioreactors simultaneously, improving manufacturing capacity and efficiency.  MilliporeSigma’s Mobius® stirred tank bioreactor portfolio, with sizes ranging from 3- to 2000-liters, offers flexibility, scalability and ease-of-use. Mobius® bioreactors support GMP production and allow customers to optimize, streamline and accelerate drug development and production. About Avid Bioservices, Inc.

X MSD invests €40m in Tipperary plant Spray drying facility is the latest element in a €75 million upgrade of the Tipperary plant about 3 hours ago Dominic Coyle At the announcement of MSD’s €40 million investment in its Ballydine plant in Co Tipperary were (from left) site lead Ger Carmody with Liz O’Donnell, director of policy, government affairs and communications at MSD Ireland and Ger Brennan, managing director for human health at MSD Ireland.         International pharma group MSD is investing €40 million to upgrade its Tipperary plant. The bulk of the money will be spent on the installation of a new spray drying facility at the Ballydine facility. Spray drying improves solubility of tablets by patients, according to the company, and how medicines are absorbed by patients. Until now, MSD – known in the United States as Merck – had no such facility in Ireland where it employs about 1,800 people. As a result, it was forced to send drugs from the Irish plant over to the US for this treatment before bringing them back to Europe, a spokesman for the company said. “This investment reflects the growing importance of MSD Ireland’s operations to our global network,” said Ballydine site lead Ger Carmody. “The investment will ensure Ballydine continues to be well positioned for the ongoing development of new products providing the technologies that our newer products require.” The spray drying facility is the latest element in a €75 million upgrade of the Tipperary plant, where the company employs around 600 people, over the past three years. Mr Carmody said MSD’s Ballydine workforce was now leading the way in the development of new medicines, including the group’s new hepatitis C drug Zepatier, which is being manufactured at the Tipperary factory for patients worldwide. The managing director of MSD human health Ger Brennan said the company’s Irish workforce – in Tipperary, Cork and Carlow – are playing a leading role in the production and development of next generation therapies. MSD announced a separate investment of up €25 million to expand its clinical trials programme in Ireland earlier this year. The investment will focus on trials of cancer drugs over the next three years.       Topics: Ger Brennan Ger Carmody Merck Msd Ballydine Tipperary Read More Harris looks to woo European Medicines Agency to Dublin Trinity Biotech records 63% drop in pretax profit Losses dip slightly at Alkermes to $72.6m Dublin-based drugs firm Icon reports rise in revenues Pharma group Shire to create 150 new jobs in Dublin GlaxoSmithKline posts 31% gain in first-quarter profit Jazz Pharma to recommend use of big-selling narcolepsy drug in children Eli Lilly’s profit beats expectations thanks to demand for new drugs United Drug to make €40m investment at Dublin headquarters Irish medtech firm Diaceutics signs major deal with US lab  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Personal Finance PAYE workers may be unaware of Revenue tax liability Work Lucy Kellaway: Mondelez gives us a mouthful of unpalatable cliches Rugby Gerry Thornley: Anti-climactic final round of derbies – especially for Ulster Health Succession rules safeguard Catholic ethos of church’s health service assets Sponsored ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ The Story of Home: 'People need a sense of belonging' Charting a family adventure on the Shannon-Erne Waterways ‘I just love it, it’s a lovely place to work,’ says ‘Burlo’ concierge Latest Business First-time buyers: It’s cheaper to buy than rent, but do the sums first 07:38 EY Entrepreneur of the Year: 24 firms shortlisted for award 07:34 Government urged to do more to support social entrepreneurs 07:30 PAYE workers may be unaware of Revenue tax liability 07:29 Globoforce to create 100 jobs at Park West 07:28 Most Read in Business 1 First-time buyers: It’s cheaper to buy than rent, but do the sums first 2 PAYE workers may be unaware of Revenue tax liability 3 EY Entrepreneur of the Year: 24 firms shortlisted for award 4 Brexit challenge for Ireland will be to keep UK market share, says former WTO adviser 5 If you have any assets overseas you need to read this 6 Lucy Kellaway: Mondelez gives us a mouthful of unpalatable cliches 7 North’s commercial property market sees slump in investment 8 Greece, lenders reach long-awaited deal on bailout reforms 9 CRH defends Philippines plans amid sales slump 10 Investor roadshow tests opinions of Irish economy and banking sector Never miss a story.

Earnings: Solid Quarter, but Investors Wait Value-driving events won't come until the second half of the year or beyond. Brian Orelli (TMFBiologyFool) May 1, 2017 at 2:00PM Seattle Genetics (NASDAQ:SGEN) reported solid first-quarter earnings on Thursday, but the potential expansion of Adcetris into treating patients in other cancer settings and the development of the rest of the biotech's pipeline are what investors are mainly focused on. Seattle Genetics results: The raw numbers Metric Q1 2017 Q1 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $109 million $111 million (1.8%) Income from operations ($59 million) ($21 million) N/A Earnings per share ($0.42) ($0.15) N/A Data source: Seattle Genetics. What happened with Seattle Genetics this quarter? While revenue fell year over year, the decline was due to a one-time $20 million milestone payment from Takeda in the year-ago quarter that Seattle Genetics couldn't completely make up for. Adcetris sales were up a solid 20% year over year, putting sales on track to meet management's 2017 guidance of $280 million to $300 million. Excluding the aforementioned milestone payment, royalty revenue from Takeda on sales of Adcetris in its territories increased 38% year over year. The larger loss came from increased spending, mostly for research and development costs as Seattle Genetics supports the development of its pipeline. Image source: Getty Images. What management had to say Clay Siegall, Seattle Genetics' chairman, CEO, and president, explained why the company delayed filing for approval of Adcetris in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) using the ALCANZA trial: And then we changed our guidance at our last conference call to mid-year, and that was because of our discussions with the FDA based on other data that we've had from investigator-sponsored trials, specifically two of them, which showed strong activity in CTCL with patients that were below the histology cutoff that we used in our ALCANZA trial, and with patients that were in other subtypes of CTCL. In other words, the added data could result in more CTCL patients approved to take Adcetris, producing more sales in the long term that should more than make up for the short-term lost sales from the delayed approval. Adcetris has gotten more competition for patients with refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) after the recent approvals of Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) Opdivo and Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda, but Darren Cline, Seattle Genetics' EVP of commercial, doesn't see the new drugs as a threat: Despite the recent FDA approval of a second PD-1 inhibitor in [the] relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma setting, we have seen no erosion in share in our existing relapsed-HL business. Most prescribers have indicated they view the checkpoint inhibitor agents as interchangeable and would use both in post-Adcetris later lines of therapy or palliative setting[s], if necessary. Looking forward Seattle Genetics has a lot of potential, but investors are going to have to be patient this year, with most of the value-driving events happening in the latter half of the year. The application to treat CTCL patients with Adcetris won't come until the middle of this year, so an approval probably won't arrive until late 2017 or possibly even next year. The ECHELON-1 phase 3 trial in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma is supposed to wrap up this year, but management hasn't given any more specifics on timing -- suggesting that it's likely to come in the latter half of the year. Two pipeline drugs -- vadastuximab talirine and enfortumab vedotin -- are progressing nicely toward potential approvals. But vadastuximab talirine is still enrolling the phase 3 trial required to gain regulatory approval, and the registration trial for enfortumab vedotin won't start until the second half of this year.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 01, 2017 10:56am   Comments Share: The week ahead could bring heightened volatility with it. On top of companies releasing first-quarter results, there’s a Fed meeting, monthly jobs data, and Congress keeps working to approve government funding by Friday’s deadline. Those are just some of the potentially market-moving events this week and on the earnings front, several major healthcare companies kick it off this week with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) reporting on Tuesday, May 2. Pfizer Earnings and Options Activity When PFE reports tomorrow, analysts will likely be digging into sales for the company’s top five products: Prevnar 13, Enbrel, Lyrica, Ibrance, and Eliquis. In 2016, these drugs generated roughly $17 billion in sales and their results might have an outsized effect on the company’s operations. Sales for Prevnar 13, its top-selling product, fell 8% in 2016 to $5.7 billion. Another area of focus is how its Anacor and Medivation acquisitions are affecting the bottom line. Eucrisa, obtained from the Anacor buyout, won U.S. regulatory approval in December for treating eczema. Management  has said it expects Eucrisa to eventually achieve peak annual sales of at least $2 billion, according to Reuters, and this will be the first quarter of the new drug’s sales. PFE also acquired Medivation for $14 billion in September 2016, which added prostate cancer drug Xtandi to its portfolio; despite a year-over-year sales decline in Q4, management indicated it thinks the drug still has strong future growth prospects on last quarter’s earnings call.     Last quarter, the pharma giant missed Wall Street earnings expectations by $0.03 per share. For the first quarter, PFE is expected to earn $0.67 per share, the same as in Q1 2016, on revenue of $13.04 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates.   The options market has priced in just over a 1.3% potential stock move in either direction around the company’s earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. In short-term options trading at the May 5 weekly expiration, calls were active at the 34 and 35 strike prices while puts were active at the 33.5 and 34 strikes. The implied volatility for PFE sits at the 19th percentile. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Merck & Co. Earnings and Options Activity Most of the focus has been on MRK’s newer drugs Keytruda, a cancer treatment, and Zepatier, a hepatitis C treatment. Zepatier sales have been growing, but it faces competition from similar products made by GILD and AbbVie Inc (NYSE: ABBV). Several analysts think both of MRK’s key drugs could see a boost in sales this quarter from international launches. Looking ahead to the rest of 2017, management does see a few challenges. Increasing competition, loss of patent exclusivity, and foreign currency exchange headwinds are all anticipated to adversely impact operations. On last quarter’s earnings call, CFO Robert Davis said “while we are facing rapid erosion of sales from our products that have lost patent exclusivity, we will not get the full benefit of the ramp from new product launches, such as Keytruda and Zepatier, until the second half of 2017.” Davis also said he expects operating expenses to be heavier in the beginning of the year due to higher promotional expenses for Keytruda and the phasing of clinical spend. For Q1, MRK is expected to report earnings of $0.83 per share, down from $0.89 in Q1 2016, on revenue of $9.29 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. That’s the lowest earnings estimate in the past 8 quarters for the pharmaceutical maker. In short-term options trading at the May 5 weekly expiration, calls were active at the 62.5 and 64 strikes and there wasn’t a lot of activity on the put side. At the May 19 monthly expiration, calls were active at the 65 and 66 strikes and puts were active at the 60 and 62.5 puts. The implied volatility sits at the 66th percentile. Gilead Sciences Q1 Earnings and Options Activity GILD shares have been  battered over the past year as the company’s key hepatitis C treatments, Harvoni and Sovaldi, faced increasing competition. That appears to have led to declining revenues and earnings since Q1 2016. The company also lowered sales guidance for the year after last quarter’s worse-than-expected results. While there’s a lot of pessimism towards the company’s hepatitis C franchise, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said the company’s oncology drugs help offset some of its recent sales troubles.     When GILD reports after market close tomorrow, it’s expected to earn $2.24 per share, down from $3.03 in Q1 2016, on revenue of $6.66 billion according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. The revenue expectation is the lowest for the company out of its past 8 quarters. The stock is down almost 23% over the past year and has declined about 7.5% year to date, compared to an increase of 5.6% for the S&P 500 (SPX). The options market has priced in about a 3.75% potential stock move in either direction around its earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator. In short-term options trading at the May 5 weekly expiration, calls were active at the 68.5 strike price while puts were active at the 67 and 68 strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 52nd percentile. Posted-In: Analyst Color Biotech Earnings Health Care Previews Options Econ #s Markets © 2017 Benzinga.com.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 01, 2017 9:10am   Comments Share: Neurotrope Inc (NASDAQ: NTRP) announced “positive topline results” for its leading Alzheimer's drug in a Monday press release, but investors weren’t fooled. “The study failed,” Adam Feuerstein, biotech reporter at The Street, said Monday on Benzinga’s Pre Market Prep radio show. “That’s the headline here. The study failed.” The results of the Phase 2 trial of Bryostatin-1 (0.07) fell short of the industry’s accepted standard (0.05) — and that was after the firm adjusted its data. Neurotrope threw out a portion of its patients to examine a mere subgroup, still with statistically insignificant cognitive improvements. The fact that the company only discussed lower-dose results and excluded those of larger-dose trials only compounded the Street’s negative reaction to the study, as traders interpreted the higher dose as a complete failure. Future of Neurotrope Feuerstein said the company will likely press ahead, sustained by the public’s sentiment toward Alzheimer's and commitment to a cure. However, it’s equally likely to continue pumping negative news. “That’s the history of Alzheimer's — drugs that don't really work just get moved into larger trials, and then those don’t really work,” he said. “It’s unfortunate, a lot of money spent on these clinical trials, but so far we haven’t seen anything that’s very clinically effective.” The company will attempt to raise money to move forward, possibly through partnerships with larger pharmaceuticals, but Feuerstein isn’t hopeful. Neutrotrope’s unique approach to Alzheimer's can be viewed as either daring or foolish, considering that the likes of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) rejected its pursuit. “This drug tries to attack Alzheimer's in a different way than most companies have tried to do it and that could be interesting if it worked, but it’s probably more of a red flag that most of the companies with much deeper benches in the science and in Alzheimer's really have not seen this kind of mechanism very promising,” Feuerstein said. “So it’s gonna be hard to imagine that you’ll see a partnership coming out of this thing.” A Good Trade? Not necessarily. Most of the momentum behind Neurotrope’s stock has been generated by trader board promotions and generally unfounded excitement. “If you looked at the science and looked at it at a very fundamental perspective, there really wasn’t a lot of hope here, and I think reality is sort of hitting the stock today,” Feuerstein said. “It’s a good trading opportunity because the volatility is nice, but long term, I don’t think that changes the fundamental view of the company.” Instead, he suggested watching Biogen Inc (NASDAQ: BIIB) as the next company with large Phase 3 clinical studies in the Alzheimer's space. Its results are due in 2019 or 2020. Neurotrope had a premarket value of $7.91 and was trading down 42 percent at the time of publication.

Week Ahead Brings Heavy Load With Earnings, Data, Fed Meeting The Ticker Tape , TD Ameritrade   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} May 01, 2017 8:13am   Comments Share: Anyone who likes a lot of action can start right here. This coming week promises a smorgasbord, testing the market’s mettle with indices at or near record highs. There’s a Fed meeting, a truckload of key earnings reports — including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) — and monthly jobs data. The U.S. government has to decide by the end of the week whether to stay open. And to top everything off, French voters go back to the polls this coming weekend to choose a president. In other words, there’s something for everyone, which means that volatility, which began to climb a little Friday from recent lows, could show more life. The Nasdaq surged late last week on positive earnings results from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and earnings in general have been mostly strong. That allowed the markets to plow ahead to the best weekly showing of the year for some indices as investors focused mainly on Q1 corporate results. Earnings are probably going to be the key driver again this coming week, and the real fun starts Tuesday morning with Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM), Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP). Next comes Apple (AAPL) after Tuesday’s close. Facebook (FB) is Wednesday afternoon. Keep an eye on AAPL and FB to see if they can emulate some of the other recent strong tech company earnings. The markets received a boost last week from French election results, which delivered as many investors had hoped with a centrist candidate getting the most votes in the first round. But that was just the first round, and attention turns back to the French as the May 7 election approaches. Polls late last week showed centrist Emmanuel Macron leading right-wing rival Marine Le Pen. But memories of last year’s surprising Brexit and U.S. election votes could mean caution in the markets, as traders may want to avoid taking major positions ahead of the vote. Before that, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and futures prices show virtually no chance of a rate hike. By June, however, the futures market projects a close to 70% chance of an increase in rates. While this week’s Fed meeting doesn’t appear likely to result in any fireworks, investors would be wise to not get complacent, because all Fed meetings are “live,” and the Fed’s statement Wednesday afternoon could be worth a close watch for anyone trying to read the tea leaves. Ahead of the mid-June meeting, the Fed gets a look at two monthly jobs reports, with the April data due this Friday and the May report right before the June gathering. The March report delivered disappointing jobs growth of less than 100,000 positions, but the thought now is that might have been weather-related. A warm January and February might have triggered some construction industry job growth a little ahead of schedule, while a cold March might have hurt other industries. Perhaps the April report could iron things out a little, and check closely for any possible revisions to the March number. Another key data point the Fed is said to watch is PCE prices, and the March reading on that comes out Monday, along with March construction spending and the ISM Index for April. Auto and truck sales data hit the market on Tuesday, and factory orders data are due Thursday. All told, it’s a busy week on the data front. As the French election and the U.S. Congress decision on keeping the government open — which it put off for a week with a vote last Friday — both approach near the end of this coming week, it might be interesting to see how currencies and bond prices move. The euro was up vs. the dollar as of midday Friday, but any sign of movement in the polls toward the right-wing candidate might cause the euro to weaken. U.S. 10-year Treasuries steadied near 2.31% late Friday, but signs of possible contention in Congress later this week could put pressure on yields. Still, there’s a lot happening between now and then, so investors might not want to miss any of the action. A Closer Look at Weak Q1 GDP The headline Q1 GDP estimate of 0.7% was below most analyst estimates, and — if it stands at this level through the next two government projections — would be the weakest in years. Looking beneath the headline number, it appears a number of factors played into the weakness. The main drag on growth was the change in private inventories, which subtracted 0.93 percentage points, Briefing.com noted. A downturn in government spending subtracted 0.30 percentage points. Spending on goods was up 0.1%, while spending on services increased only 0.4%. The key takeaway, Briefing.com said, was that growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased just 0.3%, the weakest in more than seven years. On the Other Hand, There’s Earnings While the GDP estimate seemed to point toward a slowing economy, the stock market mostly ignored the report, in part because anticipation of a weak result was somewhat baked in, and because earnings appear to tell a different story. Earnings, more than the hard data, seem to reflect some of the so-called “soft data” like business and consumer confidence readings, which mostly moved higher in Q1. Housing numbers also have been resilient. All this makes Friday’s payrolls report arguably take on additional importance as investors try to get a better sense of economic health. Watch the wages data, because rising wages can really help play into consumer spending and maybe contribute to more robust Q2 GDP growth. One More Word on Consumers At times like these, it sometimes helps to look across the lake from here in Chicago over to Michigan. The University of Michigan released its final April consumer sentiment report Friday, which showed the headline index rising to 97 from 96.9 in March. From a high-level standpoint, sentiment looks good, the survey said, but the political divide that was so evident in last year’s tough-fought election seems to continue playing out in consumers’ outlook. “Consumer sentiment continued to travel along the high plateau established following Trump's election...,” said Richard Curtin, the survey’s chief economist, in a press release. “There was widespread agreement among consumers on their very positive assessments of the current state of the economy as well as widespread disagreement on future economic prospects. Although the partisan divide has slightly narrowed in recent months, it still reflects a very pessimistic economic outlook among Democrats and a very optimistic outlook among Republicans.” Posted-In: Analyst Color Earnings Bonds Previews Forex Treasuries Econ #s Federal Reserve © 2017 Benzinga.com.

About Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Syndax is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative pipeline of cancer therapies. Our lead product candidate, entinostat, which was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA following positive results from our Phase 2b clinical trial, ENCORE 301, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial for advanced hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer. Given its potential ability to block the function of immune suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment, entinostat is also being evaluated in combination with approved PD-1 antagonists. Ongoing Phase 1b/2 clinical trials combine entinostat with KEYTRUDA from Merck & Co., Inc. for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma; with TECENTRIQ from Genentech, Inc. for TNBC; and with BAVENCIO from Pfizer Inc. and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, for ovarian cancer. Our second product candidate, SNDX-6352, is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the CSF-1 receptor and may also block the function of immune suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment. SNDX-6352 is being evaluated in a single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial and is expected to be developed to treat a variety of cancers.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Rahul Jadhav Global Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Therapeutics Market Analysis and Forecast by 2025 The global non-small cell lung cancer therapeutics market is expected to reach a value of USD 12.2 billion by 2025, based on a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. The non-small cell cancer therapeutics (NSCLC) market is anticipated to witness significant growth during the forecast period. This can be attributed to the high investment by market players in the research and development of lung cancer therapy, presence of a rich pipeline, and increasing penetration of drugs during the forecast period. Browse the report: http://www.orbisresearch.com/reports/index/non-small-cell-lung-cancer-nsclc-therapeutics-market-analysis-by-drug-alimta-iressa-avastin-tarceva-zykadia-tagrisso-xalkori-cyramza-opdivo-alecensa-by-region-north-america-europe-asia-pacific-latin-america-mea-and-segment-forecasts-2014-2025 Introduction of several drugs in various geographical regions is likely to drive the market during the forecast period. For instance, in October 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Alecensa (alectinib), a drug developed by Genentech to treat ALK-positive NSCLC as a first-line treatment. The drug has been approved in the U.S., Japan, Canada, Hong Kong, South Korea, Kuwait, and Israel. Presence of a strong pipeline of drugs for non-small cell lung cancer helps propel the market during the forecast period. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Orion Corporation, Merck KGaA, AstraZeneca, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, and Pfizer, Inc. have major molecules in the pipeline. Request a sample of the report: http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/267661 Further key findings from the study suggest: By drug, Alimta accounted for the highest share in 2015. However, it is expected to witness decline in its share during the forecast period. Alecensa (alectinib) is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period. This is majorly attributed to the clinical benefit of the drug to treat ALK-positive NSCLC. Alecensa is expected to be a competitor to Pfizer’s Xalkori and Merck’s Keytruda during the forecast period. A superior progression-free survival rate of Alecensa was observed in the clinical trials as compared to Crizotinib. Geographically, North America dominated the overall industry in 2015. This is due to the early entry of drugs in the market, increased adoption of new treatment, and high cost of the drug. It is expected that North America would maintain its dominance during the forecast period and grow with the highest rate over the coming years due to expected entry of new drugs. Several players are operating in the industry. Geographical penetration and development of innovative & effective drugs are the key strategies of the players to increase their share. Some of the key players are GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Plc., Novartis AG, AstraZeneca, F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer Inc., Eli Lilly & Company, and Sanofi.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Orphan Drug Market Analysis, Share, Trends and Forecast by 2022 Orbis Research According to Stratistics MRC, the Global Orphan Drug market is estimated at $145.89 million in 2016 and is expected to reach $265.63 million by 2022 growing at a CAGR of 10.5% from 2016 to 2022. Rising focus of big pharmaceutical companies on orphan drug improvement, increasing occurrence of rare diseases, government incentives for orphan medicine are some factors favouring the market growth. However, some factors such as high initial investment that leads to higher per patient treatment cost, reimbursement uncertainties and high cost of drug development are hindering the market. North America registered significant growth for the market during the forecast period due to rising healthcare spending, constructive government initiatives, growing occurrence of chronic diseases and small timeline required for orphan drug development.

The role of an ETF is to provide investors with an investing option that isn’t tied to one sole company. Instead, an ETF will hold a basket of assets – stocks, bonds, commodities – that trades close to its net asset value over the course of the a day. Furthermore, ETFs tend to track an index, making them a prime example for how a sector is performing on any given day. To help make investors aware of some of their options when looking at investing in the pharmaceutical sector, the Investing News Network (INN) looks at the five top ETFs (barring any leveraged ETFs) in the space. Included on the list are: PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals Portfolio ETF (NYSEARCA:PJP) iShares US Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE) SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:XPH) Market Vectors Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:PPH) Market Vectors Generic Drugs ETF (NASDAQ:GNRX) The funds are arranged by the value of their assets. “Trump’s victory could mean the end of Obamacare.

PETER DOCKRILL 1 MAY 2017   For the patients, it was a gamble: if they took part in a new study, they'd be off the waiting list, and would receive a new kidney from an organ donor – but the organ they'd be getting would be one infected with the hepatitis C virus. Those were the terms of two bold clinical studies conducted last year in the US, but for the patients who took part, the gamble paid off. Doctors this week announced that all 20 patients who received donated organs – and subsequently contracted hepatitis C – were able to beat the infection thanks to an antiviral treatment after the transplant.   The approach carries an amount of risk, as there's a chance the patients receiving the organs might never be cured of hepatitis C. But the early success of the two trials run separately by the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University could provide new hope for the hundreds of thousands of patients on organ donation lists around the world. In the US alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting to receive kidney transplants, but despite the level of need, organ donations from people with hepatitis C haven't been possible - with viable kidneys even being thrown out due to the infection. Thanks to the success of these preliminary results, that's something that might change in the future. "We started this trial in the hopes that, if successful, we could open up an entirely new pool of donor organs, and effectively transplant hundreds, if not thousands, more patients who are awaiting a lifesaving organ," says one of the researchers, liver transplant specialist David S. Goldberg from the University of Pennsylvania. "Historically, hepatitis C infected kidneys were often discarded, and were thought to be damaged or too 'high-risk'. Our pilot data demonstrate the ability to cure the contracted virus following transplantation in this patient population."   Last year, Goldberg and his team approached 38 kidney patients on dialysis who had been waiting for a donated organ for at least one and a half years. Once they and their families were informed of the procedure and its risks, 14 provided their consent, with 10 of this group being selected to receive infected kidneys. One of those, Irma Hendricks, describes joining the trial as a "no brainer", having been on dialysis for six months and facing a five-year wait before a donated kidney would be available. "I went to a dialysis centre three days a week," she told Marie McCullough at The Philadelphia Inquirer. "It gave me constant headaches and fatigue. I felt, 'What do I have to lose?' I would rather deal with hep C than dialysis." Like all the other patients in Goldberg's trial, Hendricks did contract the virus when she received her transplant – but all of the group managed to beat the virus thanks to a 12-week course of the oral medication Zepatier, donated by the funder of the study, Merck.   "I feel as good as I felt maybe a decade ago," says one of the patients, Kiran Shelat. "I have lots of energy, I'm sleeping better, and my outlook on life has definitely improved." In a similar but separate trial involving 10 patients at John Hopkins University, the antiviral treatment also successfully eradicated the virus in all participants. The results are only preliminary at the moment, having been announced at the American Transplant Congress in Chicago over the weekend – although the results of the University of Pennsylvania trial were published in a brief letter in The New England Journal of Medicine. But the researchers are optimistic – if larger studies can confirm that the technique is safe, it could mean hundreds of kidneys infected with hepatitis C could potentially be used in transplants in the future. "This has the potential to enable 500 to 1,000 more people to get kidney transplants [annually], just based on how many organs are being discarded now," says surgeon Niraj Desai, who ran the kidney transplant trial at Johns Hopkins University. "So it's very exciting." Moving ahead, the researchers want to expand the trials. The University of Pennsylvania team is now extending the trial to another 10 kidney patients, and plan to conduct new clinical trials in the future, transplanting hearts, livers, and lungs donated by people with the virus. One hurdle with these kinds of treatments could be the high cost of the medications used to combat hepatitis C. The drug used in the trial usually costs US$55,000 for a round of treatment, and another new medication to treat the virus, Harvoni, costs US$94,000. But if the researchers can figure out a way to keep these prices down – such as by devising shorter treatment windows than the 12 weeks used in the clinical trials – there could be an awful lot of promise here. The preliminary results of the University of Pennsylvania trial are published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

In a small trial, transplantation of the infected organs to HCV-negative patients on dialysis led within a few days to HCV viremia in the recipients, according to Peter Reese, MD, of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and colleagues. But treatment with direct-acting agents (DAAs) against the virus cured the infection in all cases and the grafts functioned well, albeit with some early blips, Reese and colleagues reported online in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. HCV infection is often seen as a reason to discard an organ from a deceased donor, Reese and colleagues noted. Indeed, they had reported previously that as many as 500 organs a year -- most of high quality -- are discarded because of HCV infection and others might never have been procured because of concerns that transplant centers would refuse them. The advent of the DAAs, though, has changed the picture. The drugs are almost universally effective in curing HCV with minimal side effects and might allow the safe use of infected organs, Reese and colleagues said. To address the issue, they conducted an open-label, single-group, pilot trial dubbed THINKER (for Transplanting Hepatitis C Kidneys into Negative Kidney Recipients). To be eligible, patients had to be on dialysis, HCV-negative, and expecting a long wait for a kidney transplant. They also had to undergo a special three-step consent process, which included an educational presentation, written informed onset, and a change in their waiting list profile to indicate willingness to have an HCV-infected kidney Patients were excluded if they had conditions that increased the risk of liver disease, graft failure, or death. The transplant kidneys were also carefully selected: they had to be high quality organs and the HCV had to be genotype 1. Overall, the researchers identified 38 potentially eligible patients, of whom 22 attended the educational presentation, and 14 provided written informed consent and had their waiting-list profile changed. Ten of those -- half of them men, 20% black, with a median age of 59 years -- received an infected kidney. The median time from the change in the waiting list profile to transplant was 58 days and the median Kidney Donor Profile Index score was 42%, on a scale in which higher values indicate a greater risk of graft failure. Patients were treated with intravenous glucocorticoids and rabbit antithymocyte globulin, followed by oral tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. The investigators measured HCV in the third day after transplant; all patients were viremic and were started on a fixed-dose, single-pill combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir (Zepatier) for 12 weeks. All recipients were cured, where the investigators defined a cure as no detectable HCV 12 weeks after the end of therapy, the so-called SVR12. After six months, patients' median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg per deciliter with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 62.8 mL per minute per 1.73 m2. One patient had delayed graft function, two had transiently elevated aminotransferase levels, and one developed a transient new class I donor-specific antibody level. As well, one patient who had IgA nephropathy before transplant developed proteinuria, at an estimated level of 2 g per day of urinary protein excretion. Biopsy after SVR12 showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, Reese and colleagues said. The analysis suggests that transplanting HCV-positive kidneys into negative recipients and following the procedure with DAA treatment can provide "potentially excellent allograft function with a cure of HCV infection," the researchers concluded. The study had support from Merck to the University of Pennsylvania and by the Fred and Suzanne Biesecker Pediatric Liver Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Reese disclosed relationships with Merck during the conduct of the study as well as grants from CVS Caremark, grants from Astra-Zeneca/Bristol-Meyers Squibb, and personal fees from COHRDATA outside the submitted work.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Mumps Market Foreseen to Grow Exponentially Over 2017 – 2025 : Persistence Market Research Presently, however, the availability of the vaccine has led to a decrease in the number of cases to fewer than 1,000 a year, and epidemics have also become fairly rare. According to the WHO, in the countries where large-scale immunization against mumps has been applied, the incidence of the disease has dropped radically. However, outbreaks do continue to occur and some immunized individuals, who have been in very close contact with someone who is infected, can still contract the disease. Yet, vaccination is highly crucial in protection against the infectious disease. For instance, in the U.S., in August 2016, dozens were diagnosed with mumps in New York City, and subsequently, greater than 400 people were affected with the virus across Arkansas. The mumps market has been segmented on the basis of type of therapy, end-user and geography. Based on type of therapy, the mumps market has been segmented into preventive and curative therapies. The preventive therapy includes the Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella (MMRV) vaccine and single-unit mumps vaccine. The curative therapies segment includes analgesics for the basic symptom of headache and pain in mumps and antibiotic and anti-inflammatory agents to manage the complications arising from mumps infection. The preventive market is anticipated to garner the highest market share during the forecast period owing to a high rate of immunization for the disease and lower cases of outbreaks. Based on distribution channel, the mumps market has been segmented into hospital pharmacies, retail pharmacies and institutional centers. Hospital and retail pharmacies shall dominate the mumps market during the forecast period. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/13501 Based on geography, the market has been segmented into the following regions: North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. North America is expected to lead the mumps market, owing to higher rates of vaccination coupled with the expensive cost of vaccination and treatment. Moreover, the recent 2016 outbreaks in the U.S. shall increase the demand for mumps preventive and treatment therapies in the immediate future. The mumps market in Asia is anticipated to register the third spot after Europe, which is expected to take second largest share in the market during the forecast period. Since 1993, Japan has ceased using the combination vaccine for mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) in routine immunizations, owing to severe side effects in some vaccine recipients, notably non-viral meningitis. However, in Japan, certain vaccines, such as those for mumps and hepatitis B, are not part of the national immunization programs. Thus, the legal scenario in Japan is likely to promote the indigenous production of a safer MMR vaccine, thus offering less opportunity to global players to invest in the market. In countries that have sound vaccination campaigns, mumps has become quite rare. This is, however, not the case in South Africa since the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR) is only available through the private sector. Thus, effectively priced vaccines could help lower the incidence of mumps in the Africa market. The major players operating in the mumps market include GlaxoSmithKline plc.

Chief Executive Pascal Soriot believes 2017 will mark the trough for the British group, as it starts to put generic losses behind it and builds up sales of recently launched and experimental cancer medicines. "The pipeline continued to deliver in what we expect will be a pivotal year," he said. "The total revenue performance reflected the transitional impact of recent patent expiries, which is expected to recede in the second half of the year." Despite income from disposals and external deals, first-quarter revenue fell 12 percent to $5.4 billion, although core earnings per share (EPS) rose 4 percent in dollar terms to 99 cents - helped by a $161 million one-off gain on the sale of short-term investments. Industry analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $5.4 billion and earnings of 82 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data. So-called "externalisation" revenue, which some analysts argue unduly flatters AstraZeneca's results, rose 2 percent to $562 million, while product sales fell 13 percent to $4.8 billion. "Earnings quality concerns persist," said Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, who rates the stock 'market-perform'. Shares in the company were down 0.5 percent by midday, with analysts noting that several key new drugs had missed consensus sales forecasts, including heart drug Brilinta, Lynparza for ovarian cancer and diabetes treatment Farxiga. AstraZeneca reiterated its expectation that full-year revenue would decline at a low to mid single-digit percentage rate, with core EPS dropping by a low to mid-teens percentage. BIG BET ON CANCER For investors, owning AstraZeneca shares represents a major bet on the company's oncology portfolio. It is already doing well with new lung cancer pill Tagrisso, but the really big opportunity lies in cancer immunotherapy. Results from its closely watched MYSTIC immuno-oncology (I-O) trial in previously untreated lung cancer patients are expected mid-year. Merck &amp; Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche already have similar drugs approved for lung cancer but AstraZeneca hopes to carve out a market by proving the value of combining two I-O drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab. "If combination works in a large range of patients, then certainly our market share should be expected to be pretty high," Soriot told reporters. It is a big 'if' for shareholders, who are waiting to see evidence that AstraZeneca can thrive as an independent company after spurning a takeover bid from Pfizer in 2014. "For long-term investors, the jury remains out on the CEO, who rebuffed the 70 billion pounds ($90 billion) offer made by Pfizer," said EdenTree Investment Management fund manager Ketan Patel. Analysts at Jefferies see a $20 billion opportunity for I-O drugs in first-line, non-small cell lung cancer, with sales split between I-O monotherapy (administering one such medicine on its own); I-O plus conventional chemotherapy; and combinations of two I-O drugs, as in AstraZeneca's approach. Outside cancer, AstraZeneca dropped development of an experimental respiratory treatment licensed from Synairgen , lopping 47 percent off the value of the small British biotech firm.

Chances low getting guideline-recommended meds, study finds MedpageToday savesaved register today Earn Free CME Credits by reading the latest medical news in your specialty.sign up by Nicole Lou Reporter, MedPage Today/CRTonline.org May 01, 2017 This article is a collaboration between MedPage Today® and: Action Points American patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have been unlikely to receive the guideline-directed therapies they need. Note that the study suggests that new healthcare system strategies are required to ensure adequate resource utilization in patients with PAD. American patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have been unlikely to receive the guideline-directed therapies they need, researchers found. From 2005 to 2012, there were 3.9 million annual visits for PAD on average, with doctors only occasionally prescribing medical therapy and lifestyle counseling: antiplatelets (35.7%), statins (33.1%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs; 28.4%), cilostazol (Pletal; 4.7%), and exercise or diet counseling (22%). Moreover, the low use of medication and counseling stayed flat throughout the 8-year study period, reported Jeffrey S. Berger, MD, MS, of NYU School of Medicine, and Joseph A. Ladapo, MD, PhD, of UCLA School of Medicine, writing online in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. "The use of guideline-recommended therapies in patients with PAD was much lower than expected, which highlights an opportunity to improve the quality of care in these high-risk patients," the authors wrote. Patients with comorbid coronary artery disease (CAD; 24.3%) did have better odds of getting certain guideline-directed therapies -- although their chances were not great, either, for being prescribed: Antiplatelets (~53% versus ~33% for peers without CAD, P<0.01) Statins (~48% versus ~32%, P<0.01) ACEI/ARBs (~39% versus ~30%, P<0.05) Smoking-cessation counseling (~60% versus 30%, P<0.01) Additionally, on multivariable adjustment, patients were much more likely to get antiplatelets from their cardiologists than from primary care doctors (~53% versus ~33%, OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9). "New healthcare system strategies are required to ensure adequate resource utilization in patients with PAD," Berger and Ladapo emphasized. "Although much attention is focused on novel therapies in PAD, a refocus on established therapies and healthy behaviors is clearly needed. Attempts to increase patient and physician awareness of the benefits of lifestyle recommendations and secondary prevention may be necessary. In addition, systems of chronic disease management in which the use of nurses, other healthcare providers, or information systems complements the role of physicians also may be helpful. Finally, efforts to monitor the prevention practices taking care of PAD patients may provide new incentives for quality care." In an accompanying editorial, two clinicians emphasized inter-specialty collaboration for better PAD care: "There should be heightened attempts by national societies and others to increase physician and patient awareness of PAD," wrote William R. Hiatt, MD, and R. Kevin Rogers, MD, MSc, both of the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora. "PAD is somewhat unique in that multiple specialties care for this population, and as such, vascular specialists would benefit from increased collaboration among these specialties to provide PAD-specific service lines and to promote health care policies." One policy change of note was the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' recent decision to reimburse supervised exercise for the condition, which the editorialists called "an appropriate step to narrowing the treatment gap for PAD." For the analysis, a random sample of 1,982 outpatient visits was gathered from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The patients (mean age of 69.2 years, 51.8% women, and 56.6% non-Hispanic white) had a diagnosis of PAD. Chief among the study's limitations, however, the authors said, were that the surveys were unable to provide data on PAD severity and symptom status. Furthermore, visits by the same patient could not be accounted for, and there was no information on the reasons patients were not given medication. "It is difficult to explain these rather alarming results of undertreatment in PAD patients," Hiatt and Rogers wrote. "This information is not new." Perhaps the lack of therapies specifically targeting PAD is one factor, the editorialists said. "There may be some confusion as to which antiplatelet therapy is most appropriate in PAD. More clinical trials specifically developing therapies for PAD would certainly improve the treatment options and, hopefully, the overall management of PAD." Berger disclosed financial relationships with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Merck. Ladapo was supported by the NHLBI and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Hiatt reported institutional research grants from Bayer, AstraZeneca, and Janssen. Rogers is on the adjudication committee of the Bayer- and Janssen-sponsored VOYAGER trial.

One thing I make a point to feature in each issue is a detailed screen of some sort for interesting income opportunities. Sometimes I run straightforward, simple screens, like last month’s search for low-cost, high-yield equity income funds. Other months we might track down potential short squeeze candidates, talk about ways to combat inflation or hunt for highly efficient businesses that generate the most revenue per employee. This month, I wanted to get back to basics and pinpoint a few stocks that are poised for meaningful dividend hikes in the near future. According to FactSet Research, dividend distributions among S&P 500 companies have increased for 11 straight quarters. Over the past year, aggregate payments are up 4.8% to $431 billion. That’s the good news. The bad news is that many companies have reached the upper limits of what they can afford to distribute relative to current profits. In fact, 44 members of the S&P 500 (almost 10%) have unsustainable payout ratios above 100%, meaning they aren’t earning enough to cover their dividend payments. Many of these companies may have trouble maintaining their current payout — let alone increasing it. Still, after a mild “earnings recession” in which corporate profits slumped for a few quarters, bottom lines are starting to strengthen again. More than three-fourths (76%) of S&P companies to report first-quarter earnings through April 20 have managed to beat estimates. And the average growth rate of 9.2% is tracking to be the highest since 2011. That has helped fuel a number of recent dividend hikes, some of which have directly benefitted the portfolio holdings in my newsletter. What companies might be next? Well, to answer that question I screened for companies with a strong dividend track record (rising payments for at least the past three consecutive years), a positive 2017 earnings outlook, and ample room for further increases (modest payout ratios below 60%). This test proved tougher than expected. Most companies prefer to make their annual increase in the first quarter and won’t have another raise until next year. The intent here is to pinpoint potential dividend hikes over the next few months — so that eliminates many contenders. 10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every Year The biggest hurdle that tripped up the remaining candidates was an excessive payout ratio. I can’t count the number of quality companies that met all other requirements, only to be eliminated once I found out they were paying out more than 90% of their profits — or 100% in the case of pharma giant Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and a few dozen others. Here are some of the more notable survivors. These are all good potential candidates you might want to consider. But keep in mind, this is just a screen.
