Verubecestat, which is currently under clinical trial, is said to halt the beta amyloid plaque formation in brain.  ( Sean Gallup | Getty Images ) Advertisement One of the drugs developed by Merck, which is currently undergoing clinical trials, reportedly shows promise in treating Alzheimer's disease. Merck's Verubecestat For Alzheimer's The drug verubecestat has been found to be effective against the formation of beta amyloid plaque, the protein buildup in the brain, reports a team from Merck Research Laboratories. However, whether halting the sticky protein buildup could slow down the mental decline in Alzheimer's patients is yet to be studied. If Merck's verubecestat is found effective in treating cognitive decline in the major clinical trials, which are currently underway, it would be the first drug approved for use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in more than a decade. Matt Kennedy, who led the trial, noted that the therapeutic options currently available for Alzheimer's disease improve cognitive symptoms to a small extent but don't treat the underlying causes. Therefore, there is big need for a therapy that targets the root cause of the disease. Merck's Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trial According to the study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine on Nov. 2, the researchers tested verubecestat in 32 patients with early stage Alzheimer's disease. While all the patients received the drug for seven days, the healthy controls were asked to take the drug for two weeks. Though no difference in plaque accumulation was seen in MRI scans, the amount of plaque-forming components in the cerebrospinal fluid samples taken from patients were found to have been reduced. Mechanism Of Action Of Verubecestat Verubecestat blocks the enzyme BACE1, which plays a role in the production of two molecules that link together to form the amyloid plaque. It is noted that people with BACE1 gene mutation are observed to be resistant to Alzheimer's disease. However, this is not the first drug to target BACE1, since a number of attempts made earlier aimed at inhibiting the enzyme failed as a result of side effects that included eye problems and liver toxicity. The clinical trial by Merck involving verubecestat is the first large-scale trial conducted for Alzheimer's by far and the drug is also said to have fewer side effects than those previously tested. It is reported that the drug is being tested in 1,500 patients in very early stages of Alzheimer's disease and 2,000 patients suffering from mild to moderate levels of dementia. The results of first phase of these trials are expected to be out in July 2017. "People are excited," said John Hardy, a neuroscientist at University College London who first reported the role of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer's disease, reported The Guardian. "This is a very nice drug and I'm sure Merck are feeling very pleased with themselves." TAG Alzheimer's Disease, Verubecestat, Merck © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Merck (MerckGroup.com), a leading science and technology company, today announced the kick off of “Merck More than a Patient” which is a new initiative of “Merck Cancer Access Program” in Africa. Merck in partnership with “Women for Cancer” started this initiative with the aim to empower women cancer survivors in Africa through supporting them to establish their own small business so that they can lead an independent and productive life. African Press Organization / APO Merck will also help in raising awareness about Cancer prevention and early detection and tackling the myths and stigma associated with the disease with special focus on women. “I am very happy that “Merck More than a Patient” has this positive impact on these women’s lives. Therefore, this initiative will be launched in other African countries in 2017. Through our collaboration with cancer patients associations and cancer institutions across Africa, we aim to help uplift women cancer survivors to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy – and by doing so, they can now give back to the society through their new businesses. They will become more than cancer patients. In addition to our efforts to raise awareness about early detection and prevention specially addressing Cancer in Women” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer of Merck Healthcare. Benda Kithaka and Co-Founder and Chairperson of”Women for Cancer” emphasized: “We are grateful to Merck for the continued support towards “Women 4 Cancer” survivors and our recent collaboration through the “Merck More than a Patient” initiative. The cancer patients are also appreciative that Merck is assisting them to make strides in gaining financial independence beyond their cancer survivorship. Merck will also help raising awareness about Cancer and tackling myths and stigma associated with the disease, I am hoping we can together empower our communities to access accurate cancer information, which should result in behaviour change coupled with adoption of health seeking behaviour for quality cancer prevention and care”. Read about The women cancer survivors: “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Rose Chiedo, a cervical cancer survivor – read her story … Rose Atieno Chiedo, a 46 year old mother of one who lives in Nairobi, Kenya, is a cervical cancer survivor. Rose used to make and sell samosas before her cancer diagnosis and after her recovery she started to make jewellery in a small scale to cover some of her needs. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Rose to expand her jewellery business enabling her to generate a better and steady income to meet her needs and re-build her life. Below is Rose’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Rose used to complain of lower backaches and suffered from spotting. She went to Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi for further investigation where she found out that she had cervical cancer Stage 2B. “When I was diagnosed with cancer in July 2013 the first thing that came to my mind was death,” Rose says as she narrates her painful journey. “Basically that is what anyone would think. People have a negative attitude towards cancer. The perception is that it cannot be treated” Rose added. Rose corrected the misconception about Cancer saying “Some people think Cancer is as a result of a curse or witchcraft. The truth, Cancer is NOT caused by witchcraft. Although some cancers run in the family and others result from exposure to certain chemicals and infections, many cancers may be due to preventable behavior and dietary risk factors. Many think that once diagnosed with cancer, one can only expect death. The truth is Cancer is NOT a death sentence. One can have good quality of life after cancer diagnosis, they need to seek treatment early, follow medical advice and join a cancer support group. Paying attention to signs and symptoms increases the chance and benefits of early detection and treatment; including better recovery and more affordable treatment costs.” Rose added “I shared the news with my brother and he was shocked. He became very worried about my health and where the money to cater for my treatment would come from as we are orphans. There was no one who could help me other than him. It was a big blow to him because he knew the whole burden would be on him of which he actually took up,” Rose explains. Sad journey of treatment: “From the beginning to the end of my treatment it was just sad because I didn’t have money and I was depending on someone else for support. Before my illness, I used to sell samosas (a fried flour shell filled with minced meat or vegetables and spices) at that time at Ksh 5 per piece. So for 100 samosas I would get Ksh 500 (USD 5) in a day. But I was not able to manage the business as I would get weak and they are very heavy to carry and deliver for customers. So I stopped the business,” Rose says sadly. Rose was able to get treatment (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) in March 2014 after waiting for eight months. In August of the same year there was a recurrence and Rose had to go for further treatment. Women4Cancer a charitable organisation in Kenya supported her to cover her treatment in 2015. Speaking of her treatment Rose says: “The queues are so long at the hospital. It seems like one is fighting a losing battle. But I realized it was not a losing battle when I finished my treatment. And that is when I started fighting to survive.” After recovery, Rose has been making jewellery but on a very small scale to sell and support herself and other needy women. Rose had a dream to expand the business and train other women to generate income so that they become productive members in society. Rose’s jewellery business expanded: “Merck More than a Patient” is a new initiative of Merck Cancer Access Program with the aim to empower women cancer survivors to re-build their shattered lives after the devastating cancer experience. It will help them to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Rose to expand her jewellery business. Moreover, it has enrolled her in the Kenya Chamber of Commerce – Women in Business body, which will help her network with other entrepreneurial women, thus giving her a platform to generate even more business. “What Merck has done is really going to help me to improve my business from small-scale to large-scale. I make my jewelry at home and sell it to my neighbors and friends. This business is something I can do at my convenience. I can carry the beads wherever I am going and I can sit anywhere and do my bead work,” Rose says with confidence and joy. “I would really want to thank “Merck More than a Patient” and really appreciate them because this will help me to improve my life and will also enable me to use better quality materials because I can now be able to afford to buy them,” Rose adds. I am not a patient anymore. I am a survivor and I am a victor! Rose concludes. “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Esther Muthike, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Esther Wakabari Muthike is a 75 year old widow from Kirinyaga in eastern Kenya and is a cancer survivor. Her husband passed away 25 years ago. Before she fell ill, Esther was a farmer who also reared cows for milk. She had to sell her cow to cater for her cancer treatment expenses. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Esther to get a cow from which she is able to get milk to sell to cover her needs. This has enabled Esther to get a steady income to become independent and re-build her life. Below is Esther’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Esther found out that she had cervical cancer in May 2015 at a medical camp organised by Women4Cancer. She was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital for further investigations and treatment in July 2015. She started radiotherapy and chemotherapy in September 2015 and finished treatment in November 2015. “When I was told I had cancer, I knew I would die even if I was being treated. The doctors told us that cancer is incurable,” Esther says. Stigmatised by family and community for having cancer: Esther explains how she was stigmatised by her family and community: “When people heard that I had cancer, they told me to sell all my property because the disease is incurable. People in the community avoided me because they thought I would infect them with cancer. It is only one of my daughters – Susan who stood by me. She is the only one who used to wash my clothes. I had a foul smell and so people avoided me. I could not even go to visit my neighbours either. I could only visit Susan my daughter.” “I used to be a small-scale farmer and I also had a cow that provided me and family with milk to sell some for an income. But I had to sell my cow when I fell ill with cancer. My daughter also sold her goats to help with the expenses,” Esther explains. Esther also stopped farming for a while due to the health issues and treatment procedures. However, after treatment, she went back to farming and hoped for help to buy a cow that would enable her to generate a steady income from the sale of milk to cater for her needs. Esther empowered and independent again: “Merck more than a Patient” initiative aims to empower women cancer survivors in Africa. This initiative has supported Esther to buy a cow to replace the one she sold to cover her treatment and to enable her to meet her needs and become independent again,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. “Merck has really changed my life by giving me a cow. I now feel better. I now get milk to drink and sell. I have money in my hands from the sale of the milk. Previously I was not getting any money. I have named this cow Wambui because of its beauty. Before I used to borrow milk from my neighbours. But now I am enjoying milk from Wambui. Since I got Wambui, I pray for Merck every day that they bless others the way they have blessed me. I am a victor, I am not sick anymore,” Esther says with a smile. “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Margaret Njenga, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Margaret Wanjiku Njenga is a cervical cancer survivor from Kiambu, Kenya. Margaret who is 47 years old is married with six children. She was diagnosed with cancer in August 2013 at a medical camp run by Women4Cancer. She was an active business woman who used to make and sell soap and disinfectants to schools. She also had a cow whose milk she used to sell. She could not continue with the business after she fell ill and she also had to sell her cow. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Margaret to get a cow which is about to give birth and she will have two. Margaret will be able to get a steady income from the sale of milk and be able to educate her children. Below is Margaret’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Margaret explains: “My mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2010. My sisters and I were advised to go for regular cancer screenings as we could also get it as it could be in our genes. I was screened four times and the doctors kept saying they could see something. In each of these times I was given medication. I went for a fifth check-up and the results showed an anomaly. I was advised to go to hospital and I was diagnosed with cancer.” Diagnosed with cancer and stops doing business and farming: At the hospital, Margaret was told she would need to have her uterus removed. “I went home and told my husband that I had cancer. Remembering how much pain my late mother had gone through and the amount of money she had spent on treatment and she still died, I told him it would be better to have my uterus removed so that I can raise my children,” she explains. “It didn’t mean that I would not die but I would have a few more years to live,” she adds. “I would lock myself in the house after my children go school. I would think a lot and cry. I always saw myself dying. Who would take care of my children? I asked myself. My heart was very troubled,” Margaret narrates sadly. “Before I became sick I used to make and sell home-made soap. I would go to schools to look for orders to supply them with the soap. I also started supplying the schools with toilet disinfectant. When I was diagnosed with cancer, I had to stop this job as it required walking long distances,” says Margaret. “A friend who also had her uterus removed loaned me Ksh 10,000 (USD 100) to book for treatment at the hospital. I also had a cow whose milk I used to sell. I had to sell my cow so that I could raise money for my treatment as I did not have the Ksh 30,000 (USD 300) required for the treatment all at once. I was also too stressed such that I could not work,” Margaret adds. Margaret empowered and uplifted: When Margaret came from hospital she was unable to continue with the business she used to do before and they were struggling financially as a family. Their children were sent away from school for lack of fees as the money was not enough as she still had to buy medicine. “Merck More than a Patient” is a new initiative of Merck Cancer Access Program with the aim to empower women cancer survivors to re-build their shattered lives after the devastating cancer experience. It will help them to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. Merck through “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Margaret to buy a cow that will enable her financially through selling milk. “I am very happy because “Merck More than a Patient” has come to my aid and bought me a cow that will help me to continue raising my children. They have uplifted me and I am very happy and may God bless them,” Margaret says with joy. “My cow has a few days before it gives birth. I might be lucky and get a heifer and I will have two cows. From this I will get more milk, have enough to drink and to sell and more money to educate my children. I can now move on with my life and with a grateful heart. We have named the cow Joy because of the joy it has brought back to this home. Merck has really uplifted me and now my life is moving on as I had hoped. I feel strong and able to continue with my life,” Margaret says with satisfaction. “Merck more than a Patient” empowers Loise Njenga, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Loise Wambui Kimani from Dagoretti, Nairobi was diagnosed with cervical cancer in August 2015. Loise who is 45 years and is married with five children has been struggling to take care of her family ever since as she had to stop working as a house help for a living. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Loise to establish a shop from which she is able to get a steady income to cater for her needs and that of her family. Below is Loise’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” “I used to work as a house-help and used to be paid Ksh 6,000 (USD 60) per month which helped me cater for my children’s needs. When I was diagnosed with cancer I continued working but had to stop as I could not cope with the work load,” Loise explains. “I heard that anyone with cancer dies. I imagined I would die. I was in shock. I told my friends I had cancer but most of them told me when you have cancer you don’t live for long that someone just dies. I thought my life had come to an end,” Loise says. Rejected by community and life becomes hard: “People around me rejected me and thought I would infect them with cancer,” Loise says with sadness. “I eventually had my uterus removed and started radiotherapy in January 2016. When I came back home from the hospital, life became very hard. My husband became the sole breadwinner unlike before when we used to help each other. Our combined income used to help sustain the family,” she adds. Loise empowered and is now a victor: Merck through “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Loise establish a shop which is giving her a steady income and enabling her to take care of her family’s needs. “Merck has been very helpful because they have opened a shop for me and I am already enjoying the benefits. This shop is helping me to bring up my children and now I am able to help my husband,” Loise says with a smile. “I would like Merck to continue helping other cancer survivors because the disease is financially draining and when Merck comes in to help the burden becomes lighter. I thank them because they have done great things and God bless them very much. I am doing well, I am healed and I am a victor,” she says. “Merck More than a Patient initiative aims to empower women cancer survivors by helping them to establish a small business in order to generate a steady income to cater for their needs and enable them to re-build their lives,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer Merck Healthcare.

Print Share All News Consumer Pharma New Drugs Pipeline Clinical Trials FDA Alerts Merck Scientists Publish New Research Detailing the Early Development of Verubecestat, an Investigational BACE1 Inhibitor in Science Translational Medicine Tweet KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE) November 2, 2016 --Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the publication of research conducted by Merck scientists on the discovery and development of verubecestat, an investigational small molecule inhibitor of the enzyme beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), for the potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The research was published online in the latest edition of the peer-reviewed journal Science Translational Medicine and includes results from the Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers and people with AD. The efficacy and safety of verubecestat is currently being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, EPOCH and APECS, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD and prodromal AD, respectively. “The development of a potential disease modifying therapy for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease has long been a focus of biomedical research,” said Dr. Michael Egan, vice president, clinical development neurosciences, Merck Research Laboratories. “We believe this research has the potential to contribute important evidence regarding the amyloid hypothesis, a leading scientific theory for what causes Alzheimer’s disease, and we look forward to seeing the data from our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.” BACE1 is an important enzyme in the initiation of the toxic Aβ peptide production in the brain. Researchers believe that sustained, selective inhibition of BACE1 leading to a significant decrease in the toxic Aβ peptide production is a promising means for therapeutic intervention. This hypothesis has not yet been demonstrated in clinical studies. Historically the development of selective BACE1 inhibitors with properties allowing oral absorption and the ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier to the site of action in the brain proved technically challenging. Detailed analysis of the BACE1 protein structure and function by Merck scientists over many years was used to design a series of drug-like compounds with an ability to inhibit the protein, both in vitro and in the central nervous system (CNS) of preclinical animal models. This process yielded the lead compound verubecestat. Verubecestat produced significant CNS Aβ lowering in rodents and non-human primates treated for 6- to 9-months. Verubecestat’s preclinical safety and tolerability profile supported its progression into human clinical testing for chronic use. Subsequent evaluation of once-daily doses of verubecestat in Phase 1 studies of healthy volunteers and in people with AD for a duration of one week demonstrated significant decreases in the levels of Aβ peptide production, a key marker of BACE1 activity, in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of up to 80 percent. Data from patients with AD were initially presented at the 2013 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC). Results of the Phase 1 trial of patients with Alzheimer’s disease The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple dose study evaluated the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profile of verubecestat in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease (n=32). Patients were randomized to receive one of three doses (12 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg) of verubecestat or placebo orally once-daily for seven days. Samples of CSF were collected over 36 hours via a lumbar catheter and analyzed for levels of amyloid β 40 (Aβ40), amyloid β 42 (Aβ42) and soluble amyloid precursor protein β (sAPPβ) as biomarkers of BACE1 activity. In this study, verubecestat at doses of 12, 40 and 60 mg caused a dose-dependent and sustained reduction in the levels of Aβ40 from baseline in the CSF, a measure of BACE1 activity, of 57, 79 and 84 percent, respectively. No study discontinuations due to adverse events were recorded. Analysis of vital signs and laboratory assessments, including liver function tests, showed no statistically significant changes related to the administration of verubecestat. Verubecestat was generally well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and individuals with AD. No dose-dependent increase in the incidence of adverse events was observed. Adverse events included headache, nasal congestion and dizziness. About the EPOCH Study EPOCH is a Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind study evaluating efficacy and safety of two oral doses of verubecestat (12 mg and 40 mg) administered once-daily versus placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate AD currently using standard of care treatment. The primary efficacy outcomes of the study are the change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) score, as well as the change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) score, following 78 weeks of treatment. For more information about the EPOCH study, visit www.merck.com/clinical-trials/infographics/P07738.html. About the APECS Study APECS is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of verubecestat in subjects with prodromal AD. The study is designed to enroll 1,500 participants. Patients will be randomized to receive placebo, or 12 mg or 40 mg verubecestat, once-daily. The primary efficacy outcome of the study is change from baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score following 104 weeks of treatment.

Nov 2, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet “Merck More than a Patient” aims to uplift women cancer survivors to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy. “Merck more than a Patient” aims to raise awareness about Cancer and tackling myths and stigma associated with the disease with special focus on women. Merck (MerckGroup.com), a leading science and technology company, today announced the kick off of “Merck More than a Patient” which is a new initiative of “Merck Cancer Access Program” in Africa. Merck in partnership with “Women for Cancer” started this initiative with the aim to empower women cancer survivors in Africa through supporting them to establish their own small business so that they can lead an independent and productive life. Merck will also help in raising awareness about Cancer prevention and early detection and tackling the myths and stigma associated with the disease with special focus on women. “I am very happy that “Merck More than a Patient” has this positive impact on these women’s lives. Therefore, this initiative will be launched in other African countries in 2017. Through our collaboration with cancer patients associations and cancer institutions across Africa, we aim to help uplift women cancer survivors to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy – and by doing so, they can now give back to the society through their new businesses. They will become more than cancer patients. In addition to our efforts to raise awareness about early detection and prevention specially addressing Cancer in Women” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer of Merck Healthcare. Benda Kithaka and Co-Founder and Chairperson of”Women for Cancer” emphasized: “We are grateful to Merck for the continued support towards “Women 4 Cancer” survivors and our recent collaboration through the “Merck More than a Patient” initiative. The cancer patients are also appreciative that Merck is assisting them to make strides in gaining financial independence beyond their cancer survivorship. Merck will also help raising awareness about Cancer and tackling myths and stigma associated with the disease, I am hoping we can together empower our communities to access accurate cancer information, which should result in behaviour change coupled with adoption of health seeking behaviour for quality cancer prevention and care”. Read about The women cancer survivors: “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Rose Chiedo, a cervical cancer survivor – read her story … Rose Atieno Chiedo, a 46 year old mother of one who lives in Nairobi, Kenya, is a cervical cancer survivor. Rose used to make and sell samosas before her cancer diagnosis and after her recovery she started to make jewellery in a small scale to cover some of her needs. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Rose to expand her jewellery business enabling her to generate a better and steady income to meet her needs and re-build her life. Below is Rose’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Rose used to complain of lower backaches and suffered from spotting. She went to Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi for further investigation where she found out that she had cervical cancer Stage 2B. “When I was diagnosed with cancer in July 2013 the first thing that came to my mind was death,” Rose says as she narrates her painful journey. “Basically that is what anyone would think. People have a negative attitude towards cancer. The perception is that it cannot be treated” Rose added. Rose corrected the misconception about Cancer saying “Some people think Cancer is as a result of a curse or witchcraft. The truth, Cancer is NOT caused by witchcraft. Although some cancers run in the family and others result from exposure to certain chemicals and infections, many cancers may be due to preventable behavior and dietary risk factors. Many think that once diagnosed with cancer, one can only expect death. The truth is Cancer is NOT a death sentence. One can have good quality of life after cancer diagnosis, they need to seek treatment early, follow medical advice and join a cancer support group. Paying attention to signs and symptoms increases the chance and benefits of early detection and treatment; including better recovery and more affordable treatment costs.” Rose added “I shared the news with my brother and he was shocked. He became very worried about my health and where the money to cater for my treatment would come from as we are orphans. There was no one who could help me other than him. It was a big blow to him because he knew the whole burden would be on him of which he actually took up,” Rose explains. Sad journey of treatment: “From the beginning to the end of my treatment it was just sad because I didn’t have money and I was depending on someone else for support. Before my illness, I used to sell samosas (a fried flour shell filled with minced meat or vegetables and spices) at that time at Ksh 5 per piece. So for 100 samosas I would get Ksh 500 (USD 5) in a day. But I was not able to manage the business as I would get weak and they are very heavy to carry and deliver for customers. So I stopped the business,” Rose says sadly. Rose was able to get treatment (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) in March 2014 after waiting for eight months. In August of the same year there was a recurrence and Rose had to go for further treatment. Women4Cancer a charitable organisation in Kenya supported her to cover her treatment in 2015. Speaking of her treatment Rose says: “The queues are so long at the hospital. It seems like one is fighting a losing battle. But I realized it was not a losing battle when I finished my treatment. And that is when I started fighting to survive.” After recovery, Rose has been making jewellery but on a very small scale to sell and support herself and other needy women. Rose had a dream to expand the business and train other women to generate income so that they become productive members in society. Rose’s jewellery business expanded: “Merck More than a Patient” is a new initiative of Merck Cancer Access Program with the aim to empower women cancer survivors to re-build their shattered lives after the devastating cancer experience. It will help them to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Rose to expand her jewellery business. Moreover, it has enrolled her in the Kenya Chamber of Commerce – Women in Business body, which will help her network with other entrepreneurial women, thus giving her a platform to generate even more business. “What Merck has done is really going to help me to improve my business from small-scale to large-scale. I make my jewelry at home and sell it to my neighbors and friends. This business is something I can do at my convenience. I can carry the beads wherever I am going and I can sit anywhere and do my bead work,” Rose says with confidence and joy. “I would really want to thank “Merck More than a Patient” and really appreciate them because this will help me to improve my life and will also enable me to use better quality materials because I can now be able to afford to buy them,” Rose adds. I am not a patient anymore. I am a survivor and I am a victor! Rose concludes. “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Esther Muthike, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Esther Wakabari Muthike is a 75 year old widow from Kirinyaga in eastern Kenya and is a cancer survivor. Her husband passed away 25 years ago. Before she fell ill, Esther was a farmer who also reared cows for milk. She had to sell her cow to cater for her cancer treatment expenses. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Esther to get a cow from which she is able to get milk to sell to cover her needs. This has enabled Esther to get a steady income to become independent and re-build her life. Below is Esther’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Esther found out that she had cervical cancer in May 2015 at a medical camp organised by Women4Cancer. She was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital for further investigations and treatment in July 2015. She started radiotherapy and chemotherapy in September 2015 and finished treatment in November 2015. “When I was told I had cancer, I knew I would die even if I was being treated. The doctors told us that cancer is incurable,” Esther says. Stigmatised by family and community for having cancer: The cancer patients are also appreciative that Merck is assisting them to make strides in gaining financial independence beyond their cancer survivorship Esther explains how she was stigmatised by her family and community: “When people heard that I had cancer, they told me to sell all my property because the disease is incurable. People in the community avoided me because they thought I would infect them with cancer. It is only one of my daughters – Susan who stood by me. She is the only one who used to wash my clothes. I had a foul smell and so people avoided me. I could not even go to visit my neighbours either. I could only visit Susan my daughter.” “I used to be a small-scale farmer and I also had a cow that provided me and family with milk to sell some for an income. But I had to sell my cow when I fell ill with cancer. My daughter also sold her goats to help with the expenses,” Esther explains. Esther also stopped farming for a while due to the health issues and treatment procedures. However, after treatment, she went back to farming and hoped for help to buy a cow that would enable her to generate a steady income from the sale of milk to cater for her needs. Esther empowered and independent again: “Merck more than a Patient” initiative aims to empower women cancer survivors in Africa. This initiative has supported Esther to buy a cow to replace the one she sold to cover her treatment and to enable her to meet her needs and become independent again,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. “Merck has really changed my life by giving me a cow. I now feel better. I now get milk to drink and sell. I have money in my hands from the sale of the milk. Previously I was not getting any money. I have named this cow Wambui because of its beauty. Before I used to borrow milk from my neighbours. But now I am enjoying milk from Wambui. Since I got Wambui, I pray for Merck every day that they bless others the way they have blessed me. I am a victor, I am not sick anymore,” Esther says with a smile. “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Margaret Njenga, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Margaret Wanjiku Njenga is a cervical cancer survivor from Kiambu, Kenya. Margaret who is 47 years old is married with six children. She was diagnosed with cancer in August 2013 at a medical camp run by Women4Cancer. She was an active business woman who used to make and sell soap and disinfectants to schools. She also had a cow whose milk she used to sell. She could not continue with the business after she fell ill and she also had to sell her cow. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Margaret to get a cow which is about to give birth and she will have two. Margaret will be able to get a steady income from the sale of milk and be able to educate her children. Below is Margaret’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Margaret explains: “My mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2010. My sisters and I were advised to go for regular cancer screenings as we could also get it as it could be in our genes. I was screened four times and the doctors kept saying they could see something. In each of these times I was given medication. I went for a fifth check-up and the results showed an anomaly. I was advised to go to hospital and I was diagnosed with cancer.” Diagnosed with cancer and stops doing business and farming: At the hospital, Margaret was told she would need to have her uterus removed. “I went home and told my husband that I had cancer. Remembering how much pain my late mother had gone through and the amount of money she had spent on treatment and she still died, I told him it would be better to have my uterus removed so that I can raise my children,” she explains. “It didn’t mean that I would not die but I would have a few more years to live,” she adds. “I would lock myself in the house after my children go school. I would think a lot and cry. I always saw myself dying. Who would take care of my children? I asked myself. My heart was very troubled,” Margaret narrates sadly. “Before I became sick I used to make and sell home-made soap. I would go to schools to look for orders to supply them with the soap. I also started supplying the schools with toilet disinfectant. When I was diagnosed with cancer, I had to stop this job as it required walking long distances,” says Margaret. “A friend who also had her uterus removed loaned me Ksh 10,000 (USD 100) to book for treatment at the hospital. I also had a cow whose milk I used to sell. I had to sell my cow so that I could raise money for my treatment as I did not have the Ksh 30,000 (USD 300) required for the treatment all at once. I was also too stressed such that I could not work,” Margaret adds. Margaret empowered and uplifted: When Margaret came from hospital she was unable to continue with the business she used to do before and they were struggling financially as a family. Their children were sent away from school for lack of fees as the money was not enough as she still had to buy medicine. “Merck More than a Patient” is a new initiative of Merck Cancer Access Program with the aim to empower women cancer survivors to re-build their shattered lives after the devastating cancer experience. It will help them to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. Merck through “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Margaret to buy a cow that will enable her financially through selling milk. “I am very happy because “Merck More than a Patient” has come to my aid and bought me a cow that will help me to continue raising my children. They have uplifted me and I am very happy and may God bless them,” Margaret says with joy. “My cow has a few days before it gives birth. I might be lucky and get a heifer and I will have two cows. From this I will get more milk, have enough to drink and to sell and more money to educate my children. I can now move on with my life and with a grateful heart. We have named the cow Joy because of the joy it has brought back to this home. Merck has really uplifted me and now my life is moving on as I had hoped. I feel strong and able to continue with my life,” Margaret says with satisfaction. “Merck more than a Patient” empowers Loise Njenga, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Loise Wambui Kimani from Dagoretti, Nairobi was diagnosed with cervical cancer in August 2015. Loise who is 45 years and is married with five children has been struggling to take care of her family ever since as she had to stop working as a house help for a living. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Loise to establish a shop from which she is able to get a steady income to cater for her needs and that of her family. Below is Loise’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” “I used to work as a house-help and used to be paid Ksh 6,000 (USD 60) per month which helped me cater for my children’s needs. When I was diagnosed with cancer I continued working but had to stop as I could not cope with the work load,” Loise explains. “I heard that anyone with cancer dies. I imagined I would die. I was in shock. I told my friends I had cancer but most of them told me when you have cancer you don’t live for long that someone just dies. I thought my life had come to an end,” Loise says. Rejected by community and life becomes hard: “People around me rejected me and thought I would infect them with cancer,” Loise says with sadness. “I eventually had my uterus removed and started radiotherapy in January 2016. When I came back home from the hospital, life became very hard. My husband became the sole breadwinner unlike before when we used to help each other. Our combined income used to help sustain the family,” she adds. Loise empowered and is now a victor: Merck through “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Loise establish a shop which is giving her a steady income and enabling her to take care of her family’s needs. “Merck has been very helpful because they have opened a shop for me and I am already enjoying the benefits. This shop is helping me to bring up my children and now I am able to help my husband,” Loise says with a smile. “I would like Merck to continue helping other cancer survivors because the disease is financially draining and when Merck comes in to help the burden becomes lighter. I thank them because they have done great things and God bless them very much. I am doing well, I am healed and I am a victor,” she says. “Merck More than a Patient initiative aims to empower women cancer survivors by helping them to establish a small business in order to generate a steady income to cater for their needs and enable them to re-build their lives,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer Merck Healthcare.

The acquisition includes remetinostat, a skin-directed HDAC inhibitor, and birinapant, a bivalent SMAC mimetic, and all intellectual property and data associated with Tetralogic's HDAC inhibitor and SMAC mimetic projects. Remetinostat Clinical Program Remetinostat is a topical, skin-directed inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and has a strong link to Medivir's existing expertise in protease inhibition. The compound was designed to effectively inhibit HDACs within cutaneous lesions, but to be rapidly broken down in the bloodstream, preventing the side effects associated with systemically administered HDAC inhibitors. Remetinostat is currently in a late phase II program aimed to treat early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a chronic, orphan hematologic cancer that presents in the skin. There are few drugs available for the treatment of the disease, and those currently available have generally poor tolerability. As a result, patients are in need of safe and effective new treatment options which remetinostat may represent. The estimated addressable market for early-stage CTCL in the US alone is approximately USD 900m annually. Medivir currently plans to start a phase III trial with remetinostat in the second half of 2017. Birinapant Clinical Program Birinapant is a bivalent, second mitochondrial activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetic that binds cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) and induces their degradation. cIAPs are part of the ubiquitin proteasome system, and birinapant therefore ties in well to Medivir's existing interests in modulators of protein ubiquitination. Medivir currently plans to start two different clinical studies with birinapant: A phase I study in combination with KeytrudaTM(pembrolizumab), a PD-1 inhibitor from Merck Co., Inc. (MSD outside of the US and Canada, "MSD"), in patients with solid tumours, subject to transfer to Medivir of the clinical trial agreement between Tetralogic and MSD and receipt of KeytrudaTMsupply. Preclinical studies have shown that SMAC mimetics such as birinapant are able to enhance the response of T-cells to tumour antigens, and the objective of the planned phase I study is to investigate the safety of the combination and the potential of birinapant to enhance response rates seen with KeytrudaTMalone. PD-1 inhibitors such as KeytrudaTMare immuno-oncology products that have substantially improved treatment outcomes for patients with solid tumours. Revenues of PD-1 inhibitors as reported by MSD and Bristol-Myers Squibb in the last twelve months have totalled approximately USD 3.2b. The PD-1 inhibitor market is expected to continue to grow from increasing use and expansion of the number of indications for which they are approved. A phase II program, to investigate birinapant in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment for high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs), including ovarian cancer, in collaboration with clinical investigators at UCLA. The UCLA team have identified that platinum-resistant cells in HGSCs are highly susceptible to birinapant-platinum co-therapy in approximately half of patients, and have developed a bioassay to enable patient selection. High-grade serous carcinomas are tumours that are believed to be derived from cells in the fallopian tube and can present as ovarian, endometrial, tubal or peritoneal cancer. The majority of ovarian cancer cases are high-grade serous carcinomas and these patients have a very poor survival rate. The ovarian cancer market size overall is estimated to be USD 840m, with those patients resistant to platinum treatments representing the group with highest unmet need. Financial Consideration and Third-Party Arrangements The acquisition has been structured to provide an upfront cash payment, but with the majority of financial consideration tied to successful clinical development, regulatory approvals and sales milestones. Medivir will also assume agreements or certain obligations with other third parties, including the MSD agreement regarding KeytrudaTM, subject to confirmation from MSD. The acquisition includes the following potential payments to Tetralogic and other third party licensees: Upfront cash consideration of USD 12m; Remetinostat development milestones through regulatory filings of up to USD 20m; Remetinostat regulatory approval milestones of up to USD 45m; Remetinostat tiered royalties capped at an aggregate of 13%; Additional remetinostat commercialization milestones of up to USD 31m, primarily based on substantial sales achievement levels; Birinapant development milestones and research support of up to USD 20m; Birinapant tiered royalties capped at an aggregate of 10%; and Additional birinapant commercialization milestones of up to USD 110m, primarily based on substantial sales achievement levels. Strategic Overview "This is a transformative transaction for Medivir and an important part of our strategy to expand our pipeline with programs in later stage clinical phases, shifting the balance from research to clinical development. The acquisition enables Medivir to build critical mass in development and secures visible value generation, with expected near-term and continuous news flow from multiple studies. These assets are complementary to our oncology efforts in early phases. Both programs have an excellent fit with the Medivir scientific platforms and we are uniquely positioned to recognize the value of both of Tetralogic's clinical assets," says Niklas Prager, CEO President of Medivir. Richard Bethell, CSO of Medivir continues, "We are excited to have acquired these two projects, both of which have the potential to meaningfully advance the care of cancer patients. Medivir has a track record of discovering and developing drugs that are targeted to specific tissues, so we are well placed to rapidly progress remetinostat for the treatment of early-stage CTCL. Many patients with this disease are urgently in need of new treatments that are both safe and effective. We also believe that birinapant, through its effects on both immune and tumour cells, offers the potential to improve the treatment of a number of different cancers. We look forward to rapidly advancing both of these agents into the next round of clinical studies." Closing Conditions The transaction is subject to confirmation by MSD of agreement transfer to Medivir, the consent of the Tetralogic Senior Noteholders, approval of the Tetralogic shareholders and other customary closing conditions. Medivir expects the transaction to close by year end 2016. Advisors Medivir's legal advisor is Wiggin and Dana LLP.

Nearly a decade on not much has changed for patients. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/REX Hannah Devlin Science correspondent @hannahdev Wednesday 2 November 2016 14.57 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 2 November 2016 18.00 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger When Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s he recalled his wife’s relief that he hadn’t got a brain tumour. “All I could think then was, ‘I know three people who have got better after having a brain tumour. I haven’t heard of anyone who’s got better from Alzheimer’s,’” the late author wrote in 2008. Nearly a decade on, not much has changed for people facing a new diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. Unlike patients with heart disease, cancer or diabetes, there is no well-trodden medical track to follow and no treatments that can slow the disease’s devastating progress. Between 2002 and 2012, 99.6% of drugs studies aimed at preventing, curing or improving Alzheimer’s symptoms were either halted or discontinued. The consistent failure of trials, at vast financial cost to drugs companies, caused many to shut down dementia programmes as a result. The latest trial results from Merck, together with other drugs in the final stage of development, provide hope that the years of deadlock may be drawing to a close. The Merck trial may be preliminary, in the clinical sense, but it represents an entire career’s work for some of the scientists involved. “We’re 16 years into the program,” said Matt Kennedy, the neuroscience director at Merck who led the research. “It’s a good example of how long it takes.” How BACE1 blocking drug could reduce toxic proteins in Alzheimer's patients. The first challenge scientists faced was creating a compound that would get through the blood-brain barrier, without also causing toxic side-effects or damaging healthy structures in the brain. Simply optimising the structure of the compound to do this took a decade, Kennedy said. The latest results appear to show that the scientists got this bit right - the drug appeared to have few side-effects and it substantially lowered levels of toxic amyloid compounds. The real question, which the next phase of the trial should answer, is whether the formation of plaques are a root cause of the disease or simply a visible symptom. Previous drugs aimed at clearing abnormal tangles of proteins from the brain have not been successful, and some argue that by the time the plaques are present irreparable brain damage may have already occurred. It is possible that previous drugs based on the so-called amyloid hypothesis, were given to patients whose disease was too far advanced for them to benefit. Merck hopes that its drug, which acts at an earlier stage in the disease process by shutting down the production of the misshapen proteins rather than clearing them once they appear, will fare better. There is no guarantee that the drug will ultimately make it to market, but in a field that has seen such scant progress, the fact that a major clinical trial is underway is welcome news. Professor John Hardy, a neuroscientist at University College London and pioneer in the study of Alzheimer’s disease, said: “Conveying some excitement isn’t the wrong thing to do in this case.” More analysis Topics Alzheimer's Neuroscience Health Medical research Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home election 2016 US world opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home election 2016 US world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Society › Alzheimer's Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2016 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Merck, a leading science and technology company, on Wednesday, November 2, announced the kick off of “Merck More than a Patient” which is a new initiative of “Merck Cancer Access Program” in Africa. Merck in partnership with “Women for Cancer” started this initiative with the aim to empower women cancer survivors in Africa through supporting them to establish their own small business so that they can lead an independent and productive life. Merck will also help in raising awareness about Cancer prevention and early detection and tackling the myths and stigma associated with the disease with special focus on women. “I am very happy that “Merck More than a Patient” has this positive impact on these women’s lives. Therefore, this initiative will be launched in other African countries in 2017. Through our collaboration with cancer patients associations and cancer institutions across Africa, we aim to help uplift women cancer survivors to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy – and by doing so, they can now give back to the society through their new businesses. They will become more than cancer patients. In addition to our efforts to raise awareness about early detection and prevention specially addressing Cancer in Women” say Rasha Kelej, chief social officer of Merck Healthcare, said. Benda Kithaka and co-founder and chairperson of “Women for Cancer” emphasised: “We are grateful to Merck for the continued support towards “Women 4 Cancer” survivors and our recent collaboration through the “Merck More than a Patient” initiative. The cancer patients are also appreciative that Merck is assisting them to make strides in gaining financial independence beyond their cancer survivorship. Merck will also help raising awareness about Cancer and tackling myths and stigma associated with the disease, I am hoping we can together empower our communities to access accurate cancer information, which should result in behaviour change coupled with adoption of health seeking behaviour for quality cancer prevention and care.” “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Rose Chiedo, a cervical cancer survivor – read her story … Rose Atieno Chiedo, a 46 year old mother of one who lives in Nairobi, Kenya, is a cervical cancer survivor. Rose used to make and sell samosas before her cancer diagnosis and after her recovery she started to make jewellery in a small scale to cover some of her needs. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Rose to expand her jewellery business enabling her to generate a better and steady income to meet her needs and re-build her life. Chiedo used to complain of lower backaches and suffered from spotting. She went to Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi for further investigation where she found out that she had cervical cancer Stage 2B. “When I was diagnosed with cancer in July 2013 the first thing that came to my mind was death,” Chiedo said as she narrated her painful journey. “Basically that is what anyone would think. People have a negative attitude towards cancer. The perception is that it cannot be treated,” Chiedo said. She corrected the misconception about cancer saying: “Some people think cancer is as a result of a curse or witchcraft. The truth, cancer is NOT caused by witchcraft. Although some cancers run in the family and others result from exposure to certain chemicals and infections, many cancers may be due to preventable behaviour and dietary risk factors. Many think that once diagnosed with cancer, one can only expect death. The truth is cancer is NOT a death sentence. One can have good quality of life after cancer diagnosis, they need to seek treatment early, follow medical advice and join a cancer support group. Paying attention to signs and symptoms increases the chance and benefits of early detection and treatment; including better recovery and more affordable treatment costs. “I shared the news with my brother and he was shocked. He became very worried about my health and where the money to cater for my treatment would come from as we are orphans. There was no one who could help me other than him. It was a big blow to him because he knew the whole burden would be on him of which he actually took up.” “From the beginning to the end of my treatment it was just sad because I didn’t have money and I was depending on someone else for support. Before my illness, I used to sell samosas (a fried flour shell filled with minced meat or vegetables and spices) at that time at Ksh 5 per piece. So for 100 samosas I would get Ksh 500 (USD 5) in a day. But I was not able to manage the business as I would get weak and they are very heavy to carry and deliver for customers. So I stopped the business,” Rose said sadly. Rose was able to get treatment (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) in March 2014 after waiting for eight months. In August of the same year there was a recurrence and Rose had to go for further treatment. Women4Cancer a charitable organisation in Kenya supported her to cover her treatment in 2015. Speaking of her treatment Chiedo said: “The queues are so long at the hospital. It seems like one is fighting a losing battle. But I realized it was not a losing battle when I finished my treatment. And that is when I started fighting to survive.” After recovery, Chiedo has been making jewellery but on a very small scale to sell and support herself and other needy women. Chiedo had a dream to expand the business and train other women to generate income so that they become productive members in society. “Merck More than a Patient” is a new initiative of Merck Cancer Access Programme with the aim to empower women cancer survivors to re-build their shattered lives after the devastating cancer experience. It will help them to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy,” Kelej said. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Rose to expand her jewellery business. Moreover, it has enrolled her in the Kenya Chamber of Commerce – Women in Business body, which will help her network with other entrepreneurial women, thus giving her a platform to generate even more business. “What Merck has done is really going to help me to improve my business from small-scale to large-scale. I make my jewellery at home and sell it to my neighbours and friends. This business is something I can do at my convenience. I can carry the beads wherever I am going and I can sit anywhere and do my bead work,” Chiedo said with confidence and joy. “I would really want to thank “Merck More than a Patient” and really appreciate them because this will help me to improve my life and will also enable me to use better quality materials because I can now be able to afford to buy them,” Chiedo added. “I am not a patient anymore. I am a survivor and I am a victor!” Rose concluded. Another cervical cancer survivor is Esther Muthike. Muthike is a 75 year old widow from Kirinyaga in eastern Kenya and is a cancer survivor. Her husband passed away 25 years ago. Before she fell ill, Esther was a farmer who also reared cows for milk. She had to sell her cow to cater for her cancer treatment expenses. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Esther to get a cow from which she is able to get milk to sell to cover her needs. This has enabled Muthike to get a steady income to become independent and re-build her life. Muthike found out that she had cervical cancer in May 2015 at a medical camp organised by Women4Cancer. She was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital for further investigations and treatment in July 2015. She started radiotherapy and chemotherapy in September 2015 and finished treatment in November 2015. “When I was told I had cancer, I knew I would die even if I was being treated. The doctors told us that cancer is incurable,” she said. Muthike disclosed how she was stigmatised by her family and community: “When people heard that I had cancer, they told me to sell all my property because the disease is incurable. People in the community avoided me because they thought I would infect them with cancer. It is only one of my daughters – Susan who stood by me. She is the only one who used to wash my clothes. I had a foul smell and so people avoided me. I could not even go to visit my neighbours either. I could only visit Susan my daughter. “I used to be a small-scale farmer and I also had a cow that provided me and family with milk to sell some for an income. But I had to sell my cow when I fell ill with cancer. My daughter also sold her goats to help with the expenses.” Muthike also stopped farming for a while due to the health issues and treatment procedures. However, after treatment, she went back to farming and hoped for help to buy a cow that would enable her to generate a steady income from the sale of milk to cater for her needs. “Merck more than a Patient” initiative aims to empower women cancer survivors in Africa. This initiative has supported Esther to buy a cow to replace the one she sold to cover her treatment and to enable her to meet her needs and become independent again,” Kelej said. “Merck has really changed my life by giving me a cow.  I now feel better. I now get milk to drink and sell. I have money in my hands from the sale of the milk. Previously I was not getting any money. I have named this cow Wambui because of its beauty. Before I used to borrow milk from my neighbours. But now I am enjoying milk from Wambui. Since I got Wambui, I pray for Merck every day that they bless others the way they have blessed me. I am a victor, I am not sick anymore,” Muthike said with a smile. Another beneficiary of “Merck More than a Patient” is Margaret Njenga, a cervical cancer survivor.  Njenga is a cervical cancer survivor from Kiambu, Kenya. Margaret who is 47 years old is married with six children. She was diagnosed with cancer in August 2013 at a medical camp run by Women4Cancer. She was an active business woman who used to make and sell soap and disinfectants to schools. She also had a cow whose milk she used to sell. She could not continue with the business after she fell ill and she also had to sell her cow. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Margaret to get a cow which is about to give birth and she will have two. Margaret will be able to get a steady income from the sale of milk and be able to educate her children. Njenga explained: “My mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2010. My sisters and I were advised to go for regular cancer screenings as we could also get it as it could be in our genes. I was screened four times and the doctors kept saying they could see something. In each of these times I was given medication. I went for a fifth check-up and the results showed an anomaly. I was advised to go to hospital and I was diagnosed with cancer.” At the hospital, Njenga was told she would need to have her uterus removed. “I went home and told my husband that I had cancer. Remembering how much pain my late mother had gone through and the amount of money she had spent on treatment and she still died, I told him it would be better to have my uterus removed so that I can raise my children,” she explained. “It didn’t mean that I would not die but I would have a few more years to live. “I would lock myself in the house after my children go school. I would think a lot and cry. I always saw myself dying. Who would take care of my children? I asked myself. My heart was very troubled,” Njenga said sadly. She said further: “Before I became sick I used to make and sell home-made soap. I would go to schools to look for orders to supply them with the soap. I also started supplying the schools with toilet disinfectant. When I was diagnosed with cancer, I had to stop this job as it required walking long distances. “A friend who also had her uterus removed loaned me Ksh 10,000 (USD 100) to book for treatment at the hospital. I also had a cow whose milk I used to sell. I had to sell my cow so that I could raise money for my treatment as I did not have the  Ksh 30,000 (USD 300) required for the treatment all at once. I was also too stressed such that I could not work.” When Njenga came from hospital she was unable to continue with the business she used to do before and they were struggling financially as a family. Their children were sent away from school for lack of fees as the money was not enough as she still had to buy medicine. “Merck More than a Patient” is a new initiative of Merck Cancer Access Program with the aim to empower women cancer survivors to re-build their shattered lives after the devastating cancer experience. It will help them to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy,” Kelej said. Merck through “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Margaret to buy a cow that will enable her financially through selling milk. “I am very happy because “Merck More than a Patient” has come to my aid and bought me a cow that will help me to continue raising my children. They have uplifted me and I am very happy and may God bless them,” Njenga said with joy. “My cow has a few days before it gives birth. I might be lucky and get a heifer and I will have two cows. From this I will get more milk, have enough to drink and to sell and more money to educate my children. I can now move on with my life and with a grateful heart. We have named the cow Joy because of the joy it has brought back to this home. Merck has really uplifted me and now my life is moving on as I had hoped. I feel strong and able to continue with my life,” Margaret says with satisfaction. Another lucky one is Loise Wambui Kimani from Dagoretti, Nairobi. She was diagnosed with cervical cancer in August 2015. Loise who is 45 years and is married with five children has been struggling to take care of her family ever since as she had to stop working as a house help for a living. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Kimani to establish a shop from which she is able to get a steady income to cater for her needs and that of her family. “I used to work as a house-help and used to be paid Ksh 6,000 (USD 60) per month which helped me cater for my children’s needs. When I was diagnosed with cancer I continued working but had to stop as I could not cope with the work load,” Kimani explained. “I heard that anyone with cancer dies. I imagined I would die. I was in shock. I told my friends I had cancer but most of them told me when you have cancer you don’t live for long that someone just dies. I thought my life had come to an end,” Kimani said. “People around me rejected me and thought I would infect them with cancer,” Kimani said with sadness. “I eventually had my uterus removed and started radiotherapy in January 2016. When I came back home from the hospital, life became very hard. My husband became the sole breadwinner unlike before when we used to help each other. Our combined income used to help sustain the family,” she added. Merck through “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Kimani establish a shop which is giving her a steady income and enabling her to take care of her family’s needs. “Merck has been very helpful because they have opened a shop for me and I am already enjoying the benefits. This shop is helping me to bring up my children and now I am able to help my husband,” Kimani said with a smile. “I would like Merck to continue helping other cancer survivors because the disease is financially draining and when Merck comes in to help the burden becomes lighter. I thank them because they have done great things and God bless them very much. I am doing well, I am healed and I am a victor,” she said. “Merck More than a Patient initiative aims to empower women cancer survivors by helping them to establish a small business in order to generate a steady income to cater for their needs and enable them to re-build their lives,” Kelej said. —  Nov 2, 2016 @ 18:15 GMT | No Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

About Atacicept  Atacicept is a potential treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Atacicept, a recombinant fusion protein, contains the soluble TACI receptor that binds to the cytokines BLyS and APRIL. These cytokines are members of the tumor necrosis factor family that promote B-cell survival and autoantibody production associated with certain autoimmune diseases such as SLE. Atacicept has been shown in animal models to affect several stages of B-cell development and may inhibit the survival of cells responsible for making antibodies. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, acquired exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights for atacicept, including in North America, from Zymogenetics in 2008.   Atacicept is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)   Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease, where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common form of lupus and can result in swollen, painful joints, skin rash, extreme fatigue and kidney damage. Estimates vary widely, but SLE may affect as many 300,000 patients in the U.S. alone. Women and individuals with African, Asian, and Hispanic heritage are affected disproportionately by SLE.

Merck (MerckGroup.com), a leading science and technology company, today announced the kick off of “Merck More than a Patient” which is a new initiative of “Merck Cancer Access Program” in Africa. Merck in partnership with “Women for Cancer” started this initiative with the aim to empower women cancer survivors in Africa through supporting them to establish their own small business so that they can lead an independent and productive life. Merck will also help in raising awareness about Cancer prevention and early detection and tackling the myths and stigma associated with the disease with special focus on women. “I am very happy that “Merck More than a Patient” has this positive impact on these women’s lives. Therefore, this initiative will be launched in other African countries in 2017. Through our collaboration with cancer patients associations and cancer institutions across Africa, we aim to help uplift women cancer survivors to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy – and by doing so, they can now give back to the society through their new businesses. They will become more than cancer patients. In addition to our efforts to raise awareness about early detection and prevention specially addressing Cancer in Women” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer of Merck Healthcare. Benda Kithaka and Co-Founder and Chairperson of”Women for Cancer” emphasized: “We are grateful to Merck for the continued support towards “Women 4 Cancer” survivors and our recent collaboration through the “Merck More than a Patient” initiative. The cancer patients are also appreciative that Merck is assisting them to make strides in gaining financial independence beyond their cancer survivorship. Merck will also help raising awareness about Cancer and tackling myths and stigma associated with the disease, I am hoping we can together empower our communities to access accurate cancer information, which should result in behaviour change coupled with adoption of health seeking behaviour for quality cancer prevention and care”. Read about The women cancer survivors: “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Rose Chiedo, a cervical cancer survivor - read her story … Rose Atieno Chiedo, a 46 year old mother of one who lives in Nairobi, Kenya, is a cervical cancer survivor. Rose used to make and sell samosas before her cancer diagnosis and after her recovery she started to make jewellery in a small scale to cover some of her needs. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Rose to expand her jewellery business enabling her to generate a better and steady income to meet her needs and re-build her life. Below is Rose’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Rose used to complain of lower backaches and suffered from spotting. She went to Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi for further investigation where she found out that she had cervical cancer Stage 2B. “When I was diagnosed with cancer in July 2013 the first thing that came to my mind was death,” Rose says as she narrates her painful journey. “Basically that is what anyone would think. People have a negative attitude towards cancer. The perception is that it cannot be treated” Rose added. Rose corrected the misconception about Cancer saying “Some people think Cancer is as a result of a curse or witchcraft. The truth, Cancer is NOT caused by witchcraft. Although some cancers run in the family and others result from exposure to certain chemicals and infections, many cancers may be due to preventable behavior and dietary risk factors. Many think that once diagnosed with cancer, one can only expect death. The truth is Cancer is NOT a death sentence. One can have good quality of life after cancer diagnosis, they need to seek treatment early, follow medical advice and join a cancer support group. Paying attention to signs and symptoms increases the chance and benefits of early detection and treatment; including better recovery and more affordable treatment costs.” Rose added    “I shared the news with my brother and he was shocked. He became very worried about my health and where the money to cater for my treatment would come from as we are orphans. There was no one who could help me other than him. It was a big blow to him because he knew the whole burden would be on him of which he actually took up,” Rose explains. Sad journey of treatment: “From the beginning to the end of my treatment it was just sad because I didn’t have money and I was depending on someone else for support. Before my illness, I used to sell samosas (a fried flour shell filled with minced meat or vegetables and spices) at that time at Ksh 5 per piece. So for 100 samosas I would get Ksh 500 (USD 5) in a day. But I was not able to manage the business as I would get weak and they are very heavy to carry and deliver for customers. So I stopped the business,” Rose says sadly. Rose was able to get treatment (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) in March 2014 after waiting for eight months. In August of the same year there was a recurrence and Rose had to go for further treatment. Women4Cancer a charitable organisation in Kenya supported her to cover her treatment in 2015. Speaking of her treatment Rose says: “The queues are so long at the hospital. It seems like one is fighting a losing battle. But I realized it was not a losing battle when I finished my treatment. And that is when I started fighting to survive.” After recovery, Rose has been making jewellery but on a very small scale to sell and support herself and other needy women. Rose had a dream to expand the business and train other women to generate income so that they become productive members in society. Rose’s jewellery business expanded: “Merck More than a Patient” is a new initiative of Merck Cancer Access Program with the aim to empower women cancer survivors to re-build their shattered lives after the devastating cancer experience. It will help them to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Rose to expand her jewellery business. Moreover, it has enrolled her in the Kenya Chamber of Commerce - Women in Business body, which will help her network with other entrepreneurial women, thus giving her a platform to generate even more business. “What Merck has done is really going to help me to improve my business from small-scale to large-scale. I make my jewelry at home and sell it to my neighbors and friends. This business is something I can do at my convenience. I can carry the beads wherever I am going and I can sit anywhere and do my bead work,” Rose says with confidence and joy. “I would really want to thank “Merck More than a Patient” and really appreciate them because this will help me to improve my life and will also enable me to use better quality materials because I can now be able to afford to buy them,” Rose adds. I am not a patient anymore. I am a survivor and I am a victor! Rose concludes. “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Esther Muthike, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Esther Wakabari Muthike is a 75 year old widow from Kirinyaga in eastern Kenya and is a cancer survivor. Her husband passed away 25 years ago. Before she fell ill, Esther was a farmer who also reared cows for milk. She had to sell her cow to cater for her cancer treatment expenses. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Esther to get a cow from which she is able to get milk to sell to cover her needs. This has enabled Esther to get a steady income to become independent and re-build her life. Below is Esther’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Esther found out that she had cervical cancer in May 2015 at a medical camp organised by Women4Cancer. She was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital for further investigations and treatment in July 2015. She started radiotherapy and chemotherapy in September 2015 and finished treatment in November 2015. “When I was told I had cancer, I knew I would die even if I was being treated. The doctors told us that cancer is incurable,” Esther says. Stigmatised by family and community for having cancer: Esther explains how she was stigmatised by her family and community: “When people heard that I had cancer, they told me to sell all my property because the disease is incurable. People in the community avoided me because they thought I would infect them with cancer. It is only one of my daughters - Susan who stood by me. She is the only one who used to wash my clothes. I had a foul smell and so people avoided me. I could not even go to visit my neighbours either. I could only visit Susan my daughter.” “I used to be a small-scale farmer and I also had a cow that provided me and family with milk to sell some for an income. But I had to sell my cow when I fell ill with cancer. My daughter also sold her goats to help with the expenses,” Esther explains. Esther also stopped farming for a while due to the health issues and treatment procedures. However, after treatment, she went back to farming and hoped for help to buy a cow that would enable her to generate a steady income from the sale of milk to cater for her needs. Esther empowered and independent again: “Merck more than a Patient” initiative aims to empower women cancer survivors in Africa. This initiative has supported Esther to buy a cow to replace the one she sold to cover her treatment and to enable her to meet her needs and become independent again,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. “Merck has really changed my life by giving me a cow.  I now feel better. I now get milk to drink and sell. I have money in my hands from the sale of the milk. Previously I was not getting any money. I have named this cow Wambui because of its beauty. Before I used to borrow milk from my neighbours. But now I am enjoying milk from Wambui. Since I got Wambui, I pray for Merck every day that they bless others the way they have blessed me. I am a victor, I am not sick anymore,” Esther says with a smile. “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Margaret Njenga, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Margaret Wanjiku Njenga is a cervical cancer survivor from Kiambu, Kenya. Margaret who is 47 years old is married with six children. She was diagnosed with cancer in August 2013 at a medical camp run by Women4Cancer.

Margaret will be able to get a steady income from the sale of milk and be able to educate her children. Below is Margaret’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Margaret explains: “My mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2010. My sisters and I were advised to go for regular cancer screenings as we could also get it as it could be in our genes. I was screened four times and the doctors kept saying they could see something. In each of these times I was given medication. I went for a fifth check-up and the results showed an anomaly. I was advised to go to hospital and I was diagnosed with cancer.” Diagnosed with cancer and stops doing business and farming: At the hospital, Margaret was told she would need to have her uterus removed. “I went home and told my husband that I had cancer. Remembering how much pain my late mother had gone through and the amount of money she had spent on treatment and she still died, I told him it would be better to have my uterus removed so that I can raise my children,” she explains. “It didn’t mean that I would not die but I would have a few more years to live,” she adds. “I would lock myself in the house after my children go school. I would think a lot and cry. I always saw myself dying. Who would take care of my children? I asked myself. My heart was very troubled,” Margaret narrates sadly. “Before I became sick I used to make and sell home-made soap. I would go to schools to look for orders to supply them with the soap. I also started supplying the schools with toilet disinfectant. When I was diagnosed with cancer, I had to stop this job as it required walking long distances,” says Margaret. “A friend who also had her uterus removed loaned me Ksh 10,000 (USD 100) to book for treatment at the hospital. I also had a cow whose milk I used to sell. I had to sell my cow so that I could raise money for my treatment as I did not have the  Ksh 30,000 (USD 300) required for the treatment all at once. I was also too stressed such that I could not work,” Margaret adds. Margaret empowered and uplifted: When Margaret came from hospital she was unable to continue with the business she used to do before and they were struggling financially as a family. Their children were sent away from school for lack of fees as the money was not enough as she still had to buy medicine. “Merck More than a Patient” is a new initiative of Merck Cancer Access Program with the aim to empower women cancer survivors to re-build their shattered lives after the devastating cancer experience. It will help them to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare.

They have uplifted me and I am very happy and may God bless them,” Margaret says with joy. “My cow has a few days before it gives birth. I might be lucky and get a heifer and I will have two cows. From this I will get more milk, have enough to drink and to sell and more money to educate my children. I can now move on with my life and with a grateful heart. We have named the cow Joy because of the joy it has brought back to this home. Merck has really uplifted me and now my life is moving on as I had hoped. I feel strong and able to continue with my life,” Margaret says with satisfaction. “Merck more than a Patient” empowers Loise Njenga, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Loise Wambui Kimani from Dagoretti, Nairobi was diagnosed with cervical cancer in August 2015.

Merck (MerckGroup.com), a leading science and technology company, today announced the kick off of “Merck More than a Patient” which is a new initiative of “Merck Cancer Access Program” in Africa. Merck in partnership with “Women for Cancer” started this initiative with the aim to empower women cancer survivors in Africa through supporting them to establish their own small business so that they can lead an independent and productive life. Merck will also help in raising awareness about Cancer prevention and early detection and tackling the myths and stigma associated with the disease with special focus on women. “I am very happy that “Merck More than a Patient” has this positive impact on these women’s lives.

The cancer patients are also appreciative that Merck is assisting them to make strides in gaining financial independence beyond their cancer survivorship. Merck will also help raising awareness about Cancer and tackling myths and stigma associated with the disease, I am hoping we can together empower our communities to access accurate cancer information, which should result in behaviour change coupled with adoption of health seeking behaviour for quality cancer prevention and care”. Read about The women cancer survivors: “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Rose Chiedo, a cervical cancer survivor - read her story … Rose Atieno Chiedo, a 46 year old mother of one who lives in Nairobi, Kenya, is a cervical cancer survivor. Rose used to make and sell samosas before her cancer diagnosis and after her recovery she started to make jewellery in a small scale to cover some of her needs. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Rose to expand her jewellery business enabling her to generate a better and steady income to meet her needs and re-build her life. Below is Rose’s story before and after meeting “Merck More than a Patient.” Rose used to complain of lower backaches and suffered from spotting. She went to Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi for further investigation where she found out that she had cervical cancer Stage 2B. “When I was diagnosed with cancer in July 2013 the first thing that came to my mind was death,” Rose says as she narrates her painful journey. “Basically that is what anyone would think. People have a negative attitude towards cancer. The perception is that it cannot be treated” Rose added. Rose corrected the misconception about Cancer saying “Some people think Cancer is as a result of a curse or witchcraft. The truth, Cancer is NOT caused by witchcraft. Although some cancers run in the family and others result from exposure to certain chemicals and infections, many cancers may be due to preventable behavior and dietary risk factors. Many think that once diagnosed with cancer, one can only expect death. The truth is Cancer is NOT a death sentence. One can have good quality of life after cancer diagnosis, they need to seek treatment early, follow medical advice and join a cancer support group. Paying attention to signs and symptoms increases the chance and benefits of early detection and treatment; including better recovery and more affordable treatment costs.” Rose added    “I shared the news with my brother and he was shocked. He became very worried about my health and where the money to cater for my treatment would come from as we are orphans. There was no one who could help me other than him. It was a big blow to him because he knew the whole burden would be on him of which he actually took up,” Rose explains. Sad journey of treatment: “From the beginning to the end of my treatment it was just sad because I didn’t have money and I was depending on someone else for support. Before my illness, I used to sell samosas (a fried flour shell filled with minced meat or vegetables and spices) at that time at Ksh 5 per piece. So for 100 samosas I would get Ksh 500 (USD 5) in a day. But I was not able to manage the business as I would get weak and they are very heavy to carry and deliver for customers. So I stopped the business,” Rose says sadly. Rose was able to get treatment (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) in March 2014 after waiting for eight months. In August of the same year there was a recurrence and Rose had to go for further treatment. Women4Cancer a charitable organisation in Kenya supported her to cover her treatment in 2015. Speaking of her treatment Rose says: “The queues are so long at the hospital. It seems like one is fighting a losing battle. But I realized it was not a losing battle when I finished my treatment. And that is when I started fighting to survive.” After recovery, Rose has been making jewellery but on a very small scale to sell and support herself and other needy women. Rose had a dream to expand the business and train other women to generate income so that they become productive members in society. Rose’s jewellery business expanded: “Merck More than a Patient” is a new initiative of Merck Cancer Access Program with the aim to empower women cancer survivors to re-build their shattered lives after the devastating cancer experience. It will help them to reclaim their lives and become active contributors to the economy,” says Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. “Merck More than a Patient” has helped Rose to expand her jewellery business. Moreover, it has enrolled her in the Kenya Chamber of Commerce - Women in Business body, which will help her network with other entrepreneurial women, thus giving her a platform to generate even more business. “What Merck has done is really going to help me to improve my business from small-scale to large-scale. I make my jewelry at home and sell it to my neighbors and friends. This business is something I can do at my convenience. I can carry the beads wherever I am going and I can sit anywhere and do my bead work,” Rose says with confidence and joy. “I would really want to thank “Merck More than a Patient” and really appreciate them because this will help me to improve my life and will also enable me to use better quality materials because I can now be able to afford to buy them,” Rose adds. I am not a patient anymore. I am a survivor and I am a victor! Rose concludes. “Merck More than a Patient” empowers Esther Muthike, a cervical cancer survivor – Read her story Esther Wakabari Muthike is a 75 year old widow from Kirinyaga in eastern Kenya and is a cancer survivor.

The licence agreement provides Merck with access to a pioneering technology to prepare fluorescent peptides as tools to understand how disease progresses in early stages and with improved resolution. 'At Merck, we are always looking for innovative ideas to enhance our customers research efforts. This compound from the University of Edinburgh offers researchers a way to fluorescently label peptides that has minimal interference with peptide structure. This will enable biological discovery and complement our portfolio of chemical biology tools,' said Udit Batra, Member of the Merck Executive Board, and CEO Life Science. A research team from The University of Edinburghs School of Clinical Sciences, led by the Principal Investigator Dr Marc Vendrell, worked in collaboration with academic partners at the University of Barcelona (Professor Rodolfo Lavilla) and The University of Manchester (Professor Nick Read) to co-invent the technology, the initial stages of which have been funded by the EU Commission via a Marie Curie Career integration Grant. This technology, which is the subject of a patent application, will allow the use of natural peptide mimics as disease reporters by applying a fluorescent compound that makes their identification easier under the microscope, as Dr Vendrell explains: 'Peptides are essential natural products, but they are not fluorescent and therefore invisible under the microscope. If we want to know how peptides behave, we need to attach them to fluorescent tags in order to see them. Crucially, it is very important that when we attach these tags to make peptides fluorescent, they behave exactly in the same way as they would in their natural state. This is exactly what we have achieved with our technology.' As an initial Proof of Concept, Dr Vendrell and colleagues used peptides binding to fungal cells to visualise fungal pathogens. Their research proved that the fluorescent peptides behaved exactly in the same way as the natural peptides. This is a major-breakthrough in peptide chemistry and in the biomedical sciences since it paves the way for a better understanding of disease onset and behaviour. Dr Vendrell added: 'One of the main advantages of our technology is that it can be broadly applied to almost all peptides, having a global impact in biomedicine. This means that our technology will improve our understanding of disease at many different levels, from cancer to the regeneration of tissues or the progression of inflammatory diseases.' Dr Angus Stewart-Liddon, ERIs Licensing Executive, said: 'This is an exciting breakthrough as it provides a powerful addition to our toolbox to investigate disease action. Working with the life science business of Merck means the technology will be made readily accessible to researchers worldwide, both in industry and in academia. It is another great example of the University working in collaboration with trusted industry partners to make valuable research tools accessible.'

Both have exciting CAR-T therapies in development. Only one deserves consideration for your portfolio. Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Nov 3, 2016 at 11:41AM Image source: Getty Images. Immunotherapy, or using the body's immune system to fight diseases and cancers, has become a sizzling investment opportunity for biopharma companies and investors alike. While there's been interest in everything from DNA vaccines to checkpoint antibodies, the real frenzy has surrounded CAR-T therapies, in which a patient's immune cells are engineered and reinjected as a personalized treatment. One darling of the CAR-T boom has been Juno Therapeutics (NASDAQ:JUNO), which will be among the first companies to submit an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval. Investors are widely expecting it will be one of the first to successfully gain approval, too, with speculative launch dates in the first half of 2018.  And although it hasn't been as closely associated with CAR-T as Juno Therapeutics, Ziopharm Oncology (NASDAQ:ZIOP) is part of a collection of entities (including Intrexon, Merck, and MD Anderson) developing a therapeutic pipeline in the same class, in addition to programs for various other indications. The company was a little late to the party, but its investors are excited about the potential in immunotherapy all the same. Both companies are down 50% in the last year. Both are pusuring CAR-T immunotherapies. Those similarities make for a fun question: Which company is the better buy, Ziopharm Oncoloy or Juno Therapeutics? As it turns out, the two are actually quite different -- and only one deserves consideration for your portfolio. ZIOP data by YCharts. The matchup Let's begin with a head-to-head immunotherapy comparison. Juno Therapeutics has an astounding 10 clinical trials in its pipeline -- all of which use CAR-T. Eight have initiated at least phase 1 trials, while two are making headway in phase 2 trials. The most advanced program, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), posted a complete remission rate of 89% in its phase 1 trial. Data like that are what have investors so excited about the stock's potential.  On the other hand, Ziopharm lists eight clinical trial categories on its website for CAR-T therapeutics, but has only begun enrolling patients in two phase 1 trials for advanced lymphoid malignancies, including ALL. That means it doesn't (yet) have the same data as Juno Therapeutics. The difference in pipeline maturity can be chalked up to the fact that Ziopharm was relatively late to the party: it's developing a technology licensed from MD Anderson in early 2015. That makes it highly unlikely the company will be first to market with a CAR-T therapeutic if approval comes its way, which could severely limit its future market potential considering the torrid pace of Juno Therapeutics and Kite Pharma in the same indications.  Unfortunately, things don't get better for Ziopharm the deeper investors dig. Here's how the company stacks up against Juno Therapeutics in several leading financial metrics: Metric Juno Therapeutics Ziopharm Market cap, current $2.53 billion $744.1 million Cash and short term investments, 6/30/2016 $956.9 million $109.0 million Revenue, TTM $43.1 million $7.5 million Major partners Celgene Intrexon, Merck Serono Data sources: Press releases and Google Finance.  Revenue may be the least important metric for either development-stage company, but it highlights major differences in the commitment levels of partners. So does each company's cash balance. Juno Therapeutics has significantly more cash padding its research and development efforts than Ziopharm. The bulk of the company's total came in summer 2015 from a $1 billion investment from Celgene, which included the purchase of 9.1 million shares of common stock and jump-started a collaboration. Ziopharm touts a partnership with Merck Serono, but it's not even close to being on the same level as Celgene. Merck Serono's partnership allows it to select two CAR-T targets, sit back as Ziopharm and Intrexon take care of all development expenses, and then take the goods and run if they reach investigational new drug status. In other words, Ziopharm doesn't benefit from the partnership in a meaningful way. Now, investors may point out that Ziopharm is pursuing programs outside of CAR-T, but none provide a strong case for investment. The company is partnered with or dependent on technologies licensed from Intrexon for every single clinical trial. Literally every technology (there are seven) used in a clinical trial on Ziopharm's website has been licensed from Intrexon. Worse, the pair have discontinued at least one clinical trial for a lack of efficacy and have struggled to show safety or efficacy in all others developed to a point they merit public reporting. It appears the company has a data problem. The verdict On the surface, the similarities between Juno Therapeutics and Ziopharm may make it appear as if the head-to-head matchup is close for individual investors. However, after a little more investigation, it becomes clear that the better buy is Juno Therapeutics. The company has more and better data, a boatload of cash to fund development and commercialization, and serious partners willing to throw down serious capital. There are still questions investors need to consider -- will regulatory approvals from phase 2 results face unexpected obstacles in later-stage trials? Will CAR-T prove to be too toxic to be safe? -- but this particular matchup isn't even close.  Maxx Chatsko has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The drug, verubecestat, is one of a number being trialled by pharmaceutical companies in a race for the first treatment that can halt or reverse the disease. Results from a small Phase 1 study confirm that verubecestat can reduce levels of beta-amyloid, a protein fragment that accumulates in sticky deposits or "plaques" in the brains of Alzheimer's sufferers. A new drug could offer hope to Alzheimer's sufferers Most importantly, it appeared to produce no severe side effects. Earlier experiments with drugs that work the same way, by targeting an enzyme linked to beta-amyloid build-up, were abandoned when they were found to cause liver and nerve damage. Publication of the trial findings comes as two much larger international trials testing the effectiveness of verubecestat in more than 3,000 patients near completion. Depending on the outcome of these Phase III studies, one arm of which is taking place in the UK, the drug could be licensed in the next two to three years. Verubecestat, made by drug giants Merck, is not alone. Two other medicines with the potential to modify Alzheimer's progression, solanezumab and aducanumab, are also undergoing Phase III trials. However both differ from the Merck drug in that they are antibodies designed to mount an immunological-style attack on beta-amyloid. Dr Rosa Sancho, from the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "It has been over a decade since a new drug was licensed for the treatment of dementia, so we urgently need new medicines that can provide real benefit for people living with dementia. "There is a wave of potential new treatments currently being tested for dementia, with the results of these studies hotly anticipated over the course of the coming months and years. "In this small Phase I clinical trial, verubecestat was able to reduce the levels of a key Alzheimer's protein, but it remains to be seen whether this translates into slower memory decline for people with the disease." A history of past failures mean that scientists tread carefully when announcing apparently promising results from early studies of new Alzheimer's treatments. Currently there are medicines available that can alleviate some of the symptoms of the disease, but nothing capable of halting or slowing its progress. That situation may be about to change if drugs such as verubecestat pass the stiff tests of safety and effectiveness imposed by medicine regulators. The Phase I trial reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine recruited just 32 patients and was chiefly concerned with dosage and safety. Participants had mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease but were otherwise healthy. The study, led by Dr Matthew Kennedy, from Merck's US research laboratories in New Jersey, looked for markers of beta-amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid. It showed that single and multiple doses of verubecestat could lower levels of the harmful peptide without serious side effects. Other research by the same team found that a single dose of the drug markedly reduced levels of beta-amyloid in rats and monkeys. The animals showed no sign of toxicity even after extended treatment. Verubecestat is known as a BACE1 inhibitor. It targets an enzyme called beta-secretase 1 that slices up a precursor protein to produce beta-amyloid fragments. Dr Sancho added: "As verubecestat works differently to other drugs currently being tested for Alzheimer's, if it proves successful, it could be an important weapon in the arsenal for doctors treating the disease in future. "Alzheimer's is a complex and devastating disease and so a multi-pronged approach may give us the best chance of tackling it in the coming years. As the first BACE1 inhibitor to reach the final stages of testing in people, the ultimate test will be whether these ongoing trials show verubecestat can provide tangible benefits for people with Alzheimer's. "Scientists have reflected on past lessons in Alzheimer's drug development and it is promising to see an increasing number of drugs now entering Phase III clinical testing in the disease, giving us renewed hope in the hunt for new treatments." Verubecestat is administered in the form of tablets. Dr Clare Walton, research manager at the charity Alzheimer's Society, said: "Amyloid plaques are a key hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and most recent efforts to find new dementia treatments focus on reducing the production of amyloid or clearing plaques out of the brain. "This study describes a new drug that reduces the production of amyloid in people with dementia and, importantly, it appears to be safer than similar drugs that have come before. This finding has paved the way for much larger clinical trials that are currently under way, and we very much look forward to the results of these in the coming years."

In draft guidance, the UK cost-effectiveness regulator said that the drug does not represent value for money and expressed concern over 'significant uncertainties' in the evidence provided. Erbitux was first rejected by NICE for head and neck cancer in 2009 but is undergoing reappraisal as part of the watchdog's programme to assess all drugs that are currently available on the Cancer Drugs Fund. Merck has since provided further evidence for Erbitux to assist this appraisal process, reducing the indication to patients with mouth cancer alone as well as proposing an additional, undisclosed discount. However, the committee said that the new evidence does not adequately clarify why Erbitux should be more effective in mouth cancer patients than head and neck cancer patients. Professor Carole Longson, director of the health technology evaluation centre at NICE, said: “This decision not to recommend cetuximab as an option for treating mouth cancer will be disappointing for some patients. “However, we need to make sure the NHS makes the most of its resources by only funding treatments that are both clinically effective and represent good value for money.” Erbitux is still available to patients on the previous Cancer Drugs Fund programme, and will continue to be until final draft guidance is published.

VSTM, +1.60% and Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. INFI, +2.31% today announced that the companies entered into a license agreement under which Verastem licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Infinity’s oncology product candidate duvelisib. Duvelisib is an oral inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-delta and PI3K-gamma being investigated for the treatment of hematologic cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) and T cell lymphomas. Verastem will pay to Infinity up to $28 million in milestones, with positive data from DUO®, a Phase 3, randomized monotherapy study of duvelisib in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, triggering the first milestone payment, and royalties on net sales. “Duvelisib is a clinically validated, late-stage product candidate with a proven mechanism of action. This transaction has an attractive risk/reward profile given the modest financial investment prior to obtaining topline data from the DUO study, currently anticipated in the first half of 2017, as well as the potential applications for a variety of other lymphoid malignancies,” said Robert Forrester, President and Chief Executive Officer of Verastem. “Duvelisib complements Verastem’s oncology pipeline by augmenting our strategic focus of developing small molecule agents that target malignant cells both directly and through modulation of the tumor microenvironment. This transaction represents a positive step toward our goal of bringing new treatment options to patients with cancer. We are working closely with Infinity to ensure a smooth transition of the duvelisib program.” “The potential of duvelisib is supported by clinical data demonstrating anti-cancer activity and a manageable safety profile in a wide range of lymphoid malignancies, including relapsed/refractory iNHL, CLL and T cell lymphomas,” said Gregory I. Berk, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Verastem. “While there have been significant advances recently in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies, not all patients experience benefits or can tolerate these treatments. There remains a need for new oral medicines, and the targeted inhibition of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma brings a unique approach designed to address both the malignant B cell and its supportive microenvironment. We look forward to reporting data from the DUO study, which could enable a submission for regulatory approval.” “Infinity has always been committed to finding innovative ways to develop novel medicines which hold significant promise for people living with cancer. Verastem provides duvelisib the best opportunity to advance toward regulatory filings and potential commercialization given their oncology-focused capabilities and deep knowledge of the tumor microenvironment,” stated Adelene Perkins, President and Chief Executive Officer of Infinity. “Additionally, the license of duvelisib fulfills an important strategic goal for Infinity by preserving cash while enabling our shareholders to participate in the value of the duvelisib program through potential milestone payments and royalties to Infinity.” Terms of Transaction Under the terms of the license agreement, Verastem is obligated to pay to Infinity up to $28 million in milestones. Infinity is entitled to receive two milestone payments, $6 million upon positive data from the DUO study and $22 million upon the first regulatory approval inside or outside of the U.S. Verastem will also pay Infinity tiered mid-to-high single-digit royalties on net sales and will be responsible for the single-digit-royalty on net sales of duvelisib owed by Infinity to MundiPharma International Corporation Limited and Purdue Pharmaceutical Products L.P. Verastem’s Expanded Oncology Pipeline In addition to duvelisib, Verastem also holds worldwide rights to the tumor microenvironment-targeting focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitors defactinib (VS-6063) and VS-4718. Verastem’s lead FAK inhibitor, defactinib, is currently being evaluated in three separate clinical collaborations in combination with immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of several different cancer types, including pancreatic, ovarian, non-small cell lung cancer, and mesothelioma. These studies are combination clinical trials with pembrolizumab or avelumab from Merck & Co. and Pfizer/Merck KGaA, respectively. Verastem also owns rights to the FAK inhibitor VS-4718 and the dual PI3K and mTORC1/2 inhibitor VS-5584 which are both currently being evaluated in Phase 1 clinical studies. Financial Guidance Based on current operating plans including duvelisib, Verastem expects to have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund its research and development programs and operations into 2018. Conference Call Information Verastem will host a conference call on November 2, 2016, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the license agreement announced today. The call can be accessed by dialing 877-341-5660 (U.S. and Canada) or 315-625-3226 (international), and entering passcode 12230467. To access the live webcast, please use either the following link: http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/vsavfj6j or visit the investors section of the Verastem website at www.verastem.com. A replay of the call will be available on the Company’s website for a period of 180 days from today. About the Tumor Microenvironment The tumor microenvironment encompasses various cellular populations and extracellular matrices within the tumor or cancer niche that support cancer cell survival. This includes immunosuppressive cell populations such as regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, M2 tumor-associated macrophages, as well as tumor-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix proteins which can hamper the entry and therapeutic benefit of cytotoxic immune cells and anti-cancer drugs. In addition to targeting the proliferative and survival signaling of cancer cells, Verastem’s compounds duvelisib, defactinib, VS-4718 and VS-5584 also target the tumor microenvironment as a mechanism of action to potentially improve a patient’s response to therapy. About Duvelisib Duvelisib is an investigational, dual inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-delta and PI3K-gamma, two enzymes that are known to help support the growth and survival of malignant B cells and T cells. PI3K signaling may lead to the proliferation of malignant B cells and is thought to play a role in the formation and maintenance of the supportive tumor microenvironment. [1,2,3 ] Duvelisib is currently being evaluated in late- and mid-stage clinical trials, including DUO®, a randomized, Phase 3 monotherapy study in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [4] , and DYNAMO®, a single-arm, Phase 2 monotherapy study in patients with refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) that achieved its primary endpoint of overall response rate upon topline analysis of efficacy data [5] . Duvelisib is also being evaluated for the treatment of hematologic malignancies through investigator-sponsored studies, including T cell lymphoma. [6] Information about duvelisib clinical trials can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov. About Defactinib Defactinib (VS-6063) is an investigational inhibitor of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the PTK-2 gene that mediates oncogenic signaling in response to cellular adhesion and growth factors. [7] Based on the multi-faceted roles of FAK, defactinib is used to treat cancer through modulation of the tumor microenvironment, enhancement of anti-tumor immunity, and reduction of cancer stem cells.

Daily Tar Heel staff writer Rebecca Ayers sat down with Ozawa to ask about the study.

Eva Ellenburg 10/17/16 10:46pm Take a Glance at new social app Hopspot PAID CONTENT 10/13/16 4:49pm DTH: Do you find this movement not to vaccinate children and adults a growing problem, and why is it so important to get vaccinated? SO: Yeah, I think it is a growing problem because people really don’t understand the amount, the scale of the economic costs that we’re incurring. These are preventable diseases, these are diseases that we can actually avoid if we were to be vaccinated. And people aren’t necessarily putting a value in that prevention and instead actually incurring these costs. DTH: Do you think parents not getting their children vaccinated has to do with the study that showed the (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) vaccine caused autism in children, even though it was proven false? SO: The MMR vaccine really being linked to Autism was debunked many, many times. The author who came up with the medicine paper has been de-licensed and he can no longer practice medicine. It’s really done a terrible disservice to, I think, public health in general because people are very worried and kind of fearful ... But the benefit of vaccination really is that you have this thing call herd immunity, so if you vaccinate people then those who are not vaccinated can also benefit from the protection that they receive. DTH: How does this affect health care in the U.S.? SO: It affects health care insomuch that we’re spending both time and effort in fighting diseases that we can actually prevent. So, people are actually spending money for medications, for in-patient care, and people actually have to leave the workplace for sick leave in order to actually seek care. So, those are the kinds of costs that could actually be saved to individuals, to families as well to the actual health care system. DTH: How do you think a growing number of children and adults not getting vaccinated will affect the U.S. in the future? SO: This actually kind of accumulates, so if more people continue not to get vaccinated, it will continue to incur more costs. As our population actually gets older, there’s going to be more and more people who are going to need more care. Care becomes more expensive as you get older — if more adults currently can start to value more in vaccinations, then we may be able to prevent more costs into the future. @rebeccaayers234 state@dailytarheel.com CLARIFICATION: A previous version was unclear about the costs of vaccine-preventable diseases. These diseases cost the U.S. $9 billion, but the cost of not vaccinating is $7 billion. The difference — $2 billion — is an unavoidable cost. Thanks for reading.

Job cuts in South Florida included 125 at nonprofit Gulfstream Goodwill Industries in West Palm Beach, 51 at computer services company NTT America in Boca Raton, and 112 at pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. in Miami Lakes. For the nine months of 2016, Florida had 11,169 planned layoffs, a 17 percent decrease from 13,426 in the same period in 2015. Nationally, planned job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers fell 39 percent to the second-lowest level of the year: 30,740 job cuts in October, compared with 50,504 job cuts a year ago. The lowest level was 30,157 job cuts announced in May. The October total was the lowest since 1999, when 22,814 job cuts were announced in the first month of the fourth quarter, Challenger said. CEO John Challenger said he doesn't think the upcoming U.S. election is resulting in employers holding off on staffing decisions.

Alzheimer’s theory suggests the plaque kills the healthy neurons, leading to memory loss. Results from a small Phase 1 study confirm that the drug verubecestat can reduce levels of beta-amyloid, a protein fragment that accumulates in sticky deposits or "plaques" in the brains of Alzheimer's sufferers. The trial was primarily seeking to determine safety of verubecestat , but found it worked to prevent the production of enzymes that cause plaque on the brain’s neurons. Researchers may have discovered how to slow brain aging https://t.co/gFjGAy7DZg— RT (@RT_com) October 14, 2016 A study published in Science Translational Medicine by Merck Research Laboratories details the results of the verubecestat trial, which found promising results and importantly, no severe side effects. However, conclusions won’t be drawn until phase III of the clinical trial has been completed, which tests effectiveness and safety on a larger scale. “It represents well over a decade of investment in this project by many, many scientists,” team leader Matthew Kennedy told Scientific American. “Today there are very limited therapeutic options available for people with Alzheimer’s disease, and those that exist provide only short-term improvement to the cognitive and functional symptoms. They do not directly target the underlying disease processes. There is an urgent need for [these].” #GeneWilder, star of ‘Blazing Saddles’, dies at 83 https://t.co/nXphuln12ypic.twitter.com/jmcUATqODh— RT America (@RT_America) August 30, 2016 The trial involved giving 32 early-stage Alzheimer’s patients the drug for seven days, with some taking it for two weeks. The short term trial couldn’t render visible changes to the plaques, but fluid samples show reduced levels of the compounds that make up the proteins. Verubecestat inhibits BACE1 (Beta-site Amyloid precursor protein Cleaving Enzyme 1), an enzyme which produces a protein (amyloid beta) that clumps together and forms the plaques around the neurons, causing Alzheimer's. Phase III is trialling 2,000 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s and 1,500 in the early stage of the disease. The results are expected in July 2017.

Is Plunging Today The specialty pharmacy's shares tumbled after management reported weak quarterly results and lowered guidance. Brian Feroldi (TMFTypeoh) Nov 3, 2016 at 1:01PM What happened Shares of Diplomat Pharmacy (NYSE:DPLO), a distributor of specialty biotechnology and pharmaceutical products, dropped by 37% as of 11:55 a.m. EDT on Thursday after the company reported disappointing third-quarter results. Image source: Getty Images. So what Diplomat continued to rapidly grow its top line during the quarter, producing total revenue of $1.18 billion, which was up nearly 25% year over year. However, this figure was still quite a bit shy of the $1.26 billion that Wall Street was expecting, especially in light of the fact that more than half of the company's growth came as a result of acquisitions.  Management stated that its revenue growth was held back by a handful of factors, including direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees that were paid to Medicare Part D plans and pharmacy benefits managers, as well as a general shift from older hepatitis C drugs to newer ones that generate less revenue. The latter point shouldn't have been all that surprising to investors, as drugmakers Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, and Merck have been engaged in a pricing war in an effort to build market share. If that wasn't bad enough, Diplomat also struggled to translate its revenue growth into profits. Net income from continuing operations plunged by 66% during the period, to $5.4 million, which produced earnings per share (EPS) of only $0.08. However, if EPS were normalized for the DIR fees, then it would have actually been $0.25, according to management. In light of the specialty pharmacy's disappointing quarterly results, management decided to pour cold water on its full-year guidance. Revenue is now projected to land between $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion, which is down from a prior outlook of $4.5 billion to $4.9 billion. The company believes that it will generate between $0.83 and $0.87 in adjusted earnings per share for the year, which is also below its previously announced range of $0.90 and $0.95. Now what It's been a difficult few months to be a long-term Diplomat shareholder. In late October, shares dropped after news broke that two of the company's executives would be leaving at year-end. With today's huge drop, shares have now fallen more than 59% since the start of the year and are currently trading at an all-time low.   With pessimism for Diplomat Pharmacy running so high, management did its best to remind investors that there are some positive trends working in its favor. The company's oncology business is growing rapidly, which should continue as new drugs come to market. In addition, the company still plans on using its financial might to make bolt-on acquisitions that should drive additional growth. Finally, there is legislation in Congress right now that, if it passes, could potentially limit the company's future exposure to DIR fees. Overall, this report leaves investors with both bullish and bearish takeaways. However, given the added uncertainty surrounding the DIR fees and management's lowered guidance, it is hard to blame the markets for knocking down shares today.

The other report adds that women afflicted with breast cancer alone could nearly double from 1.7 million diagnosed last year to 3.2 million by 2030, the Guardian reports. The first report, compiled by Merck and the American Cancer Society and released at the World Cancer Congress in Paris on Tuesday, says the predicted surge in cancer deaths would amount to a 57% increase, per a press release. The same report notes all four top cancers—breast, lung, colorectal, and cervical—are mostly preventable or easily detected early on, aiding treatment. The second report, based on three papers in the Lancet, adds cervical cancer may rise by as much as 25% by 2030, leading to 700,000 diagnoses. That report also notes women in low- and middle-income countries carry much of the burden of breast and cervical cancers, with less access to quality care and a greater likelihood of dying from their illnesses than women in richer nations. Perhaps a bit ironically, some of the cancers in the lower-income countries used to be prevalent only in higher-income ones, but as the poorer countries started going through "rapid economic transition," the women there began experiencing risk factors like their more affluent counterparts, including "physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors" like putting off having kids, per an ACS VP. "The global community cannot continue to ignore the problem—hundreds of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily every year," Richard Sullivan, co-author of the Lancet report, says in the release.

No exceptions except if trauma or crime or war is the cause but still: fear, pain, dread, death. Certain from long before the moment you conceived them. When you lie ill and dying, no joy of the past will make it all see perfectly acceptable. And you will not give expression to your pain or fear or dread because you know that those who die silently are said to have died bravely! At the final moment, all that sickness and pain stuffed up inside you like constipation because no one wants to hear or know the truth. But read on and find distraction in the form of undying, immortal, optimism, Pollyannaism and genetic cheerfulness. They are the reasons you are all here instead of enjoying the perfect heaven known as never having been.

Interestingly these are ones that we don't get enough of. Iodine, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K2 all cause cancer when you don't get enough. Iodine and selenium particularly cause breast cancer when deficient.

Dr. Len Yaffe of Stoc*Doc Partners sheds light on the issues in this analysis of drug price negotiation policy, and focuses in on one California ballot proposition that aims to rein in costs. One issue of focus in the election rhetoric is Medicare drug price negotiation, which is specifically precluded in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Furthermore, a noninterference provision was included: "In order to promote competition under this part and in carrying out this part, the Secretary (of Health and Human Services): (1) may not interfere with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and PDP sponsors; and (2) may not require a particular formulary or institute a price structure for the reimbursement of covered Part D drugs." Additionally, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsequently made into law that Part D drug plans give nearly full access to drugs in six therapeutic categories: anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antineoplastics, antiretrovirals and immunosuppressants, effectively eliminating price negotiations. A Millman study found that these six protected classes represent 17–33% of Part D drug costs by Part D plan administrators. Also, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) examined the effect of striking the noninterference provision and estimated that it would have a negligible effect on spending versus what private plans negotiate. It should be noted that a repeal of this provision would require action by both Houses of Congress. "The recent weakness in pharmaceutical stocks affords an excellent buying opportunity in select names with promising pipelines, includingDURECT Corp." California's Proposition 61 would require state agencies to pay the same price as the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) for prescription drugs. California spent $3.8 billion on prescription medicines in fiscal year 2014–2015, and almost 83% of that was for Medi-Cal and the Public Employees Retirement System. It should be understood that many programs are excluded, including Medi-Cal Managed Care, local school district employees and local government employees, as well as the majority of Californians with private insurance. Included are the 3.0 million low-income people covered by Medi-Cal Fee for Service, prison inmates, Department of State Hospital patients and some state employees and retirees. As it relates to Medi-Cal, the table above lists the price discounts afforded to various government health programs. The VA pays the lowest price, and also directly negotiates even greater discounts with manufacturers. It has this ability due to assured volume based on compliance, and very aggressive formulary management. This can result in total discounts approximating 40%, versus the 23% for Medicaid. However, Medicaid, in exchange for this discount, agrees to cover most drugs. For example, an analysis by the Lewin Group showed that, of the 300 drugs most prescribed to senior citizens, 35% are not included in the VA formulary, versus 6% in Medicare Part D formularies. A separate analysis by Einthoven and Fong stated that fewer than 33% of the 4,300 drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries are on the VA national formulary. Furthermore, according to Frank Lichtenberg, only 38% of drugs approved by the FDA in the 1990s, and 19% of the drugs approved since 2000, are on the VA national formulary. The first issue for consideration is the disclosure of VA pricing. Without additional discounts, the VA and Medi-Cal should be charged similarly for prescription medicines. If the VA is not forced to disclose the incremental discounts it receives for market share guarantees through compliance and formulary control (neither of which is robustly permitted by Medicaid), then Medi-Cal's savings would be minimal. If Medi-Cal were to receive the full VA discount, then I would expect the drug companies to lower the incremental discount to the VA to strike a balanced price, and perhaps even raise prices to the private sector (20 million Californians). Therefore, in the aggregate, Californians would end up paying more for their drugs. This is in no way intended to justify the high cost of prescription pharmaceuticals. As I have previously written, I maintain that there are more appropriate methods to control these costs. Additionally, it is critical to understand that the drug spend represents only 12% of total U.S. healthcare dollars. I forecast healthcare costs to grow at an average annual rate of 6% through 2030, at which time they will exceed $7 trillion, or 25% of GDP. I have provided a means of bending the cost curve in my article, "Solving America's Health Care Crisis." From an investment standpoint, I think the recent weakness in pharmaceutical stocks (iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index [IBB] and VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF [PPH] down 10% and 9%, respectively, in the last month) affords an excellent buying opportunity in select names with promising pipelines. In this group I include Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK:NYSE), Celgene Corp. (CELG:NASDAQ), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (REGN:NASDAQ), Tesaro Inc. (TSRO:NASDAQ), Ardelyx Inc. (ARDX:NASDAQ)and DURECT Corp.

By Olivia Lerche PUBLISHED: 09:29, Thu, Nov 3, 2016 | UPDATED: 10:31, Thu, Nov 3, 2016 GETTYAlzheimer's disease: Drug could treat disease The drug, verubecestat, is one of a number being trialled by pharmaceutical companies in a race for the first treatment that can halt or reverse the disease. A study carried out at Merck Research Laboratories in New Jersey, USA, describes early tests of the drug - full name BACE1 inhibitor verubecestat (MK-8931) - safely reduced the production of amyloid beta in 32 people with Alzheimer’s disease. Dr Clare Walton, Research Manager at Alzheimer’s Society, said: “Amyloid plaques are a key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease and most recent efforts to find new dementia treatments focus on reducing the production of amyloid or clearing plaques out of the brain. “This study describes a new drug that reduces the production of amyloid in people with dementia and, importantly, it appears to be safer than similar drugs that have come before. This finding has paved the way for much larger clinical trials that are currently underway, and we very much look forward to the results of these in the coming years.” Related articles Palliative care: GPs warning over care of terminally-ill Sickness and diarrhoea: Symptoms of 'dangerous' winter bug explained Experts found the drug appeared to produce no severe side effects. Earlier experiments with drugs that work the same way, by targeting an enzyme linked to beta-amyloid build-up, were abandoned when they were found to cause liver and nerve damage. The publication of the trial findings comes as two much larger international trials testing the effectiveness of verubecestat in more than 3,000 patients nears completion. Depending on the outcome of these studies, one of which is taking place in the UK, the drug could be licensed in the next two to three years. Verubecestat, made by drug giants Merck, is not alone -  two other medicines with the potential to modify Alzheimer's progression, solanezumab and aducanumab, are also undergoing Phase III trials. GETTYAlzheimer's disease: Successful drug trials could lead to new treatment Dr Rosa Sancho, from the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "It has been over a decade since a new drug was licensed for the treatment of dementia, so we urgently need new medicines that can provide real benefit for people living with dementia. "There is a wave of potential new treatments currently being tested for dementia, with the results of these studies hotly anticipated over the course of the coming months and years. "In this small Phase I clinical trial, verubecestat was able to reduce the levels of a key Alzheimer's protein, but it remains to be seen whether this translates into slower memory decline for people with the disease." Participants involved in the trial had mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease but were otherwise healthy. Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's Tue, August 23, 2016 There are more than 520,000 people in the UK with Alzheimer's disease. Here are 10 early signs and symptoms including memory loss and problem-solving to look out for.

Results showed that doses of verubecestat could lower levels of the harmful peptide without serious side effects. Dr Sancho added: "As verubecestat works differently to other drugs currently being tested for Alzheimer's, if it proves successful, it could be an important weapon in the arsenal for doctors treating the disease in future. "Alzheimer's is a complex and devastating disease and so a multi-pronged approach may give us the best chance of tackling it in the coming years. As the first BACE1 inhibitor to reach the final stages of testing in people, the ultimate test will be whether these ongoing trials show verubecestat can provide tangible benefits for people with Alzheimer's. "Scientists have reflected on past lessons in Alzheimer's drug development and it is promising to see an increasing number of drugs now entering Phase III clinical testing in the disease, giving us renewed hope in the hunt for new treatments." More than 850,000 people in the UK suffer with dementia.

("Delivra", or "the Company") (DVA) announced today the Company has successfully completed its first phase pre-clinical research into transdermal berberine for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease related to high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Berberine is a natural plant extract that has been used in eastern medicine for thousands of years, and more recently also in the western world. There is an abundance of research on berberine, and its effectiveness in reducing cholesterol and triglycerides is well-established. The main challenges with the use of berberine in its traditional oral format are exceptionally low bioavailability (< 2%) and highly adverse gastrointestinal events. Transdermal berberine from Delivra overcomes these challenges, showing 8-times higher concentration levels in the blood than oral, with no gastrointestinal side effects, and proved significantly more effective than oral in reducing cholesterol and triglycerides in a model of metabolic disease. This achievement represents a first-in-class platform that may prove effective in reducing cholesterol, triglycerides, and other hallmarks of cardiovascular disease. Delivra's research and development includes formulations, compounding, stability testing, and measurement of systemic penetration and delivery of topical berberine and the closely related natural product, dihydroberberine (DHB). Delivra-berberine and Delivra-DHB achieve circulating blood levels 8-times higher than an oral equivalent treatment, which overcomes a key limitation of this natural compound. With increased berberine blood levels is an expected increase in this compound's effectiveness to reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels, with Delivra-DHB achieving a profound reduction in cholesterol by 34% and reduction in triglycerides by 85%, as compared to control. While this is pre-clinical data, it is very promising in the context of published rates for leading statin drugs in the range of 20-35% reduction in cholesterol and 10-30% reduction in triglycerides. In certain cases, this treatment may provide a natural alternative to the use of statin drugs, the most prescribed drug class in the world, and most commonly recognized by the trade names Lipitor™ (Pfizer Inc.), Zocor™ (Merck & Co. Inc.), and Crestor™ (Astra Zeneca Limited). A Delivra berberine therapy could avoid the side effects associated with statin drugs, including muscle pain, liver damage, stomach upset, increased blood sugar, and a range of neurological issues. Interestingly, preliminary data suggests the Delivra transdermal berberine may also function synergistically to enhance the performance of statin drugs, potentially allowing greater benefits while taking less drug. "These strong results demonstrate the potential for a break-through natural product to address a globally prevalent health issue," said Dr. Joe Gabriele, founder and CEO of Delivra. "To bring to market a natural product that works as well or better than some of the world's most commonly prescribed drugs, without the side effects, would be a game changer for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. We will continue to advance our research, through further pre-clinical work and then into clinical trials, and we look forward to continuing to report to shareholders on our progress." Delivra has filed a provisional US patent to protect its unique berberine formulations. ABOUT DELIVRA CORP. Delivra Corp. is a developer of transdermal technologies for the delivery of pharmaceutical and natural molecules through the skin, rather than via pills. Delivra manufactures and sells a growing line of natural topical creams under the LivRelief™ brand, for conditions such as joint and muscle pain, nerve pain, varicose veins, wound healing, and sports performance. LivRelief™ products are available in pharmacies, grocery chains, and independent health food stores across Canada, and on-line at livrelief.com. LivRelief™ products are also available on-line and on Amazon in the United States. In parallel with its consumer products business, Delivra also has a mandate to license its unique, proven, and patent-pending delivery platform to global pharmaceutical companies for the transdermal delivery of third party active ingredients to treat a broad range of conditions. With a global transdermal drug delivery market forecast to grow to USD $40 billion by 2018 (source:Kelly Scientific), Delivra believes the licensing opportunity is robust.

"The problem is, no one has this on their radar," so patients are not routinely checked for it, said Dr. Javid Moslehi, head of a Vanderbilt University clinic specializing in heart risks from cancer therapies. He led a report Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine describing two patients who died of heart trouble two weeks after receiving their first doses of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, for the deadly skin cancer melanoma. Two similar drugs also are on the market, and the study leaders believe they might pose heart risks, too. "My sense is that this is a class effect, not limited to one drug," Moslehi said. The risks do not negate the huge benefits of these relatively new types of drugs, doctors stress. Called checkpoint inhibitors, they have transformed treatment of several types of cancer by helping the immune system see and attack tumors. In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumor but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. Patients need to be told of the risks, monitored closely and treated quickly with medicines to quell the immune response if trouble develops. Besides melanoma, the Opdivo-Yervoy combination is used to treat some lung cancers, though at different doses. Other checkpoint inhibitors include Genentech's Tecentriq, for bladder cancer, and Merck & Co.'s Keytruda, which former President Jimmy Carter received for melanoma that spread to his brain. Many more are in testing. More on this... Immunotherapy improves survival in head and neck cancer patients, study finds Heart attacks are linked to patients' activity level, emotional state UCLA study finds why some cancers stop responding to immunotherapy There have been occasional, previous reports of heart troubles with these drugs. After the two recent deaths, doctors asked Bristol-Myers to check patient safety records on Opdivo and Yervoy. As of April, 18 cases of serious heart inflammation were found among 20,594 patients receiving either or both drugs, a rate of 0.09 percent. It was more severe and more common among people on both drugs, affecting 0.27 percent of those patients. Bristol-Myers scientists helped write the journal report, and some other authors consult for the company. Studies have shown that the drug combination gives a stronger anti-cancer effect than either drug alone, but "we've known this is a double-edged sword" because of the risk of over-stimulating the immune system, said Dr. Jeffrey Sosman of Northwestern University in Chicago, who treated the two patients who died. "The big question is, is there enough advantage to using the combination, which is much more toxic, than a single drug," he said. That's a larger question facing the cancer field, not just with immune therapies. Some of the newer gene-targeting drugs also have produced major side effects when used in combination. Yet many doctors believe that combos may be the best way to get cancer to go into remission and stay there longer, by shutting down multiple pathways the tumor employs at once. Dr. Michael Atkins, deputy director of the Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes the heart problems with checkpoint inhibitors will turn out to be treatable in most patients. "It just gives us a moment of pause," said Atkins, who led a study that included one of the two patients who died. "This is a rare event ... but it's a particularly serious one."

This study, carried out at Merck Research Laboratories in New Jersey, USA, describes early tests of a new drug, (full name BACE1 inhibitor verubecestat (MK-8931)) found to safely reduce the production of amyloid beta in 32 people with Alzheimer’s disease. Responding to this research, Dr Clare Walton, Research Manager at Alzheimer’s Society, said: 'Amyloid plaques are a key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease and most recent efforts to find new dementia treatments focus on reducing the production of amyloid or clearing plaques out of the brain. 'This study describes a new drug that reduces the production of amyloid in people with dementia and, importantly, it appears to be safer than similar drugs that have come before. This finding has paved the way for much larger clinical trials that are currently underway, and we very much look forward to the results of these in the coming years.'

The other report adds that women afflicted with breast cancer alone could nearly double from 1.7 million diagnosed last year to 3.2 million by 2030, the Guardian reports. The first report, compiled by Merck and the American Cancer Society and released at the World Cancer Congress in Paris on Tuesday, says the predicted surge in cancer deaths would amount to a 57% increase, per a press release. The same report notes all four top cancers—breast, lung, colorectal, and cervical—are mostly preventable or easily detected early on, aiding treatment. The second report, based on three papers in the Lancet, adds cervical cancer may rise by as much as 25% by 2030, leading to 700,000 diagnoses. That report also notes women in low- and middle-income countries carry much of the burden of breast and cervical cancers, with less access to quality care and a greater likelihood of dying from their illnesses than women in richer nations. Perhaps a bit ironically, some of the cancers in the lower-income countries used to be prevalent only in higher-income ones, but as the poorer countries started going through "rapid economic transition," the women there began experiencing risk factors like their more affluent counterparts, including "physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors" like putting off having kids, per an ACS VP. "The global community cannot continue to ignore the problem—hundreds of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily every year," Richard Sullivan, co-author of the Lancet report, says in the release.

No exceptions except if trauma or crime or war is the cause but still: fear, pain, dread, death. Certain from long before the moment you conceived them. When you lie ill and dying, no joy of the past will make it all see perfectly acceptable. And you will not give expression to your pain or fear or dread because you know that those who die silently are said to have died bravely! At the final moment, all that sickness and pain stuffed up inside you like constipation because no one wants to hear or know the truth. But read on and find distraction in the form of undying, immortal, optimism, Pollyannaism and genetic cheerfulness. They are the reasons you are all here instead of enjoying the perfect heaven known as never having been. Nothing you can possibly say about me will alter the nature of existence: I did not create the universe and I did not father your children or you WarmWeatherGuy Nov 2, 2016 4:55 PM CDT If you Google cancer and each of the nutrients we need you will find 5 that cause cancer when we don't get enough. Interestingly these are ones that we don't get enough of. Iodine, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K2 all cause cancer when you don't get enough. Iodine and selenium particularly cause breast cancer when deficient.

He led a report Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine describing two patients who died of heart trouble two weeks after receiving their first doses of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, for the deadly skin cancer melanoma. Two similar drugs also are on the market, and the study leaders believe they might pose heart risks, too. “My sense is that this is a class effect, not limited to one drug,” Moslehi said. The risks do not negate the huge benefits of these relatively new types of drugs, doctors stress. Called checkpoint inhibitors, they have transformed treatment of several types of cancer by helping the immune system see and attack tumors. In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumor but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. Patients need to be told of the risks, monitored closely and treated quickly with medicines to quell the immune response if trouble develops. Besides melanoma, the Opdivo-Yervoy combination is used to treat some lung cancers, though at different doses. Other checkpoint inhibitors include Genentech’s Tecentriq, for bladder cancer, and Merck & Co.’s Keytruda, which former President Jimmy Carter received for melanoma that spread to his brain. Many more are in testing. There have been occasional, previous reports of heart troubles with these drugs. After the two recent deaths, doctors asked Bristol-Myers to check patient safety records on Opdivo and Yervoy. As of April, 18 cases of serious heart inflammation were found among 20,594 patients receiving either or both drugs, a rate of 0.09 percent. It was more severe and more common among people on both drugs, affecting 0.27 percent of those patients. Bristol-Myers scientists helped write the journal report, and some other authors consult for the company. Studies have shown that the drug combination gives a stronger anti-cancer effect than either drug alone, but “we’ve known this is a double-edged sword” because of the risk of over-stimulating the immune system, said Dr. Jeffrey Sosman of Northwestern University in Chicago, who treated the two patients who died. “The big question is, is there enough advantage to using the combination, which is much more toxic, than a single drug,” he said. That’s a larger question facing the cancer field, not just with immune therapies. Some of the newer gene-targeting drugs also have produced major side effects when used in combination. Yet many doctors believe that combos may be the best way to get cancer to go into remission and stay there longer, by shutting down multiple pathways the tumor employs at once. Dr. Michael Atkins, deputy director of the Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes the heart problems with checkpoint inhibitors will turn out to be treatable in most patients. “It just gives us a moment of pause,” said Atkins, who led a study that included one of the two patients who died. “This is a rare event … but it’s a particularly serious one.” ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP .

Yet many doctors believe that combos may be the best way to get cancer to go into remission and stay there longer, by shutting down multiple pathways the tumor employs at once. Dr. Michael Atkins, deputy director of the Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes the heart problems with checkpoint inhibitors will turn out to be treatable in most patients. “It just gives us a moment of pause,” said Atkins, who led a study that included one of the two patients who died. “This is a rare event … but it’s a particularly serious one.” ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP .

This represented a near 60-percent increase in less than two decades, said an analysis conducted by the American Cancer Society (ACS), released Tuesday at the World Cancer Congress in Paris. As the global population grows and ages, the highest toll will be among women in poor and middle-income countries, it said, and much of it from cancers which are largely preventable. "Most of the deaths occur in young- and middle-aged adults,", placing a heavy burden on families and national economies, said Sally Cowal, senior vice president of global health at the ACS, which compiled the report with pharmaceutical company Merck. A second report, published in The Lancet medical journal yesterday, said the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer alone could almost double to 3.2 million a year by 2030 from 1.7 million in 2015. For cervical cancer, the number of diagnoses could "rise by at least 25 percent to over 700,000 by 2030," mainly in low- and middle-income countries, said a statement from The Lancet. Cancer is already killing one in seven women around the world, said the ACS report -- the second highest cause of death after cardiovascular disease. All four of the deadliest cancers -- breast, colorectal, lung and cervical cancer -- are mostly preventable or can be detected early, when treatment is more successful. In poorer countries, a much smaller proportion of cancer cases are diagnosed and treated than in rich ones, while a much bigger group dies. The relative burden is growing for developing countries as people live longer due to better basic healthcare. Women in these countries are also increasingly exposed to known cancer risk factors "associated with rapid economic transition," said Cowal, "such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors" such as postponing motherhood. “Due to these changes, cancers that were once common only in high-income countries are becoming more prevalent," said the report entitled "The Global Burden of Cancer in Women."

New drug found to reduce plaques in the brain moves into final trials Verubecestat reduced levels of proteins that accumulate within the brain The drug is being trialed in a race to be the first to try prevent the disease Scientists found it appeared to produce no side effects in patients taking it By Colin Fernandez Science Correspondent For The Daily Mail Published: 14:00 EST, 2 November 2016 | Updated: 16:30 EST, 2 November 2016 e-mail 191 shares 44 View comments A promising new drug treatment for Alzheimer’s has been developed that reduces the plaques thought to cause dementia. Drugs that help to reduce the sticky amyloid plaques that form in the brain have been developed, but have severe side effects. Medical experts hailed the advance as an important step forward in attempts to control the killer disease. No new Alzheimer’s drug has been licensed for 10 years – making an urgent need for an effective drug treatment for the disease which affects 500,000 people in the UK. A pioneering new drug has been shown to clear away toxic clumps of protein material in the brain thought to be a primary cause of Alzheimer’s disease The drug called verubecestat is in a family of drugs called BACE1 inhibitors. Previous similar drugs were severely toxic, causing liver damage. The latest drug treatment, has successfully undergone a phase 1 clinical trial – a trial which shows the drug is safe in humans.

Share this article Share 191 shares In animal studies the drug successfully reduced levels of amyloid beta in blood and spinal fluid of rats and monkeys. The research’s authors, led by Matthew Kennedy of Merck Research Laboratories in Kenilworth, New Jersey aid that ‘the animals showed no signs of toxicity even after extended treatement.’ The drug, verubecestat, is one of a number being trialed by pharmaceutical companies in a race for the first treatment that can halt or reverse the disease (stock) The phase 1 trial in 32 patients – both healthy adults and patients with mild and moderate Alzheimer’s disease found that verubecestat lowered beta amyloid without serious side effects. ‘The promising results have helped launch phase 3 trials of the drug investigating its long-term outcomes in AD [Alzheimer’s Disease] patients,’ the authors of the research said. The research has been published in Science Translational Medicine. ARE YOU LONELY? YOU MAY BE AT RISK OF DEMENTIA Being lonely may trigger dementia, research suggests. People who had high levels of a protein in their brain linked to Alzheimer's disease were nearly eight times more likely to feel isolated. The proteins - known as cortical amyloids - accumulate within the brain as plaques. Experts believe they are responsible for the onslaught of dementia as they trigger the death of brain cells which can cause memory loss and confusion.   Dr Rosa Sancho, Head of Research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘It has been over a decade since a new drug was licenced for the treatment of dementia, so we urgently need new medicines that can provide real benefit for people living with dementia.  'There is a wave of potential new treatments currently being tested for dementia, with the results of these studies hotly anticipated over the course of the coming months and years. ‘In this small phase 1 clinical trial, verubecestat was able to reduce the levels of a key Alzheimer’s protein, but it remains to be seen whether this translates into slower memory decline for people with the disease. ‘As verubecestat works differently to other drugs currently being tested for Alzheimer’s, if it proves successful, it could be an important weapon in the arsenal for doctors treating the disease in future.  'Alzheimer’s is a complex and devastating disease and so a multi-pronged approach may give us the best chance of tackling it in the coming years. ‘As the first BACE1 inhibitor to reach the final stages of testing in people, the ultimate test will be whether these ongoing trials show verubecestat can provide tangible benefits for people with Alzheimer’s.  'Scientists have reflected on past lessons in Alzheimer’s drug development and it is promising to see an increasing number of drugs now entering phase 3 clinical testing in the disease, giving us renewed hope in the hunt for new treatments.'

This represented a near 60-percent increase in less than two decades, said an analysis conducted by the American Cancer Society (ACS), released Tuesday at the World Cancer Congress in Paris. As the global population grows and ages, the highest toll will be among women in poor and middle-income countries, it said, and much of it from cancers which are largely preventable. "Most of the deaths occur in young- and middle-aged adults,", placing a heavy burden on families and national economies, said Sally Cowal, senior vice president of global health at the ACS, which compiled the report with pharmaceutical company Merck. A second report, published in The Lancet medical journal on Wednesday, said the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer alone could almost double to 3.2 million a year by 2030 from 1.7 million in 2015. For cervical cancer, the number of diagnoses could "rise by at least 25 percent to over 700,000 by 2030," mainly in low- and middle-income countries, said a statement from The Lancet. Cancer is already killing one in seven women around the world, said the ACS report -- the second highest cause of death after cardiovascular disease.  All four of the deadliest cancers -- breast, colorectal, lung and cervical cancer -- are mostly preventable or can be detected early, when treatment is more successful. In poorer countries, a much smaller proportion of cancer cases are diagnosed and treated than in rich ones, while a much bigger group dies. The relative burden is growing for developing countries as people live longer due to better basic healthcare. Women in these countries are also increasingly exposed to known cancer risk factors "associated with rapid economic transition," said Cowal, "such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors" such as postponing motherhood. "Due to these changes, cancers that were once common only in high-income countries are becoming more prevalent," said the report entitled "The Global Burden of Cancer in Women." - Regional differences - According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 6.7 million new cancer cases and 3.5 million deaths among women worldwide in 2012. Of these, 56 percent of cases and 64 percent of deaths were in less developed countries. "These numbers are expected to increase to 9.9 million cases and 5.5 million deaths among females annually by 2030 as a result of the growth and ageing of the population," said the ACS report. The biggest concentration is in eastern Asia, with 1.7 million cases and a million deaths in 2012, mainly in China. The highest ratio of cancer cases per population group are still reported in high-income countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia, but this was partly due to better access to screening and detection. Deaths, however, were proportionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries with reduced access to diagnosis and treatment. The countries with the highest death rate were Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Mongolia and Papua New Guinea. Breast and lung cancer are the two most common types in both rich and poor nations, with colorectal cancer the number three killer in developed countries and cervical cancer in less developed ones. Cervical cancer can be staved off by vaccination against the cancer-causing Human papillomavirus (HPV) and can be easily detected through regular Papanicolaou (pap) test screens. The Lancet report, comprised of three research papers, said a basic cancer control package could be introduced in low- and middle-income countries for as little as $1.72 (1.55 euros) per person -- the equivalent of just three percent of current health spending in these countries. Universal HPV vaccination of all 12-year-old girls could prevent 420,000 deaths worldwide over their lifetime. "The global community cannot continue to ignore the problem -- hundreds of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily every year," said Richard Sullivan of King's College London, who co-authored The Lancet report. "Not only are the costs of essential cancer services for women lower than expected, but scale-up of diagnostic, surgical and treatment services are a highly effective investment compared the devastating economic cost to countries, communities and families."

Mr. van Hooren has over 20 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry, including extensive work in clinical project and clinical trial management. Prior to joining Xenikos, he was Director Clinical Operations at Acerta-Pharma, where he was responsible for the set up and line management of the European clinical operations group, including the execution of Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trial programs with the compound acalabrutinib, a potential best-in-class irreversible oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, that contributed to a major transaction with AstraZeneca in December 2015. Mr. van Hooren previously worked as a Program Manager at Merck, where he managed Women's Health Programs. He also worked for many years at Organon in positions of increasing responsibility in both clinical development and medical marketing. At Xenikos, Mr. van Hooren will be responsible for preparing and executing the EU/US randomized active-controlled Phase 2 pivotal study of T-Guard in acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as well as exploring new potential indications that might benefit from T-Guard's promise as a therapeutic tool for safely and swiftly resetting the body's immune system in T-cell-mediated diseases. He will take over the responsibilities of Dr. Edna Venneker, who is leaving the company to pursue another opportunity. Xenikos announced just recently that the last patient has completed treatment in the Company's Phase 1/2 trial evaluating T-Guard for the treatment of steroid-resistant acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Ypke van Oosterhout, PhD, Chief Executive Officer, said: "We are delighted to welcome Eric to Xenikos in this very important phase of the T-Guard development. He has a broad background in strategic drug development for both new biological and new chemical entities, as well as in global clinical trial management and medical marketing. His many years of experience will be invaluable as we continue to advance our product candidate, T-Guard in clinical development and eventual registration for market approval in acute graft-versus-host disease, as well as explore other opportunities for this promising development candidate." Dr. van Oosterhout continued: "I would also like to warmly thank Dr. Venneker, who has been instrumental in driving our clinical program. We wish her the very best in her next endeavor." *About Xenikos B.V.* Xenikos B.V. is developing new, innovative immunotherapies to help restore patients' health and save lives.

PHOTO | FILE  In Summary According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 6.7 million new cancer cases and 3.5 million deaths among women worldwide in 2012. Of these, 56 percent of cases and 64 percent of deaths were in less developed countries. "These numbers are expected to increase to 9.9 million cases and 5.5 million deaths among females annually by 2030 as a result of the growth and ageing of the population," said the ACS report. Advertisement By AFP More by this Author Two reports have warned of an explosion in cancer deaths among women, with a toll, mainly from breast cancer, of some 5.5 million per year by 2030 — roughly the population of Denmark. This represented a near 60-percent increase in less than two decades, said an analysis conducted by the American Cancer Society (ACS), released Tuesday at the World Cancer Congress in Paris. As the global population grows and ages, the highest toll will be among women in poor and middle-income countries, it said, and much of it from cancers which are largely preventable. "Most of the deaths occur in young- and middle-aged adults,", placing a heavy burden on families and national economies, said Sally Cowal, senior vice president of global health at the ACS, which compiled the report with pharmaceutical company Merck. A second report, published in The Lancet medical journal on Wednesday, said the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer alone could almost double to 3.2 million a year by 2030 from 1.7 million in 2015. For cervical cancer, the number of diagnoses could "rise by at least 25 percent to over 700,000 by 2030," mainly in low- and middle-income countries, said a statement from The Lancet. Cancer is already killing one in seven women around the world, said the ACS report — the second highest cause of death after cardiovascular disease. All four of the deadliest cancers — breast, colorectal, lung and cervical cancer — are mostly preventable or can be detected early, when treatment is more successful. In poorer countries, a much smaller proportion of cancer cases are diagnosed and treated than in rich ones, while a much bigger group dies. The relative burden is growing for developing countries as people live longer due to better basic healthcare. Women in these countries are also increasingly exposed to known cancer risk factors "associated with rapid economic transition," said Cowal, "such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors" such as postponing motherhood. "Due to these changes, cancers that were once common only in high-income countries are becoming more prevalent," said the report entitled "The Global Burden of Cancer in Women." REGIONAL DIFFERENCES According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 6.7 million new cancer cases and 3.5 million deaths among women worldwide in 2012. Of these, 56 percent of cases and 64 percent of deaths were in less developed countries. "These numbers are expected to increase to 9.9 million cases and 5.5 million deaths among females annually by 2030 as a result of the growth and ageing of the population," said the ACS report. The biggest concentration is in eastern Asia, with 1.7 million cases and a million deaths in 2012, mainly in China. The highest ratio of cancer cases per population group are still reported in high-income countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia, but this was partly due to better access to screening and detection. Deaths, however, were proportionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries with reduced access to diagnosis and treatment. The countries with the highest death rate were Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Mongolia and Papua New Guinea. BREAST AND LUNG CANCER Breast and lung cancer are the two most common types in both rich and poor nations, with colorectal cancer the number three killer in developed countries and cervical cancer in less developed ones. Cervical cancer can be staved off by vaccination against the cancer-causing Human papillomavirus (HPV) and can be easily detected through regular Papanicolaou (pap) test screens. The Lancet report, comprised of three research papers, said a basic cancer control package could be introduced in low- and middle-income countries for as little as $1.72 (1.55 euros) per person — the equivalent of just three percent of current health spending in these countries. Universal HPV vaccination of all 12-year-old girls could prevent 420,000 deaths worldwide over their lifetime. "The global community cannot continue to ignore the problem — hundreds of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily every year," said Richard Sullivan of King's College London, who co-authored The Lancet report. "Not only are the costs of essential cancer services for women lower than expected, but scale-up of diagnostic, surgical and treatment services are a highly effective investment compared the devastating economic cost to countries, communities and families."   email print In the headlines Hunt for Raila mole in Kalonzo backyard Party to discuss allegation that Muthama is working on a plot to deny Kalonzo chance to carry Wife in custody after murder of school principal Principal of Kiru Boys went missing last week and was found strangled nearly a week later Boy takes mental drug to pass math Murkomen won’t face MPs, says Gumbo Options galore for Obama in his retirement life Lands officials accused of laxity, shielding grabbers from the law Missing principal found dead in Kiambu - VIDEO We are united, Jubilee rivals for Nairobi governorship say Latest: Life and Style Showbiz Funky Kool and the Gang bring boogie back to thrilled fans: PHOTOS   Health, Science and Environment Seeking halal contraception in Kenya's Muslim northeast   Showbiz Hollywood worries about Trump as stars honour Jackie Chan   DN2 I was overweight and miserable   DN2 KITOTO: He wants me to be his second wife...   DN2 KITOTO: My girlfriend is still seeing her ex   DN2 KITOTO: How do you relate with your spouse?   LATEST FROM NAIROBI NEWS LATEST NTV VIDEOS CJ Maranga says he will lead a united Supreme Court Missing Kiru Boys Principal found dead, wife the main suspect in murder Eldoret residents voice their views on NTV's feature poor millionaire Death of inmate at Wajir GK prison raises concerns KCSE scare in Kisumu as exam papers are delivered in carton with a hole Watch More Videos Contact Us FAQ E-papers About Us Business Daily Daily Monitor Nairobi News NTV The Citizen The EastAfrican

This would represent a near 60 per cent increase in less than two decades, said an analysis conducted by the American Cancer Society (ACS), released Tuesday at the World Cancer Congress in Paris. As the global population grows and ages, the highest toll will be among women in poor and middle-income countries, it said, and much of it from cancers which are largely preventable. “Most of the deaths occur in young- and middle-aged adults,” placing a heavy burden on families and national economies, said Sally Cowal, senior vice-president of global health at the ACS, which compiled the report with pharmaceutical company Merck. A second report, published in The Lancet medical journal on Wednesday, said the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer alone could almost double to 3.2 million a year by 2030 from 1.7 million in 2015. For cervical cancer, the number of diagnoses could “rise by at least 25 per cent to over 700,000 by 2030,” mainly in low- and middle-income countries, said a statement from The Lancet. Cancer is already killing one in seven women around the world, said the ACS report - the second highest cause of death after cardiovascular disease. All four of the deadliest cancers - breast, colorectal, lung and cervical cancer - are mostly preventable or can be detected early, when treatment is more successful. In poorer countries, a much smaller proportion of cancer cases are diagnosed and treated than in rich ones, while a much bigger group dies. The relative burden is growing for developing countries as people live longer due to better basic healthcare. Women in these countries are also increasingly exposed to known cancer risk factors “associated with rapid economic transition,” said Cowal, “such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors” such as postponing motherhood. “Due to these changes, cancers that were once common only in high-income countries are becoming more prevalent,” said the report entitled “The Global Burden of Cancer in Women.” According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 6.7 million new cancer cases and 3.5 million deaths among women worldwide in 2012. Of these, 56 per cent of cases and 64 per cent of deaths were in less developed countries. “These numbers are expected to increase to 9.9 million cases and 5.5 million deaths among females annually by 2030 as a result of the growth and ageing of the population,” said the ACS report. The biggest concentration is in eastern Asia, with 1.7 million cases and a million deaths in 2012, mainly in China. The highest ratio of cancer cases per population group are still reported in high-income countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia, but this was partly due to better access to screening and detection. Deaths, however, were proportionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries with reduced access to diagnosis and treatment. The countries with the highest death rate were Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Mongolia and Papua New Guinea. Breast and lung cancer are the two most common types in both rich and poor nations, with colorectal cancer the number three killer in developed countries and cervical cancer in less developed ones. Cervical cancer can be staved off by vaccination against the cancer-causing Human papillomavirus (HPV) and can be easily detected through regular pap test screens. The Lancet report, comprised of three research papers, said a basic cancer control package could be introduced in low- and middle-income countries for as little as US$1.72 per person - the equivalent of just three per cent of current health spending in these countries. Universal HPV vaccination of all 12-year-old girls could prevent 420,000 deaths worldwide over their lifetime. “The global community cannot continue to ignore the problem -- hundreds of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily every year,” said Richard Sullivan of King’s College London, who co-authored The Lancet report. “Not only are the costs of essential cancer services for women lower than expected, but scale-up of diagnostic, surgical and treatment services are a highly effective investment compared the devastating economic cost to countries, communities and families.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: women at risk: death toll from cancer to spike   Most Popular Viewed 1 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election 2 The C-word: why Hong Kong localists have offended all Chinese 3 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 4 Legco adjourned amid chaos as Hong Kong localists try to retake oaths and crash relocated meeting 5 Beijing to interpret Hong Kong’s Basic Law over oath-taking saga Shared 1 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 2 The C-word: why Hong Kong localists have offended all Chinese 3 Finance, wealth and ... slavery?

All four of the deadliest cancers – breast, colorectal, lung and cervical cancer – are mostly preventable or can be detected early, when treatment is more successful. In poorer countries, a much smaller proportion of cancer cases are diagnosed and treated than in rich ones, while a much bigger group dies. The relative burden is growing for developing countries as people live longer due to better basic healthcare. Women in these countries are also increasingly exposed to known cancer risk factors "associated with rapid economic transition," said Cowal, "such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors" such as postponing motherhood. "Due to these changes, cancers that were once common only in high-income countries are becoming more prevalent," said the report entitled "The Global Burden of Cancer in Women." Regional differences According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 6.7 million new cancer cases and 3.5 million deaths among women worldwide in 2012. Of these, 56% of cases and 64% of deaths were in less developed countries. "These numbers are expected to increase to 9.9 million cases and 5.5 million deaths among females annually by 2030 as a result of the growth and ageing of the population," said the ACS report. The biggest concentration is in eastern Asia, with 1.7 million cases and a million deaths in 2012, mainly in China. The highest ratio of cancer cases per population group are still reported in high-income countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia, but this was partly due to better access to screening and detection. Deaths, however, were proportionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries with reduced access to diagnosis and treatment. The countries with the highest death rate were Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Mongolia and Papua New Guinea. Breast and lung cancer are the two most common types in both rich and poor nations, with colorectal cancer the number three killer in developed countries and cervical cancer in less developed ones. Cervical cancer can be staved off by vaccination against the cancer-causing Human papillomavirus (HPV) and can be easily detected through regular Papanicolaou (pap) test screens. The Lancet report, comprised of three research papers, said a basic cancer control package could be introduced in low- and middle-income countries for as little as US$1.72 (RM7.21) per person – the equivalent of just three percent of current health spending in these countries. Universal HPV vaccination of all 12-year-old girls could prevent 420,000 deaths worldwide over their lifetime. "The global community cannot continue to ignore the problem – hundreds of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily every year," said Richard Sullivan of King's College London, who co-authored The Lancet report. "Not only are the costs of essential cancer services for women lower than expected, but scale-up of diagnostic, surgical and treatment services are a highly effective investment compared the devastating economic cost to countries, communities and families." — AFP Share this news: Lifestyle Opinion Property Education Media & Marketing Community Photos Home Contact Us RSS Archive Advertise with Us View desktop version Copyright © 2016 Sun Media Corporation Sdn.

In the highly competitive multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment market, prescription barriers helped 5 of the 10 brands we surveyed eke out narrow market share gains while the other 5 lost out. Which barriers had the biggest impact? Are they the ones that helped the most prescribed brand gain three times as much market share as its closest rival? Find out in Market Access Impact: MS. Request sample pages The report covers 10 major MS drugs from Bayer, Biogen, EMD Serono, Genzyme, Novartis, and Teva. You'll learn which barriers cost your brand the most share, and see which competitors you're losing share to and taking it from—insight you can use to improve your market access strategy. Not your market? Click here to see the EU report Top Takeaways Highly competitive market: More than two thirds of the doctors surveyed prescribe eight of the ten brands covered in the report. Nearly all doctors prescribe the top two brands. Half of brands benefit from barriers: But the most prescribed brand benefits the most, with a barrier-related gain three times as high as any competitor's. Market access is the #1 issue: Barriers related to market access affect nearly as many prescriptions as all other barriers combined. Excellent brand awareness and perception: Nearly all doctors surveyed are aware of the brands covered, and most of them are willing to consider brands they don't currently prescribe. Clear market loser: More doctors experience barriers with one brand in particular. Not surprisingly, that brand is least prescribed, and sees a net share loss to all of the others. Insight into 10 Major MS Drugs Aubagio (teriflunomide; Genzyme) Avonex (interferon beta-1a; Biogen) Betaferon (interferon beta-1b; Bayer) Copaxone (glatiramer acetate; Teva) Gilenya (fingolimod; Novartis) Lemtrada (alemtuzumab; Genzyme) Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a; Biogen) Rebif (interferon beta-1a; Merck Group) Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate; Biogen) Tysabri (natalizumab; Biogen) Paragraph>Exploring Market Access Barriers Market Access Impact: MS explores key issues affecting MS drug manufacturers. You'll learn: How barriers affect market access: What brands do doctors prescribe the most? How many prescriptions do barriers affect? Which barriers have the biggest impact? How barriers affect your brand: How many doctors prescribe your brand? How many don't, but would consider it? Why don't doctors prescribe your brand? What do they prescribe instead? Which competing brands does your brand take market share from? A Report Based on Expert Knowledge We surveyed 100 US neurologists, chosen from the largest community of validated physicians in the world.

Posted 04 Nov 2016 05:10 Updated 04 Nov 2016 06:04 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Nov 3, 2016 in New York City. (Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: The S&P 500 fell for the eighth straight session on Thursday (Nov 3) as stocks continued to price in a potential win by Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump, who is seen by many investors as an unpredictable wildcard, continues to trail Democrat Hillary Clinton in most polls, but has significantly narrowed the gap in the last 10 days. "This election is causing jitters for investors," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. "An increasing number of investors would prefer to watch this election from the sidelines and not have the full exposure that they've got." The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 28.97 points (0.16 per cent) to 17,930.67, its sixth straight decline. The broad-based S&P 500 fell 9.28 points (0.44 per cent) to 2,088.66, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 47.16 points (0.92 per cent) to 5,058.41, its eighth straight fall. Signs of nervousness showed in the Vix volatility index, which measures market fear. The index vaulted about 14 per cent to 22.08, the highest level since it hit 25.76 after Britain's shock vote in June to exit the European Union. Th Vix was up more than 40 per cent since Oct 27. Facebook sank 5.6 per cent despite reporting a 166 per cent jump in third-quarter profits to US$2.4 billon. Analysts said investors were unnerved by a warning of weaker revenue growth in 2017 and a plan to beef up investment in engineers and data-centres. Shares of generic drug makers plunged after Bloomberg reported that US antitrust investigators could unveil criminal charges of price-fixing by the industry before year-end. These included Mylan, down 6.9 per cent, and Teva, down 9.6 per cent. Other pharmaceutical stocks were also under pressure, with Dow members Pfizer falling 2.4 per cent and Merck 0.7 per cent. Insurer AIG fell 4.0 per cent after reporting third quarter operating earnings of US$1.00 per share, below the US$1.21 expected by analysts. The results included US$622 million in expenses because of increased costs in payments for customers who are living longer, particularly those on disability. Media-entertainment group 21st Century Fox surged 7.3 per cent as it reported a 22 per cent rise in net profit to US$821 million for the quarter ending Sep 30, bolstered by its Fox News Channel amid a busy US election campaign. Some other media stocks were also strong, with CBS rising 0.6 per cent and Dow member Disney 1.6 per cent. Other companies with major moves after earnings included Fitbit, down 33.6 per cent, Marathon Oil, up 10.7 per cent and US Steel, up 7.7 per cent. - AFP/ec Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

He led a report Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine describing two patients who died of heart trouble two weeks after receiving their first doses of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, for the deadly skin cancer melanoma. Two similar drugs also are on the market, and the study leaders believe they might pose heart risks, too. “My sense is that this is a class effect, not limited to one drug,” Moslehi said. The risks do not negate the huge benefits of these relatively new types of drugs, doctors stress. Called checkpoint inhibitors, they have transformed treatment of several types of cancer by helping the immune system see and attack tumors.   In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumor but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumor but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. Patients need to be told of the risks, monitored closely and treated quickly with medicines to quell the immune response if trouble develops. Besides melanoma, the Opdivo-Yervoy combination is used to treat some lung cancers, though at different doses. Other checkpoint inhibitors include Genentech’s Tecentriq, for bladder cancer, and Merck & Co.’s Keytruda, which former President Jimmy Carter received for melanoma that spread to his brain. Many more are in testing. There have been occasional, previous reports of heart troubles with these drugs. After the two recent deaths, doctors asked Bristol-Myers to check patient safety records on Opdivo and Yervoy. As of April, 18 cases of serious heart inflammation were found among 20,594 patients receiving either or both drugs, a rate of 0.09 percent. It was more severe and more common among people on both drugs, affecting 0.27 percent of those patients. Bristol-Myers scientists helped write the journal report, and some other authors consult for the company. Studies have shown that the drug combination gives a stronger anti-cancer effect than either drug alone, but “we’ve known this is a double-edged sword” because of the risk of over-stimulating the immune system, said Dr. Jeffrey Sosman of Northwestern University in Chicago, who treated the two patients who died. (Brian A. Jackson/iStock) “The big question is, is there enough advantage to using the combination, which is much more toxic, than a single drug,” he said. That’s a larger question facing the cancer field, not just with immune therapies. Some of the newer gene-targeting drugs also have produced major side effects when used in combination. Yet many doctors believe that combos may be the best way to get cancer to go into remission and stay there longer, by shutting down multiple pathways the tumor employs at once. Dr. Michael Atkins, deputy director of the Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes the heart problems with checkpoint inhibitors will turn out to be treatable in most patients. “It just gives us a moment of pause,” said Atkins, who led a study that included one of the two patients who died. “This is a rare event … but it’s a particularly serious one.” Editor’s Picks ‘Human Rights is Part of the DNA of America’: An Interview with Gary Locke on Hillary Clinton, China, and the 2016 Election Trump Elected President: Here’s How He Plans to Change America Honoring Veterans Today, Preparing Our Young to Do So Tomorrow Receive Our Epoch 10 Newsletter Important stories from around the world, in your inbox daily.

The punishment, based on Sharia law, comes less than a month after the kingdom executed another prince for murder a Saudi newspaper reported. It said the prince had been sentenced to flogging and jail without specifying the charges. It was unclear how many lashes he received. However, the brief report in Okaz daily did not disclose the offence for which he was being punished. The unidentified prince was also ordered to serve a prison sentence, the newspaper added. Last month, Saudi authorities executed Prince Turki bin Saud al-Kabir in a highly unusual case involving one of the thousands of members of the royal family. He was condemned to death for shooting dead Adel al-Mahemid, a Saudi, during a brawl. Most people put to death in Saudi Arabia are beheaded with a sword.

"The problem is, no one has this on their radar," so patients are not routinely checked for it, said Dr. Javid Moslehi, head of a Vanderbilt University clinic specializing in heart risks from cancer therapies. Youssef Cohen, 68, undergoes cancer treatment with the drug Keytruda John Moore / Getty Images, file He led a team of experts who reported Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine about two patients who died of heart trouble two weeks after receiving their first doses of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, for the deadly skin cancer melanoma. Two similar drugs also are on the market, and the study leaders believe they might pose heart risks, too. "My sense is that this is a class effect, not limited to one drug," Moslehi said. Related: Cancer Drug Keytruda Keeps Some Patients Alive Three Years The risks do not negate the huge benefits of these relatively new types of drugs, doctors stress. Called checkpoint inhibitors, they have transformed treatment of several types of cancer by helping the immune system see and attack tumors. "My sense is that this is a class effect, not limited to one drug." In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumor but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. Patients need to be told of the risks, monitored closely and treated quickly with medicines to quell the immune response if trouble develops. Besides melanoma, the Opdivo-Yervoy combination is used to treat some lung cancers, though at different doses. Other checkpoint inhibitors include Genentech's Tecentriq, for bladder cancer, and Merck & Co.'s Keytruda, which former President Jimmy Carter received for melanoma that spread to his brain. Many more are in testing. There have been occasional, previous reports of heart troubles with these drugs. After the two recent deaths, doctors asked Bristol-Myers to check patient safety records on Opdivo and Yervoy. "This is a rare event ... but it's a particularly serious one." As of April, 18 cases of serious heart inflammation were found among 20,594 patients receiving either or both drugs, a rate of 0.09 percent. It was more severe and more common among people on both drugs, affecting 0.27 percent of those patients. Bristol-Myers scientists helped write the journal report, and some other authors consult for the company. Studies have shown that the drug combination gives a stronger anti-cancer effect than either drug alone, but "we've known this is a double-edged sword" because of the risk of over-stimulating the immune system, said Dr. Jeffrey Sosman of Northwestern University in Chicago, who treated the two patients who died. "The big question is, is there enough advantage to using the combination, which is much more toxic, than a single drug," he said. Related: Drug Harnesses Immune System to Fight Cancer That's a larger question facing the cancer field, not just with immune therapies. Some of the newer gene-targeting drugs also have produced major side effects when used in combination. Yet many doctors believe that combos may be the best way to get cancer to go into remission and stay there longer, by shutting down multiple pathways the tumor employs at once. Dr. Michael Atkins, deputy director of the Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes the heart problems with checkpoint inhibitors will turn out to be treatable in most patients. "It just gives us a moment of pause," said Atkins, who led a study that included one of the two patients who died. "This is a rare event ... but it's a particularly serious one."

November 03, 2016 07:00 ET Delivra Advances Revolutionary Treatment for Cardiovascular Disease TORONTO, ON--(Marketwired - November 03, 2016) - Delivra Corp. ("Delivra", or "the Company") (TSX VENTURE: DVA) announced today the Company has successfully completed its first phase pre-clinical research into transdermal berberine for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease related to high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Berberine is a natural plant extract that has been used in eastern medicine for thousands of years, and more recently also in the western world. There is an abundance of research on berberine, and its effectiveness in reducing cholesterol and triglycerides is well-established. The main challenges with the use of berberine in its traditional oral format are exceptionally low bioavailability (< 2%) and highly adverse gastrointestinal events. Transdermal berberine from Delivra overcomes these challenges, showing 8-times higher concentration levels in the blood than oral, with no gastrointestinal side effects, and proved significantly more effective than oral in reducing cholesterol and triglycerides in a model of metabolic disease. This achievement represents a first-in-class platform that may prove effective in reducing cholesterol, triglycerides, and other hallmarks of cardiovascular disease. Delivra's research and development includes formulations, compounding, stability testing, and measurement of systemic penetration and delivery of topical berberine and the closely related natural product, dihydroberberine (DHB). Delivra-berberine and Delivra-DHB achieve circulating blood levels 8-times higher than an oral equivalent treatment, which overcomes a key limitation of this natural compound. With increased berberine blood levels is an expected increase in this compound's effectiveness to reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels, with Delivra-DHB achieving a profound reduction in cholesterol by 34% and reduction in triglycerides by 85%, as compared to control. While this is pre-clinical data, it is very promising in the context of published rates for leading statin drugs in the range of 20-35% reduction in cholesterol and 10-30% reduction in triglycerides. In certain cases, this treatment may provide a natural alternative to the use of statin drugs, the most prescribed drug class in the world, and most commonly recognized by the trade names Lipitor™ (Pfizer Inc.), Zocor™ (Merck & Co. Inc.), and Crestor™ (Astra Zeneca Limited). A Delivra berberine therapy could avoid the side effects associated with statin drugs, including muscle pain, liver damage, stomach upset, increased blood sugar, and a range of neurological issues. Interestingly, preliminary data suggests the Delivra transdermal berberine may also function synergistically to enhance the performance of statin drugs, potentially allowing greater benefits while taking less drug. "These strong results demonstrate the potential for a break-through natural product to address a globally prevalent health issue," said Dr. Joe Gabriele, founder and CEO of Delivra. "To bring to market a natural product that works as well or better than some of the world's most commonly prescribed drugs, without the side effects, would be a game changer for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. We will continue to advance our research, through further pre-clinical work and then into clinical trials, and we look forward to continuing to report to shareholders on our progress." Delivra has filed a provisional US patent to protect its unique berberine formulations. ABOUT DELIVRA CORP.

The research published in the journal Science Translational Medicine on the basis of a small 32-person sample gave rise to two broader clinical trials that are now underway with more than 3,000 subjects. The treatment uses a compound called verubecestat, developed by US pharmaceutical firm. It reduces levels of proteins called beta amyloids by blocking an enzyme known as BACE1. In people with Alzheimer's disease, the proteins clump into plaques that damage the brain, affecting cognitive abilities, especially memory. The enzyme plays a key role in production of the proteins. The 32 people who participated in the first clinical trial had been diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's. Pharmaceutical labs are working to develop compounds that can stop or even reverse the formation of these plaques. Until now, products developed to neutralise the BACEI enzyme had very toxic side effects, such as liver damage or further neuro-degeneration. But verubecestat does not, said Dr Matthew Kennedy of the Merck research lab in northeastern state of New Jersey. Researchers found that one or two doses of the compound were enough to lower protein levels without causing side effects. The two so-called phase 3 clinical trials now under way to evaluate how well verubecestat works will conclude in July 2017. If the results are good, the compound could be marketed as a pill in two or three years. The number of people in the United States suffering from mind-wasting Alzheimer's could surpass 28 million by 2050 after the entire baby boomer generation gets past age 80, according to projections. The World Health Organization says 36 million people around the world suffer from some form of dementia, most of them with Alzheimer. The figure is expected to double by 2030 to exceed 65.7 million, and triple by 2050 to 115.4 million, if no effective treatment is found in the next few years. ― AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Cut genetic risk of heart attack with a healthy lifestyle says new research Rihanna and Manolo Blahnik team up on winter shoe collection Michael Kors: How the new Singapore flaghsip store is better than online shopping World Diabetes Day: Five dietary tips for diabetics Historic gems to star at Geneva jewel auctions Elephants kneel to pay respect to late Thai king Bhumibol ‘Rose Gold’ is this winter’s hottest hair trend What it is like being a 24-year-old female farmer in Singapore Blood pressure spike around doctors might point to heart problem Hilarious Singaporean take on BBC’s ‘Iguana vs Snake’ documentary (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Debu bauksit beri ancaman Alzheimer, kata penyelidik Eye movement link to Alzheimer’s (VIDEO) Pengarah muzik tersohor Ooi Eow Jin dikenang RTM dalam konsert khas (VIDEO) Kajian: Sambung belajar di hari tua kurangkan risiko nyanyuk Scientists identify protein key to Alzheimer’s treatment Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Global Market Study on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Treatment: North America Likely to Emerge as the Dominant Market in 2016 LONDON, Nov. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — In a newly published report on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Drugs, Persistence Market Research analyzes the PCOS drugs market over an eight-year period from 2016 to 2024 and studies the key drivers and trends impacting the market. The primary objective of the report is to provide updates and information related to market opportunities and useful insights into factors that are significantly transforming businesses and enterprises in the global PCOS market. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) – also known as Stein-Leventhal Syndrome – is a common hormonal endocrine disorder that affects women of child bearing age i.e. 15 to 49 years. This disease is characterized by the formation of cysts on the ovaries leading to an insufficiency of the ovulation initiating hormone in the female body. PCOS mainly occurs due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors, which cause an abnormal function of the hormones present in the pituitary gland that regulate ovulation. Few of the symptoms of PCOS include irregular menstruation, excess facial and body hair, infertility, and acne and other skin problems. PCOS is also associated with diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart diseases, acute depression, and obstructive sleep apnea. Currently, there are no specific diagnostic tests available for the detection of PCOS; however, blood tests, physical examination, vaginal ultrasound, and medical history analysis are widely recommended by general physicians and gynecologists. While there is no cure for PCOS, its symptoms and associated conditions can be managed with the help of lifestyle modification activities, weight loss management, and medications. Currently, no drugs are approved by the FDA and EMA for PCOS. However, oral contraceptives, insulin sensitizing agents, and aromatase inhibitors are used as first line agents for the treatment of irregular menstruation, diabetes, and facial hair growth respectively. This report covers the global PCOS drugs market performance in terms of revenue contribution from various segments. Included in the report is a detailed impact analysis of key trends, drivers, restraints, and opportunities influencing the growth of the global polycystic ovary syndrome drugs market. The report begins with an overview of the polycystic ovary syndrome drugs process and the main reasons why patients worldwide are adopting this process.

A small trial of the drug was primarily aimed at assessing safety, but the findings suggest it effectively “switched off” the production of toxic amyloid proteins that lead to the sticky plaques seen in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. If the tablet, produced by pharmaceutical giant Merck, is also shown to slow the pace of mental decline – a crucial question that a major clinical trial should answer when it reports next year – it could be the first treatment for Alzheimer’s to be licensed in more than a decade.

He led a report Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine describing two patients who died of heart trouble two weeks after receiving their first doses of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, for the deadly skin cancer melanoma. Two similar drugs also are on the market, and the study leaders believe they might pose heart risks, too. “My sense is that this is a class effect, not limited to one drug,” Moslehi said. The risks do not negate the huge benefits of these relatively new types of drugs, doctors stress. Called checkpoint inhibitors, they have transformed treatment of several types of cancer by helping the immune system see and attack tumors. In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumor but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. Patients need to be told of the risks, monitored closely and treated quickly with medicines to quell the immune response if trouble develops. Besides melanoma, the Opdivo-Yervoy combination is used to treat some lung cancers, though at different doses. Other checkpoint inhibitors include Genentech’s Tecentriq, for bladder cancer, and Merck & Co.’s Keytruda, which former President Jimmy Carter received for melanoma that spread to his brain. Many more are in testing. There have been occasional, previous reports of heart troubles with these drugs. After the two recent deaths, doctors asked Bristol-Myers to check patient safety records on Opdivo and Yervoy. As of April, 18 cases of serious heart inflammation were found among 20,594 patients receiving either or both drugs, a rate of 0.09 percent. It was more severe and more common among people on both drugs, affecting 0.27 percent of those patients. Bristol-Myers scientists helped write the journal report, and some other authors consult for the company. Studies have shown that the drug combination gives a stronger anti-cancer effect than either drug alone, but “we’ve known this is a double-edged sword” because of the risk of over-stimulating the immune system, said Dr. Jeffrey Sosman of Northwestern University in Chicago, who treated the two patients who died. “The big question is, is there enough advantage to using the combination, which is much more toxic, than a single drug,” he said. That’s a larger question facing the cancer field, not just with immune therapies. Some of the newer gene-targeting drugs also have produced major side effects when used in combination. Yet many doctors believe that combos may be the best way to get cancer to go into remission and stay there longer, by shutting down multiple pathways the tumor employs at once. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Studies have shown that the drug combination gives a stronger anti-cancer effect than either drug alone, but "we've known this is a double-edged sword" because of the risk of over-stimulating the immune system, said Dr. Jeffrey Sosman of Northwestern University in Chicago, who treated the two patients who died. "The big question is, is there enough advantage to using the combination, which is much more toxic, than a single drug," he said. That's a larger question facing the cancer field, not just with immune therapies. Some of the newer gene-targeting drugs also have produced major side effects when used in combination. Yet many doctors believe that combos may be the best way to get cancer to go into remission and stay there longer, by shutting down multiple pathways the tumor employs at once. Dr. Michael Atkins, deputy director of the Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes the heart problems with checkpoint inhibitors will turn out to be treatable in most patients. "It just gives us a moment of pause," said Atkins, who led a study that included one of the two patients who died. "This is a rare event ... but it's a particularly serious one." ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP .

He led a report published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine describing two patients who died of heart trouble two weeks after receiving their first doses of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, for the deadly skin cancer melanoma. Two similar drugs also are on the market, and the study leaders believe they might pose heart risks, too. “My sense is that this is a class effect, not limited to one drug,” Moslehi said. The risks do not negate the huge benefits of these relatively new types of drugs, doctors stress. Called checkpoint inhibitors, they have transformed treatment of several types of cancer by helping the immune system see and attack tumors. In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumor but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. Patients need to be told of the risks, monitored closely and treated quickly with medicines to quell the immune response if trouble develops. Besides melanoma, the Opdivo-Yervoy combination is used to treat some lung cancers, though at different doses. Other checkpoint inhibitors include Genentech’s Tecentriq, for bladder cancer, and Merck & Co.’s Keytruda, which former President Jimmy Carter received for melanoma that spread to his brain. Many more are in testing. There have been occasional, previous reports of heart troubles with these drugs. After the two recent deaths, doctors asked Bristol-Myers to check patient safety records on Opdivo and Yervoy. As of April, 18 cases of serious heart inflammation were found among 20,594 patients receiving either or both drugs, a rate of 0.09 percent. It was more severe and more common among people on both drugs, affecting 0.27 percent of those patients. Studies have shown that the drug combination gives a stronger anticancer effect than either drug alone.

"The problem is, no one has this on their radar," so patients are not routinely checked for it, said Dr. Javid Moslehi, head of a Vanderbilt University clinic specializing in heart risks from cancer therapies. He led a report Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine describing two patients who died of heart trouble two weeks after receiving their first doses of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, for the deadly skin cancer melanoma. Two similar drugs also are on the market, and the study leaders believe they might pose heart risks, too. "My sense is that this is a class effect, not limited to one drug," Moslehi said. The risks do not negate the huge benefits of these relatively new types of drugs, doctors stress. Called checkpoint inhibitors, they have transformed treatment of several types of cancer by helping the immune system see and attack tumors. In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumor but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. Patients need to be told of the risks, monitored closely and treated quickly with medicines to quell the immune response if trouble develops. Besides melanoma, the Opdivo-Yervoy combination is used to treat some lung cancers, though at different doses. Other checkpoint inhibitors include Genentech's Tecentriq, for bladder cancer, and Merck & Co.'s Keytruda, which former President Jimmy Carter received for melanoma that spread to his brain. Many more are in testing. There have been occasional, previous reports of heart troubles with these drugs. After the two recent deaths, doctors asked Bristol-Myers to check patient safety records on Opdivo and Yervoy. As of April, 18 cases of serious heart inflammation were found among 20,594 patients receiving either or both drugs, a rate of 0.09 percent. It was more severe and more common among people on both drugs, affecting 0.27 percent of those patients. Bristol-Myers scientists helped write the journal report, and some other authors consult for the company. Studies have shown that the drug combination gives a stronger anti-cancer effect than either drug alone, but "we've known this is a double-edged sword" because of the risk of over-stimulating the immune system, said Dr. Jeffrey Sosman of Northwestern University in Chicago, who treated the two patients who died. "The big question is, is there enough advantage to using the combination, which is much more toxic, than a single drug," he said. That's a larger question facing the cancer field, not just with immune therapies. Some of the newer gene-targeting drugs also have produced major side effects when used in combination. Yet many doctors believe that combos may be the best way to get cancer to go into remission and stay there longer, by shutting down multiple pathways the tumor employs at once. Dr. Michael Atkins, deputy director of the Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes the heart problems with checkpoint inhibitors will turn out to be treatable in most patients. "It just gives us a moment of pause," said Atkins, who led a study that included one of the two patients who died. "This is a rare event ... but it's a particularly serious one." ——— Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP . 0 Shares Email Star Comments Some Immune-Boosting Cancer Drugs May Pose Rare Heart Risks Google Highlighting Inaccurate Story About Election Results HP Enterprise Ordered to Keep Working on Rhode Island System PHOTO GALLERY: Supermoon Puts on a Show Around the World Trump on Twitter: Restrained or an Unvarnished White House?

disturbing downside to some powerful new drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer: In rare cases, they may cause potentially fatal heart damage, especially when used together. "The problem is, no one has this on their radar," so patients are not routinely checked for it, said Dr. Javid Moslehi, head of a Vanderbilt University clinic specializing in heart risks from cancer therapies. He led a report Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine describing two patients who died of heart trouble two weeks after receiving their first doses of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, for the deadly skin cancer melanoma. Two similar drugs also are on the market, and the study leaders believe they might pose heart risks, too. "My sense is that this is a class effect, not limited to one drug," Moslehi said. The risks do not negate the huge benefits of these relatively new types of drugs, doctors stress. Called checkpoint inhibitors, they have transformed treatment of several types of cancer by helping the immune system see and attack tumors. In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumor but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. Patients need to be told of the risks, monitored closely and treated quickly with medicines to quell the immune response if trouble develops. Besides melanoma, the Opdivo-Yervoy combination is used to treat some lung cancers, though at different doses. Other checkpoint inhibitors include Genentech's Tecentriq, for bladder cancer, and Merck & Co.'s Keytruda, which former President Jimmy Carter received for melanoma that spread to his brain. Many more are in testing. There have been occasional, previous reports of heart troubles with these drugs. After the two recent deaths, doctors asked Bristol-Myers to check patient safety records on Opdivo and Yervoy. As of April, 18 cases of serious heart inflammation were found among 20,594 patients receiving either or both drugs, a rate of 0.09 percent. It was more severe and more common among people on both drugs, affecting 0.27 percent of those patients. Bristol-Myers scientists helped write the journal report, and some other authors consult for the company. Studies have shown that the drug combination gives a stronger anti-cancer effect than either drug alone, but "we've known this is a double-edged sword" because of the risk of over-stimulating the immune system, said Dr. Jeffrey Sosman of Northwestern University in Chicago, who treated the two patients who died. "The big question is, is there enough advantage to using the combination, which is much more toxic, than a single drug," he said. That's a larger question facing the cancer field, not just with immune therapies. Some of the newer gene-targeting drugs also have produced major side effects when used in combination. Yet many doctors believe that combos may be the best way to get cancer to go into remission and stay there longer, by shutting down multiple pathways the tumor employs at once. Dr. Michael Atkins, deputy director of the Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes the heart problems with checkpoint inhibitors will turn out to be treatable in most patients. "It just gives us a moment of pause," said Atkins, who led a study that included one of the two patients who died. "This is a rare event ... but it's a particularly serious one." ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP . Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

XNCR, +13.17% a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 and provided a review of pipeline and corporate highlights. "During the third quarter, we initiated clinical trials across our internal pipeline of XmAb programs, including Phase 1 studies of subcutaneously administered XmAb®5871 and XmAb®7195, and a first-in-human Phase 1 study of our lead immuno-oncology bispecific antibody candidate, XmAb®14045," said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Xencor. "With these milestones complete and a strong cash position, we expect to report data from multiple clinical trials in the year ahead, while also initiating studies of additional bispecific oncology candidates and continuing to explore the breadth of our Fc engineering technology." Pipeline Highlights: XmAb5871: XmAb5871 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets CD19 with its variable domain and that uses Xencor's XmAb immune inhibitor Fc domain to target FcRIIb, a receptor that inhibits B-cell function. In March 2016, Xencor initiated Phase 2 clinical studies of XmAb5871 for the treatment of IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and in July 2016, Xencor initiated a Phase 1 trial of subcutaneously administered XmAb5871. Preliminary data from IgG4-RD Phase 2 trial to be presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2016 Annual Meeting on November 13, 2016 in Washington, DC; additional data expected in 2017 Initial data from subcutaneous administration trial expected in 2017 Initial data from SLE Phase 2 trial expected in 2018 XmAb7195: XmAb7195 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets IgE with its variable domain and uses Xencor's XmAb Immune Inhibitor Fc domain to target FcRIIb, resulting in three distinct mechanisms of action for reducing IgE levels. In September 2016, Xencor initiated a Phase 1b multi-dose trial of subcutaneously administered XmAb7195 for the treatment of allergic disease. Initial data from subcutaneous administration Phase 1b trial expected in 1H17 Bispecific Oncology Pipeline: Xencor's initial bispecific antibody programs are tumor-targeted antibodies that contain both a tumor antigen binding domain and a cytotoxic T-cell binding domain. These bispecific antibodies activate T cells for highly potent and targeted killing of malignant cells. Their XmAb Fc domains confer long circulating half-lives, stability and ease of manufacture. In September 2016, Xencor initiated a Phase 1 trial of XmAb14045 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other CD123-expressing hematologic malignancies. Initial data from XmAb14045 Phase 1 trial expected in 2017 Initiation of Phase 1 trial for XmAb®13676 in B-cell malignancies expected in 1Q17; initial data expected in 2018 Investigational New Drug (IND) application filing for XmAb®18087 in neuroendocrine tumors expected in 2017 IND application filing for XmAb®20717, a PD-1 x CTLA-4 dual checkpoint inhibitor, in multiple oncology indications expected in 2018 Partnered XmAb Programs: Nine pharmaceutical companies and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are advancing novel drug candidates either discovered at Xencor or that rely on Xencor's proprietary XmAb® technology. Seven such programs are currently undergoing clinical testing.  In September, MorphoSys announced that it began dosing in the safety evaluation portion of a Phase 2/3 combination trial of XmAb®5574/MOR208 with bendamustine in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (B-MIND trial). Following the Phase 2 safety evaluation, the study is expected to transition into a pivotal Phase 3 part in 2017.  Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2016 Financial Results Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $301.9 million as of September 30, 2016, compared to $193.3 million on December 31, 2015. The increase reflects the $150 million upfront payment received from Novartis in July 2016, net of spending for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 were $7.8 million compared to $3.5 million for the same period of 2015. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $81.1 million, compared to $6.0 million for the same period in 2015. Revenues in the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 were earned primarily from the Company's Novartis and Amgen collaborations, compared to revenues for the same period in 2015, which were earned primarily from the Company's Novo Nordisk, Alexion and CSL collaborations. Research and development expenditures for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 were $14.1 million, compared to $10.6 million for the same period in 2015. Total research and development expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 were $38.5 million, compared to $23.3 million for the same period in 2015. The increased spending on research and development for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to additional spending on Xencor's XmAb5871 clinical programs and bispecific technologies, including its initial bispecific oncology clinical candidates, XmAb14045 and XmAb13676. General and administrative expenses in the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 were $3.0 million compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2015. Total general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of 2016 were $10.0 million, compared to $8.5 million in the first nine months of 2015. Decreased spending on the general and administration areas for the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period in 2015 is due to lower stock-based compensation charges in the quarter, while the increased spending for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period in 2015 reflects additional legal and accounting fees for compliance related activities and additional stock-based compensation charges. Non-cash, share-based compensation expense for the first nine months of 2016 was $5.9 million compared to $3.4 million for the first nine months of 2015. Net loss for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $8.1 million, or $(0.20) on a fully diluted per share basis, compared to a net loss of $10.0 million, or $(0.25) on a fully diluted per share basis, for the same period in 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net income was $32.7 million or $0.78 on a fully diluted per share basis, compared to net loss of $25.3 million, or $(0.66) on a fully diluted per share basis, for the same period in 2015. The lower loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the loss reported for the same period in 2015 is primarily due to revenue earned from the Company's Amgen collaboration, while the income earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period in 2015 is primarily due to revenue earned from the Company's Novartis collaboration. The total shares outstanding was 41,138,851 as of September 30, 2016, compared to 40,477,003 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2015. Financial Guidance Based on current operating plans, Xencor expects to have cash to fund research and development programs and operations beyond the end of 2019.

Our healthcare contributors believe that these three companies are compelling investments. Brian Feroldi (TMFTypeoh) Nov 2, 2016 at 3:42PM Image source: Getty Images. Like Rodney Dangerfield, the biotech sector isn't getting a lot of respect these days. The iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF (NASDAQ:IBB), a popular exchange-traded fund that owns a wide range of biotech stocks, is down 24% year to date, which badly trails the S&P 500's slightly positive return. This downturn suggests that it is a great time to go bargain-hunting in the sector, so we asked a team of Motley Fool healthcare contributors to each highlight a biotech stock that they believe is a great buy right now. Read on to see why they choose Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), Xencor (NASDAQ:XNCR), and bluebird bio (NASDAQ:BLUE). This large-cap biotech has two speculative catalysts that could drive shares higher soon George Budwell: Buying biotech stocks with the explicit goal of turning a quick profit on a catalyst-driven event can be a good way to lose a lot of money fast. Biotech catalysts, after all, frequently don't play out in investors' favor. The large-cap biotech Biogen, though, is somewhat unique in this regard because its two speculative catalysts essentially have little to no downside for the company. Biogen's first possible catalyst is a buyout offer. Although the company has repeatedly been the target of buyout rumors in the past, the forthcoming retirement of long-standing CEO George Scangos  -- combined with big pharma's seemingly insatiable appetite for mergers and acquisitions of late -- may finally pave the way for a deal. If so, a buyout could come before year's end, presumably around the time Scangos is expected to formally step down. The next possible catalyst is the upcoming top-line data readout for Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) Alzheimer's disease drug candidate solanezumab. According to Lilly's third-quarter results, the data-collection phase of solanezumab's late-stage trial for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease has officially wrapped up, setting the stage for pivotal data release by December at the latest. Solanezumab works in a similar manner to Biogen's rival drug candidate aducanumab, so a success for Lilly would do wonders to validate this as-yet-unproven drug class. Why do these catalysts come with little to no risk? The big-picture issue is that Biogen is a solid, revenue-generating biotech with modest near-term growth prospects, a fairly clean balance sheet, and a rather pedestrian valuation within its peer group. In short, the market doesn't appear to be counting on either of these catalysts to maintain the biotech's valuation at current levels. So, in the worst-case scenario -- that is, if neither of these catalysts comes to fruition -- investors would end up owning a piece of a top biotech company that sports a growing footprint in the high-value multiple sclerosis drug market, along with some intriguing clinical-stage assets.  Big pharma is betting big on this company's platform Brian Feroldi: My risk-averse investing style keeps me far away from most clinical-stage biotech stocks, but I must admit that I find Xencor's story to be quite compelling.  What sets Xencor apart from other biotech stocks is its XmAb antibody engineering platform. This technology allows the company to create finely tuned antibody drug candidates that promise better potency and stability than currently available drugs. That's an attractive combination.  While I'm generally wary of clinical-stage biotechs that promise "game-changing" technology, what impresses me about Xencor is that it has already convinced some of the largest healthcare companies in the world to sign on as partners. Novartis recently signed a deal with Xencor that netted it $150 million up front and billions in potential milestone payments. Other collaboration partners include Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Amgen, Novo Nordisk, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, and more.  Image source: Getty Images. That's an impressive list of partners, and by 2018 Xencor believes that it will have 13 company-owned or partnered antibodies in the clinic. That gives investors multiple shots on goal, so this isn't just a one-drug story.  Before you get too excited, you should know that Xencor's most advanced product candidate is still just in phase 2. That means that the risks are still substantial and that it will be years before any products could hit the market. Still, I think that Xencor's broad pipeline and high-quality list of partners give it a leg up over most other clinical-stage biotechs. If you have a high tolerance for risk and are looking for a company that offers lots of long-term upside, then I think this stock could be worth nibbling on today. Like a phoenix from the ASHes? Cory Renauer: Late last year, clinical-stage biotech bluebird bio's stock took a beating after the company presented less-than-perfect results from its lead program, LentiGlobin for treatment of beta thalassemia, which is a form of inherited anemia, presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting last December. People with the condition require frequent blood transfusions, and ahead of the meeting it seemed as if a single treatment with LentiGlobin would totally end this necessity. Unfortunately, it was reported at ASH that a few patients with the most severe form of beta thalassemia still required transfusions. Since then, bluebird bio has tweaked its process in a manner that should increase the amount of functional hemoglobin produced by LentiGlobin treatment. It has also started a late-stage study designed to support an application for treatment of less severe beta thalassemia patients with the new-and-improved version. This year at ASH it will present more data from patients treated with the old LentiGlobin process. Last year seven of seven patients with less severe beta thalassemia had remained transfusion-free for over seven months. If these same patients remained transfusion-free for another year, it would bolster confidence for the ongoing late-stage trial with the improved version of LentiGlobin in this population.  Beta-thalassemia results aren't the only numbers investors will be looking out for in the weeks ahead. LentiGlobin has also shown potential in sickle-cell anemia, a disease that represents a tremendous burden on healthcare systems around the globe. In the U.S. alone, the genetic disorder shortens the lives of roughly 100,000 people, and annual spending on transfusions and other treatments can top $200,000 per patient. At ASH last year, bluebird bio shared positive, but limited, results with LentiGlobin in sickle-cell disease. Positive beta-thalassemia data alone would make bluebird bio's recent market cap of around $1.76 billion seem awfully small. If the company's presentations also lead to further encouragement in sickle-cell disease, it could send the stock soaring. Brian Feroldi owns shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals.

Nupur Jha   November 2, 2016 13:48 IST 3 Shares 3 Shares Reports by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and Lancet studies revealed that breast cancer cases are likely to double by 2030 in developing nations.TipsTimes/Flickr Deaths caused by breast cancer are likely to rise to around 5.5 million per year by 2030, which is almost equal to Denmark's population. This highlights an increase of 60 percent in less than two decades, says a study conducted by the American Cancer Society (ACS). As the global population grows and ages, the highest toll will be among women in poor and middle-income countries. Why advertise with us? Related Improper sleep in women leads to breast cancer PETA declares beer is healthier than milk "Most of the deaths occur in young and middle-aged adults, placing a heavy burden on families and national economies," says Sally Cowal, senior vice-president of global health at the ACS, which compiled the report with pharmaceutical company Merck. The number of cervical cancer cases is also likely to rise by at least 25 percent. It has the potential to reach above 700,000 by 2030 mostly in low and middle-income countries, another study by Lancet stated. According to ACS, one out of seven women dies of cancer, which is the second major cause of death after heart ailments. The four most fatal types of cancers -- breast, cervical, colorectal and lung -- are detectable at its early stage and are treatable. Lesser number of cancer cases are detected and treated in poor nations compared to the rich ones which lead to more number of deaths. The women of these countries are prone to known cancer threats such as unhealthy diet, obesity, physical inactivity and reproductive factors like postponing pregnancy, which are linked to the rapid economic transition, the Guardian reported. "Due to these changes, cancers that were once common only in high-income countries are becoming more prevalent," stated the report titled The Global Burden of Cancer in Women.

Login Register Public Release: 3-Nov-2016 Insulin resistance reversed by removal of protein University of California - San Diego Share  Print  E-Mail IMAGE: Jerrold Olefsky, M.D., is a professor of medicine in the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at UC San Diego School of Medicine. view more Credit: UC San Diego Health By removing the protein galectin-3 (Gal3), a team of investigators led by University of California School of Medicine researchers were able to reverse diabetic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in mouse models of obesity and diabetes. By binding to insulin receptors on cells, Gal3 prevents insulin from attaching to the receptors resulting in cellular insulin resistance. The team led by Jerrold Olefsky, MD, professor of medicine in the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at UC San Diego School of Medicine, showed that by genetically removing Gal3 or using pharmaceutical inhibitors to target it, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance could be returned to normal, even among older mice. However, obesity remained unchanged. "This study puts Gal3 on the map for insulin resistance and diabetes in mouse model," said Olefsky, associate dean for scientific affairs and senior author of the study. "Our findings suggest that Gal3 inhibition in people could be an effective anti-diabetic approach." Olefsky and other researchers have been studying how chronic tissue inflammation leads to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. In the paper, published in the journal Cell on November 3, researchers explain that inflammation requires macrophages -- specialized cells that destroy targeted cells. In obese adipose tissue (fat), for example, 40 percent of cells are macrophages. Macrophages in turn secrete Gal3, which then acts as a signaling protein attracting more macrophages, thus resulting in the production of even more Gal3. Furthermore, investigators identified bone marrow-derived macrophages as the source of Gal3 that leads to insulin resistance. More importantly, researchers found that Gal3 is secreted by macrophages, and can then cause insulin resistance in liver, fat cells, and muscle cells independent of inflammation. Gal3 has previously been connected to other diseases. Olefsky will continue to study Gal3 depletion as a possible therapeutic target for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis as well as heart and liver fibrosis. ### Study co-authors include: Pingping Li, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College and UC San Diego; Shuainan Liu, Zhufang Shen, Bing Cui, Lijuan Kong, Shaocong Hou, Xiao Liang, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College; Min Lu, UC San Diego, and Merck Research Laboratories; Gautum Bandyyopadhyay, Dayoung Oh, Andrew M.
