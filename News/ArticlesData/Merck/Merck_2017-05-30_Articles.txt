To view the Multimedia News Release, please click: https://www.multivu.com/players/uk/8107251-merck-iaco-sclerosis-care-giver-survey/ The survey is being launched in response to preliminary findings from research commissioned by Merck which indicate that while 18-34 year-olds make up the largest group of MS care partners, the impact of caregiving during the prime of their lives and the challenges faced by this group are poorly understood. The global survey aims to provide a deep understanding of these unmet needs as a first step towards developing better resources and solutions for MS care partners in the future. "We know that for many, providing care and support for someone with MS can be an overwhelming prospect - and this is particularly true for young people in the prime of their lives, building careers or families for example," said Rick Greene, Executive Advisor, International Alliance of Carer Organizations (IACO). "The findings from the Merck data highlight the stark reality that faces many care partners in MS - anxiety, depression and pain being just a few. Therefore, in collaboration with Merck, we are announcing a large-scale survey that will help us to build a comprehensive picture of the problems facing MS care partners and, importantly, look to develop solutions to address these needs." Preliminary findings from Merck-commissioned research showed the following: "There are more than 2.3 million people with multiple sclerosis (MS) worldwide. MS affects their quality of life and that of carers, family and friends" said Peer Baneke, CEO of the MS International Federation. "This year's World MS Day campaign encourages anyone affected by MS to share their tips for managing the challenges of #LifeWithMS." The global care partner survey, which is being launched on World MS Day and will be fielded in the following months, will uncover insights from care partners from Europe, the US and Canada. Results from the survey will be announced in the next 12 months along with recommendations on how support can be shaped to address the needs of MS care partners, including younger care partners. "Merck is committed to improving understanding of the needs of MS patients and care partners to help inform our programs and initiatives," said Ali-Frédéric Ben-Amor, Vice President Global Medical Affairs, in the Neurology & Immunology business of Merck.

About Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, chronic and inflammatory condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS) and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, and around 85% of people with MS are diagnosed with this type.[i] The exact cause of MS is unknown but it is thought that the body's immune system attacks myelin, disrupting the information flow along the nerves. There is currently no cure for MS, but treatments are available to help slow the course of the disease. About World MS Day 2017 World MS Day is officially marked on the last Wednesday of May.

Through a multi-year collaboration on a shared “Learning Laboratory,” the companies will explore value-based and pay-for-performance models, known as Outcomes-Based Risk Sharing Agreements (OBRSAs), and their potential for broad adoption among health insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and pharmaceutical companies. The initiative will involve the use of real world data to co-develop and test advanced predictive models and co-design OBRSAs to reduce clinical and financial uncertainty with respect to payment for prescription drugs. Under OBRSAs, health plans and other payers reimburse drug manufacturers on the basis of clinical outcomes achieved. Prices can fall or rise if the results succeed or fail to meet expectations outlined in the agreement. Increasingly, OBRSAs have become part of the conversation across the health care system due to the desire by health plans, care providers, PBMs, and pharmaceutical companies to base reimbursements on evidence-based outcomes. Because the measuring and monitoring of clinical outcomes is crucial to the viability and applicability of these models, Optum’s integrated claims and clinical records will be used to provide data reflective of real world patient care and outcomes in the United States. These data assets will enable the companies to assess OBRSA models across different patient populations, clinical settings, and therapeutic areas aligned with Merck’s product portfolio. “Ensuring that health care dollars are spent on interventions that improve patient care and health outcomes is a shared goal for all stakeholders,” said Curt Medeiros, president of Optum Life Sciences. “This collaboration offers an opportunity to leverage our collective strengths to increase knowledge about the design and implementation of outcomes-based contracts in the U.S. health system.” Optum and Merck plan to publicly share analytic insights, findings and recommendations to help inform and facilitate the understanding and use of pragmatic approaches to OBRSAs in the health care system. “Our collaboration will create a unique data-driven platform to enable modeling and analysis of innovative contracts that are needed to move to a value-based health care model,” said Susan Shiff, senior vice president, Center for Observational and Real-world Evidence, Merck. “The collaboration between Merck and Optum will help advance both organizations’ common goals of improving patient health outcomes, expanding access to innovative therapies, and ensuring the best use of health care spending.” Optum provides expertise in pharmaceutical contracting, health economic and outcomes research, actuarial analytics, and health policy and regulation, as well as access to data required for exploration of these new models. Merck provides data science and outcomes research expertise, a deep understanding of the pharmaceuticals marketplace, and years of experience working with large private and public customers to create flexible pricing models across multiple therapy areas.

To view the Multimedia News Release, please click: https://www.multivu.com/players/uk/8107251-merck-iaco-sclerosis-care-giver-survey/ The survey is being launched in response to preliminary findings from research commissioned by Merck which indicate that while 18-34 year-olds make up the largest group of MS care partners, the impact of caregiving during the prime of their lives and the challenges faced by this group are poorly understood. The global survey aims to provide a deep understanding of these unmet needs as a first step towards developing better resources and solutions for MS care partners in the future. "We know that for many, providing care and support for someone with MS can be an overwhelming prospect - and this is particularly true for young people in the prime of their lives, building careers or families for example," said Rick Greene, Executive Advisor, International Alliance of Carer Organizations (IACO). "The findings from the Merck data highlight the stark reality that faces many care partners in MS - anxiety, depression and pain being just a few. Therefore, in collaboration with Merck, we are announcing a large-scale survey that will help us to build a comprehensive picture of the problems facing MS care partners and, importantly, look to develop solutions to address these needs." Preliminary findings from Merck-commissioned research showed the following: Highest number of care partners were aged 18-34 (41% of males and 39% of females in this group) - The US had a higher percentage of care partners aged 18-34 (46% for male and 45% for female care partners vs. 35% male and 33% female care-partners within Europe) Family members caring for a mother with MS generated the majority of social media conversations related to MS caregiving, reflecting the prevalence of younger care partners in MS Problems identified among care partners included anxiety, depression, insomnia and pain, along with concerns about the financial impact of MS for families. "There are more than 2.3 million people with multiple sclerosis (MS) worldwide. MS affects their quality of life and that of carers, family and friends" said Peer Baneke, CEO of the MS International Federation. "This year's World MS Day campaign encourages anyone affected by MS to share their tips for managing the challenges of #LifeWithMS." The global care partner survey, which is being launched on World MS Day and will be fielded in the following months, will uncover insights from care partners from Europe, the US and Canada. Results from the survey will be announced in the next 12 months along with recommendations on how support can be shaped to address the needs of MS care partners, including younger care partners. "Merck is committed to improving understanding of the needs of MS patients and care partners to help inform our programs and initiatives," said Ali-Frédéric Ben-Amor, Vice President Global Medical Affairs, in the Neurology & Immunology business of Merck. "The global survey will help us identify new ways to support those affected by MS, including the families and friends of those with this overwhelming condition."

About Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, chronic and inflammatory condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS) and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, and around 85% of people with MS are diagnosed with this type.[i] The exact cause of MS is unknown but it is thought that the body's immune system attacks myelin, disrupting the information flow along the nerves.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Inthera Bioscience Raises CHF 10.5 Million in Series A Financing Round Zurich, Switzerland, May 31, 2017 / B3C newswire / — Inthera Bioscience, a Swiss biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class targeted small molecule therapies for solid tumors, today announced the closing of a Series A financing of CHF 10.5 million (EUR 9.6 million). The financing round was led by Merck Ventures, with equal contribution from Aglaia BioMedical Ventures and Novo Seeds and the participation of a private investor. In conjunction with the financing round, Emmanuelle Coutanceau of Novo Seeds and Keno Gutierrez of Merck Ventures have joined the company’s Board of Directors. Earlier this year, the Board of Directors had already been strengthened with two experienced biotech executives, Klaus Schollmeier, who has assumed the Chairman role, and Anker Lundemose, joining as independent member. Inthera Bioscience employs a proprietary technology platform to rationally design small molecule inhibitors of intracellular protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The company’s drug discovery programs are focused on the development of novel first-in-class oral agents blocking aberrant cell signaling in solid tumors, which are currently in pre-clinical development. Since its incorporation in 2013, Inthera’s drug discovery projects have made rapid progress under the leadership of the founders Ulrich Kessler and Paramjit Arora.      Jasper Bos, Vice President at Merck Ventures and former Chairman of Inthera’s Board of Directors, commented: “Having been able to play an active role in this venture and to support the translation of outstanding science into highly innovative therapeutics, has been deeply satisfying. Inthera’s technology has the potential to radically change our perspective on the druggability of intracellular PPIs.” “I first met Ulrich in 2015 and have been following Inthera ever since”, said Klaus Schollmeier, Chairman of the Board of Directors. “It is fascinating to watch his entrepreneurial spirit driving everyone involved. The continuous progress in Inthera’s lead program is very impressive and a reward for the hard effort and dedication of the whole team. It is a great pleasure to join this exciting endeavor and work with such a strong investor syndicate.” “We are now in a position to complete the pre-clinical development of our lead program against HPV-associated cancers and expand our operations and pipeline”, said Ulrich Kessler, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Inthera. “I am very glad about the strong commitment from our investors and look forward to unfolding Inthera’s innovative potential in oncology supported by our experienced new board members.”    About Inthera Bioscience AG Inthera Bioscience is a private biopharmaceutical company focused on developing inhibitors of intracellular protein-protein interactions employing a proprietary technology platform. Rationally designed, these orally bioavailable molecules display hot spot residues on a non-peptidic backbone merging the versatility of small molecules with the specificity of biologics. The broad applicability of the approach has been illustrated against several targets in oncology. Inthera’s lead programs focus on HPV-associated cancers and hypoxia-inducible signaling.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck Receives FDA Approval of ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir), a New Once-Daily Option, in Combination with Other Antiretroviral Agents, for the Treatment of HIV-1 Infection in Appropriate Patients KENILWORTH, N.J.–( )–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ISENTRESS® HD, a new 1200 mg once-daily dose of the company’s integrase inhibitor, ISENTRESS® (raltegravir), to be administered orally as two 600 mg film-coated tablets with or without food, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults, and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg, who are treatment-naïve or whose virus has been suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg given twice daily. “ISENTRESS has been used as a component of treatment regimens for patients diagnosed with HIV-1 for almost a decade,” said Dr. Michael S. Saag, associate dean for global health, and director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. “The addition of a convenient once-daily version with a comparable efficacy and safety profile at 48 weeks to the existing twice-daily version of ISENTRESS provides physicians with a new therapeutic option for some patients with HIV-1 infection.” ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD do not cure HIV-1 infection or AIDS. Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develop and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely. For more information, see “Selected Safety Information” below. The FDA approval of once-daily ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) is supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 ONCEMRK trial. At Week 48, 89 percent (N=531) of treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once a day achieved viral suppression of HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL compared to 88 percent (N=266) of patients receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice a day, each in combination therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with a treatment difference of 0.5 percent, and a 95 percent confidence interval of -4.2, 5.2. This was consistent across demographic groups at initiation of therapy and a variety of patient populations, including those with high viral load (HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL). “Because of improvements in the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies and with appropriate access to care, HIV infection can now be managed as a chronic disease,” said Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute. “For people living with HIV, having a wide range of effective therapies is important because it provides options to fit patients’ individual needs and lifestyles.” In ONCEMRK, through 48 weeks, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was low (1 percent in patients receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily and 2 percent in patients receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily). There were no drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥2 percent of patients in either treatment group. Clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate, and severe) occurring in ≥2 percent of patients on ISENTRESS HD or ISENTRESS included abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Treatment-emergent viral mutations leading to any drug resistance were detected in less than 1 percent (4/531) of those treated with ISENTRESS HD once daily. ISENTRESS HD can be co-administered with a wide range of antiretroviral agents and non-antiretroviral agents. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. The co-administration of ISENTRESS HD with aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids, calcium carbonate antacids, rifampin, tipranavir/ritonavir, etravirine, and other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is not recommended. “ISENTRESS HD exemplifies Merck’s unwavering commitment to innovation in HIV therapy, and we are pleased to be able to offer this option to a broad range of appropriate adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg who are living with HIV,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, global clinical development, infectious diseases and vaccines, Merck Research Laboratories. The price of ISENTRESS HD will be the same as ISENTRESS twice daily. Merck anticipates ISENTRESS HD to be available in pharmacies in approximately four weeks. About ONCEMRK The ONCEMRK study is an ongoing Phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active comparator-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg, given as two 600 mg oral tablets, compared to twice-daily ISENTRESS 400 mg, each in combination therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in previously untreated adults with HIV-1 infection with HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL. The primary efficacy objective was the proportion of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 48. Selected Safety Information about ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) and ISENTRESS (raltegravir) Immune reconstitution syndrome can occur, including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. ISENTRESS chewable tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame, which may be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria. Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with drugs that induce uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir. Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other drugs may alter the plasma concentration of raltegravir. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. Co-administration or staggered administration of aluminum and/or magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids and ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD is not recommended. Co-administration of ISENTRESS HD with calcium carbonate antacids, tipranavir/ritonavir, or etravirine is also not recommended. During co-administration with rifampin, the recommended dosage of ISENTRESS in adults is 800 mg twice daily. Rifampin, a strong inducer of UGT1A1, reduces plasma concentrations of ISENTRESS. There are no data to guide co-administration of ISENTRESS with rifampin in patients below 18 years of age. Co-administration with rifampin is not recommended with ISENTRESS HD. The impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes on raltegravir is unknown (e.g., Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, and Phenytoin). Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with other strong inducers is not recommended. About ISENTRESS (raltegravir) Approved in 2007, ISENTRESS was the first integrase inhibitor developed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. ISENTRESS is one of the regimen options recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services – in combination with other antiretroviral agents – as a first-line therapy in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults. ISENTRESS chewable tablets and oral suspension, each in combination therapy, are approved to treat pediatric patients aged at least four weeks of age, and weighing less than 20 kg. ISENTRESS works by inhibiting the insertion of HIV-1 DNA into human DNA by the integrase enzyme and has demonstrated rapid antiviral activity. Inhibiting integrase from performing this essential function limits the ability of the virus to replicate and infect new cells. ISENTRESS is approved as part of combination therapy in 112 countries for treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients. ISENTRESS, in combination therapy, for use in children and adolescents with HIV-1 aged two years and older has also been approved for use in 69 countries, and ISENTRESS oral suspension for infants at least four weeks of age is approved for use in 33 countries. Selected Safety Information about ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) and ISENTRESS (raltegravir) Continued The most commonly reported (≥2 percent) drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity in treatment-naïve adult patients receiving ISENTRESS compared with efavirenz were headache (4 percent vs. 5 percent), insomnia (4 percent vs. 4 percent), nausea (3 percent vs. 4 percent), dizziness (2 percent vs. 6 percent), and fatigue (2 percent vs. 3 percent), respectively. The most commonly reported (≥2 percent) clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (Mild, Moderate, and Severe) in treatment-naïve adult patients receiving ISENTRESS HD compared with ISENTRESS through 48 weeks included abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Intensities were defined as follows: Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated); Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); or Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity). Grade 2–4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with ISENTRESS. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, or increased serum creatine kinase. There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263. Women infected with HIV-1 should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD due to the potential for HIV transmission.

ECHO Flight transports aid workers and medical supplies to Ebola outbreak in DRC, May 2017. European Commission/Flickr. Some rights reserved.Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the African subcontinent, Ebola strikes back. The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed that a new outbreak of the disease had occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on May 12th. On May 21st, it revealed that a fourth person – one of the 43 believed to have been affected and the 400 now being tracked as potential patients – was believed to have died as a result of the virus. However, unlike the chaos that surrounded the first Ebola outbreak, the authorities seem largely in control.  Despite the significant logistical challenge of getting the right medical help deep into the jungles of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Matshidiso Rebecca Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa says that she is “optimistic” that the outbreak can be halted quickly. She also notes that WHO Africa has learned lessons from the last outbreak to become a “more responsive, accountable, effective and transparent organization”.    And of course, this time, doctors are coming armed with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine candidate, developed by pharmaceutical giant Merck. The drug is slated to be 100% effective against one of the five strands of the virus and has demonstrated “compelling results” in previous trials, but it has not been licensed yet. Undeterred by this minor detail, the WHO has 300,000 doses on hand and Moeti has indicated that the WHO “could potentially mount a campaign within a week if all of the conditions are met and personnel, financing and logistics are in place.” And on May 23rd, the DRC submitted a formal vaccine trial protocol to an ethical review board, the first step towards deploying the vaccine.  A damp squib in the fight against Ebola? Recent reports have cast a long shadow over Merck’s vaccine. Indeed, the US National Academy of Medicine has challenged the methodology of the 4160-patient clinical trial and made the lukewarm statement that while the vaccine “most likely provides some protection to recipients,” the protection “could in reality be quite low”. Not only is the vaccine ineffective against four strands of the Ebola virus, but also it might be altogether useless on people with compromised immune systems (HIV positive) or pregnant women.  Beyond raising questions about the way treatments are developed for infectious diseases with public and private funds, rVSV-ZEBOV’s fate seems to parallel another boom-bust: the experimental drug ZMapp. Despite being one of the most sought-after drugs at the height of the Ebola crisis and seen by many as having already been responsible for saving lives, ZMapp has narrowly missed the statistical threshold that researchers have set to prove the drug’s effectiveness. For this reason, the authors of a study conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases concede that ZMapp has probably lost its chance to prove its worth as an Ebola treatment. Therefore, future clinical trials would be better off focusing on “one of a small number of other promising, but unproven, treatments that have emerged since the beginning of the recent crisis.”  Luckily, the Merck vaccine is just one of several candidates now in different phases of development. Among the most promising is GSK’s cAd3-ZEBOV vaccine, with the company touting “very encouraging” findings after the first tests, albeit with the caveat that it will only be available in the second half of 2018. And earlier in May, scientists at New York’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine have also indicated that they have identified two antibodies  – ADI-15878 and ADI-15742  – that they believe will be able to thwart the five known Ebola viruses.  Johnson and Johnson is developing a 2-dose vaccination approach, while China has also thrown down the gauntlet and is working on the Ad5-EBOV vaccine, based on work done by a Chinese military research unit. Another promising candidate comes from an unlikely source – Guinea. Russian scientists working in a medical research centre built by the aluminium company UC Rusal in the country have devised a vaccine, the Gam-Evak-Kombi, which claims to be 100% effective. After the recent Ebola outbreak in the DRC, Moscow started shipping the drug to Guinea in case the DRC outbreak expands. States to the rescue With so many vaccines in the works, one would be forgiven for thinking that the lessons of 2014, when Ebola claimed 11,000 lives, were learned. In actuality, up until 2014, treating such diseases had usually been the remit of national governments  - like the US, Canada, the UK, China or Russia - as the scale of previous outbreaks of infectious diseases was never sufficient to justify billions being invested by profit-driven private pharmaceutical companies.  And Ebola isn’t going to be the health challenge that leads them to change their ways. Writing in The Independent, Oxford University’s Professor Adrian Hill observes that there was never a real business case for the Ebola vaccine “because of the nature of the outbreak…because of the number of people likely to be affected was, until now, thought to be very small and [because] the people affected are in some of the poorest countries in the world and can't afford to pay for a new vaccine."  In short, thousands died due to a “market failure”, as the WHO’s outgoing Director Margaret Chan, once said. This is borne out by the fact that the work to create a vaccine actually started 10 years ago. But the research stalled at the Phase One clinical trial juncture due to a lack of funding. Only when the recent outbreak started did interest in the vaccine resurface.  Western governments need to realise that to completely rely on the for-profit pharmaceutical sector to drive the process to develop vaccines is to accept that only drugs that have a lucrative market will ever be developed. As the Ebola crisis proved, this is disastrous for public health. Governments need to change their approach and understand they need to invest significantly larger sums in prevention and vaccines. The pharma sector won’t change, so they will have to.

Merck’s commitment to infectious diseases For more than 80 years, Merck has contributed to the discovery and development of novel medicines and vaccines to combat infectious diseases. In addition to a combined portfolio of antibiotic and antifungal medicines, vaccines, and medicines for HIV and HCV, Merck has multiple programs that span discovery through late-stage development. Merck currently has nine compounds in Phase 2/Phase 3 clinical trials for the potential treatment or prevention of infectious diseases. About ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) ZERBAXA is an antibacterial combination product for intravenous infusion consisting of the cephalosporin antibacterial drug ceftolozane sulfate and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam sodium. ZERBAXA is approved in the United States and is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by the following Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ZERBAXA used in combination with metronidazole is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus salivarius. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZERBAXA and other antibacterial drugs, ZERBAXA should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Important Safety Information about ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) Patients with renal impairment: Decreased efficacy of ZERBAXA has been observed in patients with baseline CrCl of 30 to ≤50 mL/min. In a clinical trial, patients with cIAIs with CrCl >50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 85.2% when treated with ZERBAXA plus metronidazole vs. 87.9% when treated with meropenem. In the same trial, patients with CrCl 30 to ≤50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 47.8% when treated with ZERBAXA plus metronidazole vs. 69.2% when treated with meropenem. A similar trend was also seen in the cUTI trial. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dose of ZERBAXA accordingly. Hypersensitivity: ZERBAXA is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to ceftolozane/tazobactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, or other members of the beta-lactam class. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials. Before initiating therapy with ZERBAXA, make careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. If an anaphylactic reaction to ZERBAXA occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD), ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. Development of drug-resistant bacteria: Prescribing ZERBAXA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients were headache (5.8%) in the cUTI trial, and nausea (7.9%), diarrhea (6.2%) and pyrexia (5.6%) in the cIAI trial.

Merck’s commitment to infectious diseases For more than 80 years, Merck has contributed to the discovery and development of novel medicines and vaccines to combat infectious diseases. In addition to a combined portfolio of antibiotic and antifungal medicines, vaccines, and medicines for HIV and HCV, Merck has multiple programs that span discovery through late-stage development. Merck currently has nine compounds in Phase 2/Phase 3 clinical trials for the potential treatment or prevention of infectious diseases. About ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) ZERBAXA is an antibacterial combination product for intravenous infusion consisting of the cephalosporin antibacterial drug ceftolozane sulfate and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam sodium. ZERBAXA is approved in the United States and is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by the following Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ZERBAXA used in combination with metronidazole is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus salivarius. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZERBAXA and other antibacterial drugs, ZERBAXA should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy.

Merck’s commitment to infectious diseases For more than 80 years, Merck has contributed to the discovery and development of novel medicines and vaccines to combat infectious diseases. In addition to a combined portfolio of antibiotic and antifungal medicines, vaccines, and medicines for HIV and HCV, Merck has multiple programs that span discovery through late-stage development. Merck currently has nine compounds in Phase 2/Phase 3 clinical trials for the potential treatment or prevention of infectious diseases. About ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) ZERBAXA is an antibacterial combination product for intravenous infusion consisting of the cephalosporin antibacterial drug ceftolozane sulfate and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam sodium. ZERBAXA is approved in the United States and is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by the following Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ZERBAXA used in combination with metronidazole is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus salivarius. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZERBAXA and other antibacterial drugs, ZERBAXA should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Important Safety Information about ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) Patients with renal impairment: Decreased efficacy of ZERBAXA has been observed in patients with baseline CrCl of 30 to ≤50 mL/min. In a clinical trial, patients with cIAIs with CrCl >50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 85.2% when treated with ZERBAXA plus metronidazole vs. 87.9% when treated with meropenem. In the same trial, patients with CrCl 30 to ≤50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 47.8% when treated with ZERBAXA plus metronidazole vs. 69.2% when treated with meropenem. A similar trend was also seen in the cUTI trial. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dose of ZERBAXA accordingly. Hypersensitivity: ZERBAXA is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to ceftolozane/tazobactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, or other members of the beta-lactam class. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials. Before initiating therapy with ZERBAXA, make careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. If an anaphylactic reaction to ZERBAXA occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD), ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. Development of drug-resistant bacteria: Prescribing ZERBAXA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients were headache (5.8%) in the cUTI trial, and nausea (7.9%), diarrhea (6.2%) and pyrexia (5.6%) in the cIAI trial. About Merck For more than a century, Merck, a leading global biopharmaceutical company known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, has been inventing for life, bringing forward medicines and vaccines for many of the world’s most challenging diseases. Through our prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products, we work with customers and operate in more than 140 countries to deliver innovative health solutions. We also demonstrate our commitment to increasing access to health care through far-reaching policies, programs and partnerships. Today, Merck continues to be at the forefront of research to advance the prevention and treatment of diseases that threaten people and communities around the world – including cancer, cardio-metabolic diseases, emerging animal diseases, Alzheimer’s disease and infectious diseases including HIV and Ebola.

These new jobs will be created at the company’s bases in Cork and Carlow in a €280m investment by MSD. While jobs have not been created in the animal health division itself, which is based in Dublin, the move will boost overall company operations and add to the individual site regions – in rural Co. Cork and on the outskirts of Carlow town respectively. Over 200 new employees will be hired in the MSD plant in Brinny, Co. Cork, which works on medicines for lung cancer, melanoma, hepatitis C and rheumatoid arthritis. Meanwhile, a further 120 recruits will be brought in at the company’s Carlow plant, which is a manufacturing site and, according to MSD, “the company’s first stand-alone vaccine and biologics facility outside the US”. The firm, with headquarters in the USA, will bring its total number of employees up to more than 1,900 with the move. This move is designed to meet the increased global demand for MSD’s medicines and vaccines produced in Ireland, according to the company. There will be various types of jobs created such as biochemistry, biology, engineering, technical, quality and operations roles. MSD has a current workforce over 1,600 people in Ireland with plants in Dublin, Cork, Carlow and Tipperary. Its Irish operations had a turnover of €4.7 billion in 2016. MSD creates common farm vaccines such as Bovilis BVD, Bovilis IBR Marker, Blackleg Vaccine and Bovivac S. It also produces a range of animal antibiotics and pour-ons. Sanat Chattopadhyay, MSD Executive Vice President and President of MSD’s Manufacturing Division, spoke at the announcement of the move, stating: “Today’s announcement is a reflection of MSD Ireland’s positive standing in our global network, a vote of confidence in our people and their work, and a sign of MSD’s future commitment to Ireland. The expansion of our presence in Ireland is a testament to the talent of our Irish employees. In recent years our Irish businesses have played an increasingly important role in the production of some of MSD’s most important breakthrough medicines for the global market. Minster for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Mary Mitchell O’Connor, welcomed the move and the locations chosen, noting: “It is particularly gratifying that this expansion and additional job creation will take place in two regional locations, thereby strengthening the government’s efforts to ensure balanced industrial development around the country.” Related Stories Zurich seeking candidates with farming experience for insurance apprenticeship Read More From Agri-Business Job creation Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation MSD MSD Animal Health Vaccines Connect With Us Hide Comments Please be considerate of others when commenting.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck Receives FDA Approval of ISENTRESS® HD (raltegravir), a New Once-Daily Option, in Combination with Other Antiretroviral Agents, for the Treatment of HIV-1 Infection in Appropriate Patients KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ISENTRESS® HD, a new 1200 mg once-daily dose of the company’s integrase inhibitor, ISENTRESS® (raltegravir), to be administered orally as two 600 mg film-coated tablets with or without food, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults, and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg, who are treatment-naïve or whose virus has been suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg given twice daily. “ISENTRESS has been used as a component of treatment regimens for patients diagnosed with HIV-1 for almost a decade,” said Dr. Michael S. Saag, associate dean for global health, and director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. “The addition of a convenient once-daily version with a comparable efficacy and safety profile at 48 weeks to the existing twice-daily version of ISENTRESS provides physicians with a new therapeutic option for some patients with HIV-1 infection.” ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD do not cure HIV-1 infection or AIDS. Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develop and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely. For more information, see “Selected Safety Information” below. The FDA approval of once-daily ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) is supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 ONCEMRK trial. At Week 48, 89 percent (N=531) of treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once a day achieved viral suppression of HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL compared to 88 percent (N=266) of patients receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice a day, each in combination therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with a treatment difference of 0.5 percent, and a 95 percent confidence interval of -4.2, 5.2. This was consistent across demographic groups at initiation of therapy and a variety of patient populations, including those with high viral load (HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL). “Because of improvements in the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies and with appropriate access to care, HIV infection can now be managed as a chronic disease,” said Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute. “For people living with HIV, having a wide range of effective therapies is important because it provides options to fit patients’ individual needs and lifestyles.” In ONCEMRK, through 48 weeks, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was low (1 percent in patients receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily and 2 percent in patients receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily). There were no drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥2 percent of patients in either treatment group. Clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate, and severe) occurring in ≥2 percent of patients on ISENTRESS HD or ISENTRESS included abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Treatment-emergent viral mutations leading to any drug resistance were detected in less than 1 percent (4/531) of those treated with ISENTRESS HD once daily. ISENTRESS HD can be co-administered with a wide range of antiretroviral agents and non-antiretroviral agents. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. The co-administration of ISENTRESS HD with aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids, calcium carbonate antacids, rifampin, tipranavir/ritonavir, etravirine, and other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is not recommended. “ISENTRESS HD exemplifies Merck’s unwavering commitment to innovation in HIV therapy, and we are pleased to be able to offer this option to a broad range of appropriate adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg who are living with HIV,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, global clinical development, infectious diseases and vaccines, Merck Research Laboratories. The price of ISENTRESS HD will be the same as ISENTRESS twice daily. Merck anticipates ISENTRESS HD to be available in pharmacies in approximately four weeks. About ONCEMRK The ONCEMRK study is an ongoing Phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active comparator-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg, given as two 600 mg oral tablets, compared to twice-daily ISENTRESS 400 mg, each in combination therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in previously untreated adults with HIV-1 infection with HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL. The primary efficacy objective was the proportion of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 48. Selected Safety Information about ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) and ISENTRESS (raltegravir) Immune reconstitution syndrome can occur, including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. ISENTRESS chewable tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame, which may be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria. Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with drugs that induce uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir. Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other drugs may alter the plasma concentration of raltegravir. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. Co-administration or staggered administration of aluminum and/or magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids and ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD is not recommended. Co-administration of ISENTRESS HD with calcium carbonate antacids, tipranavir/ritonavir, or etravirine is also not recommended. During co-administration with rifampin, the recommended dosage of ISENTRESS in adults is 800 mg twice daily. Rifampin, a strong inducer of UGT1A1, reduces plasma concentrations of ISENTRESS. There are no data to guide co-administration of ISENTRESS with rifampin in patients below 18 years of age. Co-administration with rifampin is not recommended with ISENTRESS HD. The impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes on raltegravir is unknown (e.g., Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, and Phenytoin). Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with other strong inducers is not recommended. About ISENTRESS (raltegravir) Approved in 2007, ISENTRESS was the first integrase inhibitor developed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. ISENTRESS is one of the regimen options recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services – in combination with other antiretroviral agents – as a first-line therapy in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults. ISENTRESS chewable tablets and oral suspension, each in combination therapy, are approved to treat pediatric patients aged at least four weeks of age, and weighing less than 20 kg. ISENTRESS works by inhibiting the insertion of HIV-1 DNA into human DNA by the integrase enzyme and has demonstrated rapid antiviral activity. Inhibiting integrase from performing this essential function limits the ability of the virus to replicate and infect new cells. ISENTRESS is approved as part of combination therapy in 112 countries for treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients. ISENTRESS, in combination therapy, for use in children and adolescents with HIV-1 aged two years and older has also been approved for use in 69 countries, and ISENTRESS oral suspension for infants at least four weeks of age is approved for use in 33 countries. Selected Safety Information about ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) and ISENTRESS (raltegravir) Continued The most commonly reported (≥2 percent) drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity in treatment-naïve adult patients receiving ISENTRESS compared with efavirenz were headache (4 percent vs. 5 percent), insomnia (4 percent vs. 4 percent), nausea (3 percent vs. 4 percent), dizziness (2 percent vs. 6 percent), and fatigue (2 percent vs. 3 percent), respectively. The most commonly reported (≥2 percent) clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (Mild, Moderate, and Severe) in treatment-naïve adult patients receiving ISENTRESS HD compared with ISENTRESS through 48 weeks included abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Intensities were defined as follows: Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated); Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); or Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity). Grade 2–4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with ISENTRESS. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, or increased serum creatine kinase. There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263. Women infected with HIV-1 should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD due to the potential for HIV transmission.

Image: Luke Maxwell How can you make your career matter? Spend it saving lives by Kirsty Tobin 5 days ago16 Shares For most people, it’s hard to know how to make a career worthwhile. In biopharma, it’s a little easier: you’re saving lives. This morning (30 May), pharma giant MSD announced 330 new jobs as part of a €280m investment in Ireland. That investment will see sites in Cork and Carlow expanding production facilities and capacity to meet global demand for medicines and vaccines. Speaking at the announcement, the executive VP of MSD, Sanat Chattopadhyay, said: “The expansion of our presence in Ireland is a testament to the talent of our Irish employees.” While specific roles were not announced, current openings at the sites include technical, engineering, biochemistry, biology, quality and operations positions. But why should someone want to pursue one of these roles? We’ve all been there. After a tough week in work, we ask ourselves: ‘Is it all worth it? Am I making any difference at all?’ For those working in biopharma, that question is a little less nebulous. Every day, they’re helping to save people. At a National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT) event in April of this year, we caught up with Gary Collins, director of operations for biologics at MSD, to talk about what makes biopharma a great sector to work in. “Personally, I’ve got to work on two life-saving drugs,” said Collins. Collins spoke about Keytruda, a cancer treatment drug that is manufactured at MSD’s Irish operations. “There was a huge buzz about getting the drug to the patients, supporting the early-access programme, and then seeing it launched … and knowing that what we do helps save people’s lives.” From another (arguably more cynical) point of view, a career in biopharma can also mean long-term job security and stability, as the sector goes from strength to strength in Ireland. “In recent years, our Irish businesses have played an increasingly important role in the production of some of MSD’s most important breakthrough medicines for the global market,” Chattopadhyay said of the announcement earlier today. This central role translates to continued growth in the Irish biopharma market, as hubs in Cork and Galway experience a heavy influx of FDI. This places MSD – and its talent – in great company, and the future is looking good.

One term that may well become more familiar is deception technology. It's a small but growing field that has sparked the interest of some of the largest multinational companies. Israeli startup illusive networks, which is the way they spell it - no capital letters for a deception technology firm, and Germany-based pharmaceutical and life sciences company Merck KGaA, Tuesday announced a deal for the use of illusive's "Deception Everywhere" cybersecurity technology. Merck, a company with over $15 billion in net sales last year, has an extensive network to protect that stretches across six continents and has intellectual property worth millions. A 2015 Ponemon Institute study found that together with the financial services industry, pharmaceutical companies suffer the highest cost from data breaches. Companies such as illusive don't come into play at the first, most basic level of defenses against cyber threats, explains Merck's Branden Newman, head of business technology security. "The idea is that if an advanced attacker makes it past these standardized controls, there is a next level of protection that really protects our crown jewels," says Newman, who used to work for the U.S. Army Cyber Command. This level is where illusive fits in, as well as on the level of the continuous monitoring the system undergoes. Illusive networks is the first company to come out of Israel's team8, the cybersecurity startup incubator set up by of veterans of the Israeli military's Unit 8200, says illusive's founder and CEO Ofer Israeli. He explains that the deception technology developed by illusive is really attractive to high-risk clients, like those in the financial services and pharmaceutical industries "The types of attacks that we are catching and that we have been built to mitigate are really those low probability high-impact attacks. The ones that won't hit you every day but when they do hit you it can go to tens and hundreds of millions of dollars," says Israeli. The value of the deal has not been disclosed but Merck's Newman says that the extra layer of protection afforded by illusive does not come at a huge price. "Monetarily it's a relatively a low investment compared to the overall the security portfolio." That's partly because deception technology is not yet as widespread as more standardized cybersecurity solutions. Gartner research estimates that by next year one in ten companies will deploy deception technology and various reports estimate the market for it by 2021 to be between $1.33 billion and $1.7 billion. There are several reasons why Merck went for illusive over two or three other candidates, says Newman. Among those are the Israeli technology's "proactive approach" and "ease of deployment" that obviates the need for a mass install across Merck's systems. He likens the technology to a corridor with lots of doors. If attackers enter the corridor, they don't know which door to go through and if they even lightly jar one, the system is alerted. Merck keeps a close tab on Israeli cybersecurity startups, says Newman. "We have a very close connection to the U.S. startup scene but we also do keep an eye on the Israeli startup scene, particularly in the cybersecurity area because they have a very strong cybersecurity startup scene." In the meantime, illusive has spread its wings beyond Israel, especially in terms of sales and marketing, says Ofer Israeli. "From an R&D perspective, Israel is a perfect fit. For sales and marketing there's a much clearer fit in other portions of the world such as the United States," says Israeli. The company has gathered more than $30 million from early investors, including Microsoft Ventures, Cisco, Citi Ventures and NEA.

The jobs will be created as part of a €280 million investment over the next three years. MSD – which trades as Merck in the US and Canada – is a pharmaceutical giant which develops new treatments and therapies for patients. The company said its two manufacturing sites in Cork and Carlow are important links in its global chain of plants.

The plant in Brinny, Co Cork is for the development, testing and manufacturing of biologics, specialising in the fermentation, purification and sterile filling of biotech products. The over 200 new staff will work on this site, developing medicines for lung cancer, melanoma, hepatitis C and rheumatoid arthritis. In Carlow, 120 jobs will be created in the state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. Jobs on offer will include technical, engineering, biochemistry, biology, quality and operations positions. Commenting on the investment, Jobs Minister Mary Mitchell O’Connor said that she “warmly welcomed” the announcement. “MSD has been at the cutting edge of bio pharmaceutical innovation over recent years and their Irish operations are at the heart of many of the company’s exciting new products,” she said. MSD currently employs over 1,600 people across four sites in Ireland – in Carlow, Cork, Dublin and Tipperary. It’s Irish operations had a turnover of €.7 billion in 2016.

The pharma giant – which trades as Merck in North America – unveiled its three-year plans for two of its Irish manufacturing sites this morning. The new jobs come as a result of increased global demand for MSD’s medicines and vaccines produced in Ireland, while the investment will see both sites expand production facilities and capacity to meet that demand.  Available roles at the sites include technical, engineering, biochemistry, biology, quality and operations positions. The announcement was welcomed by the Minster for Jobs, Enterprise & Innovation, Mary Mitchell O’Connor, who addressed over 1,200 senior MSD business leaders from 50 countries, gathered in Dublin for MSD’s annual EMEAC (Europe, Middle East, Africa & Canada) Congress. MSD in Brinny, Co Cork, is an integrated site for the development, testing and manufacturing of biologics, specialising in the fermentation, purification and sterile filling of biotech products. More than 200 new hires will be needed to meet demand for its work on some of the company's important treatments – medicines for lung cancer, melanoma, hepatitis C and rheumatoid arthritis.  MSD in Carlow, which is the company’s first standalone vaccine and biologics facility outside the US, plans to create 120 new roles. Minister Mitchell O'Connor said: "MSD has been at the cutting edge of bio pharmaceutical innovation over recent years and their Irish operations are at the heart of many of the company's exciting new products. "It is particularly gratifying that this expansion and additional job creation will take place in two regional locations, thereby strengthening the Government's efforts to ensure balanced industrial development around the country.” Sanat Chattopadhyay, MSD executive vice president andpresident of MSD’s manufacturing division, said: "The expansion of our presence in Ireland is a testament to the talent of our Irish employees. In recent years our Irish businesses have played an increasingly important role in the production of some of MSD’s most important breakthrough medicines for the global market.” Ger Brennan, managing director of MSD Human Health in Ireland, said: "Today, our Irish sites are involved in the production of over 50% of MSD’s global top 20 products, exporting to over 60 countries worldwide and helping lead the development of new life-changing medicines for patients, including MSD’s new treatments for cancer and hepatitis C.” MSD currently employs over 1,600 people across four sites in Ireland – in Carlow, Cork, Dublin and Tipperary. Its extensive Irish operations, encompassing manufacturing, commercial, global financial services and marketing facilities, had a turnover of €4.7 billion in 2016. The Carlow and Cork bases serve as important links in MSD’s global network of manufacturing plants. It maintains headquarters for the company and manufacturing division in the US. 7:33 30 May 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 5 days ago 4 Related articles Some chemotherapy treatments deferred over drug shortages Ireland moves up the pharma food-chain Eli Lilly pushing ahead with €200m Kinsale plans Pharmacists urge Government to allow them to provide more services most popular latest sport #PornWeek: The A to Z - by way of XXX - of pornography London mayor has "more important things to do" than respond to Trump tweets GALLERY: GAA Championship Round-Up 'I would consider it if Madrid made an offer:' Eden Hazard site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

The ASCO meeting, which starts Friday in Chicago, draws tens of thousands of specialists from around the world. This year it will feature more than 250 presentations involving immune-system-boosting drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, with the lion’s share of research focused on drugs that target a protein called PD-1, including Merck & Co Inc's Keytruda, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Opdivo and Roche Holding AG's Tecentriq. The drugs work by releasing molecular brakes, or checkpoints, that tumors use to avoid the body’s immune system. That allows the immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells the same way they fight infections caused by bacteria or viruses. For certain cancers, like melanoma, the treatments can mean long-term survival for around 20 percent of patients. Researchers and drugmakers are now focused on testing whether these new drugs can become more powerful, and treat more people, in combination. "We need to probably add to those regimens to have the best chance of eradicating all of the clones that lead to (drug) resistance," said Craig Tendler, head of late development and global medical affairs at Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division. "To get from 20-25 percent of patients up to 50 percent and beyond is going to require other approaches." In some cases, researchers are combining different types of checkpoint inhibitors. They are also testing the new treatments with older drugs like chemotherapy. "There are hundreds and hundreds of combination trials," said Brad Loncar, manager of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. "We are still waiting for a winner to emerge." The global market for cancer immunotherapies alone is expected to grow more than fourfold to $75.8 billion by 2022, according to research firm GlobalData. Other checkpoint inhibitor drugs that will be in focus at ASCO include those that target the CTLA4 protein, such as Bristol's Yervoy, and those that target IDO1. A small study released earlier this month showed that combining Merck's Keytruda with an experimental IDO1 drug from Incyte Corp led to a high rate of durable responses in patients with advanced lung cancer. Separately, U.S. regulators approved a combination of Keytruda and chemotherapy for previously untreated advanced lung cancer. "As far as which combinations we think will look better ... it is a little early," said Dr. Bruce Johnson, chief clinical research officer at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and ASCO's incoming president. New data is also expected on a different class of experimental drugs that recruit immune system cells, known as CAR-T therapies, from companies including Kite Pharma Inc, Juno Therapeutics Inc and Novartis AG. The ASCO meeting will feature key trial results on the best use of J&J's Zytiga for men newly diagnosed with high-risk, metastatic prostate cancer and of AstraZeneca Plc's ovarian cancer drug Lynparza in breast cancer. New data on treating genetically-defined cancers will be presented from a wide range of companies including Loxo Oncology Inc and Roche, which aims to insure use of its newer targeted breast cancer drug Perjeta before its older, multibillion-dollar drug, Herceptin, loses patent protection.

Wilson Sonsini tops Life Sciences Law Firm Index for 2nd straight year Biotech, Pharma In landmark move, FDA approves cancer drug for a biomarker not a tissue By Juliet Preston 1 Comment / May 23, 2017 at 8:39 PM Shares1.5k Colon, pancreatic, stomach, or ovarian cancer; it increasingly shouldn’t matter. In an era of precision medicine, the treatment approach should reflect the genetic makeup of the person’s tumor and the presence or absence of key biomarkers. That ethos was set in stone on Tuesday, with the landmark FDA approval of Merck’s checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), for patients with solid tumors that express so-called mismatched repair genes. In a statement, FDA noted the historic nature of its decision. “This is the first time the agency has approved a cancer treatment based on a common biomarker rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated.” It has been a long time in the making. Scientists’ understanding of cancer has shifted dramatically in the 21st Century, helped along by initiatives such as the human genome project and the advent of next-generation sequencing. One of the biggest revelations has been the degree of heterogeneity between cancers that arise from a single tissue: A breast cancer might be more akin to a melanoma than another breast cancer. As a result, it often makes sense to classify cancers based on their genetics, not their origin, when selecting oncology treatments. Following today’s approval, one the defining features of certain solid tumors will be whether they are microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). Both are abnormalities that affect the proper repair of DNA inside the cell (aka mismatch repair genes). According to FDA, colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers have the highest rates of these mutations. MSI-H and dMMR also appear, albeit less commonly, in cancers arising in the breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid gland and other places. Approximately 5 percent of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have MSI-H or dMMR tumors. Scientists at the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins Medicine were the first to hypothesize that tumors with these mismatch repair genes would be particularly susceptible to immunotherapies, such as Keytruda. The idea was advanced into clinical trials and ultimately given the green light via FDA’s accelerated approval route. “I think that this is a really positive development for a couple of reasons,” said Joydeep Goswami, president, clinical NGS and oncology at Thermo Fisher Scientific, in online correspondence. “First, it reinforces the idea of cancer treatment being stratified by the molecular signature of the tumor. Second, it clarifies that the molecular signature of a tumor is more significant than the organ of origin. Both these emphasize the molecular nature of cancer and confirm the need to tie therapy selection to the precise molecular signature in order to ensure the best patient outcomes.” Keytruda is already approved for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and urothelial carcinoma. Other checkpoint inhibitors, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, are hot on Merck’s heels chasing market share. Is medicine ready? It’s one thing to get an FDA approval, it’s another to implement this form of medicine nationwide. As many observers noted on Twitter, oncologists often specialize based on the tissue of origin. They’re colon cancer or breast cancer experts. Perhaps more importantly, the bulk of cancer patients in the U.S. still aren’t having their tumors sequenced. The next-generation sequencing diagnostics can cost thousands of dollars and insurers have argued that the clinical utility isn’t there. Medicare and Medicaid have taken the same stance. Today’s approval could help the industry move forward. Indeed, it has been noted that the lack of routine sequencing holds back recruitment for clinical trials, which in turn limits the approval of drugs that would validate the sequencing. Scott Tomlins, co-founder and laboratory director of Strata Oncology, stressed via email that there is much more work to be done to break this treatment stalemate. Strata deals with it firsthand through its work matching eligible patients with precision medicine trials. “Results like this confirm that we should be assessing the critical and targetable molecular alterations driving every individual’s cancer,” Tomlins said. “However, it is critical to recognize that with presently available drugs, only a small subset of patients with cancer are likely to benefit from this or most other targeted therapies. Thus, finding patients whose tumors have highly targetable alterations, and enrolling them onto the most appropriate clinical trials remain the critical barriers to accelerating approval of promising therapies and gaining widespread reimbursement for molecular profiling.” There’s also value in ruling out patients that are unlikely to respond to personalized therapies. Keytruda launched in the U.S. with a list price of $12,500 per patient per month, or $150,000 per year. Many trials are underway studying checkpoint inhibitors as part of combination therapies, which would see the cost climb further. The case is definitely building for genetic testing, as means to finding the right individuals and saving the expense and struggle of treating those who are unlikely to benefit.

MSD, the US pharmaceutical company, will create 330 roles and invest €280 million over three years in Cork and Carlow. It currently employs 1,600 people across Carlow, Dublin, Cork and Tipperary. The company, known as Merck in the US and Canada, said it was increasing its Irish workforce and committing additional resources to the country in order to meet a growing demand for medicines and vaccines produced in Ireland. Sanat Chattopadhyay, executive vice-president and president of MSD’s manufacturing division, said the announcement was a sign of its commitment to Ireland. “In recent years our Irish businesses have played an increasingly important role in the… Want to read more?

UCC economics lecturer Declan Jordan said the decision by Merck — which is known as MSD in Europe — to invest €280m in its manufacturing bases in Cork and Carlow was evidence that fear of Mr Trump’s protectionist rhetoric was overblown. Mr Jordan said the creation of 210 jobs in Cork and 120 in Carlow by MSD Ireland showed it was back to business as usual in Europe for multinationals who saw Ireland as a gateway to the continent.  MSD Ireland has 500 employed in Brinny and has been one of the area’s biggest employers for 35 years. Fellow pharma giant Eli Lilly recently confirmed it would be proceeding with a €200m expansion near Kinsale, having put it on hold in the direct aftermath of Mr Trump’s election to the White House — a sign fears had subsided, Mr Jordan said. However, he warned that Mr Macron could upset the apple cart for foreign direct investment in Ireland if he pursued the implementation of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), which aims to share out the spoils of European corporation tax.  The CCCTB proposal has faced fierce resistance in Ireland, with leaders insisting it could cost the country 50% of its current corporation tax base. Mr Jordan said: “We are not overly reliant on foreign direct investment but it is a very important part of our economy. We tend to go over the top when we hear rhetoric such as that from Mr Trump.  "However, he is just another factor we have to contend with and I am confident we can overcome that. I am more wary of Mr Macron. The CCCTB is a bigger risk than Mr Trump.” Mr Jordan said it was important the Government “did not rest on its laurels and become complacent” as the threat of Brexit loomed. There was more good news on the jobs front as outdoor clothing firm Regatta Great Outdoors announced 100 jobs in Dublin, Galway, and Waterford. The jobs will be filled in the next 12 months. In Sligo, global healthcare company Abbott will relocate its Irish nutritional devices business from its existing base to a new, purpose-built IDA Ireland advance technology building.  The move will see a combined investment of almost €10m and will join manufacturing and business support within one building. “The good and bad times go in natural cycles,” said Mr Jordan.  “It may be lots of job announcements and investments today, which is fantastic — but it was job losses in recent years. The important thing is to not get carried away by either and make sure we take our opportunities when they come, especially in relation to Brexit. I maintain there is lots of opportunity for Ireland in relation to Brexit.” Newly elected Cork Chamber president Bill O’Connell said the MSD announcement was evidence that Cork was still a destination par excellence for the pharma industry. “We have a unique business environment, exceptional quality of life and highly educated workforce, and we work hard to ensure that this is furthered and maintained,” he said.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Wednesday that it could not recommend routine use of the medicine in newly diagnosed patients, given the drug's high cost and uncertainties about overall survival benefits. But the agency backed Keytruda use within the Cancer Drugs Fund, signalling that it had the potential to satisfy the criteria for routine use on the National Health Service (NHS) for this group of patients but needs more investigation. The decision follows data presented at a medical meeting last year showing that Keytruda could help lung cancer patients whose tumours have a high level of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. Keytruda is already approved as a cost-effective second-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have previously taken chemotherapy but no longer respond. MSD, as Merck is known outside North America, has agreed to provide Keytruda to the NHS at an undisclosed discount.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Human Vaccines Market: Rise in Awareness Programs Sponsored by For-profit and Non-Profit Organizations a Significant Growth Booster The global human vaccines market is dominated by GlaxoSmithKline plc., Sanofi, Pfizer, Inc., and Merck & Co, Inc. These players collectively accounted for over 70% of the market in terms of revenue in 2015. Analysts at Transparency Market Research have identified some of the key strategies adopted by players in the human vaccines market in order to gain a competitive edge over the rest. These include mergers and acquisitions, collaborations and acquisitions for market penetration, the establishment of local production sites, the expansion of product portfolios, and expansion activities in regions with high growth potential. This 183 page report gives readers a comprehensive overview of the Human Vaccines Market. Browse through 30 data tables and 81 figures to unlock the hidden opportunities in this market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/human-vaccines-market…. A focus on research and development is also a successful growth strategy, TMR finds. For instance, Pfizer, Inc. has always focused on R&D in order to improve innovation and productivity. It is presently working on various pipeline products for different therapies and innovating new capabilities that can position it for long-term leadership across the globe. The global human vaccines market was valued at US$28.3 bn in 2015 and is estimated to reach US$72.5 bn by 2024, registering an 11.2% CAGR during the forecast period. Hospital Pharmacies and Drugstores Prominent Distribution Channels for Human Vaccines By age group, pediatric vaccines accounted for a 57.5% share in the global human vaccines market in 2015. Adult vaccines, on the other hand, are expected to expand at a 13.2% CAGR from 2016 to 2024. Based on product, the pneumococcal segment accounted for the majority share in in 2015, with the hepatitis segment exhibiting strong growth during the forecast period. On basis of vaccine type, the conjugate vaccines segment accounted for the majority share in the global human vaccines market in 2015. On the other hand, the combination vaccines segment is expected to expand at an outstanding CAGR from 2016 to 2024. By distribution channel, the hospital pharmacies segment led the global human vaccines market. However, the drugstores segment is projected to expand at a considerable pace through 2024. Geographically, North America dominates the global human vaccines market and is estimated to reach a value of US$28.0 bn by 2024. Asia Pacific is the most promising market for human vaccines and is expected to expand at a high CAGR of 12.5% during the forecast period. Minimal Side Effects of Vaccines Bolstering Large-scale Adoption An extremely low risk of serious and fatal side effects associated with vaccines is one of the primary factors driving the market for human vaccines around the world. Similar to other drugs, vaccines are associated with a few side effects; however, most of the times, these are rather mild. Soreness, swelling, redness at the site of injection, fever, rash, or itchiness are the most common side effects of vaccines. Several healthcare organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US FDA, the American Medical Association (AMA), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend the use of vaccines owing to their safety. Complementing this factor is the growing awareness among patients and the general population regarding the benefits of vaccination. This can be attributed to a rise in awareness programs by government, private, and not-for-profit organizations. “The celebration of the National Immunization Awareness Month in the month of August in the U.S., for instance, is a great way of spreading awareness and getting more people to opt for vaccination,” the author of the report states. Request a sample of this report to know what opportunities will emerge in the rapidly evolving Human Vaccines Market by 2024: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… High Costs Deterring Market Growth Strict regulatory requirements is a major hurdle for most players in the global human vaccines market. In addition to this, high costs pose a significant challenge. “The discovery and development of new vaccines require immense capital. Moreover, the transportation, storage, and handling of vaccines can also be extremely heavy on the pocket,” the TMR analyst reports. Apart from this, the containment of technical expertise in the hands of a few major players also acts as a deterrent on the growth of the human vaccines market.

Markets News provided by Research and Markets 30 May, 2017, 09:40 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Therapeutics Market Analysis By Drug (Alimta, Iressa, Avastin, Tarceva, Zykadia, Tagrisso, Xalkori, Cyramza, Opdivo, Alecensa), By Region And Segment Forecasts 2014 - 2025" report to their offering. The global non-small cell lung cancer therapeutics market is expected to reach a value of USD 12.2 billion by 2025 The non-small cell cancer therapeutics (NSCLC) market is anticipated to witness significant growth during the forecast period. This can be attributed to the high investment by market players in the research and development of lung cancer therapy, presence of a rich pipeline, and increasing penetration of drugs during the forecast period. Introduction of several drugs in various geographical regions is likely to drive the market during the forecast period. For instance, in October 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Alecensa (alectinib), a drug developed by Genentech to treat ALK-positive NSCLC as a first-line treatment. The drug has been approved in the U.S., Japan, Canada, Hong Kong, South Korea, Kuwait, and Israel. Presence of a strong pipeline of drugs for non-small cell lung cancer helps propel the market during the forecast period. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Orion Corporation, Merck KGaA, AstraZeneca, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, and Pfizer, Inc. have major molecules in the pipeline. Further key findings from the study suggest: By drug, Alimta accounted for the highest share in 2015. However, it is expected to witness decline in its share during the forecast period. Alecensa (alectinib) is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period. This is majorly attributed to the clinical benefit of the drug to treat ALK-positive NSCLC. Alecensa is expected to be a competitor to Pfizer's Xalkori and Merck's Keytruda during the forecast period. A superior progression-free survival rate of Alecensa was observed in the clinical trials as compared to Crizotinib. Geographically, North America dominated the overall industry in 2015. This is due to the early entry of drugs in the market, increased adoption of new treatment, and high cost of the drug. It is expected that North America would maintain its dominance during the forecast period and grow with the highest rate over the coming years due to expected entry of new drugs. Several players are operating in the industry. Geographical penetration and development of innovative & effective drugs are the key strategies of the players to increase their share. Some of the key players are GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Plc., Novartis AG, AstraZeneca, F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer Inc., Eli Lilly & Company, and Sanofi.

Pic: Dan Linehan SOCIAL BOOKMARKS Cork gets 210 jobs through MSD Brinny expansion Rob McNamara  MORE than 200 jobs are to be created in the latest employment boost for Cork after pharmaceutical giant MSD announced a €280 investment in their Irish operations. MSD, known as Merck in the UK, will be hiring 210 people at their Brinny facility, outside Kinsale, to meet demand for medicine products for lung cancer, melanoma, hepatitis C and rheumatoid arthritis. Jobs Minister Mary Mitchell O'Connor said the announcement will contribute to the spread of jobs development outside of the capital. “MSD has been at the cutting edge of biopharmaceutical innovation over recent years and their Irish operations are at the heart of many of the company's exciting new products. It is particularly gratifying that this expansion and additional job creation will take place in two regional locations, thereby strengthening the Government's efforts to ensure balanced industrial development around the country,” she said. The company develops, tests and manufactures biologics, specialising in the fermentation, purification and sterile filling of biotech products that fight common diseases. Biologics are genetically-engineered proteins made from human genes. They will be hiring 210 people at their Brinny facility to meet demand for medicine products for lung cancer, melanoma, hepatitis C and rheumatoid arthritis. The company will also hire 120 people for its Carlow facility and Jobs Minister Mary Mitchell O'Connor said the announcement will contribute to the spread of jobs development outside of the capital. “MSD has been at the cutting edge of biopharmaceutical innovation over recent years and their Irish operations are at the heart of many of the company's exciting new products. It is particularly gratifying that this expansion and additional job creation will take place in two regional locations, thereby strengthening the Government's efforts to ensure balanced industrial development around the country,” she said. Martin Shanahan, CEO of IDA Ireland said, “MSD’s decision to invest in its Irish operations across a number of regional locations further strengthens Ireland’s positioning as a global destination for manufacturing excellence in biopharmaceuticals. It is pleasing that MSD continues to evolve, grow and innovate from Ireland to continue to meet patient needs around the world.” MSD already employ more than 1,600 people at four locations – Cork, Carlow, Dublin and Tipperary – and has been in the country for the last 50 years. The company had a turnover of €4.7bn last year. Ger Brennan, managing director of MSD Human Health in Ireland said that investment in Ireland over the last five decades has positioned MSD as a significant player in responding to the world’s most vital, unmet health needs. “Our existing portfolio and future pipeline ensure current and future employees can operate at the cutting edge of science and technology. Our Irish sites are involved in the production of over 50% of MSD’s global top 20 products, exporting to over 60 countries worldwide.” Details on the jobs at MSD are available at http://www.msd.ie/careers &nbsp;     Most Read Woman dies after two dogs attack her in Galway 04.06.2017 Man charged with possessing 4kgs of TNT; another charged with IRA membership 04.06.2017 Two due before Special Criminal Court on dissident charges 04.06.2017 Leo Varadkar to set up new anti-terrorism Govt unit in response to London attack 04.06.2017 PSNI investigate attack on man in Coleraine by eight men with metal bars and bats 04.06.2017 Motorcyclist in hospital with serious injuries after accident in Antrim 04.06.2017 Connect With Us Contact Us Linn Dubh, Assumption Road, Blackpool, Cork, Ireland. 021 4272722 Contact us online here Home Cork News National News Lotto Send us your news Cork Sport National Sport Business Ents Showbiz Horoscopes Competitions Life Showbiz Horoscopes Competitions Services Family Notices Free Ads Advertising Find a House Find a Job Competitions Our Partners Breaking News Irish Examiner RecruitIreland Support Contact Us Cookie Policy Privacy Policy About Us Terms and Conditions © Evening Echo 2017

The nation is in the right place at the right time. If you read the news today then you would have learned that MSD, known as Merck in the States, is to create 330 new jobs at its manufacturing plants in Cork and Carlow as part of a €280m investment. What is also riveting about the announcement is that the Irish sites are responsible for more than 50pc of MSD’s top 20 products. These new responsibilities put Ireland at the cutting edge of developments in the areas of biologics. ‘We see a day where every individual suffering from disease will have molecular drivers of that disease clarified, and have new treatment doors opened up for them that [are] as unique as they are. In that regard, we are on the cusp of a Pentium-type era in life sciences’ – COLIN MAC HALE The pharma industry in Ireland has come a long way since the 1990s when the industry was largely involved in processing, a rather unglamorous but essential part of the supply chain. Since then, the myriad of operations of biotech giants – from MSD to GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Regeneron, Allergan and others – are higher up the value chain and have more in common with the Google campus than the old smokestack past. Ireland is the seventh-largest exporter of medicinal products in the world The latest numbers available from IDA Ireland indicate that there are now more than 120 biopharmaceutical operations in the country, out of which 40 are approved by the FDA to produce goods for the pivotal US market. There are 29,000 people directly employed in the biopharma FDI sector alone, and nine out of the top 10 biopharma giants in the world are manufacturing in Ireland. ‘In the last 10 years, there has been a significant ramp-up in large molecule, biologics and manufacturing throughout Ireland’ – TOMMY FANNING In 2015, the biopharma sector recorded €39bn worth of exports, and it contributes more than €1bn in corporation tax to the Irish exchequer annually. According to IDA Ireland’s head of biopharmaceuticals and food division, Tommy Fanning, Ireland is the seventh-largest exporter of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in the world. “In the last 10 years, there has been a significant ramp-up in large molecule, biologics and manufacturing throughout Ireland, adding to our substantial traditional manufacturing base in small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and oral solid dose (OSD). “Over €10bn in new investment has been committed in the last decade for new biotech manufacturing facilities in both drug substance (Alexion, Pfizer, Regeneron, Lilly, J&J, BMS and BioMarin) and drug product (Sanofi-Genzyme, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Amgen and MSD). “Our existing clients have continued to invest and have been joined by an exciting new group of high-growth companies.” Fanning said that an exemplary compliance record, strong Government support for R&D and zero-defect biopharma manufacturing excellence have driven this wave of investment in new biotech facilities. “Irish plants are regularly seen as global manufacturing sites, with FDA approvals in addition to European manufacturing licenses. “The Irish Government is committed to continuing to invest in our education, research and broader ecosystem to ensure that Ireland remains the competitive location of choice for new biotech manufacturing operations. “We have established the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT), which, with its pilot-scale biotech manufacturing equipment, serves as a ‘flight simulator’ for biotech manufacturing. NIBRT is now working with world-leading companies, providing detailed and significant training as well as growing its investment in process research.” According to Fanning, the original background in process engineering, the history in food processing and the quality of the education system gives Ireland a strong advantage when high-level skills are a priority. “A key target is to grow out the sub-supply base, both in terms of manufacture and services. Ireland has attracted a number of the global CRO (clinical research organisations) companies, including Quintiles, PPD, Parexel and Icon, using Ireland as a base to support their international activities,” Fanning said. Clinical trials environment is key When it comes to discovery and clinical trials, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) interfaces with both the pharma industry and health services in Ireland to increase clinical trials and boost discovery. IPHA CEO Oliver McCarthy believes that Ireland’s ability to facilitate discovery and clinical research is an asset, but we need to move faster in terms of adoption of proven drugs by our health services. ‘We think Ireland can do well as a promoter, developer and adopter of innovation across the value chain’ – OLIVER MCCARTHY “We represent the research-based pharma industry that is producing and researching and offering new medicines based on research. We work with over 47 companies here in Ireland, including 39 that are involved in making prescription drugs. “In the value chain of biopharma, we would be involved in advocating for policies and improvements in the areas of discovery and adoption, [to] improve access to medicines in Ireland through clinical trials and research.” McCarthy said that a welcome development has been the establishment of the Health Research Board’s Clinical Research Coordination Ireland (CRCI) network of clinical research hubs. McCarthy said this is essential to the successful conduct of world-class, patient-focused research. “We have seen the intensity of clinical trials increase in the last few years and the CRCI is definitely helping in this regard. “It is a crucial part of the ecosystem and how we position Ireland as an innovation island. When companies look at Ireland, they often see the return on investment, the corporation tax and, of course, the people. “But I think companies in this space also like to know that this is an environment where the innovation they are interested in capturing – from a discovery and translational research aspect – is being adopted too, and that there is an openness in the value chain for adoption of these companies’ medicines in our health services.” McCarthy said companies that invest increasingly look at this kind of environment and assess the whole innovation ecosystem. “There is room to improve. We are not satisfied that it is as good as it should be and we are calling on State authorities to improve the efficiency of processes to get faster results.” He said Ireland currently ranks 16th out of 26 countries in terms of the number of medicines approved for use in health services. “That’s not the best and we want to improve. “We have a fantastic base here. We think Ireland can do well as a promoter, developer and adopter of innovation across the value chain. That’s our ambition to encourage policymakers to speed up adoption.” Capturing the next wave Matt Moran, director of BioPharmachem Ireland (the Ibec body that represents the industry) said that nevertheless, the industry’s shift in Ireland from being a process-based part of the supply chain to being at the pinnacle of product development is no mean feat. “For a long time, the industry went through a patent-cliff period where things slowed down. But Ireland has caught the new wave of capital investment in new molecule and biotech. In a single decade, anything up to €10bn in capital investment has been announced. New and existing companies are investing – companies like BMS, Lilly and Mallinckrodt – and are driving a significant expansion of the sector. ‘It’s a good time in the industry. Its agility and responsiveness, reputation for high standards and compliance makes it a magnet for further investment’ – MATT MORAN “It used to be just process and product, but you are also seeing shared services roles, and most are tacking on R&D to what was traditionally a manufacturing hub.” Just like the digital sectors, Moran warns that finding people is difficult. “Talent is a challenge. Competitiveness is a challenge. The main problem is getting enough people to work in an expanding sector. It is an opportunity as well as a challenge, and we need more people coming out of college with STEM degrees. “The work that needs to be done in promoting the industry is enormous and we are working with the Institute of Technology, for example, to create apprenticeship model for people with non-traditional skills to be trained to work in the sector.” Moran said the infrastructural supports that have grown in recent years have been substantial, from the creation of NIBRT to the SSPC (Solid State Pharmaceutical Cluster), one of the Science Foundation Ireland Centres for Science, Engineering and Technology. “You are seeing infrastructure growing up around the industry, resulting in a more integrated life sciences cluster. The key has been a supportive and responsive government that gets it. “Overall, the industry has never been stronger. It’s a good time in the industry. Its agility and responsiveness, reputation for high standards and compliance makes it a magnet for further investment. “What we are seeing is a shift from small molecule manufacturing to large molecule manufacturing, and BMS, Alexion, Regeneron and Pfizer are all hiring people.” I put it to Moran that, as traditional pharma companies downsize, can’t the skills be shifted to the newer operations? “That’s the beauty of the sector. There is a lot of mobility in the sector if you have chemical engineering skills and qualifications, and that’s where NIBRT also comes in very useful in terms of training and upskilling.” But, ultimately, Moran warns, the difficulty is encouraging parents and new generations of schoolkids to foster a love of science and consider rewarding careers in an industry that keeps giving. “It’s a constant challenge. That’s why we hope our BioPharma Ambition event at Dublin Castle in February will help raise the profile of the industry. “The industry has a job of outreach to do. When you bring people to these facilities, they get it and their eyes light up. Also, the rise of entrepreneurs like Nora Khaldi of Nuritas, and Mark Barrett and Brian Glennon of APC, will help shine a light on the cluster,” said Moran. A Pentium moment for pharma As well as the rise of life sciences entrepreneurs, the opportunity for greater cross-pollination between the pharma and the technology industries is ripe for exploration, explained Colin Mac Hale, industry director (EMEA) for health and life sciences at Intel. “Technology has redefined what is possible for life as we know it. The $2.7bn, 10-year international research effort to map all of the genes of our species that [was] completed in 2003, referred to as the ‘Human Genome Project’, will be viewed by historians as one of the most important medical research projects ever. ‘It’s an understatement to say that the life sciences industry is in the middle of the most dramatic transformation it has ever seen’ – COLIN MAC HALE “10 years after that historic milestone, the industry became capable of building high-volume genome sequencing instruments that could sequence 18,000 human genomes per year, breaking the ‘$1,000 genome in one day’ barrier. This opened the door to population studies and clinical usage models that had not been possible before. Soon, we will be at the cusp of the $100 genome, where doctors will be able to unravel the DNA of a patient’s entire genome in an hour, opening the door to routine personalised diagnosis and treatment plans. This will transform our understanding of disease detection and prevention. “Technology is underpinning all of this. It’s an understatement to say that the life sciences industry is in the middle of the most dramatic transformation it has ever seen. This is one of the most striking examples of Moore’s Law in action. Moore’s Law democratises computing. It’s a pretty powerful law of economics. It says that by advancing semiconductor manufacturing capability at a regular cadence, we can bring down the cost of any business model that relies on computing. “Genomics data is the biggest of big data, and high-volume genome sequencing generates an enormous amount of it. That data needs to be analysed as fast as it is produced. Intel has teamed up with leaders in the life sciences industry to bring to market fast, scalable and affordable analytics solutions that have freed genomic data to be widely accessible for research around the world.” Mac Hale cited the collaboration between Qiagen Bioinformatics and Intel to create a platform that could enable the full analysis of human genomes for as little as $22 each. Qiagen’s Clinical Insight (QCI) platform was used by Rigshospitalet, one of Denmark’s largest and most specialised hospitals, to implement a precision medicine capability for more than 700 advanced cancer patients. Using actionable insights delivered by the QCI platform, doctors found clinically actionable onco-driver mutations and therapies in 40pc of those patients. More than half of those patients were able to enrol in clinical trials to receive drug therapies targeted at their genetic profile. Mac Hale said that just like the moment when the Pentium processor made the PC mainstream, advances in precision medicine, genome sequencing and biologics are changing the game in areas such as oncology, paediatrics, pharmacogenomics and reproductive health. And Ireland is in the right place at the right time. “Our goal is to make healthcare a lot more precise for every individual that healthcare delivery organisations care for. We see a day where every individual suffering from disease will have molecular drivers of that disease clarified, and have new treatment doors opened up for them that [are] as unique as they are. In that regard, we are on the cusp of a Pentium-type era in life sciences.” In-Depth: Life Sciences Week, More on IDA Ireland Related: life sciences, funding and investment, IDA Ireland, employers, research, Intel, Ibec, Pharma, government & policy, biotech 66 DAYS 4 HOURS 26 MINUTES Get your early bird tickets now!

Woods was approached by a member of the Jupiter Police Department, who found him wearing his seat belt while sound asleep at the wheel of his $222,000 Mercedes. The star's car was idling in the middle of Military Trail about one mile from police headquarters, a deserted stretch of road at night but an extremely busy traffic artery during the day. Both his brake lights and flashers were on. After he was woken by cops, Woods - who was alone in the car - told them he had no idea where he was, according to the paperwork. 'I asked Woods where he was going to which he stated he did not know, he just likes to drive,' the arresting officer's affidavit states. Wearing athletic shorts and a t-shirt, Woods was actually driving south, away from his home on Jupiter Island, according to police, who were not aware of what happened to the tires Woods was described as cooperative and confused at first in the reports, which goes on to reveal that he agreed to a breathalyzer and blew .000 One officer said that Woods was falling asleep even after police had come to investigate his car Eldrick T. Woods was approached by a member of the Jupiter Police Department, who found him wearing his seat belt while sound asleep at the wheel of his pricey Mercedes seadan seen in better days Scene: The 41-year-old golfer had to be woken up by an officer and stated that he did not know where he was after first claiming he had driven from California (site of Woods' DUI arrest above) Another officer said that Woods was falling asleep even after police had come to investigate his car.  The golfer later stated 'he was coming from LA California from golfing,' reads the report. 'Woods stated that he did not know where he was. Woods had changed the story of where he was was going and where he was coming from.' He then asked 'how far from his house he was,' according to the affidavit. When asked again where he was coming from and heading to, he told police he was leaving LA and 'that he was on his way down to Orange County.'  Wearing athletic shorts and a t-shirt, Woods was actually driving south, away from his home on Jupiter Island, the report notes. After a fellow cop, who was interviewing the suspect returned to his car, he observed 'the driver fell asleep with his eyes closed and his head up against the headrest.'  Woods was described as cooperative and confused at first in the reports, which goes on to reveal that he agreed to a breathalyzer despite earlier reports. Bad news: The Probable Cause Affidavit from Tiger Woods' DUI arrest reveals that the golfer was asleep at the wheel when he was approached early Monday (Woods above in March) The affidavit also states that there were no odors coming from Woods or the car, this also despite earlier reports claiming that Woods' breath smelled like liquor according to one officer on the scene. Police say that when he exited his car, he was struggling to keep upright and was 'swaying and nearly lost his balance.' He leaned down to tie his shoes, resting his foot on the police patrol car, and 'nearly lost his balance.' 'I asked Woods if he wished to takeoff his shoes. Woods removed his shoes and left them under the front end of my patrol vehicle,' the officer said in the report. Woods appeared confused and seemed to struggle during the sobriety tests. At one point, when Woods was asked to say recite the alphabet backwards to check if he might be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, he instead offered to 'recite the entire national anthem backwards.'  'When asked if he understood the directions he stated, 'yes, recite the entire national anthem backwards.'  Only after the instructions were repeated did he eventually get it right.  'After several times of explaining the instructions he competed the task correctly,' the officer said in the report. Performing under pressure: After failing four field sobriety tests, Woods did manage to successfully recite the national anthem backwards (report above) Family: Wodds and ex-wife Elin Nordegren share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7 (Woods and Nordegren with Sam in 2009 above) Woods was also asked to perform a Walk & Turn first according to the affidavit, but 'could not maintain starting position,' 'missed heel to toe each time,''stepped off line several times' and 'used arms for balance.' Woods also 'stopped walking to steady self' at one point notes the report. He next was asked to perform a One Leg Stand, and was unable to raise his leg off the ground six inches, placing his foot down 'several times' while he tried to complete the test. The Finger To Nose seemed to confuse Woods, who despite having the instructions explained to him multiple times and claiming he understood what was being asked of him failed to complete the task as ordered according to the report. Woods also did not complete the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus as he 'did not follow the stimulus.' In total, six members of law enforcement were involved in the arrest, five of whom were on the scene of the incident at some point on Monday.  'Based on all my observations, Woods SFSTs, and statements made by Woods, I believed I had probably cause to arrest and charge Woods with DUI.' The golf pro was placed in handcuffs, placed under arrest and transported to the station where at 4am, a little less than two hours after the arrest, Woods was observed by one of the officers on the scene for 20 minutes prior to submitting to a breathalyzer. The affidavit notes that Woods' speech was 'slow, sluggish, very slurred' and his attitude was described as 'sluggish, sleepy, unable to walk alone.' Woods was 'cooperative as much as possible' but 'very droopy, extremely sleepy' and had trouble keeping his eyes open.  The breathalyzer was agreed to the report notes, and the results were explained to Woods after he blew a .000 twice in the span of three minutes. He then agreed to the urine test, which was drawn at 4:40 am according to the report, and was read his rights. The results of which have not been released at the time. VICODIN Vicodin is a powerful painkiller prescribed for moderate to severe pain. It contains a mix of hydrocodone (an opioid) and acetaminophen (a less potent painkiller, like Tylenol, that accentuates the effects of hydrocodone). Hydrocodone can slow or stop breathing. Too much acetaminophen can damage the liver. The FDA warning for Vicodin says it 'may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery; patients should be cautioned accordingly.' Users are warned not to take Vicodin if: - they have taken a MAO inhibitor in the last 14 days - they have recently taken a sedative - they have a history of alcohol problems  The affidavit, which also reveals that Woods was on four prescription drugs - Soloxex [sic], Vicodin, Torix and Vioxx. The affidavit notes that Woods has not taken Vioxx this year.    Woods refused however to complete the question and answer section of the form, which involves a mix of general questions about the current date and time along with personal questions about physical aliments or any prescription drugs an individual is taking at the time.  In the Notice to Appear, Officers state that there was no indication of alcohol influence during Woods' arrest, but under drug influence marked 'unknown.' Woods, who occupation is listed as 'athlete,' is facing a traffic misdemeanor for his driving under the influence arrest and will make his first appearance in court later this summer. That appearance is a mandatory one for Woods, who must be in attendance on that date according to the notice he received on Monday. He could be facing up to six months in prison if convicted on the charge, and be ordered to pay $1,000 in fines while performing up to 50 hours of community service. Woods could also walk free if test show he took no more than the recommended dosage of his medication, which was prescribed by a medical professional. It was hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations. Woods' first knee surgery occurred back in 1994 while he was still in college, with the teenager having a benign tumor removed from his knee. His Achilles injuries meanwhile all came around the same time his career began to spiral back in 2008, with the four operations he underwent occurring between then and 2012.  Not noted on the report is the fact that Woods has also had four procedures done on his back as well, the most recent being the fusion procedure he underwent in April.  'The surgery went well, and I'm optimistic this will relieve my back spasms and pain,' Woods said shortly after the operation.  'When healed, I look forward to getting back to a normal life, playing with my kids, competing in professional golf and living without the pain I have been battling so long.' Work in progress: It was also hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations (surgeries above) Rough time: Woods had difficulty signing his name (top left) and then writing in print (bottom right) on his Notice to Appear at 7:30am on Monday morning  His most recent blog post was just six day ago, and the typically laconic Woods wrote in depth about how happy he was with his surgery and his excitement about a possible return to golf. 'It has been just over a month since I underwent fusion surgery on my back, and it is hard to express how much better I feel. It was instant nerve relief. I haven't felt this good in years,' wrote Woods.  He went on to say that while it was a difficult decision to make, he ultimately agreed to the surgery so he could 'have a life with his kids.' VIOXX Woods said he has not taken this in the past year. Vioxx was withdrawn from the US market in 2004 over safety concerns that it increases risk of heart attack and stroke. A major report published by the journal Lancet found that 88,000 Americans had heart attacks from taking Vioxx, and 38,000 of them died. It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (known medically as rofecoxib) that was once prescribed to treat osteoarthritis, acute pain conditions and period pains. Last year, manufacturer Merck & Co had to pay $830 million to resolve a class action suit with shareholders. The company has reserved $4.85 billion to settle legal claims with patients. Here is a brief timeline: - May 1999: First approved by the FDA in 1999, Vioxx was sold by Merck & Co. - December 1999: within months, a safety panel found that scores of patients had suffered serious heart problems or died - double the rate of those on a similar drug with different properties. - In the ensuing years, numerous studies found similar issues - but in that time, 20 million Americans took the drug - September 2004: Merck withdraws the drug after a large study found the clearest evidence that Vioxx increases the risk of heart attacks Woods then wrote about his career moving forward, stating: 'As for returning to competitive golf, the long-term prognosis is positive. My surgeon and physiotherapist say the operation was successful. It's just a matter of not screwing up and letting it fuse. I'm walking and doing my exercises, and taking my kids to and from school. All I can do is take it day by day. There's no hurry.' He added: 'But, I want to say unequivocally, I want to play professional golf again.' The golfer closed out the post as if it would be his last for some time, writing: 'That's about it for now. Have a great summer.'  Should he return, Woods would still be in striking distance of the two biggest PGA records, with his 79 wins just three shy of Sam Snead's record 82 and his 14 Majors four shy of record-holder Jack Nicklaus. Not one to weigh in on the personal matters of his fellow athletes, Nicklaus was forced to speak about Woods' situation due to the fact that he had a previously scheduled press conference on Tuesday afternoon ahead of the  Memorial Tournament, which he founded over four decades ago. When asked if he wanted to comment, Nicklaus responded: 'Not really.' He then added however: 'I feel bad for Tiger. Tiger's a friend. He needs all our help.'  Woods also owns a restaurant near his home in Jupiter, The Woods. The establishment offers classic American fare and drinks along with a lengthy list of bourbons, ryes, cognacs and cigars.    He released a book this past March as well,   Forbes estimated Woods' net worth to be $740million in 2016, with the golfer making $45.5million just that year in endorsements despite his lackluster play on the links.  Time will now tell if any of those big name sponsors, including Nike and Rolex, opt out of their relationship with the golfer.  Woods resigned with Nike back in 2013, but the company stopped making golf equipment last year, meaning that the athlete is being paid to wear their clothing. And that is something he will not be doing for some time after his surgery.  Secret garden: Woods lives in a $54million mansion in Hobe Sound that is well guarded and secluded (entrance above) In The Woods: The golfer also owns a restaurant near his home in Jupiter, The Woods (above), which offers classic American fare That personal fortune meanwhile comes after Woods handed over $750million to first wife Elin Nordegren in their 2010 divorce. The couple share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7, with the exact details of their arrangement unknown due to a seal on the court documents, It is unclear if this arrest might impact the agreement between Woods and his ex-wife. Woods apologized for his actions in a statement late Monday, while claiming that he had not been drinking prior to his arrest and believed that he had suffered a reaction to a prescription medication.

Check out AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Sanofi. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) May 31, 2017 at 3:44PM More than 420 million people across the world have diabetes. At least 29 million of those individuals are Americans, including an estimated 8 million undiagnosed cases. And prevalence of diabetes is increasing. Because of the enormous market size, many pharmaceutical companies have developed treatments for the disease. Some of these drugmakers rank as some of the best dividend stocks on the market. AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), and Sanofi (NYSE:SNY) stand out as the top dividend stocks in diabetes treatment, but several others are strong contenders. Image source: Getty Images. AstraZeneca AstraZeneca markets several diabetes treatments, including Bydureon, Byetta, Farxiga, Kombiglyze, Onglyza, Symlin, and Xigduo. The company's diabetes franchise generated revenue of $2.4 billion last year. Farxiga is AstraZeneca's No. 1 diabetes medication. Sales for the drug totaled $835 million in 2016, up 70% compared to the prior year. This strong growth knocked Onglyza out of the top spot among the company's diabetes drugs. AstraZeneca claims an attractive dividend yield of 5.58%. Although the company currently is paying out more in dividends than it's making on the bottom line, the dividend should be relatively safe because AstraZeneca appears to have solid earnings growth prospects in the coming years. Pfizer Pfizer doesn't have as significant a presence in the diabetes market as AstraZeneca. The big drugmaker's lineup includes diabetes medications Glucotrol, Glyset, and Micronase. However, none of these drugs generated enough sales to even merit a reference in Pfizer's annual report for 2016. More revenue in the diabetes market could be in store for Pfizer, though. Pfizer and its development partner, Merck (NYSE:MRK), expect a decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin by December 2017. The type 2 diabetes drug is expected to reach peak sales topping $1 billion. Pfizer has long been a favorite among dividend investors. It should be still, with a solid yield of 3.98%. Like AstraZeneca, Pfizer has a dividend payout ratio of just over 100%. While that's not good, it probably will only be temporary. Pfizer should experience reasonable earnings growth in the near future, thanks in part to new products gained with several acquisitions made over the past few years. Sanofi Sanofi is a major player in the global diabetes market, with products such as Lantus, Amaryl, Apidra, Toujeo, Insuman, Lyxumia, and Soliqua. Lantus is Sanofi's top-selling product in its diabetes franchise and overall. It's also the No.1 insulin brand in the world. A major challenge for Sanofi is that sales of Lantus are slipping due to generic competition. Sales for Toujeo, however, are soaring and have largely offset the decline for Lantus. Soliqua should also help. The drug gained U.S. approval in late 2016 and is expected to generate peak annual sales of around $1.5 billion. In addition, Sanofi has a couple of promising late-stage diabetes candidates in its pipeline.  Sanofi's dividend currently yields 3.21%. Its payout ratio of 86% is relatively high, but the dividend doesn't appear to be in significant jeopardy right now. Other contenders There are other drugmakers in the diabetes market with dividend yields that aren't too far behind those of AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Sanofi. Merck, which markets Janumet and Januvia, claims a yield of 2.94%. Bristol-Myers Squibb, developer of diabetes drug Farxiga, sports a dividend yield of 2.9%. GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) also sells a diabetes drug, Tanzeum. The drugmaker's dividend yield of 4.55% would rank the stock second behind AstraZeneca. However, GlaxoSmithKline's payout ratio is a whopping 225%. There is significant reason to worry that Glaxo's dividend could be slashed in the future. Still, investors looking for great dividend stocks in the diabetes market have plenty of options from which to choose. AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Sanofi can deliver high yields and dividend checks that should keep on flowing well into the future. Keith Speights owns shares of Pfizer.

We like this definition. The reputation of the pharmaceutical industry is strong as the Pharma RepTrak® finds public perceptions are improving across 8 key markets BOSTON, USA (PRWEB) May 31, 2017 Reputation Institute named AbbVie the most reputable pharmaceutical company in today’s release of its annual Global Pharma RepTrak®. The study is based on over 16,500 reputation ratings collected during January and February 2017 among the general public in 8 key markets: Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, UK and US. The reputation of the pharmaceutical industry is improving and is now at a strong level with the general public. Overall, the industry earned a strong RepTrak® score of 71.8, up from 68.2 in 2016. 44% of respondents viewed the industry as having an excellent reputation with a 7% point increase compared to 2016, while 26% perceived it as weak or poor, down from 35% in 2016. “The strong reputation results come as a surprise to many, who expect the general public to be very negative towards the pharmaceutical companies. However, the reputation data tells a different story,” says Kasper Ulf Nielsen, Executive Partner of Reputation Institute. “We see that the general public actually has strong positive feelings about the individual pharmaceutical companies which they see as delivering on core expectations within products and services, innovation, and leadership. This does not match the media coverage, which is very negative, but serves as a good reminder that media coverage does not equal reputation. Reputation is the perception people have, and that is what is captured in the RepTrak® study.” The Pharma RepTrak® measures the perception of 17 pharmaceutical companies on overall reputation as well as the seven rational dimensions of reputation: products / services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship, leadership and performance. Each company is measured by the general public who are somewhat or very familiar with the company. The top 10 companies in the 2017 Global Pharma RepTrak® are: 1.    AbbVie 2.    Novo Nordisk 3.    Takeda 4.    Roche 5.    Janssen Pharmaceuticals 6.    Gilead Sciences 7.    Bayer 8.    MSD / Merck & Co 9.    Sanofi 10.    Eli Lilly AbbVie tops the reputation ranking and saw a strong improvement of 5.3 RepTrak® points since last year. “Since the company’s inception less than five years ago, we have worked to raise a better understanding of AbbVie among our key stakeholders,” said Laura Schumacher, Executive Vice President, External Affairs, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, AbbVie. “We are pleased that these efforts have resonated with our global audience and driven greater understanding of who we are and what we stand for as a company.” Investing in a strong reputation pays off. A 5-point increase in reputation results in a 9% increase in recommendation. The benefit of a strong reputation is seen for AbbVie, Novo Nordisk, and Takeda, where 54% of the general public would definitely recommend these companies, compared to only 44% who would do the same for Pfizer and GSK. “In a world where word of mouth is becoming more and more critical, reputation is proving to be a key driver of business success, and that’s why the leading companies are actively measuring and managing it,” says Kasper Ulf Nielsen, Executive Partner at Reputation Institute. Within the 7 dimensions of reputation AbbVie took the top spot within Workplace, Governance and Citizenship while Novo Nordisk won on the dimensions of Products / Services and Innovation. Bayer was rated as the best company within Financial Performance and Leadership. The perceptions of the pharmaceutical companies are improving across all seven dimensions of reputation placing 5 of the 7 dimensions in the strong tier. The strongest perception is for Financial Performance followed by Products / Services, Leadership, and Innovation. Governance and Citizenship are the only dimensions, which are still rated in the average tier with scores of 69.2 and 69.5, respectively. Only 1-4% of people hold negative views of the companies across the 7 dimensions, which explain the improvement in reputation overall. However, some individual companies are still struggling with weak perceptions in specific markets, and they are falling further behind as the rest of the industry is improving.

Saag, associate dean for global health, and director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. “The addition of a convenient once-daily version with a comparable efficacy and safety profile at 48 weeks to the existing twice-daily version of ISENTRESS provides physicians with a new therapeutic option for some patients with HIV-1 infection.” ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD do not cure HIV-1 infection or AIDS. Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develop and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely. For more information, see “Selected Safety Information” below. The FDA approval of once-daily ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) is supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 ONCEMRK trial. At Week 48, 89 percent (N=531) of treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once a day achieved viral suppression of HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL compared to 88 percent (N=266) of patients receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice a day, each in combination therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with a treatment difference of 0.5 percent, and a 95 percent confidence interval of -4.2, 5.2. This was consistent across demographic groups at initiation of therapy and a variety of patient populations, including those with high viral load (HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL). “Because of improvements in the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies and with appropriate access to care, HIV infection can now be managed as a chronic disease,” said Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute. “For people living with HIV, having a wide range of effective therapies is important because it provides options to fit patients’ individual needs and lifestyles.” In ONCEMRK, through 48 weeks, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was low (1 percent in patients receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily and 2 percent in patients receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily). There were no drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥2 percent of patients in either treatment group. Clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate, and severe) occurring in ≥2 percent of patients on ISENTRESS HD or ISENTRESS included abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Treatment-emergent viral mutations leading to any drug resistance were detected in less than 1 percent (4/531) of those treated with ISENTRESS HD once daily. ISENTRESS HD can be co-administered with a wide range of antiretroviral agents and non-antiretroviral agents. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. The co-administration of ISENTRESS HD with aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids, calcium carbonate antacids, rifampin, tipranavir/ritonavir, etravirine, and other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is not recommended. “ISENTRESS HD exemplifies Merck’s unwavering commitment to innovation in HIV therapy, and we are pleased to be able to offer this option to a broad range of appropriate adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg who are living with HIV,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, global clinical development, infectious diseases and vaccines, Merck Research Laboratories. The price of ISENTRESS HD will be the same as ISENTRESS twice daily. Merck anticipates ISENTRESS HD to be available in pharmacies in approximately four weeks.

The public rebuke came as Donald Trump reportedly prepared to pull out of the Paris climate accord, the agreement forged by close to 200 countries to address climate change. Some 62% of shareholders voted for the resolution and against Exxon’s management at the company’s annual meeting in Dallas, Texas. The vote to more clearly report how climate change affects Exxon’s business comes as investors are increasingly demanding companies disclose the likely impact of global warming and follows the passing of similar proposals at two smaller energy companies earlier this month. Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England, which led the vote, said shareholders were showing how out of step the Trump administration had become on climate change. “Trump is acting contrary to Wall Street and the world’s largest investors,” he said. “Climate change is a material financial risk and shareholders want to know how companies will manage the change to a low carbon economy.” Exxon’s management sought to head off the proposal championed by the pension funds of the Church of England, New York and California and other large shareholders, which will force the company to conduct an annual “stress test” measuring how its oil assets will be affected by climate change regulation and new technology. Last year, the same proposal was backed by 38% of shareholders who voted. Addressing the meeting Mason said many of the company’s board members had made clear that “they recognised the significance of the agreed international goals on climate change” in their other roles. Board member Ursula Burns, former CEO of Xerox, signed the Obama administration’s climate pledge, and fellow board member Kenneth Frazier chairs Merck, a pharmaceutical company that supports “national and international action to address the challenges presented by climate change”, said Mason. He pointed out that another board member, Susan Avery, former president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, had told the Financial Times: “Clearly climate science is telling us get off fossil fuels as much as possible.” “Members of the board, do you leave your understanding of climate change at the door when you attend the ExxonMobil board meeting?” Mason asked. Chief executive Darren Woods said: “We believe the risks of climate change are serious and warrant action, thoughtful action. As a company we are taking action in many ways.” But he said the company was doing enough to address the impact of climate change and regulation on its business and that the board was against the proposal. “The board believes the company has adequately assessed the future impact of policy developments,” he said. Earlier this month, shareholders overcame management opposition to similar proposals at Occidental Petroleum and PPL, a large utility holding company, and passed resolutions forcing the companies to more clearly explain how climate change could affect their businesses. BlackRock, Exxon’s largest shareholder, backed the resolution at Occidental’s shareholders’ meeting, the first time the investment group had voted against a company’s management over climate change. “When we do not see progress despite ongoing engagement, or companies are insufficiently responsive to our efforts to protect the long-term economic interests of our clients, we will not hesitate to exercise our right to vote,” BlackRock said a statement. Sue Reid, vice-president of climate and energy at the sustainable investor network Ceres, called the vote “historic”. “This is a very strong message from investors that climate change matters and must be addressed. Now we need to see Exxon take action.” New York comptroller Thomas P DiNapoli said: “This is an unprecedented victory for investors in the fight to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil. The burden is now on ExxonMobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously.” The ExxonMobil resolution, introduced by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, says that the company “should analyze the impacts on ExxonMobil’s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2-degree [C] target”. The resolution adds: “This reporting should assess the resilience of the company’s full portfolio of reserves and resources through 2040 and beyond, and address the financial risks associated with such a scenario.” The meeting, the first since former CEO Rex Tillerson left to become secretary of state, was held at the IM Pei-designed Morton H Meyerson symphony center in downtown Dallas.

While numerous tools in the EAM market allow for a high degree of data model adaptation, this adaptability often compromises the usability and the integration potential. The new version 4.0 enables the complete customization of the data model and, at the same time, developers will find it easy to integrate into existing IT landscapes thanks to the strongly typed API. “With GraphQL, a technology developed by Facebook and now used by GitHub, among others, we have found the ideal technology to provide our customers with high-performance, graph-based access to their data,” says André Christ. LeanIX is also committed to continuity in all of their innovations: The familiar, modern LeanIX user interface is significantly faster in the new version, although its look and feel remains almost unchanged. This makes migration to the new version extremely quick and easy, and all existing customers will benefit from this free of charge over the coming months thanks to Software as a Service. With the new product features, LeanIX perfectly supports this year’s motto of the Gartner Summit: “Mastering Digital Business Platform Complexity”. LeanIX 4.0 “Pathfinder” makes it quick and easy to analyze greater amounts of information about your company’s IT architecture. This is particularly relevant to the management of microservice architectures. For many organizations, the move away from a monolithic to a microservice architecture promises significant improvements in the speed and agility of IT. While over 70% of the respondents to a LeanIX study[1] are planning this step in 2017, LeanIX has already completed this transformation with its own product, which makes the company an ideal sparring partner for customers on their way to a modern IT architecture. About LeanIX LeanIX helps companies become digital champions in their industry. With the SaaS-based information hub, companies make better and faster decisions on how to constantly reinvent their IT architecture. LeanIX establishes the 360-degree transparency needed to reduce IT complexity in the IT landscape, ensures compliance and enables growth through adopting state-of-the-art technology.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 31, 2017 9:00am   Comments Share: EAGAN, Minn., May 31, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biothera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced today that a poster about the design of IMPRIME-1™, the company's ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced melanoma/triple negative breast cancer, will be presented at the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting, taking place in Chicago, IL, June 2-6, 2017. The ASCO presentation details are as follows: Session Date & Time: Monday, June 5, 2017, 8:00 AM – 11:30 AM Central Time     Session: Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy     Presentation Title: A multicenter, open-label, phase II study of PGG beta-glucan and pembrolizumab in patients (pts) with advanced melanoma (MEL) following progression on treatment with checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) failing front-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease.     Session Location: McCormick Place, Hall A, Poster Board #193a     Abstract No.: TPS3105 Biothera announced earlier this year initiation of patient dosing in the Phase 2 study, which is evaluating the Company's Imprime PGG in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), the anti-PD-1 therapy marketed by Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada). The multi-center, open-label study is anticipated to enroll up to 71 patients who have tested positive for a biomarker that may identify patients with higher probability of responding to Imprime PGG combination therapy.  Additional information on the trial is available by visiting clinicaltrials.gov. About Biothera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Biothera Pharmaceuticals is a privately held biotechnology company developing Imprime PGG, a Phase 2 cancer immunotherapy that enhances the efficacy of anti-cancer immune response in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor, tumor-targeting and anti-angiogenesis antibodies.  Biothera Pharmaceuticals has clinical research agreements with Merck to evaluate Imprime PGG and KEYTRUDA in Phase 2 studies in advanced melanoma, metastatic triple negative breast cancer, and head and neck squamous cell cancer. This therapeutic combination also is the focus of a Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium Phase 1b/2 trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

The ASCO meeting, which starts Friday in Chicago, draws tens of thousands of specialists from around the world. This year it will feature more than 250 presentations involving immune-system-boosting drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, with the lion’s share of research focused on drugs that target a protein called PD-1, including Merck & Co Inc's Keytruda, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Opdivo and Roche Holding AG's Tecentriq. The drugs work by releasing molecular brakes, or checkpoints, that tumors use to avoid the body’s immune system. That allows the immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells the same way they fight infections caused by bacteria or viruses. For certain cancers, like melanoma, the treatments can mean long-term survival for around 20 percent of patients. Researchers and drugmakers are now focused on testing whether these new drugs can become more powerful, and treat more people, in combination. "We need to probably add to those regimens to have the best chance of eradicating all of the clones that lead to (drug) resistance," said Craig Tendler, head of late development and global medical affairs at Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division. "To get from 20-25 percent of patients up to 50 percent and beyond is going to require other approaches." In some cases, researchers are combining different types of checkpoint inhibitors. They are also testing the new treatments with older drugs like chemotherapy. "There are hundreds and hundreds of combination trials," said Brad Loncar, manager of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. "We are still waiting for a winner to emerge." The global market for cancer immunotherapies alone is expected to grow more than fourfold to $75.8 billion by 2022, according to research firm GlobalData. Other checkpoint inhibitor drugs that will be in focus at ASCO include those that target the CTLA4 protein, such as Bristol's Yervoy, and those that target IDO1. A small study released earlier this month showed that combining Merck's Keytruda with an experimental IDO1 drug from Incyte Corp led to a high rate of durable responses in patients with advanced lung cancer. Separately, U.S. regulators approved a combination of Keytruda and chemotherapy for previously untreated advanced lung cancer. "As far as which combinations we think will look better ... it is a little early," said Dr. Bruce Johnson, chief clinical research officer at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and ASCO's incoming president. New data is also expected on a different class of experimental drugs that recruit immune system cells, known as CAR-T therapies, from companies including Kite Pharma Inc, Juno Therapeutics Inc and Novartis AG. The ASCO meeting will feature key trial results on the best use of J&J's Zytiga for men newly diagnosed with high-risk, metastatic prostate cancer and of AstraZeneca Plc's ovarian cancer drug Lynparza in breast cancer. New data on treating genetically-defined cancers will be presented from a wide range of companies including Loxo Oncology Inc and Roche, which aims to insure use of its newer targeted breast cancer drug Perjeta before its older, multibillion-dollar drug, Herceptin, loses patent protection.

The ASCO meeting, which starts Friday in Chicago, draws tens of thousands of specialists from around the world. This year it will feature more than 250 presentations involving immune-system-boosting drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, with the lion’s share of research focused on drugs that target a protein called PD-1, including Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Opdivo and Roche Holding AG’s Tecentriq. The drugs work by releasing molecular brakes, or checkpoints, that tumors use to avoid the body’s immune system. That allows the immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells the same way they fight infections caused by bacteria or viruses. For certain cancers, like melanoma, the treatments can mean long-term survival for around 20 percent of patients. Researchers and drugmakers are now focused on testing whether these new drugs can become more powerful, and treat more people, in combination. “We need to probably add to those regimens to have the best chance of eradicating all of the clones that lead to (drug) resistance,” said Craig Tendler, head of late development and global medical affairs at Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division. “To get from 20-25 percent of patients up to 50 percent and beyond is going to require other approaches.” In some cases, researchers are combining different types of checkpoint inhibitors. They are also testing the new treatments with older drugs like chemotherapy. “There are hundreds and hundreds of combination trials,” said Brad Loncar, manager of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. “We are still waiting for a winner to emerge.” The global market for cancer immunotherapies alone is expected to grow more than fourfold to $75.8 billion by 2022, according to research firm GlobalData. Other checkpoint inhibitor drugs that will be in focus at ASCO include those that target the CTLA4 protein, such as Bristol’s Yervoy, and those that target IDO1. A small study released earlier this month showed that combining Merck’s Keytruda with an experimental IDO1 drug from Incyte Corp led to a high rate of durable responses in patients with advanced lung cancer. Separately, U.S. regulators approved a combination of Keytruda and chemotherapy for previously untreated advanced lung cancer. “As far as which combinations we think will look better … it is a little early,” said Dr. Bruce Johnson, chief clinical research officer at Boston’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and ASCO’s incoming president. New data is also expected on a different class of experimental drugs that recruit immune system cells, known as CAR-T therapies, from companies including Kite Pharma Inc, Juno Therapeutics Inc and Novartis AG. The ASCO meeting will feature key trial results on the best use of J&J’s Zytiga for men newly diagnosed with high-risk, metastatic prostate cancer and of AstraZeneca Plc’s ovarian cancer drug Lynparza in breast cancer.

Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, and around 85% of people with MS are diagnosed with this type.1 The exact cause of MS is unknown but it is thought that the body’s immune system attacks myelin, disrupting the information flow along the nerves. There is currently no cure for MS, but treatments are available to help slow the course of the disease. About World MS Day 2017 World MS Day is officially marked on the last Wednesday of May. Events and campaigns take place throughout the month of May. It brings the global MS community together to share stories, raise awareness and campaign with and for everyone affected by multiple sclerosis. In 2009, the MS International Federation (MSIF) MS International Federation (MSIF) and its members initiated the first World MS Day. Campaigns are rolled out globally which focus on a different theme each year. The theme for World MS Day 2017 is ‘Life with MS’.

Meet the Contributors → Woodcock: New Approvals Show FDA Is Adapting to Precision Medicine Frank Vinluan May 30th, 2017 @frankvinluan @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  The randomized controlled trial has long been held up as the gold standard for testing new drugs. But the nation’s top drug evaluator, Janet Woodcock, believes they aren’t necessary for all new experimental treatments. Randomized trials are long, expensive to run, and ultimately produce limited answers, she said at a medical conference last week. The ability to use genetic information to classify patients and match them to potential therapies opens up new possibilities for evaluating drugs. As these capabilities increase, Woodcock says, the FDA should adjust its approach to reviewing drugs. “People have been very happy with the use of the traditional standard randomized controlled trial,” Woodcock said last Thursday at the Precision Medicine World Conference at Duke University. “People know how to interpret that evidence. Yet that may not be appropriate for some of these diseases.” The FDA has shown such flexibility with two recent approvals based on better genetic insights. Last week, the FDA approved Merck’s (NYSE: MRK) cancer drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for all solid tumors with a specific genetic signature, regardless of where in the body the cancer started. That decision came days after the regulator expanded use of Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) cystic fibrosis drug, ivacaftor (Kalydeco), so more patients with a particular genetic mutations could get treatment. The additional approvals for both drugs did not require the companies to conduct more randomized controlled trials. Woodcock described the approvals as “landmarks for precision medicine.” Pembrolizumab was already approved to treat cancers of the skin, lung, and bladder, among others. The data supporting the latest approval for the Kenilworth, NJ-based company’s drug came from open-label “basket trials” that simultaneously tested pembrolizumab on a variety of tumors that all share a specific genetic alteration. Patients were selected for the studies based on genetic tests that identified that signature, a predictor of whether they would respond to the Merck therapy. The FDA’s ruling was an “accelerated approval,” meaning Merck must gather additional evidence to confirm the earlier studies. Woodcock said that this type of flexible approach is particularly important for diseases that have no treatment alternatives. Genetic information has also played a role in the development and approval of Vertex’s cystic fibrosis drug, ivacaftor. The drug was initially approved to treat patients who have specific mutations that indicate they would respond to the drug. On May 17, the FDA expanded the approval from 10 mutations to 33. Woodcock said the FDA based this decision on several factors, but the main evidence was a laboratory test that showed the drug could also help CF patients with more gene mutations. Woodcock said that this decision opens a pathway for drugs in cystic fibrosis and other diseases that have similar signs and symptoms. After a drug is first approved, a drugmaker could get additional approvals for additional patient subsets by using the lab test, rather than conducting a randomized clinical trial for each group. The FDA and drug companies have been talking about adding new approaches to clinical trials for years, and that effort is now getting a nudge forward under federal law. Among the provisions of the wide-ranging 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law last year, are requirements that the FDA hold public hearings and issue guidance to help drug companies use new clinical trial designs to test their drugs. The law also calls on the FDA to use real-world evidence to support applications for new uses of already approved drugs. (Regulatory Affairs has a good breakdown of what the new federal law means for the FDA.) Woodcock didn’t reference the Cures Act in her remarks. But she said that for some drugs, different trial designs are warranted. “Platform trials” might be useful to evaluate multiple drugs and drug combinations simultaneously, with the ability to adjust the studies on the fly by adding or dropping arms. This flexibility allows … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Frank Vinluan is editor of Xconomy Raleigh-Durham, based in Research Triangle Park.

Vasculitis is a group of disorders that leads to swelling of blood vessels. In a clinical study of 251 patients with giant cell arteritis, the primary endpoint, defined as the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission from Weeks 12 to 52, was met. Sustained remission included absence of symptoms, normalization of inflammatory laboratory tests, and tapered use of prednisone. More patients receiving Actemra plus prednisone achieved sustained remission compared to patients receiving placebo plus prednisone. A First: FDA OK’s Keytruda For Any Solid Tumor Based on Biomarker For the first time in cancer treatment, a drug has been FDA-approved based on a tumor’s biomarker (specific genetic marker) without regard to the tumor’s original location, such as with breast cancer. Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) can now be used for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as having a biomarker referred to as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). This use includes patients who have failed therapy with no alternatives and those with advanced colorectal cancer who failed certain chemotherapy drugs. In studies, a total of 15 cancer types were identified, most commonly colorectal, endometrial and other gastrointestinal cancers. IL-6 Antagonist Kevzara Cleared to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Kevzara (sarilumab), from Regeneron and Sanofi, is an interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonist newly FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or cannot tolerate one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Kevzara may be used alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other conventional DMARDs. In the MOBILITY study, treatment with Kevzara plus MTX improved physical function and demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression of structural damage compared to placebo plus MTX. In studies, common side effects included neutropenia, increased liver enzymes, and injection site redness, among others. FDA Approves Radicava to Treat Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis It's been over 2 decades since a new drug was approved for ALS. This month, the FDA approved Radicava (edaravone) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease. ALS is a rare disease that kills the nerve cells that control voluntary muscles, and most people die from respiratory failure. Radicava is a free radical scavenger that relieves oxidative stress and may affect progression of ALS. In studies at week 24, individuals receiving Radicava declined less in assessment of daily functioning compared to placebo. Common side effects reported in clinical trials were bruising and gait disturbance. AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi Cleared for Advanced Bladder Cancer Imfinzi (durvalumab) has been FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression despite use of platinum-containing chemotherapy with or without surgery. Imfinzi is an anti-PD-L1 (programmed death ligand-1) human monoclonal antibody. In studies, Imfinzi had an objective response rate (ORR) of 17%, regardless of PD-L1 status, with an ORR of 26.3% in patients with PD-L1 high-expressing tumors. Among 31 patients who responded to treatment, 14 patients (45%) had ongoing responses of at least 6 months and 5 patients (16%) at least 12 months. Of all evaluable patients, 2.7% achieved a complete response.

He failed four field sobriety tests according to the Probable Cause Affidavit, which was obtained by DailyMail.com - which also revealed Woods was on four prescription drugs - although he tested negative for alcohol. New documents released on Tuesday reveal that both tire rims on the driver's side of the Mercedes had some small but visible damage, while the front and rear tires on that side were flat. There was also some minor damage to the bumper on the driver's side, and scuffs and scratches on the rear bumper. The passenger side rear taillight was also not working, according to the documents.   The affidavit states that at 2:03am, Eldrick T. Woods was approached by a member of the Jupiter Police Department, who found him wearing his seat belt while sound asleep at the wheel of his $222,000 Mercedes.

Share this article Share 163 shares The star's car was idling in the middle of Military Trail about one mile from police headquarters, a deserted stretch of road at night but an extremely busy traffic artery during the day. Both his brake lights and flashers were on. After he was woken by cops, Woods - who was alone in the car - told them he had no idea where he was, according to the paperwork. 'I asked Woods where he was going to which he stated he did not know, he just likes to drive,' the arresting officer's affidavit states. Up and at 'em: Eldrick T. Woods was approached by a member of the Jupiter Police Department, who found him wearing his seat belt while sound asleep at the wheel of his $222,000 Mercedes (above) Scene: The 41-year-old golfer had to be woken up by an officer and stated that he did not know where he was after first claiming he had driven from California (site of Woods' DUI arrest above) Another officer said that Woods was falling asleep even after police had come to investigate his car.  The golfer later stated 'he was coming from LA California from golfing,' reads the report. 'Woods stated that he did not know where he was. Woods had changed the story of where he was was going and where he was coming from.' He then asked 'how far from his house he was,' according to the affidavit. When asked again where he was coming from and heading to, he told police he was leaving LA and 'that he was on his way down to Orange County.'  Wearing athletic shorts and a t-shirt, Woods was actually driving south, away from his home on Jupiter Island, the report notes. After a fellow cop, who was interviewing the suspect returned to his car, he observed 'the driver fell asleep with his eyes closed and his head up against the headrest.'  Woods was described as cooperative and confused at first in the reports, which goes on to reveal that he agreed to a breathalyzer despite earlier reports. Bad news: The Probable Cause Affidavit from Tiger Woods' DUI arrest reveals that the golfer was asleep at the wheel when he was approached early Monday (Woods above in March) The affidavit also states that there were no odors coming from Woods or the car, this also despite earlier reports claiming that Woods' breath smelled like liquor according to one officer on the scene. Police say that when he exited his car, he was struggling to keep upright and was 'swaying and nearly lost his balance.' He leaned down to tie his shoes, resting his foot on the police patrol car, and 'nearly lost his balance.' 'I asked Woods if he wished to takeoff his shoes. Woods removed his shoes and left them under the front end of my patrol vehicle,' the officer said in the report. Woods appeared confused and seemed to struggle during the sobriety tests. At one point, when Woods was asked to say recite the alphabet backwards to check if he might be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, he instead offered to 'recite the entire national anthem backwards.'  'When asked if he understood the directions he stated, 'yes, recite the entire national anthem backwards.'  Only after the instructions were repeated did he eventually get it right.  'After several times of explaining the instructions he competed the task correctly,' the officer said in the report. Performing under pressure: After failing four field sobriety tests, Woods did manage to successfully recite the national anthem backwards (report above) Family: Wodds and ex-wife Elin Nordegren share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7 (Woods and Nordegren with Sam in 2009 above) Woods was also asked to perform a Walk & Turn first according to the affidavit, but 'could not maintain starting position,' 'missed heel to toe each time,''stepped off line several times' and 'used arms for balance.' Woods also 'stopped walking to steady self' at one point notes the report. He next was asked to perform a One Leg Stand, and was unable to raise his leg off the ground six inches, placing his foot down 'several times' while he tried to complete the test. The Finger To Nose seemed to confuse Woods, who despite having the instructions explained to him multiple times and claiming he understood what was being asked of him failed to complete the task as ordered according to the report. Woods also did not complete the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus as he 'did not follow the stimulus.' In total, six members of law enforcement were involved in the arrest, five of whom were on the scene of the incident at some point on Monday.  'Based on all my observations, Woods SFSTs, and statements made by Woods, I believed I had probably cause to arrest and charge Woods with DUI.' The golf pro was placed in handcuffs, placed under arrest and transported to the station where at 4am, a little less than two hours after the arrest, Woods was observed by one of the officers on the scene for 20 minutes prior to submitting to a breathalyzer. The affidavit notes that Woods' speech was 'slow, sluggish, very slurred' and his attitude was described as 'sluggish, sleepy, unable to walk alone.' Woods was 'cooperative as much as possible' but 'very droopy, extremely sleepy' and had trouble keeping his eyes open.  The breathalyzer was agreed to the report notes, and the results were explained to Woods after he blew a .000 twice in the span of three minutes. He then agreed to the urine test, which was drawn at 4:40 am according to the report, and was read his rights. The results of which have not been released at the time. VICODIN Vicodin is a powerful painkiller prescribed for moderate to severe pain. It contains a mix of hydrocodone (an opioid) and acetaminophen (a less potent painkiller, like Tylenol, that accentuates the effects of hydrocodone). Hydrocodone can slow or stop breathing. Too much acetaminophen can damage the liver. The FDA warning for Vicodin says it 'may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery; patients should be cautioned accordingly.' Users are warned not to take Vicodin if: - they have taken a MAO inhibitor in the last 14 days - they have recently taken a sedative - they have a history of alcohol problems  The affidavit, which also reveals that Woods was on four prescription drugs - Soloxex [sic], Vicodin, Torix and Vioxx. The affidavit notes that Woods has not taken Vioxx this year.    Woods refused however to complete the question and answer section of the form, which involves a mix of general questions about the current date and time along with personal questions about physical aliments or any prescription drugs an individual is taking at the time.  In the Notice to Appear, Officers state that there was no indication of alcohol influence during Woods' arrest, but under drug influence marked 'unknown.' Woods, who occupation is listed as 'athlete,' is facing a traffic misdemeanor for his driving under the influence arrest and will make his first appearance in court later this summer. That appearance is a mandatory one for Woods, who must be in attendance on that date according to the notice he received on Monday. He could be facing up to six months in prison if convicted on the charge, and be ordered to pay $1,000 in fines while performing up to 50 hours of community service. Woods could also walk free if test show he took no more than the recommended dosage of his medication, which was prescribed by a medical professional. It was hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations. Woods' first knee surgery occurred back in 1994 while he was still in college, with the teenager having a benign tumor removed from his knee. His Achilles injuries meanwhile all came around the same time his career began to spiral back in 2008, with the four operations he underwent occurring between then and 2012.  Not noted on the report is the fact that Woods has also had four procedures done on his back as well, the most recent being the fusion procedure he underwent in April.  'The surgery went well, and I'm optimistic this will relieve my back spasms and pain,' Woods said shortly after the operation.  'When healed, I look forward to getting back to a normal life, playing with my kids, competing in professional golf and living without the pain I have been battling so long.' Work in progress: It was also hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations (surgeries above) Rough time: Woods had difficulty signing his name (top left) and then writing in print (bottom right) on his Notice to Appear at 7:30am on Monday morning  His most recent blog post was just six day ago, and the typically laconic Woods wrote in depth about how happy he was with his surgery and his excitement about a possible return to golf. 'It has been just over a month since I underwent fusion surgery on my back, and it is hard to express how much better I feel. It was instant nerve relief. I haven't felt this good in years,' wrote Woods.  He went on to say that while it was a difficult decision to make, he ultimately agreed to the surgery so he could 'have a life with his kids.' VIOXX Woods said he has not taken this in the past year. Vioxx was withdrawn from the US market in 2004 over safety concerns that it increases risk of heart attack and stroke. A major report published by the journal Lancet found that 88,000 Americans had heart attacks from taking Vioxx, and 38,000 of them died. It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (known medically as rofecoxib) that was once prescribed to treat osteoarthritis, acute pain conditions and period pains. Last year, manufacturer Merck & Co had to pay $830 million to resolve a class action suit with shareholders. The company has reserved $4.85 billion to settle legal claims with patients. Here is a brief timeline: - May 1999: First approved by the FDA in 1999, Vioxx was sold by Merck & Co. - December 1999: within months, a safety panel found that scores of patients had suffered serious heart problems or died - double the rate of those on a similar drug with different properties. - In the ensuing years, numerous studies found similar issues - but in that time, 20 million Americans took the drug - September 2004: Merck withdraws the drug after a large study found the clearest evidence that Vioxx increases the risk of heart attacks Woods then wrote about his career moving forward, stating: 'As for returning to competitive golf, the long-term prognosis is positive. My surgeon and physiotherapist say the operation was successful. It's just a matter of not screwing up and letting it fuse. I'm walking and doing my exercises, and taking my kids to and from school. All I can do is take it day by day. There's no hurry.' He added: 'But, I want to say unequivocally, I want to play professional golf again.' The golfer closed out the post as if it would be his last for some time, writing: 'That's about it for now. Have a great summer.'  Should he return, Woods would still be in striking distance of the two biggest PGA records, with his 79 wins just three shy of Sam Snead's record 82 and his 14 Majors four shy of record-holder Jack Nicklaus. Not one to weigh in on the personal matters of his fellow athletes, Nicklaus was forced to speak about Woods' situation due to the fact that he had a previously scheduled press conference on Tuesday afternoon ahead of the  Memorial Tournament, which he founded over four decades ago. When asked if he wanted to comment, Nicklaus responded: 'Not really.' He then added however: 'I feel bad for Tiger. Tiger's a friend. He needs all our help.'  Woods also owns a restaurant near his home in Jupiter, The Woods. The establishment offers classic American fare and drinks along with a lengthy list of bourbons, ryes, cognacs and cigars.    He released a book this past March as well,   Forbes estimated Woods' net worth to be $740million in 2016, with the golfer making $45.5million just that year in endorsements despite his lackluster play on the links.  Time will now tell if any of those big name sponsors, including Nike and Rolex, opt out of their relationship with the golfer.  Woods resigned with Nike back in 2013, but the company stopped making golf equipment last year, meaning that the athlete is being paid to wear their clothing. And that is something he will not be doing for some time after his surgery.  Secret garden: Woods lives in a $54million mansion in Hobe Sound that is well guarded and secluded (entrance above) In The Woods: The golfer also owns a restaurant near his home in Jupiter, The Woods (above), which offers classic American fare That personal fortune meanwhile comes after Woods handed over $750million to first wife Elin Nordegren in their 2010 divorce. The couple share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7, with the exact details of their arrangement unknown due to a seal on the court documents, It is unclear if this arrest might impact the agreement between Woods and his ex-wife. Woods apologized for his actions in a statement late Monday, while claiming that he had not been drinking prior to his arrest and believed that he had suffered a reaction to a prescription medication. The golfer underwent fusion surgery last month. 'I understand the severity of what I did and I take full responsibility for my actions. I want the public to know that alcohol was not involved,' said Woods. 'What happened was an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications. I didn't realize the mix of medications affected me so strongly.' He went on to state: 'I would like to apologize with all my heart to my family, friends, and the fans. I expect more from myself, too. I will do everything in my power to ensure this never happens again.' Woods then closed out by expressing his gratitude for the local authorities, saying: 'I fully cooperated with law enforcement, and I would like to personally thank the representatives of the Jupiter Police Dept. and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office for their professionalism.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 163 shares Most watched News videos Horrifying moment collapsed cesspool fatally drags worker inside Brazen thieves rob a California Apple store in broad daylight Ex-DNC chair threatens 'consequences' if laptop isn't returned Incredible moment Sott Dixon crashes during Indy500 Navy Seal killed in parachute accident at Fleet Week event High school student goes on profanity-laced rant at a teacher Macron forces Trump's arm back in awkward handshake exchange Dani Mathers apologizes for body shaming naked 70-year-old woman Hilarious moment a farting goat scares a child Melania Trump arrives in Sicily wearing floral jacket Hilarious moment tiny puppy pushes its friend down flight of stairs Shocking video appears to show cop punching 14-year-old girl Memorial Day brawl!

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Wednesday that it could not recommend routine use of the medicine in newly diagnosed patients, given the drug's high cost and uncertainties about overall survival benefits. But the agency backed Keytruda use within the Cancer Drugs Fund, signalling that it had the potential to satisfy the criteria for routine use on the National Health Service (NHS) for this group of patients but needs more investigation. The decision follows data presented at a medical meeting last year showing that Keytruda could help lung cancer patients whose tumours have a high level of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. Keytruda is already approved as a cost-effective second-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have previously taken chemotherapy but no longer respond. MSD, as Merck is known outside North America, has agreed to provide Keytruda to the NHS at an undisclosed discount.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Nanomedicine Market is anticipated to reach USD 350.8 billion by 2025 ·         Solutions such as nanoformulations with triggered release for tailor-made pharmacokinetics, nanoparticles for local control of tumor in combination with radiotherapy, and functionalized nanoparticles for targeted in-vivo activation of stem cell production are anticipated to drive R&D, consequently resulting in revenue generation in the coming years. ·         Biopharmaceutical and medical devices companies are actively engaged in development of novel products as demonstrated by the increasingly growing partnerships between leading enterprises and nanomedicine startups. ·         Therapeutics accounted for the largest share of market revenue in 2016 owing to presence of nanoemulsions, nanoformulations, or nanodevices ·         These devices possess the ability to cross biological barriers. Moreover, presence of drugs such as Doxil, Abraxane, and Emend is attributive for higher revenue generation ·         Presence of substantial number of products manufactured through the use of microbial sources can be attributed for the largest share ·         In-vitro diagnostics is expected to witness lucrative progress as a result of R&D carried out in this segment ·         Asia Pacific is estimated to witness the fastest growth over the forecast period ·         Key players operating in this industry include Pfizer Inc., Ablynx NV, Nanotherapeutics Inc., Nanoviricides Inc., Abraxis Inc., Arrowhead Research Inc., Celgene Corporation, Bio-Gate AG, and Merck ·         Active expansion strategies are undertaken by a number of the major market entities in order to strengthen their position ·         North America dominated the industry in 2016, accounting for a 42% of total revenue The global nanomedicine market is anticipated to reach USD 350.8 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. Development of novel nanotechnology-based drugs and therapies is driven by the need to develop therapies that have fewer side effects and that are more cost-effective than traditional therapies, in particular for cancer. Application of nanotechnology-based contrast reagents for diagnosis and monitoring of the effects of drugs on an unprecedented short timescale is also attributive drive growth in the coming years. Additionally, demand for biodegradable implants with longer lifetimes that enable tissue restoration is anticipated to influence demand. As per the WHO factsheet, cancer is found to be one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases in 2012 and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths. Thus, demand for nanomedicine in order to curb such high incidence rate is expected to boost market progress during the forecast period. Solutions such as nanoformulations with triggered release for tailor-made pharmacokinetics, nanoparticles for local control of tumor in combination with radiotherapy, and functionalized nanoparticles for targeted in-vivo activation of stem cell production are anticipated to drive R&D, consequently resulting in revenue generation in the coming years. Biopharmaceutical and medical devices companies are actively engaged in development of novel products as demonstrated by the increasingly growing partnerships between leading enterprises and nanomedicine startups. For instance, in November 2015, Ablynx and Novo Nordisk signed a global collaboration and a licensing agreement for development and discovery of innovative drugs with multi-specific nanobodies. This strategic partnership is anticipated to rise the net annual sales of the products uplifting the market growth. However, in contrary with the applications of nanotechnology, the entire process of lab to market approval is a tedious and expensive one with stringent regulatory evaluation involved thereby leading investors to remain hesitant for investments.

Development of novel nanotechnology-based drugs and therapies is driven by the need to develop therapies that have fewer side effects and that are more cost-effective than traditional therapies, in particular for cancer. Application of nanotechnology-based contrast reagents for diagnosis and monitoring of the effects of drugs on an unprecedented short timescale is also attributive drive growth in the coming years. Additionally, demand for biodegradable implants with longer lifetimes that enable tissue restoration is anticipated to influence demand. As per the WHO factsheet, cancer is found to be one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases in 2012 and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths. Thus, demand for nanomedicine in order to curb such high incidence rate is expected to boost market progress during the forecast period. Solutions such as nanoformulations with triggered release for tailor-made pharmacokinetics, nanoparticles for local control of tumor in combination with radiotherapy, and functionalized nanoparticles for targeted in-vivo activation of stem cell production are anticipated to drive R&D, consequently resulting in revenue generation in the coming years. Biopharmaceutical and medical devices companies are actively engaged in development of novel products as demonstrated by the increasingly growing partnerships between leading enterprises and nanomedicine startups. For instance, in November 2015, Ablynx and Novo Nordisk signed a global collaboration and a licensing agreement for development and discovery of innovative drugs with multi-specific nanobodies. This strategic partnership is anticipated to rise the net annual sales of the products uplifting the market growth. However, in contrary with the applications of nanotechnology, the entire process of lab to market approval is a tedious and expensive one with stringent regulatory evaluation involved thereby leading investors to remain hesitant for investments.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Glaucoma Market: Industry Analysis & Outlook 2017-2021 with Focus on the US Industry – Research and Markets DUBLIN–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Research and Markets has announced the addition of the „Global Glaucoma Market: Industry Analysis & Outlook (2017-2021)” report to their offering. „Global Glaucoma Market: Industry Analysis & Outlook (2017-2021)” analyzes the development of this market, with focus on the US and OUS treatment market. The major trends, growth drivers as well as issues being faced by the market are discussed in detail in this report. The four major players: Pfizer Inc., Novartis AG, Merck & Co., Inc. and Allergan Plc. are being profiled along with their key financials and strategies for growth. The report contains a comprehensive analysis of the global glaucoma market along with the study of the US market. Though glaucoma cannot be cured completely, the disease progression can be controlled with the help of available treatments. There are three types of modalities available for treatment of glaucoma: Drugs, Laser and Invasive Surgery. Further, based upon the approaches employed for the medication, it can be segmented into two parts: PGA Medication and Non-PGA Medication. The PGA approach reduces IOP with the help of prostaglandin (PGA). The non-PGA medication can be further divided into four sub segments: Beta blockers, Alpha blockers, Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) and Combination Products. Several factors such as rising prevalence of diabetes, growing geriatric population and rising health care expenditure along with increasing disposable income and growing obese population will drive the market growth in the next few years. Development of new drugs & devices and drug therapy focused upon IOP are the few notable market trends. However, high cost of treatment, severe side effects and hasty drug approval processes act as a major roadblock for the market growth. Key Topics Covered: 1. Overview 2. Global Glaucoma Market 3. Regional Markets 4. Market Dynamics 5. Competitive Landscape 6. Company Profiles – Allergan Plc. – Merck & Co., Inc. – Novartis AG – Pfizer Inc.

Amy Maxmen 30 May 2017 Article tools Rights & Permissions John Moore/Getty Images Ebola vaccines have been used before, but only in trials such as this one in 2015 in Liberia. Regulatory and ethics-review boards in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have approved the use of an experimental Ebola vaccine to combat an ongoing outbreak of the virus, officials announced on 29 May. If they decide to deploy the vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, health-care workers will offer it to those at highest risk of contracting the disease. Uncertainties over the outbreak’s magnitude mean that Congolese authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) must determine whether the small number of confirmed cases justifies the cost and logistical complexity that comes with deploying the vaccine, says Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general of health systems and innovation at the WHO’s headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Officials have confirmed only two cases of Ebola since they started getting reports of people with Ebola-like symptoms in late April. There are 17 suspected cases in the DRC awaiting a diagnosis, as of an update from the WHO dated 28 May. Sixty-seven percent of the computer simulations run by officials predict that there will be no further cases in the next month. Handle with care Nonetheless, officials have spent the past two weeks preparing to transport the vaccine to the outbreak’s epicentre in Likati, a remote part of the Bas-Uélé province, a part of the country that borders the Central African Republic. Workers will need to use a combination of helicopters and motorcycles, because the heavily forested province — nearly twice the size of Ireland — doesn’t have paved roads. Another option is to use small boats to traverse the region on narrow rivers. Furthermore, a lack of electricity in the area will require portable freezers capable of storing the vaccine doses at –80 °C. The WHO and the Congolese authorities will also need to train nurses on how best to roll out the immunizations, says Eugene Kabambi, a WHO communications officer based in Kinshasa, DRC. And communities must be educated about the vaccine so that there are no misunderstandings about its safety or its benefits, given the danger of Ebola. In the meantime, the Congolese Ministry of Health and the WHO have arranged for the deployment of two mobile laboratories in Bas-Uélé, where researchers with the Congolese National Biomedical Research Institute can run diagnostic tests for Ebola. And a group from the aid organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders) has set up and staffed a 10-bed Ebola treatment unit near the outbreak’s epicentre. In case of emergency In April, a WHO working group recommended the use of rVSV-ZEBOV should an outbreak occur, on the basis of promising results from a clinical trial conducted in 2015 during the Ebola crisis in Guinea1. There are 300,000 doses of the vaccine available, owing to an agreement made in 2016 between the international organization Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and Merck, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures rVSV-ZEBOV. The key to Merck’s vaccine is a protein expressed on the surface of the Zaire strain of Ebola, collected during a 1995 outbreak in Kikwit, DRC. This is nearly identical to the strain circulating in the country now. The protein triggers a person’s immune system to produce antibodies that fight the virus. Should the vaccine be deployed, staff at MSF will vaccinate health-care workers in the hot zone and the initial group of people who had contact with those infected with Ebola, as well as a secondary group who had contact with the initial crowd. This ‘ring-vaccination’ strategy was used in Guinea in 2015 to protect those at highest risk of exposure. The infrastructure, including laboratories and equipment, and the personnel required to address the Ebola epidemic in the DRC won’t come cheap. The Congolese government has estimated that its response will require US$14 million. But a humanitarian crisis in the Kasai region in central DRC is also draining resources from the government and international donors. The United Nations stated in April that it will cost at least $11 million to meet the immediate nutritional, health and educational needs of more than a million people who have been displaced by escalating conflicts in the region. “Ebola outbreaks are tragic but expected,” says Mark Feinberg, president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative based in New York City. “And this is an important opportunity to test how prepared countries are to decide whether or not they want to deploy new vaccines, and how, before they are licensed.” Journal name: Nature DOI: doi:10.1038/nature.2017.22024 References Henao-Restrepo, A.

Analyst Christian Orquera reiterated his BUY rating and decreased the price target from EUR 40.00 to EUR 39.00. Abstract: On 16 May, Noxxon closed an agreement with the National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) in Heidelberg. At this leading cancer centre, Noxxon will conduct the Phase II study of its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in a total of 20 metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients. This is good news and we expect enrolment to start soon. A few days earlier Noxxon published FY/16 results which were slightly better than we expected, and closed a capital increase raising EUR1.0m. The company also converted most of Kreos’ outstanding EUR2.6m debt and secured up to EUR20m financing through the issue of EUR10m of convertible notes with warrants to subscribe to a further EUR10m. We currently expect Noxxon to raise only EUR4.5m through the notes (giving rise to a further EUR4.5m in warrants) which will suffice to generate the required Phase II top-line data of NOX-A12. Overall we view the deal as positive as it secures funding through 2018. However, the dilutive effect (substantial discount to the current share price) has a slightly negative impact on our valuation. We have therefore lowered our price target to EUR39.00 (previously EUR40.00). We reiterate our Buy rating.

Analyst Christian Orquera bestätigt seine BUY-Empfehlung und senkt das Kursziel von EUR 40,00 auf EUR 39,00. Zusammenfassung: Am 16. Mai schloss Noxxon eine Vereinbarung mit dem Nationalen Zentrum für Tumorkrankheit (NCT) in Heidelberg ab. An diesem führenden Krebszentrum wird Noxxon die Phase-II-Studie seines Arzneimittelkandidaten NOX-A12 in Kombination mit Mercks Medikament Keytruda (Pembrolizumab) bei insgesamt 20 metastasierten kolorektalen und pankreatischen Krebspatienten durchführen. Das ist eine gute Nachricht und wir erwarten, dass die Patientenrekrutierung bald beginnt. Ein paar Tage zuvor veröffentlichte Noxxon FY/16-Ergebnisse, die etwas besser waren als wir erwartet hatten, und schloss eine Kapitalerhöhung von EUR1,0 Mio ab. Das Unternehmen hat auch die meisten bei Kreos ausstehenden EUR2,6 Mio. Schulden umgewandelt und sich bis zu EUR20 Mio. Finanzierung durch die Ausgabe von EUR10 Mio. Wandelanleihen und EUR10 Mio. Optionsscheine gesichert. Wir erwarten derzeit, dass Noxxon nur noch EUR4,5 Mio. durch die Wandelanleihen (plus weitere EUR4,5 Mio. durch Optionsscheine) abruft, was ausreicht, um die benötigten Top-Line-Ergebnisse der Phase-II-Studie von NOX-A12 zu generieren. Insgesamt bewerten wir den Deal positiv, da die nötige Finanzierung bis 2018 gesichert ist. Der verwässernde Effekt des Deals (erheblicher Abschlag auf den aktuellen Aktienkurs) wirkt sich jedoch leicht negativ auf unsere Bewertung aus. Wir haben daher unser Kursziel auf EUR39,00 (vorher EUR40,00) gesenkt. Wir bekräftigen unsere Kaufempfehlung.

Analyst Christian Orquera reiterated his BUY rating and decreased the price target from EUR 40.00 to EUR 39.00. Abstract: On 16 May, Noxxon closed an agreement with the National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) in Heidelberg. At this leading cancer centre, Noxxon will conduct the Phase II study of its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in a total of 20 metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients. This is good news and we expect enrolment to start soon. A few days earlier Noxxon published FY/16 results which were slightly better than we expected, and closed a capital increase raising EUR1.0m. The company also converted most of Kreos’ outstanding EUR2.6m debt and secured up to EUR20m financing through the issue of EUR10m of convertible notes with warrants to subscribe to a further EUR10m. We currently expect Noxxon to raise only EUR4.5m through the notes (giving rise to a further EUR4.5m in warrants) which will suffice to generate the required Phase II top-line data of NOX-A12. Overall we view the deal as positive as it secures funding through 2018. However, the dilutive effect (substantial discount to the current share price) has a slightly negative impact on our valuation. We have therefore lowered our price target to EUR39.00 (previously EUR40.00). We reiterate our Buy rating.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dr. Eric G. Mortensen, M.D., Ph.D., Clinical Trial Veteran, Joins CytoSorbents as Chief Medical Officer MONMOUTH JUNCTION, N.J., May 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — CytoSorbents Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSO), a critical care immunotherapy leader using CytoSorb® blood purification to treat deadly inflammation in critically-ill and cardiac surgery patients around the world, announced that Dr. Eric G. Mortensen, M.D., Ph.D., will join CytoSorbents as Chief Medical Officer, starting full-time on June 1, 2017.  Dr. Phillip Chan, M.D., Ph.D., CytoSorbents’ Chief Executive Officer stated, „Dr. Mortensen has led clinical development of key programs for some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, including Pfizer’s novel rheumatoid arthritis therapy, Xeljanz®, which has achieved approximately $1 billion in annual worldwide sales. He brings more than two decades of proven and successful clinical trial development expertise to the company, as well as a wealth of knowledge and experience in immunology, inflammation, and clinical medicine. We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Mortensen to the executive team at CytoSorbents.”  Dr. Mortensen commented, „CytoSorbents is at an exciting phase in the clinical and scientific validation of its unique immunotherapy approach, and I am eager to contribute my significant clinical development experience to advance this important technology. CytoSorb has been used successfully in a wide range of challenging inflammatory conditions, demonstrating the promise of blood purification as an alternative to drugs and biologics. Our goal now is to design and execute the appropriate, well-designed studies to make CytoSorb standard of care for many of these conditions. I look forward to building upon the recent REFRESH I cardiac surgery trial to advance CytoSorb through a registration trial towards potential U.S. approval. In addition, I am fascinated by the easily modified core polymer, which has led to many new experimental treatments for blood transfusion applications, hyperkalemia, drug overdose, and toxin-mediated disease. This flexibility, as well as the ability to be adapted to many different modes of administration, creates a wealth of opportunities to develop new therapies. I believe that CytoSorb and our related technologies represent a breakthrough paradigm in the approach to inflammation and critical care.” As Vice President & Therapeutic Area Clinical Head for Inflammation and Immunology at Pfizer from 2014 to 2016, Dr. Mortensen led the company’s global, late-stage development organization for programs in inflammatory diseases including studies for Enbrel® and Xeljanz®. As the Clinical Inflammation Development Strategy Lead and co-chair for Inflammation’s Therapeutic Area Strategy Team (TAST), he ensured an integrated approach to the development of medicines across the different indications within Inflammation and Immunology. Dr. Mortensen previously held positions of increasing responsibility as the Vice President, Global Medicine Development Group Global Lead for Xeljanz and Assistant Vice President and Global Therapeutic Area Director for Enbrel. Previously at GlaxoSmithKline, he led clinical programs for the reintroduction of alosetron to the US market, the registration program for alvimopan, and medical affairs programs for assets within Women’s Health, Urology, Acute Care, Gastrointestinal and Ophthalmologic business units.  Prior to this, at Merck Research Laboratories, he was responsible for registration studies of the COX2 inhibitors rofecoxib and etoricoxib. Dr. Mortensen received an A.B. in Biochemistry from Harvard College, an M.D. from the Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST), and a Ph.D. in Biophysics at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences where he studied the transduction of membrane-bound hormone receptor’s binding into intracellular activation of metabolic activity and cellular proliferation. Dr. Mortensen completed an internship and residency in Internal Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital and a fellowship in Gastroenterology at the University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor. CytoSorbents also announced that Dr. Robert H. Bartlett, M.D. will retire as Chief Medical Officer, but will continue working closely with the company as a consultant and as Co-chair of the Cardiac Surgery Advisory Board with Dr. Joseph Zwischenberger, M.D. through the next anticipated REFRESH 2 cardiac surgery trial. Dr. Chan stated, „For nearly nine years, Dr. Bartlett has served as Chief Medical Officer of CytoSorbents and has helped guide the company through multiple key clinical studies, including the successfully completed REFRESH I cardiac surgery trial, our European Union approval of CytoSorb, and commercialization of CytoSorb worldwide. A trusted advisor, an experienced and practical clinician, and a legend in the field of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, we are pleased to continue working with Dr. Bartlett on a consulting basis. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire company, we thank Dr. Bartlett for his many outstanding contributions towards the success of the company.” About CytoSorbents Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSO) CytoSorbents Corporation is a leader in critical care immunotherapy, specializing in blood purification. Its flagship product, CytoSorb® is approved in the European Union with distribution in 43 countries around the world, as a safe and effective extracorporeal cytokine adsorber, designed to reduce the „cytokine storm” or „cytokine release syndrome” that could otherwise cause massive inflammation, organ failure and death in common critical illnesses such as sepsis, burn injury, trauma, lung injury and pancreatitis, as well as in cancer immunotherapy. These are conditions where the risk of death is extremely high, yet no effective treatments exist. CytoSorb® is also being used during and after cardiac surgery to remove inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and free hemoglobin, which can lead to post-operative complications, including multiple organ failure. CytoSorbents has completed its REFRESH (REduction in FREe Hemoglobin) 1 trial – a multi-center, randomized controlled study that has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of free hemoglobin reduction with intra-operative CytoSorb® use in a heart-lung machine during complex cardiac surgery.  In 2017, the company plans to initiate a pivotal REFRESH 2 trial intended to support U.S. FDA approval.  CytoSorb® has been used safely in more than 23,000 human treatments to date. CytoSorbents’ purification technologies are based on biocompatible, highly porous polymer beads that can actively remove toxic substances from blood and other bodily fluids by pore capture and surface adsorption. Its technologies have received non-dilutive grant, contract, and other funding in excess of $18 million from DARPA, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and others. The Company has numerous products under development based upon this unique blood purification technology, protected by 32 issued U.S. patents and multiple applications pending, including CytoSorb-XL, HemoDefend™, VetResQ™, ContrastSorb, DrugSorb, and others.  For more information, please visit the Company’s websites at www.cytosorbents.com and www.cytosorb.com or follow us on Facebook and Twitter Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

June 05, 2017 0444 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:193809 Publish Date: Tue, 30 May 2017 13:23:24 GMT Service: Health Congo approves use of Ebola vaccination to fight outbreak Democratic Republic of Congo's Health Ministry has approved the use of a new Ebola vaccine to counter an outbreak in its northeast that has killed four people, a spokesman said. Quoting Jonathan Simba, a Health Ministry spokesman, reuters.com reported, "The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medicines Sans Frontieres team that is arriving (in Congo) to validate the protocol with the technical teams.” The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and developed by Merck, is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. Congo had registered 52 total suspected cases, including two that have been confirmed, the World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone, adding that the situation appeared to be under control. Simba said that the details of the vaccination campaign would be announced after a meeting of the health ministry and its partners. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in Geneva that vaccination would be deployed should an EVD (Ebola virus disease) laboratory confirmed case be identified outside already defined chains of transmission. Jasarevic said, “In that case, it would be offered to contacts and contacts of contacts of a confirmed EVD case, including healthcare workers and field laboratory Workers.” A vaccination campaign would present logistical challenges in Congo's isolated northeastern forests, including transporting and storing the vaccine in special containers at the required minus 80°C.     KeyWords Congo approves Ebola   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Pregnancy after breast cancer doesn’t raise recurrence risk, finds study Should you eat three big meals or many mini-meals?

Now there’s a Medecins Sans Frontieres team that is arriving [in Congo] today to validate the protocol with the technical teams,” Jonathan Simba, a Health Ministry spokesman, said by telephone. The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and developed by Merck, is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. As of Friday, Congo had registered 52 total suspected cases, including two that have been confirmed, the World Health Organization spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone, adding that the situation appears to be under control. Simba said that the details of the vaccination campaign would be announced after a meeting of the health ministry and its partners set to take place on Monday or Tuesday. A vaccination campaign would present logistical challenges in Congo’s isolated northeastern forests, including transporting and storing the vaccine in special containers at the required minus 80 degrees Celsius.

Request free sample: www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/europe-sleep-aids-mark .. Everyone has trouble sleeping from time to time—stressful life events like having to take a test the next day, or dealing with worries about home or work can keep you from falling asleep or staying asleep. Sleeping problems that happen once or twice a month can be annoying, but usually will resolve on their own. Sleep aids can't replace healthy sleep habits; good sleep practices are the foundation of proper treatment for insomnia. Especially if your insomnia is long-standing, it's important to use non-medical approaches, such as proper sleep hygiene, and cognitive behavioural treatments for insomnia. For some, a combination of medical and behavioural treatments may be the best way to manage insomnia symptoms, and for others a sleep aid is used at the beginning of treatment and behavioural techniques take over as a long-term approach. Some sleep aids are available by prescription only. This is because it's important to work with a doctor to decide on the best type, dose, and plan for taking a sleep aid. Over-the-counter sleep aids work for some people, but it's not a good idea to use these regularly for a long period of time. The best practice is to use a sleep aid with the input of your doctor.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Ligand Announces Aziyo Biologics Acquires Commercial Products from Partner CorMatrix SAN DIEGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: LGND) announces it will receive $10 million from a contractually specified royalty rate buy-down following the sale by CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc. of rights to its commercial pericardial repair and CanGaroo® Envelope extracellular matrix (ECM) products to Aziyo Biologics. In May 2016, Ligand acquired rights to royalties on these products and several pipeline ECM programs from CorMatrix for $17.5 million. Under the terms of the original transaction, Ligand was entitled to a $10 million payment if, upon acquisition, the new owner elected to buy-down the royalty rate. As a result of this transaction, Ligand will receive a 5% royalty on these commercial products from Aziyo, down from the original 20% royalty with CorMatrix. As part of the royalty rate reduction, Aziyo has agreed to pay Ligand up to $10 million of additional sales-based milestones tied to the commercial success of the currently-marketed products and to extend the term on these royalties by one year. Ligand’s rights to potential royalties from CorMatrix upon the successful development of its remaining pipeline ECM programs remain unchanged. “The royalty transaction entered into with CorMatrix last year has been successful in generating cash and has contributed quality shots on goal to our portfolio. CorMatrix made a strategic shift to focus on its pipeline assets, and we are encouraged by the experience and marketing strength of Aziyo’s management team,” said John Higgins, Chief Executive Officer. “This transaction repays the majority of the initial royalty purchase price, adds $10 million of new potential milestones and extends the term for royalties to be earned from the underlying ECM products. Ligand also retains rights to royalties on pipeline products being developed by CorMatrix. Overall, this transaction improves the value of the deal and near-term cash generation.” Financial Outlook As a result of this transaction, Ligand will book an estimated $2 million of additional revenue in 2017, net of offsetting non-cash accounting expenses. Previous net revenue guidance for 2017 was at least $130 million, and Ligand now expects 2017 net revenue to increase to at least $132 million. The additional revenue is expected to be classified as contract revenue and royalty revenue is expected to be slightly lower for the full year due to the lower royalty rate on CorMatrix products beginning with the second half of 2017. Additional upside in contract revenue guidance is reduced from $24 million to $14 million, reflecting the revenue from the royalty rate buy-down and associated amortization. This new revenue guidance implies a minimum adjusted diluted EPS for 2017 of $2.90, increased from original guidance of at least $2.70. About Aziyo Biologics Aziyo Biologics, Inc. was created by HighCape Partners and Tissue Banks International with the mission of restoring health and mobility to the greatest number of patients.

Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements by Ligand that involve risks and uncertainties and reflect Ligand’s judgment as of the date of this release. Words such as “plans,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” and “will,” and similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding: the timing of the $10 million payment related to the buy-down by Aziyo of the royalty rate, which is expected to be paid in full by the end of 2017; the timing of the sales-based milestones; the launch of CorMatrix’s development stage products, if ever; the expected timing of the completion of the transactions; the expected revenues to be generated by the ECM products and the impact on Ligand’s adjusted EPS; future financial and operating results of Ligand; growth in the number of products in Ligand’s portfolio, Ligand’s future revenues and other projected financial measures, expected value creation for shareholders and guidance regarding full-year 2017 and 2018 financial results. Actual events or results may differ from Ligand’s expectations. For example, Aziyo may not make the $10 million milestone payment as expected and may not be successful in commercializing the ECM products it has acquired from CorMatrix. Further, CorMatrix may not be successful in developing its ECM products and may abandon its development. With regards to Ligand’s proforma projections, Ligand may not receive expected revenue from material sales of Captisol, expected royalties on partnered products and research and development milestone payments. Ligand and its partners may not be able to timely or successfully advance any product(s) in its internal or partnered pipeline. In addition, there can be no assurance that Ligand will achieve its guidance for 2017 or 2018 or any portion thereof or beyond; that Ligand will be able to create future revenues and cash flows by developing innovative therapeutics; that results of any clinical study will be timely, favorable or confirmed by later studies, that products under development by Ligand or its partners will receive regulatory approval; that there will be a market for the product(s) if successfully developed and approved; or that Ligand’s partners will not terminate any of its agreements or development or commercialization of any of its products.

Ligand Announces Aziyo Biologics Acquires Commercial Products from Partner CorMatrix Ligand to be paid $10 million from Aziyo in exchange for royalty rate buy-down May 31, 2017 05:35 PM Eastern Daylight Time SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: LGND) announces it will receive $10 million from a contractually specified royalty rate buy-down following the sale by CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc. of rights to its commercial pericardial repair and CanGaroo® Envelope extracellular matrix (ECM) products to Aziyo Biologics. In May 2016, Ligand acquired rights to royalties on these products and several pipeline ECM programs from CorMatrix for $17.5 million. Under the terms of the original transaction, Ligand was entitled to a $10 million payment if, upon acquisition, the new owner elected to buy-down the royalty rate. As a result of this transaction, Ligand will receive a 5% royalty on these commercial products from Aziyo, down from the original 20% royalty with CorMatrix. As part of the royalty rate reduction, Aziyo has agreed to pay Ligand up to $10 million of additional sales-based milestones tied to the commercial success of the currently-marketed products and to extend the term on these royalties by one year. Ligand’s rights to potential royalties from CorMatrix upon the successful development of its remaining pipeline ECM programs remain unchanged. “The royalty transaction entered into with CorMatrix last year has been successful in generating cash and has contributed quality shots on goal to our portfolio. CorMatrix made a strategic shift to focus on its pipeline assets, and we are encouraged by the experience and marketing strength of Aziyo’s management team,” said John Higgins, Chief Executive Officer. “This transaction repays the majority of the initial royalty purchase price, adds $10 million of new potential milestones and extends the term for royalties to be earned from the underlying ECM products. Ligand also retains rights to royalties on pipeline products being developed by CorMatrix. Overall, this transaction improves the value of the deal and near-term cash generation.” Financial Outlook As a result of this transaction, Ligand will book an estimated $2 million of additional revenue in 2017, net of offsetting non-cash accounting expenses. Previous net revenue guidance for 2017 was at least $130 million, and Ligand now expects 2017 net revenue to increase to at least $132 million. The additional revenue is expected to be classified as contract revenue and royalty revenue is expected to be slightly lower for the full year due to the lower royalty rate on CorMatrix products beginning with the second half of 2017. Additional upside in contract revenue guidance is reduced from $24 million to $14 million, reflecting the revenue from the royalty rate buy-down and associated amortization. This new revenue guidance implies a minimum adjusted diluted EPS for 2017 of $2.90, increased from original guidance of at least $2.70.

HHS: Taxpayers May Have Overpaid $1.27 Billion For EpiPens Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share HHS: Taxpayers May Have Overpaid $1.27 Billion For EpiPens Image courtesy of Phillip Bradshaw Updated: June 1, 2017 4:14 pm EDTBy Chris Morran@themorrancave that's a lot of epipens epipen medicaid drug prices generic drugs Even though drug company Mylan agreed to pay $465 million to quickly settle a Justice Department investigation into allegations that it deliberately overcharged Medicaid for its EpiPen emergency allergy injector, a new report from the Department of Health and Human Services indicates that taxpayers may have overpaid more than twice that amount over ten years. Earlier today, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General sent Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley a letter [PDF], estimating that the actual additional cost for EpiPen from 2006 through 2017 could be as high as $1.27 billion. A quick lesson in how Medicaid pays for prescription medications: Drug companies whose products are purchased by Medicaid reimburse the program through mandatory rebates. The rate of those rebates is based on whether the drug is an “innovator” medication (often a newer, higher-cost drug with little or no competition) with a rebate rate of at least 23.1%, or a “non-innovator multiple source” (NIMS) drug (often an older drug with competition from generics), with a much lower rebate rate (currently 13%). Last fall, among rising concerns about Medicaid fraud, the Acting Administrator for the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), confirmed that Mylan had indeed mis-classified EpiPen as a NIMS drug and had been paying rebates that were at least ten percentage points smaller than what the company should have paid, since at least 2011. Mylan did not actually acquire EpiPen until 2007, when it purchased Merck’s generic drug business, so if the OIG’s estimate goes back to 2006, then Mylan may not be responsible for some of that potential $1.27 billion overcharge. Only two days after CMS confirmed the misclassification of EpiPen, and before it could determine the true amount and extent of Mylan’s overcharging, the drug company revealed the $465 million DOJ settlement in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also said the settlement allowed Mylan to avoid admitting any liability or wrongdoing. The settlement, which was never announced publicly by the DOJ and still has not been officially finalized, was heavily criticized on Capitol Hill, and Grassley’s Judiciary Committee asked Mylan to testify about the deal. However, the company declined to appear and explain itself to lawmakers. “The fact that the EpiPen overpayment is so much more than anyone discussed publicly should worry every taxpayer,” said Grassley in a statement, pointing out that CMS had previously advised Mylan about the improper classification of the drug but that the company did nothing to address this issue. “It looks like Mylan overcharged the taxpayers for years with the knowledge EpiPen was misclassified.” Grassley says Mylan has been unwilling to cooperate or to voluntarily provide documents requested by Judiciary. The Senator indicates in his statement that a subpoena may be “the only way to get to the bottom of this.” When reached for comment by Consumerist, a rep for Mylan would only say that the company continues to “work with the government to finalize the settlement as soon as possible.” Originally published May 31, 2017 By Chris Morran@themorrancave that's a lot of epipens epipen medicaid drug prices generic drugs Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related gaming the system Senators Ask DOJ To Investigate Mylan Over Possible EpiPen Medicaid Fraud epi-expensive Report: Defense Department Overpaid $54 Million For EpiPens not quite settled Mylan To Pay $465M To Settle EpiPen Medicaid Pricing Scandal; Critics Call Deal “Inadequate” crime might pay Sen.

Send your hot, dry tips to spage@thinkprogress.org May 31 Exxon shareholders vote to force company to disclose climate risks In a first, the oil and gas giant will be forced to consider risks to its assets as the world moves to a low-carbon future. CREDIT: AP Photo/Mark Humphrey In a surprise victory for climate advocates, 62 percent of Exxon shareholders voted in favor of a resolution requiring the oil and gas giant to report how its business will be affected by global efforts to address climate change and keep warming to below 2ºC (3.6ºF). The vote came at Exxon’s annual meeting Thursday, just hours after it was reported that the United States would likely leave the Paris climate agreement, in which nearly every country has committed to lower emissions in an effort to meet a less-than 2ºC goal. “The need for extractive companies to provide disclosure on the resilience of their portfolios to the transition to a low carbon economy is generally established,” the proposal authors wrote. “This resolution aims to ensure that ExxonMobil fully evaluates and discloses to investors risk to the viability of its assets as a result of the transition to a low carbon economy.” The resolution’s passage was lauded by activist investors, who have been trying for years to get the company to address risk to the company’s assets in the face of global efforts to combat climate change. Last year, none of the four climate-related resolutions passed. Before this year’s vote, new Exxon CEO Darren Woods told shareholders that the board recommended against the resolution but that the company was already considering the impact of climate-related regulations. “We believe the risks of climate change are serious and warrant action — thoughtful action,” Woods said. “As a company, we are taking action in many ways, including in investing in technology.” He said the board “agrees it is important to reflect both policy and technological development in our long-term projections,” before going on to advise against the resolution. Court orders Exxon to hand over documents related to decades of climate misinformation There’s a better way to get information from the oil and gas giant than a Senate deposition of the former CEO.thinkprogress.org Major investment firms reportedly voted against the board and in favor of the resolution. New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, a trustee of the New York Common Retirement Fund which co-sponsored the proxy resolution, called the win “an unprecedented victory.” “Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil,” DiNapoli said in a statement. Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face Exxon has come under fire — and is currently under investigation by two state attorneys general — for failing to disclose what it knew about climate risk as far back as the 1970s and for funding public campaigns to sow doubt about the reality of climate change. The company’s former CEO Rex Tillerson has been implicated in the investigation. Thursday’s climate resolution was presented by Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England, which manages the Church of England’s endowments. Mason called out members of the board by name —including former CEOs of Johnson and Johnson, Merck, and Xerox, all of which have made climate commitments. “Members of the board, do you leave your understanding of climate change at the door when you attend an ExxonMobil board meeting?” Mason asked. Another climate resolution, on methane emissions, was presented by another person of faith, Sister Patricia Daly, a longtime activist investor at Exxon. She said there is “an incredible moral imperative” to bringing energy access to those who live in energy poverty, but to do so in way that doesn’t jeopardize long-term climate stability. The resolution to disclose methane leaks only received 38.7 percent of the vote. The resolutions brought out some well known anti-climate advocates. Steve Milloy, the author of a site called Junk Science, spoke during the comments section of the meeting. Calling the issue a “climate hoax,” Milloy said that people like him were responsible for putting President Trump in office and criticized Exxon for kowtowing to climate activists. “My message to Exxon management is this: Stop aiding and abetting the enemies of your shareholders,” he said. Milloy also criticized Woods’ support of the global agreement to curb warming, calling it the “economically suicidal Paris accord.” Tillerson, now serving as Trump’s Secretary of State, has also said he supports the Paris climate agreement. Despite this, it has been widely reported that the Trump administration will pull the United States out of the global agreement.

Growing prevalence of animal diseases, various government agencies and animal associations; continuous innovations, increasing awareness against the use of antimicrobials is driving the vaccine producers to invest significantly into development of new products, rising incidences of zoonotic diseases in humans; increasing investments by leading players.

and by Region - Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecasts (20162021)   Browse And Choose From Our World Class Research Reports (EMAILWIRE.COM, May 31, 2017 ) According to the report  Middle-East & Africa Veterinary Vaccines Market , published by Market Data Forecast, the Middle-East & Africa market projected to reach USD 455.17 Million by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.48% from 2016 to 2021 Veterinary Vaccines are important and, at times, control of a given animal disease or essential tools for prevention, but they require complementary actions like investment for diagnostic, enabling legislation, early response, public communication etc. The growing demand for livestock products (increased urbanization, fueled by population growth, and greater purchasing power of individuals in developing or middle- income countries) coupled with the necessity of complying with the standards of trade agreements, mean that governments in the Middle-East & Africa region must improve animal health in their countries. Free sample of the report is available at http://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/middle-east-and-africa-veterinary-vaccines-market-84/request-sample Veterinary vaccine market has shown significant raise in recent years which can be attributed to growing incidences of animal pandemics in the region. Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia is endemic in numerous areas of Africa, and is suspected to occur occasionally in the Middle East. Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an insect-borne, multi-species zoonotic viral disease of livestock has been exclusively conﬁned to the African continent, but it began spreading to Middle-East in the past decade. This leads to estimation of further growth in the market in terms of livestock vaccine sales. However, regional and International collaboration has proven successful in the progressive control of these pandemics, e.g. the work of the Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Centre in South America and the European Union FMD Commission which this region lacks. It makes adoption of regulations that much harder in the area. Increasing maintenance costs for the storage of vaccines, raising adoption of vegetarian diet in key economies owing to increasing risk of obesity and other chronic diseases are major constraints of this market.

AlphaGo beat the Chinese champion in each of the games at the Future of Go Summit, including one by the closest margin possible, half a point. DeepMind, the London-based firm behind the program, will now develop a teaching tool using AlphaGo’s analysis of Go positions. Researchers behind the program will also concentrate on developing advanced general algorithms, such as those that could help to find cures for diseases, said the Google-owned company. Peer review immortalized in concrete A Russian university unveiled the world’s first monument to peer review on 26 May. The 1.5‑tonne tribute (pictured) at the Higher School of Economics (HSE) in Moscow consists of a derelict concrete block fashioned into a die, displaying on its five visible sides the possible results of review — ‘Accept’, ‘Minor Changes’, ‘Major Changes’, ‘Revise and Resubmit’ and ‘Reject’. The director of the HSE’s Institute of Education asked his faculty last year for ideas about how to turn the block into something meaningful. A suggestion by HSE sociologist Igor Chirikov to turn it into a ‘monument to an anonymous peer reviewer’ struck a chord, gathering US$2,500 in funding from an Internet campaign. The work is also carved with the titles of 21 papers, most by the researchers who made the largest contributions to the campaign. Dari Drozhzhina Private launch pad Aerospace company Rocket Lab of Huntington Beach, California, sent its Electron rocket into suborbital space on 25 May from New Zealand’s North Island — the world’s first orbital-class launch from a private facility, and the first such launch from the island nation. The rocket did not make it all the way to orbit as planned. As a relatively small vehicle, it is intended to put payloads of up to 150 kilograms into orbit. Rocket Lab hopes to provide commercial launch services for Earth-imaging and space-exploration companies. Copyright trial A Colombian biologist who endured a criminal trial for posting another scientist’s thesis online has been cleared of copyright violation — an offence that, under Colombia’s strict rights laws, could have been punishable by up to eight years in prison. In 2011, Diego Gómez Hoyos uploaded a scientist’s 2006 thesis on amphibian taxonomy to the document-sharing network Scribd, hoping to help fellow students. But two years later, he was notified that the author of the thesis was suing him, beginning a lengthy trial. Gómez, who is 29 years old, was handed down his not-guilty verdict on 24 May by a judge in Bogotá; the prosecutor in the case has appealed the decision. SPACE Mars crash report The European Space Agency (ESA) Mars test lander Schiaparelli crashed last October as a result of conflicting information in the craft’s on-board computer, an independent investigation commissioned by the agency has concluded. The craft — designed to test European landing technology — crashed into Mars at a speed of around 540 kilometres per hour. The inquiry found that the problem originated when a rotation sensor exceeded its maximum capability, leading software to incorrectly estimate the craft’s orientation. Combined with radar measurements, this caused the computer to calculate that it was below ground level and to abort its deceleration procedure when it was still 3.7 km from the surface. The agency would “take the lessons learned” in preparing for the ExoMars 2020 rover mission, said David Parker, ESA’s director of human space flight and robotic exploration, in a statement. Jupiter up close NASA’s Juno spacecraft has revealed Jupiter as a much more complex and mysterious planet than researchers had thought. Beginning with the first of its close fly-bys last August, Juno found clusters of storms around Jupiter’s north and south poles; a plume of ammonia gas welling up from within the planet’s depths; and a magnetic field both stronger and more patchy than models had predicted. Early results also suggest that Jupiter has a large but poorly defined core of heavy elements. The findings appear in a suite of papers published last week in Science and in Geophysical Research Letters. See go.nature.com/2r5yrum for a full list of papers. PEOPLE New WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a public-health expert from Ethiopia, will be the next director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) — the agency’s first chief to hail from Africa. Tedros won a 23 May vote by WHO member states and will take up the post on 1 July for a five-year term, succeeding Margaret Chan. He has previously served as Ethiopia’s health minister and foreign minister, and takes the helm in troubled times: the WHO’s core budget — its contributions from its members — is falling, and the agency has been criticized for its complex, bureaucratic and ineffective management structure. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty FACILITIES LHC fires up again Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) began collecting data again on 23 May, kicking off the third operating run since the machine started up in 2009. The LHC at CERN, Europe’s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, is the world’s most powerful accelerator; it had been closed for technical upgrades since December. In 2017, engineers hope to achieve the same number of proton–proton collisions as they did in 2016 — a record 7 quadrillion (1015) — although over a slightly shorter period. The experiments will study known particles as well as searching for rare and new phenomena beyond the standard model of particle physics. POLITICS US science budget US President Donald Trump released a revised budget plan on 23 May that would slash science spending across the federal government in 2018. His planned cuts include 18% at the National Institutes of Health and 30% at the Environmental Protection Agency. PHARMACEUTICALS Biomarker drugs The US Food and Drug Administration on 23 May issued its first approval of a cancer drug that targets tumours with specific genetic mutations, or ‘biomarkers’, regardless of where in the body the tumour first took root. The agency previously required individual approvals for a drug to be deployed in different tumour locations, even if its use was linked to a specific marker. The new approach allows a compound called pembrolizumab to be used in any solid tumour that has a particular defect in its ability to repair damaged DNA. The compound is made by Merck of Kenilworth, New Jersey. ENERGY Methane cuts The Canadian government announced regulations on 25 May to curb methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. The proposal would require the industry to reduce leaks and minimize venting during production and transportation, and is a step towards Canada’s pledge to cut methane emissions by 40–45% by 2025, compared with 2012 levels. Methane accounts for roughly 15% of the country’s greenhouse-gas emissions, and its oil and gas sector is responsible for nearly half of the total. The rules would be phased in from 2020, although environmentalists are pushing for an earlier start date. TREND WATCH The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is on track to have a bumper year for new drug approvals. It has already approved 21 drugs in 2017, nearing the 2016 total of 22. That number was unusually small — less than half of the 2015 total — and sparked concerns about the pharmaceutical industry’s new-drug pipelines. This year’s rebound, and the appointment of FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb last month, could put those fears to rest. Gottlieb has pledged to speed up drug approvals.

The fixed dose combination of integrase strand inhibitor bictegravir with the two active ingredients in Descovy - emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide - met its main objective of non-inferiority to ViiV Healthcare's Triumeq, which contains rival integrase Tivicay (dolutegravir) as well as abacavir and lamivudine. Two studies pitted the two drug combinations head to head, while another two found patients were able to switch from ViiV's drug to Gilead's with no loss of viral suppression. Detailed data from the studies will be reported later in the year. The new data represents an opportunity for Gilead to stage a comeback in the HIV category, where it has been losing market share to ViiV due to the success of Tivicay and Triumeq, which grew more than 80% to reach £2.7bn ($3.5bn) in sales last year. The strong uptake of ViiV's drugs comes on the back of what is viewed as a superior profile for dolutegravir compared to Gilead's current integrase inhibitor elvitegravir - found in its Genvoya and Stribild products - which needs to be boosted with cobicistat. With bictegravir Gilead reckons it can get back on to firmer footing, and the company says it plans to quickly move forward with a US filing this quarter and a European application next quarter, claiming the new combination "represents an important advance in triple-therapy treatment for a broad range of HIV patients". Analysts at Leerink agree. They are predicting sales of $10bn thanks to the combination's "convenience, safety and tolerability and efficacy", and they also think Gilead will use an FDA priority review voucher to get the drug to market in the US as quickly as possible. Gilead needs a win at the moment due to sales of its hepatitis C blockbusters starting to slide as the available pool of eligible patients gets smaller, as well as combination from other drugs developed by the likes of AbbVie and Merck & Co. Descovy was cleared by regulators in the US and EU last year for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and children aged 12 and older, and forms the backbone of Gilead's new generation of HIV drugs. The drug is an upgrade to Truvada, which combined emtricitabine with an older and less potent tenofovir salt (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) that is heading for patent expiry. The combination of TAF - which is considered a best-in-class non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor - and bictegravir are key to Gilead's fightback against an encroaching ViiV in HIV, according to analysts at Cowen & Co. The firm cites HIV consultants who have suggested that even if bictegravir is deemed to be equivalent to ViiV's dolutegravir in terms of both efficacy and safety, then bictegravir plus Descovy will become their go-to regimen.

The drugs combined in the single dosage form contributes to the synergistic effects claimed by each of the drug. The number of doses of the single dose therapy can be increased or decreased, but the therapy does not involving altering of API proportion in the dosage form. These are administered in the form of a vial, capsules, tablets or patch. Single-dose therapy market can be segmented based on disease indication, application, distribution channel, and geography. Based on disease indication, the market can be segmented into cancer, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, neurological disorders, psychological disorders, and microbial infections, among others. On the basis of application, single-dose therapy market can be segmented into human health and animal health. Hospitals, ambulatory centers, clinics, and pharmacies form the major distribution channels for the market. Based on geography, the market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa. Obtain Report Details: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/single-dose-therapy-ma… Increasing demand due to the synergistic effects provided by the combined fixed dose API’s administered as a single dose is the major driver for the single-dose therapy market. Further, the simpler treatment regime, convenience of administration, and the cost saving offered by single-dose therapy are also expected to drive the market growth. Additional benefits include the combined pharmacokinetics of the component drugs employed in the single dose, and enhanced medication compliance. However, the dosage of the APIs in the single-dose cannot be modified according to the patient requirements, which might negatively impact the growth of the market. In addition, the adverse side effects caused by the component drugs, the allergic reactions from any of the component drugs in the single dose therapy cannot be avoided, which might have an impact on the patient health, and a negative effect on the market growth. Also, the growing over-the-counter sale of various non-approved fixed dose combinations administered as single dose, would adversely affect the market. The increasing incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and various forms of cancer in all the geographies would drive the demand for single-dose therapies and contribute to the growth of the market. Geographically, North America is the largest market for single-dose therapy, followed by Europe. The growing geriatric population, and increased focus on research and development of effective single dose therapies has been driving the use of single-dose therapies. In addition, the growing FDA approvals of new single-dose therapies would contribute to the growth of the market. For instance, in November 2015, the U.S. FDA approved Genvoya, a single dosage form of various combination drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

Meet the Contributors → On ASCO’s Eve, Experts Fret Over Backlash to Cancer Combo Frenzy Ben Fidler May 30th, 2017 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  When thousands of cancer researchers from around the world gather in Chicago this weekend for the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting, drugs that fight tumors by boosting a patient’s immune system will take center stage, as they have in previous years. But the stage is more crowded, as researchers have begun in earnest combining these immunotherapies into experimental cocktails, hoping to push quickly past the limits of the drugs currently in use as single agents. With the frenzy to test combinations, some of immunotherapy’s biggest champions now worry that the field is moving too fast; that studies are not being designed with enough care; and that the glut of combination trials—some estimates put the number north of 1,000 at the moment—is bound to provoke a backlash. Companies are committing huge sums of money to big clinical studies “based literally on [earlier] 20-patient results, because the field is so competitive,” says Drew Pardoll, the director of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. With such flimsy foundations, says Pardoll, “my concern is that the ratio of trials that fail to the ratio of trials that succeed is going to be too high, and there will be a lot of pullback in investment. And that will result in the baby being thrown out with the bathwater.” This concern comes from a true believer. In the same interview, Pardoll says, “I’m convinced that overall we can at least double the number of cancer patients that immunotherapy can capture” with combinations. Others are sounding similar alarms. “Cancer immunotherapy has its own rules that are different from the rules of normal physics,” says James Sabry, Genentech’s senior vice president of partnering. Genentech and its parent Roche are deeply invested in immunotherapy. Their drug atezolizumab (Tecentriq) has already been approved for certain bladder and lung cancers and is currently part of at least 50 combination trials, according to clinicaltrials.gov. Immunotherapy “is going to come back down to reality,” Sabry says. To be sure, any new promising biomedical field will attract over-speculation by investors and a rush to capitalize by researchers and developers. And immunotherapy is promising, by any measure. Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which disrupt “checkpoint” proteins that tumors use to hide from the immune system, are changing the way a few cancers are treated. Six of these drugs have been approved for skin, lung, bladder, and other cancers, and in some cases they’ve produced uncharacteristically long-lasting results for patients at death’s door. They’ve already produced billions of dollars in revenue—the two leaders, nivolumab (Opdivo, from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY)) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda, from Merck (NYSE: MRK)) generated about $2.7 billion combined in 2016—with billions more at stake. But a majority of patients still don’t respond to them. In the rush to solve those puzzles, some see familiar patterns. At last year’s ASCO meeting, Anthony Tolcher, the director of clinical research at South Texas Accelerated Research Therapeutics, wondered about “a worrisome bubble.” He compared immunotherapy’s early success to that of cisplatin chemotherapy in the 1970s, which after an initial breakthrough was followed by “incremental improvements” over many years. Independent investor Brad Loncar is so bullish on immunotherapy he created the world’s first index fund for the field: the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (NASDAQ: CNCR). He isn’t fazed by the bubble talk. There will be high profile failures, just as there have been with single-agent programs, but he doesn’t think “bad results will chill future investment,” he says. With several kinds of immunotherapy making progress, such as live T cells and vaccines, “the underlying science is too promising to not get funded.” Promising science has a way of smacking into unexpected obstacles of biology, however. Despite recent advances, researchers are only scratching the surface of the complexity of the human immune system—and how it interacts with tumors that have their own genetic complexities and survival mechanisms. While large companies can afford to run a massive number of trials and deal with a few failures along the way, smaller biotechs vying for their attention have to think more strategically. Take Cambridge, MA, biotech Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, which is testing a drug, CMP-001, in combination with pembrolizumab. Mike Powell, a general partner at Sofinnova Partners and a Checkmate investor, says the company is trying CMP-001 in melanoma patients who are failing treatment with pembrolizumab because that trial is a “really tough test” and turning these patients’ disease around isn’t easy. “But when you see it, you know it is your drug doing it,” Powell says. The only FDA-approved immunotherapy combination so far—two Bristol drugs, ipiliumab (Yervoy, which blocks the protein CTLA-4) and nivolumab (which inhibits PD-1)—provided a modest survival benefit for melanoma patients over nivolumab alone with significantly more safety problems, including side effects that were unexpected—such as the onset of diabetes. There are other examples: Patients developed … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Ben Fidler is Xconomy's Deputy Biotechnology Editor.

The accord, confirmed by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston, will resolve a lawsuit against the pharmacy operator filed in 2007 by two former employees of drugmaker Organon USA Inc on behalf of the federal government and various states. CVS in a statement said the alleged conduct at issue took place before it acquired Omnicare in 2015. Omnicare neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The lawsuit claimed that from 1999 to 2005, Omnicare and certain pharmacies it acquired sought and received kickbacks from Organon in the form of discounts in exchange for promoting the antidepressants Remeron and Remeron SolTabs. The lawsuit said that as a result, Omnicare violated the False Claims Act by submitting kickback-tainted claims to Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, for reimbursement. The lawsuit was filed by Richard Templin and James Banigan, both of whom were former employees of Organon, which reached a related $31 million settlement in 2014. Organon, originally based in the Netherlands, was acquired in 2007 by Schering-Plough Corp, which later merged with Merck & Co Inc. Under the False Claims Act, whistleblowers can sue companies on the government's behalf to recover taxpayer money paid out based on fraudulent claims. If successful, whistleblowers receive a percentage of the recovery. While the U.S. Justice Department can intervene in such lawsuits, in this case, the U.S. government and the 28 states named in the complaint declined to intervene, leaving the ex-Organon employees to pursue it on their own. Joel Androphy, a lawyer for Templin and Banigan, called the settlement "a fair resolution for all concerned." According to settlement papers, Omnicare agreed to pay the federal government more than $12.8 million and nearly $10.2 pursuant to state settlement agreements. The federal government in turn has agreed to pay nearly $3.73 million to Templin and Banigan. The case is U.S. ex rel. Banigan and Templin, et al, v. Organon USA Inc, et al, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 07-cv-12153.

Login Register Public Release: 30-May-2017 Penn studies show hope for multiple cancers with pembrolizumab combination therapies New research will be presented at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Share  Print  E-Mail IMAGE: Dr. Tara Gangadhar. view more  Credit: Penn Medicine PHILADELPHIA - The combination of pembrolizumab and the checkpoint inhibitor known as epacadostat is leading to promising responses and is generally well tolerated in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, and several other cancers, according to researchers from the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Their findings also showed that adding pembrolizumab to standard therapies for breast cancer improved the number of patients achieving a pathological complete response. The results of these combination therapy studies will be presented at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in Chicago. Pembrolizumab is an intravenous drug that targets the programmed cell death (PD-1) receptor - a protein that weakens the body's immune response by suppressing T-cell production. The drug was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma in 2014, and trials testing its use for other cancers are ongoing. As part of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, researchers from Penn and other institutions gave patients the drug in combination with epacadostat, an indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor. The drug functions in a similar way to pembrolizumab by boosting T-cell production, but it's taken orally and targets a different protein. It's specifically designed to switch off IDO1, an immunosuppressive enzyme associated with tumor progression and shortened survival for patients. Researchers broke down the results by cancer type and analyzed the outcomes, including: Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma (Abstract #4503) Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (Abstract #6010) Non-small cell lung cancer (Abstract #9014) Triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer (Abstract #1103) Advanced renal cell cancers (Abstract #4515) They also looked at the drug's general safety across multiple tumor types (Abstract #3012). "In each patient group, the combination did not add any significant increase in side effects compared to what patients experience with the PD-1 inhibitor alone," said Tara Gangadhar, MD, an assistant professor of Hematology Oncology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who led five of the new analyses. Separate research looked at the combination of pembrolizumab with standard treatments prior to surgery for patients with high-risk breast cancer (Abstract #506). As part of the multi-institutional I-SPY 2 trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel with or without the PD-1 inhibitor. The addition of pembrolizomab tripled the pathologic complete response rate in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, with 15 of 21 responding (71.4 percent) compared to 16 of 83 (19.3 percent) in the control group. The rate doubled in patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer, with 7 of 25 responding (28 percent) compared to 13 of 88 in the control (14.8 percent). "This is incredibly exciting news for patients with aggressive cancers and the beginning of generating new and better curative options at diagnosis," said Angela DeMichele, MD, MSCE, the Alan and Jill Miller Professor in Breast Cancer Excellence in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Chair of Trial Operations for the study. DeMichele also noted that this trial uncovered new, previously unrecognized side effects of pembrolizumab. Four patients experienced adrenal insufficiency while another had hypophysitis - an inflammation of the pituitary gland. "These findings reflect a growing body of knowledge about how these drugs interact with the immune system that will lead to safer use of PD-1 inhibitors in future studies," DeMichele said. The Abramson Cancer Center is leading a new trial investigating pembrolizumab in head and neck cancer patients who are at high risk for recurrence or those with low-volume residual disease. Joshua Bauml, MD, an assistant professor of Hematology Oncology, is the principal investigator of the multi-site trial, which is currently enrolling patients. He will present an overview at the upcoming ASCO meeting (Abstract #TPS6095). "PD-1 inhibitors have already been shown to be effective in recurrent and metastatic head and neck cancer, but we want to specifically look at patients who have curable disease but are at risk for relapse," Bauml said. "In patients who have undergone front-line treatments, the standard approach calls for observation. We want to know if giving them this inhibitor can be an effective way to take an active role in preventing relapse." ### Gangadhar's research was supported by Incyte Corporation. Bauml's trial is funded by Merck, which manufactures pembrolizumab. Penn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care. Penn Medicine consists of the Raymond and Ruth Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (founded in 1765 as the nation's first medical school) and the University of Pennsylvania Health System, which together form a $6.7 billion enterprise. The Perelman School of Medicine has been ranked among the top five medical schools in the United States for the past 20 years, according to U.S. News & World Report's survey of research-oriented medical schools. The School is consistently among the nation's top recipients of funding from the National Institutes of Health, with $392 million awarded in the 2016 fiscal year. The University of Pennsylvania Health System's patient care facilities include: The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Presbyterian Medical Center -- which are recognized as one of the nation's top "Honor Roll" hospitals by U.S. News & World Report -- Chester County Hospital; Lancaster General Health; Penn Wissahickon Hospice; and Pennsylvania Hospital -- the nation's first hospital, founded in 1751. Additional affiliated inpatient care facilities and services throughout the Philadelphia region include Good Shepherd Penn Partners, a partnership between Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network and Penn Medicine. Penn Medicine is committed to improving lives and health through a variety of community-based programs and activities. In fiscal year 2016, Penn Medicine provided $393 million to benefit our community.

We want to know if giving them this inhibitor can be an effective way to take an active role in preventing relapse.” Gangadhar’s research was supported by Incyte Corporation. Bauml’s trial is funded by Merck, which manufactures pembrolizumab.     ### Penn Medicine is one of the world’s leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.

Request free sample: http://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/europe-sleep-aids-market-1792/request-sample Everyone has trouble sleeping from time to timestressful life events like having to take a test the next day, or dealing with worries about home or work can keep you from falling asleep or staying asleep. Sleeping problems that happen once or twice a month can be annoying, but usually will resolve on their own. Sleep aids can't replace healthy sleep habits; good sleep practices are the foundation of proper treatment for insomnia. Especially if your insomnia is long-standing, it's important to use non-medical approaches, such as proper sleep hygiene, and cognitive behavioural treatments for insomnia. For some, a combination of medical and behavioural treatments may be the best way to manage insomnia symptoms, and for others a sleep aid is used at the beginning of treatment and behavioural techniques take over as a long-term approach. Some sleep aids are available by prescription only. This is because it's important to work with a doctor to decide on the best type, dose, and plan for taking a sleep aid. Over-the-counter sleep aids work for some people, but it's not a good idea to use these regularly for a long period of time. The best practice is to use a sleep aid with the input of your doctor.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Tropical Spastic Paraparesis Market: Technological Advancements & Global Outlook 2024 Tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) also called as HTLV-1–associated myelopathy (HAM) is a type of tropical myeloneuropathies caused by the human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV-1). Although initially described in tropical countries, TSP has also been found in temperate regions such as southern Japan. HTLV-1 virus belongs to the Retroviridae family, and preferentially infects CD4 lymphoid cells. The virus has been known to cause certain kinds of leukemia and lymphoma and is transmitted through exposure to infected blood, sexual contact, and use of illegal intravenous drugs. As the virus is also known to spread through breast milk, mothers infected with HTLV-1 virus must avoid breast feeding. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/tropical-spastic-parap… According to an article published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology in 2012, the HTLV-1 virus is prevalent in certain regions including the Southwestern part of Japan, sub-Saharan Africa and South America, the Caribbean area, and certain areas of Middle East and Australo-Melanesia. The study also estimates that 5 million to 10 million individuals have been affected globally with HTLV1 virus, however various other publications estimate the global prevalence of 10 million to 20 million. HTLV-1-associated myelopathy mostly affects the spinal cord, and results in an upper motor neurone syndrome, that usually affects lower limbs. Spastic paraparesis or paraplegia is the main characteristic of the infection. Tropical spastic paraparesis results in demyelination, inflammation and necrotic lesions in spinal cord. The progressive disease is associated with degeneration of neurons in the spinal cord, and results in gradual paralysis of the lower limbs. Other rare symptoms include optic atrophy, reduced ankle reflex and cranial nerve lesions. An article published in journal Revue Neurologique in 2012, more than 90% of the tropical spastic paraparesis cases, the neurological features involved urinary bladder disturbance, spasticity and/or hyperreflexia of the lower extremities, and lower extremity muscle weakness. Various immunoassay kits are available for diagnosis of HTLV-1 virus. Companies manufacturing such diagnostic kits include MP Biomedicals LLC, Fujirebio, Inc., Quest Diagnostics, DiaSorin S.p.A. Although the disease cannot be cured completely, medications are available for management of symptoms. Corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone are prescribed to decrease the inflammation of the spinal cord, while pain is treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Make an Enquiry @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Symptoms of urinary dysfunction can be treated by prescribing darifenacin, oxybutynin, tamsulosin, terazosin, and other drugs which reduce the activity of bladder muscles. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is currently conducting phase I clinical trials for Hu MiK-Beta-1. The investigational drug is monoclonal antibody directed toward IL-2/IL-15R-Beta Subunit which blocks IL-15 action. Washington University School of Medicine in association with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. is also conducting phase II trials for Raltegravir. Various other institutes are also conducting research programs for discovering new and effective treatment options for Tropical spastic paraparesis. Scientists have also tried antiretroviral agents for treatment of HTLV-1 infections. Gradual progress in the research activities is expected to launch more treatment drugs and expand the market in the future. Due to low and restricted geographical prevalence of the disease, the market for tropical spastic paraparesis is small. Government initiative for increasing awareness of the disease and its available treatment may curb the spread of infections. Lack of sufficient information on geographical prevalence, and epidemiology has restricted the research activities. These factors will also be responsible for a slower global market growth.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Anticoagulants Market to Witness Steady Expansion by 2021 Anticoagulants are used to eliminate the risk of blood clots in the body. Blood clots are formed when platelets stick together and proteins in the blood bind together to form a solid mass. Generally, blood clots play an important role in stopping external bleeding caused by any injury to the skin. However, when blood clots form in the blood vessels, they can be dangerous as they can block blood circulation. Blood clots in arteries or the heart can obstruct blood flow and cause a heart attack. Such clots in blood vessels in the brain can cause a stroke. Anticoagulants stop the platelets from adhering to one another and clotting proteins from binding together. These are commonly used in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, and managing high and moderate risk of stroke. To get the view of full report @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/anticoa… Anticoagulants are mainly categorized as herapins, warfarin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), factor Xa inhibitors, and direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs). Heparin is an injectable anticoagulant widely used in hospitals for rapid anticoagulation. LMWHs are administered about twice a day as subcutaneous injections to treat DVT. These are more convenient to use than heparins, as LMWHs can be self injected at home. Warfarin is usually prescribed as part of long-term anticoagulant therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation to help reduce the risk of stroke by more than 60%. The global anticoagulants market is categorized based on various types of anticoagulant drugs and applications. Based on types of anticoagulants, the report covers Betrixaban, Dabigatran (Pradaxa), Edoxaban, Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and Eliquis (Apixaban). The application segment is further sub segmented into cardiovascular diseases, coronary artery diseases, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, DVT, and heart valve replacement. A sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/4090 In terms of geography, North America dominates the global anticoagulants market. This is due to increased awareness about therapeutic applications of anticoagulants in disease management in the region. The U.S. represents the largest market for anticoagulants in North America, followed by Canada. In Europe, Germany, France and the U.K. hold major shares of the anticoagulants market. The anticoagulant market in Asia too, is expected to show high growth rates in the next five years. This is because a lot of companies are setting up manufacturing facilities in the region. Moreover, the growing population is also driving the growth of the market in the region. India, China, and Japan are expected to be the fastest growing markets for anticoagulants in Asia. The increasing aging population is a key driver for the global anticoagulants market. Also, increasing investment in R&D in the pharmaceutical sector and the introduction of innovative oral anticoagulants drugs have fueled the growth of this market. However, stringent regulations set by various governments hamper the growth of the global anticoagulants market. Moreover, risk of side-effects and complications associated with the usage of oral anticoagulants also hinders growth of the global anticoagulants market. Increasing number of mergers and acquisitions of drug manufacturing companies is a key trend of the global anticoagulants market.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Wednesday that it could not recommend routine use of the medicine in newly diagnosed patients, given the drug's high cost and uncertainties about overall survival benefits. But the agency backed Keytruda use within the Cancer Drugs Fund, signalling that it had the potential to satisfy the criteria for routine use on the National Health Service (NHS) for this group of patients but needs more investigation. The decision follows data presented at a medical meeting last year showing that Keytruda could help lung cancer patients whose tumours have a high level of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. Keytruda is already approved as a cost-effective second-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have previously taken chemotherapy but no longer respond. MSD, as Merck is known outside North America, has agreed to provide Keytruda to the NHS at an undisclosed discount.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE As Novartis considers asset sales that could raise $50 billion, investors are worried any cash raised may give the Swiss drugmaker firepower for another unsuccessful megadeal. Novartis's $52 billion takeover of U.S.-based eye care giant Alcon, completed in 2011, saddled it with a business whose sales and profit have faltered two years running. Now, Chief Executive Joe Jimenez is reviewing Alcon's surgical devices and contact lens businesses, suggesting they could be valued at $25-$35 billion if he unloads them. The American CEO is also considering disposal of a roughly $14 billion stake in cross-town rival Roche, as well as his over-the-counter (OTC) drugs venture with GlaxoSmithKline , worth some $10 billion. Given Alcon missteps, however, investors are wary about arming Novartis with a pile of cash, for fear managers eager to refocus on cancer drugs as they address a sales hit from patent expiries might blunder into a big takeover. "We would applaud selling those stakes, generally," said Stephen Anness of Invesco Perpetual, Novartis's 23rd largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. "But what do you do with that money?" Anness said. "I would be very cautious about selling stakes...in things to raise a war-chest to go and do a massive deal, only for that deal to go and be another poor deal." To be sure, Jimenez has said Novartis's M&A focus remains on smaller transactions, including lower-risk drug licensing deals, ranging up to $5 billion. Still, Jimenez has not dismissed the notion of a larger transaction. He suggested last year the Roche stake - amassed during former chairman and CEO Daniel Vasella's unrequited merger aspirations two decades ago - could be sold once another, potentially more significant transaction is lined up to absorb the proceeds. "We're always monitoring what's going on but have not changed our position regarding our M&A strategy or potential disposals," Novartis spokesman Michael Willi told Reuters. Novartis, which is holding a two-day investor event in Boston yesterday and today, has portfolio holes a major deal could help fill. Where rivals including Roche, Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb have immuno-oncology drugs (I-O) on the market for a range of cancers, Novartis has only investigational molecules in this hot new therapy area. Speculation that Novartis might buy AstraZeneca sparked a brief jump in the British company's stock last year. There has also been talk of its interest in Bristol-Myers.

Dr. Eric G. Mortensen will start in his new job June 1, the company said. From 2014 to 2016, he had been vice president and therapeutic area clinical head for inflammation and immunology at Pfizer, leading its global, late-stage development organization for programs in inflammatory diseases. “Dr. Mortensen has led clinical development of key programs for some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world,” CEO Dr. Phillip Chan said in a prepared statement. “… He brings more than two decades of proven and successful clinical trial development expertise to the company, as well as a wealth of knowledge and experience in immunology, inflammation and clinical medicine.” He replaces Dr. Robert H. Bartlett, who is retiring, but will continue on as a company consultant, as well as co-chair of the cardiac surgery advisory board, through the CytoSorb product’s next anticipated cardiac surgery trial, Refresh 2. “For nearly nine years, Dr. Bartlett has served as chief medical officer of CytoSorbents, and has helped guide the company through multiple key clinical studies, including the successfully completed Refresh 1 cardiac surgery trial, our European Union approval of CytoSorb and commercialization of CytoSorb worldwide,” Chan said. “A trusted adviser, an experienced and practiced clinician and a legend in the field of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, we are pleased to continue working with Dr. Bartlett on a consulting basis.” Mortensen has also held executive positions with Xeljanz and Enbrel, as well as working on clinical programs and studies at GlaxoSmithKline and Merck Research Laboratories. “CytoSorbents is at an exciting phase in the clinical and scientific validation of its unique immunotherapy approach, and I am eager to contribute my significant clinical development experience to advance this important technology,” he said in a statement.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman U.S. and China Asthma and COPD Drugs Market Analysis and Forecast, By Indication 2024 U.S. and China Asthma and COPD Drugs Market: Snapshot The U.S. and China market for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) drugs is expected to exhibit growth at a steady pace in the next few years. Factors such as a significant rise prevalence of COPD and asthma in these two countries, advancements in diagnostic methods, and rising awareness among patients regarding the available treatment methods are considered key to the overall growth of the market over the period 2016–2024. This 101 page report gives readers a comprehensive overview of the U.S. and China Asthma and COPD Drugs Market. Browse through 7 data tables and 30 figures to unlock the hidden opportunities in this market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/us-china-asthma-copd-d… The market is expected to exhibit growth at a moderate pace in the first few years of the forecast period, chiefly owing to the patent expiries of leading drugs and the subsequent price erosion. However, the market is expected to witness new drug candidates by 2020, which will help the market tread along a better growth path in the forthcoming years. Transparency Market Research estimates that the market will exhibit a 4.1% CAGR from 2016 through 2024, rising to a valuation of US$18.7 bn by 2024 from US$13.0 bn in 2015. Combination Drugs Sales to Constitute Bulk of Revenue On the basis of drug classes in the U.S. and China asthma and COPD drugs market, the report examines the future scope of growth for varieties such as bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and combination drugs. Of these, the segment of combination drugs is presently the leading segment. It accounted for a 54% of the U.S. and China asthma and COPD drugs market in 2015 and is expected to continue to dominate throughout the report’s forecast period. Combination drugs benefit from the recommendations from agencies such as Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), which regard combination drugs as the safer course of managing asthma and COPD. The segment of monoclonal antibodies is expected to emerge as a prominent drug class for the management of asthma and COPD in the next few years. Emergence of new drug candidates in this segment will bolster its growth potential in the market during the report’s forecast period. High Costs of Asthma and COPD Drugs and Consumer Awareness make U.S. the Clear Leader In the U.S. and China market for asthma and COPD drugs, the U.S. market clearly dominates, accounting for a more than 81% of the overall market in 2016. The key factors to have benefitted the U.S. market, despite it being a relatively smaller market in terms of population, include the high costs of asthma and COPD drugs and a high level of attentiveness paid by consumers to healthcare and wellness. The U.S. market also contributes significantly to the overall asthma and COPD drugs market through regular product launches and high investments by leading companies for R&D in the areas of combination therapies and biologics. Although China presently accounts for a relatively smaller share in the U.S. and China asthma and COPD drugs market, the country is expected to present attractive growth opportunities in the next few years. The China market for asthma and COPD drugs will exhibit an impressive 10% CAGR over the period between 2016 and 2024. The key factors attributable to this projection are the rising number of asthma patients, owing chiefly to rising levels of air pollution, and a vast array of unmet medical needs. The rising prevalence of COPD in the country is chiefly owing to the high and rising number of smokers. The China market for asthma and COPD drugs also comes across as a more attractive market than the U.S. market owing to a low level of competition and high rate of growth. Request a sample of this report to know what opportunities will emerge in the rapidly evolving U.S. and China Asthma and COPD Drugs Market by 2024: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Some of the leading vendors presently operating in the U.S. and China asthma and COPD drugs market profiled in the report are Boehringer Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck and Co., Inc., Novartis AG, AstraZeneca plc, and F.

Companion animals include pets such as dogs, cats and horses; although in recent years the market has expanded reasonably for avian pets, reptiles and exotic fish. The healthcare products have transformed the health and quality of life for millions of pets across the world. The greatest challenge of maintaining pets is seeking the keenness to understand if an animal is sick and creating the proper diagnostic tests to look out for the most likely illness that affects the animal. Due to environmental factors such as the weather, flora and fauna in the immediate vicinity, each veterinary medical professional has to rely on knowledge of the surroundings and each case of illness in different region presents specific challenges for treatment. Meanwhile, the range of products for animal health keep increasing with newer anti-infectives, anti-bacterials, anti-parasitics, reproductive aids, prosthetics, and topical solutions and imaging devices. This report focuses on the global emerging demand for companion animal healthcare products. Conventionally the companion animal segment received low attention due to sheer lack of volume associated since only households with stable income. In 2012, U.S. households had approximately 160 million pets and spent close to US$ 500 annually on preliminary veterinary visits and can spend up to US$ 10,000 for taking care of serious illnesses. Surgeries such as cataract and insulin injections along with pain management medications are a regular norm now. Yet, this is a stark picture in front of the actual potential worldwide, since a significant percentage of households in developing countries and negligible number of welfare and adoption centres. There are over 10,000 animal shelters across North America and EU5, and maintain health of companion animals such as dogs and cats. The annual expenditure on healthcare products of a shelter housing 30-40 animals spends approximately US$ 50,000 annually to operate whereas large sized shelters that can handle over 1000 animals spend approximately US$ 500,000 each year. In emerging countries, awareness of animal illnesses is increasing drastically prompting significant expenditure for animal care. Request Free Report Sample@ http://www.sa-brc.com/Global-Farm--Companion-Animal-Healt... Key segments in this market include animal vaccines, nutrition and dietary products along with pharmaceuticals. In United States, the Dept. of Agriculture sets regulations for these products whereas in United Kingdom, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) which is part of the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The VMD is also responsible for regulating and tracking drug resistance in animals. However, unlike drug resistance in humans which is found to be severe in several cases, the drug resistance in animals does not hold any clinical problems. The overall market for companion animal health market is highly fragmented with well over 50 competitors that includes players such as Avian Biotech International, Dechra Pharmaceuticals, Elandco Animal Health, Merck & Co., Lohmann Animal Health, DuPont Qualicon, Virbac SA, Novartis Animal Health, Novus International, Elanco, Zoetis, Bayer Animal Health, Merial, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Ceva Sante Animale, Vetoquinol, Biobest Laboratories and Ortho-Equine.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Antibacterial Drugs Market: Business Challenges, Emerging Technologies & Competitive Landscape A new market research study, titled “Antibacterial Drugs Market – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2015 – 2023,” has been published by Transparency Market Research. As per the study, in 2014, the global antibacterial drugs market was worth US$43.9 bn. The market is projected to exhibit a 1.30% CAGR between 2015 and 2023, declining in value to touch US$38.9 bn by the end of 2023. An antibacterial drug is an antimicrobial agent that interferes with the reproduction and growth of bacteria. The growth of this bacteria can cause severe infections in animals and humans. The administration of antibacterial drugs helps in inhibiting the growth of the bacteria or completely killing it. At present, several antibacterial drugs in different formulations are available and are widely used for treating tuberculosis, legionellosis, like pneumonia, diarrhea, diphtheria, tetanus, and other diseases. Some of the prominent consumers of the global antibacterial drugs market are private clinics, hospitals, patients, and physicians. This 110 page report gives readers a comprehensive overview of the antibacterial drugs market. Browse through 9 data tables and 40 figures to unlock the hidden opportunities in this market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antibacterial-drugs-ma… The growing prevalence of infections and other diseases across the globe and increasing government support for research and development activities are some of the key drivers of the global antibacterial drugs market. However, the upcoming patent expirations and growth in drug-resistant species are projected to curtail the growth of the market in the coming years. The decline in the markets valuations will primarily be attributable to this negative factor. In 2014, the β-lactams segment accounted for a 58% share in the global antibacterial drugs market and is estimated to be in the topmost position in the next few years. In the same year, the quinolones segment accounted for a 17% share in the global market and is expected to exhibit negative growth rate in the forecast period. Furthermore, the miscellaneous antibacterial segment is projected to witness significant growth owing to the growing demand for therapies against bacterial infections and rising geriatric population. The strong pipeline in the global antibacterial drugs market includes RHB-105, Eravacycline, Ozenoxacin, Arikace, Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009), Surotomycin (MK-4261), SYM-1219, Solithromycin (CEM-101), Plazomycin, Ciprofloxacin/Fluocinolone Acetonide, SPL7013, Actoxumab/Aezlotoxumab, (MK-3415A), Omadacycline (PTK-0796), Zempia (E-101), Cadazolid, Delafloxacin, and Delamanid. The major players are making constant efforts to commercialize these drugs, which is estimated to propel the global antibacterial drugs market in the near future. At present, Asia Pacific accounts for the largest share in the global antibacterial drugs market and is projected to grow at a fast pace throughout the forecast period. The rapid growth of this region can be attributed to the strong presence of generic pharmaceutical ingredients and generic manufacturers, a growing geriatric population, and expanding population. In addition, the growing incidence of several bacterial infections including MRSA and TB, developing healthcare infrastructure, and rising purchasing power of consumers are some of the other factors anticipated to drive global antibacterial drugs market in the coming years. Request a sample of this report to know what opportunities will emerge in the rapidly evolving antibacterial drugs market during 2015 – 2023: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Asia Pacific is followed by North America and Europe. These regions are expected to witness sluggish growth throughout the forecast period. The slow-paced growth of the North America and Europe antibacterial drugs markets can be attributed to the strict regulatory requirements, market maturity, and shortened product lifecycle. The prominent players engaged in the global antibacterial drugs market include Bayer AG, Forest Laboratories, Inc., Allergan plc, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca plc, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly & Co., Novartis AG, Merck & Co., Inc., and Pfizer, Inc. These players are leading the overall market and witnessing intense competition amongst each other. Among these players, Pfizer, Inc. is considered as a dominant player owing to its significant contribution towards the global antibacterial drugs market.

It has been observed and validated that pet owners globally prefer consulting veterinary doctors at hospitals and clinics and administering prescription drugs to their small companion pets. However, a new trend of referring to the Internet to find out disease pathogenesis and buying over-the-counter (OTC) drugs from retail pharmacies and drug stores has been fast picking up. The primary trend in the companion animal drug market is an increase in pet adoption and humanization of pets globally. Other driving forces include increasing urbanization and growing affluence in emerging economies, increasing R&D for faster launch of first-in-line drugs, extension of patent approvals on formularies and growing demand for compounded medicines, as they are easily affordable and accessible. Factors restraining market growth include rising costs for R&D and lack of scope for innovation due to matured product portfolios.
