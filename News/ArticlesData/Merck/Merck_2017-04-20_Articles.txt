KEYTRUDA, which was funded for melanoma last year, is now registered for PD-L1 positive patients in both pre-treated and untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Paul Smith, MSD New Zealand Director, says, “This KEYTRUDA registration has the potential to transform the way lung cancer is treated in New Zealand and is particularly important for patients who express PD-L1. PD-L1 is a protein expressed by cancer cells to evade the immune system. “The recent KEYNOTE-024 clinical trial results have been so compelling that trial investigators believe KEYTRUDA should replace platinum-based chemotherapy to become the new “Standard of Care” for untreated advanced NSCLC that expresses high levels of PD-L1. 1 “Chemotherapy has long been the standard of care for advanced NSCLC; however the latest data from the KEYNOTE-024 trial demonstrates superior overall survival with KEYTRUDA, compared to chemotherapy in patients with high PD-L1 expression.2 “In light of that trial data, the external data and safety monitoring committee recommended that the study be stopped early to give the patients who were receiving chemotherapy the opportunity to receive KEYTRUDA.” 2 “Lung cancer is New Zealand’s biggest cancer killer, accounting for more than 1,600 deaths per year. 3 More people die of lung cancer, than of breast cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma combined.” 3 Philip Hope, CEO of Lung Foundation New Zealand, says, “This KEYTRUDA lung cancer registration is a hugely welcome step forward in ensuring New Zealanders can benefit from this new generation of treatments. I hope that this medicine will be made available on a funded basis to all New Zealanders with life-threatening lung cancer. “As New Zealanders we need to acknowledge the gravity of this disease and look at ways we can work together to prevent it, treat it and ultimately save lives. Lung cancer often affects the most disadvantaged with male lung cancer rates in the most deprived areas 3.2 times higher than those in the least deprived areas. 4 “Lung cancer can affect anyone, not just smokers; in fact, one in five people diagnosed with lung cancer have never smoked. 3 “It also has a significant impact on Maori compared to the non-Maori population with rates three – four times higher in Maori men and women respectively.” 5 Paul Smith says, “MSD has made an application to PHARMAC for funding of KEYTRUDA in advanced NSCLC. We hope that PHARMAC can work with urgency to provide lung cancer patients with a new treatment option, and we believe it is possible to fund KEYTRUDA for this group of patients as early as 1 July. “Patients wanting to access KEYTRUDA should seek further advice from their cancer specialist about the options that may benefit them.” -ENDS- Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url Trackback-URL  Print This Post comments feed for this post Tweet   No comments yet.

Originally published at Health Care Renewal Perceptions that the US health care system is dysfunctional and needs major reform go way back.  A timeline from the Tampa Bay Times noted President Theodore Roosevelt’s proposal for a national health service in 1912.  Nonetheless, as we have discussed endlessly, most attempts at reform failed, and health care dysfunction seems to be getting worse. One big problem may be that we don’t understand how much discussion of health care reform is driven by those who benefit from the status quo. A Personal Anecdote When I began my academic career in 1983, I was often in the audience for talks about how to fix health care by people billed as experts.  Often these talks seemed oddly disconnected from the realities on the ground for a junior assistant professor with a lot of clinical and teaching responsbilities.  Worse, many of the solutions they offered seemed to entail greater burdens for health care professionals, with no obvious compensation other than the warm feeling that we would be benefiting society.  Who else these solutions might benefit was not discussed. One talk given a bit later stands out in my memory. On November 29, 2001, one Dr John W Rowe gave the prestigious Levinger Lecture at Brown University entitled “Good Health: Can we Afford It?” (referenced here, see items for 11/14 and 11/16)  As I recall, Dr Rowe spent considerable time scolding us hard working physicians for overuse of medical interventions leading to endless increases in health care costs, and promising more burdensome bureaucratic interventions to rein in our follies.  While promising more burdens on physicians, Dr Rowe did not dwell on how the resulting cost savings might benefit him in his role as CEO and Chairman of Aetna Inc.  Aetna had purchased the notoriously physician-unfriendly US Healthcare, and thus had become a big for-profit health care insurer already known for imposing bureaucratic burdens on physicians in hopes of decreasing their utilization, while increasing the company’s revenues (look here).  Were Dr Rowe’s pontifications really about improving health care for all Americans, or about justifying his previous management behavior, and perhaps supporting the price of his shares in Aetna? Why was Aetna’s public relations given the patina of an academic lecture? These days, health care professionals continue to be exhorted about health care reform.  Many such pontifications may be not so much about true health care reform as about preserving the fundamental status quo which has benefited and enriched so many insiders. The interests of the pontificators are often less obvious than those of Dr Rowe.  Maybe that is so why there has been so little real reform, and what little reform there has been seems to be under continuous attack. Two Examples of How Hard It Is to Discover the Interests of Health Care Policy Pontificators In the last few weeks I posted about two recent ostensibly authoritative pontifications.  One was about ways to address the worsening problem of physician burn-out (see this post). It was written by the CEOs of large, non-profit hospital systems, joined by the CEO of the American Medical Association.  The other was about a health care reform proposal from the prestigious National Academy of Medicine (see this post).  A rather uncritical article in the Washington Post hailed it as a “radical idea” because it was written by “doctors.” In both cases, I was skeptical, mainly because many of the proponents had conflicts of interest, mostly undisclosed, that suggested they were already benefiting mightily from the current system. However, it gets worse.  While I thought my posts were based on reasonable efforts to find undisclosed conflicts of interest affecting the authors of these exhortations, within a few weeks I realized I had missed one important item affecting each.  The lesson is that the web of conflicts of interest that ensnares the insiders who run most of US health care is even more complex and adherent than any of us realizes. Dr John Noseworthy, Author of the Health Affairs Post on Reducing Physician Burnout: CEO of the Mayo Clinic, But Also Now Nominated to be a Director of Merck Dr Noseworthy, CEO of the Mayo Clinic, was the lead author of a post in HealthAffairs about reducing physician burnout.  (Oddly enough, none of the proposed action items seemed to involve increasing physician autonomy by reducing the power of managers over health care professionals.) Two weeks after Noseworthy and colleagues’ post appeared, an article on the Minnesota Public Radio website reported that Dr Noseworthy has just been nominated to a seat on the Merck board of directors.  Presumably the possibility of this nomination had been known at the time the post was published. I had previously written that two of the authors of the Health Affairs post were on corporate boards.  One, Dr Paul Rothman, was already on the board of Merck.  As corporate directors, they have fiduciary responsibilties to promote the revenues of their corporations.  Now it turns out there were at least three such board members among the health system CEOs who had pontificated to physicians about how to reduce their burn-out. Yet the power of such health care systems, whose management is often mission-hostile, and who often put revenue ahead of physicians’ professional values (per the shareholder value theory), is arguably a major cause of physician burnout.  Furthermore, Merck, in particular, has had its share of management misbehavior as demonstrated by a recent $830 million settlement for deceiving shareholders, a mere $5.9 million 2015 settlement for deceptive marketing, and multiple setttlements, cumulatively totaling more than $1 billion, plus one guilty plea for the historic deceptive marketing of Vioxx (see this post). So to what extent are the authors of this pontification about reducing physician burnout (without really giving physicians much new autonomy) insiders benefiting from the status quo in health care?  It may be more than what we think, even now. Mr Leonard Schaeffer, Author of National Academy of Medicine Article on Health Care Reform: Member of the Boards of Wahlgreen Boots, Quintiles, scPharmaceuticals, but Also Long-Term Director of Amgen Mr Schaeffer was an author of the National Academy of Medicine article, now published online in JAMA, about health care reform.  (Oddly enough, none of the “vital directions issue areas” mentioned in the article involved real challenges to the power of large health care organizations, particularly for-profit corporations, or increased autonomy for health care professionals.) The version of the article published online by the NAM did not include any explicit disclosures of conflicts of interest.  It did note that two authors were full-time employees of health care corporations, one was a consultant to health care corporations, one was a lobbyist for health care corporations, and one was on the boards of health care corporations.  The online JAMA version added more disclosures, but these were incomplete.  In my post, I noted that fully 13 of the 19 authors had major ties to large health care corporations, as employees, lobbyists, consultants or  board members. In particular, Mr Leonard D Schaeffer was listed in the NAM version as simply affiliated with the University of Southern California, but I found was actually on the boards of Wahlgreens Boots Alliance, Quintiles Transnational, and scPharmaceuticals Inc.  That was still an incomplete picture of his conflicts of interest. A ProPublica article from February, 2017 recounted how big pharmaceutical companies engaged Precision Health Economics to wage public relations campaigns to try to justify high pharmaceutical prices.  The article noted the following about Mr Schaeffer. Amgen has ties to all three founders of Precision Health Economics. Working for other firms, Philipson has twice testified as an expert witness for Amgen, defending the company’s rights to drug patents, according to his curriculum vitae. The other two founders, Goldman and Lakdawalla, are principals at the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at USC, which received $500,000 in late 2016 from Amgen for an ‘innovation initiative,’ according to public disclosures. Goldman said the funds were unrestricted and could be used at the center’s discretion. Robert Bradway, the CEO and chair of Amgen, is on the advisory board of the university center, and Leonard Schaeffer, a professor at USC and the namesake of the center, sat on Amgen’s board of directors for nearly a decade. With funding from Amgen, the Schaeffer Center hosted a forum in Washington, D.C., in October 2015 on the affordability of specialty drugs. Before a panel focused on the new cholesterol treatment, Goldman cautioned against lowering drug prices. So Mr Schaeffer, in addition to his current board positions, turns out to have had a long relationship with Amgen.  Given that according to the 2013 Amgen proxy statement, Mr Schaeffer retired from the board with at least 28,277 shares of Amgen stock and options for 15,000 more, he may have current financial ties to the company. So once again, to what extent were the authors of the 2017 NAM report on health care reform (which did not challenge the influence of large health care corporations over the health of US citizens) insiders benefiting from the status quo in health care?  It may be more than what we think, even now. Summary Health care professionals, policy makers, and the public are constantly harangued by apparently unbaised experts about health care reform.  Yet many of these authorities are insiders who benefit from the status quo.  Many of their financial connections to the corporations that make the most money from the US commercialized health care system are not disclosed.  It may take considerable investigation to determine their involvement in a web of conflicts of interest that drapes over the US health care system. Meanwhile, audiences should demand that those who lecture us about health care reform disclose all their financial conflicts of interest.  Any whiff of deception about their personal interests should suggest intense skepticism. True health care reform requires honest discussion of the issues.  Honesty in this case entails complete and detailed disclosure of the discussants’ conflicts of interest. Until such honest is the rule, be very, very careful about taking sanctimonious spiels at face value. 00020 This entry was posted in Banana republic, Free markets and their discontents, Guest Post, Health care, Media watch, Ridiculously obvious scams, The destruction of the middle class on April 20, 2017 by Yves Smith.

The NHS grew out of the Emergency Medical Service of WWII handling civilian casualties of bombing and keeping a healthy population for fighting and national stability. Most European countries (except Switzerland) were combat zones with displaced population and disease. The need to provide full cover to protect against cross-infection was the basis of total cover. The USA has not faced such a situation since 1865. No Japanese invasion or bombing on Mainland USA Reply ↓ makedoanmend April 20, 2017 at 5:36 am The NHS came about because people who fought in WWII wanted a piece of the action after the war. They didn’t fight and sacrifice themselves so that insurance companies could profit. They lived through the former deprivation of inadequate health care prior to the war. Aneurin (Nye) Bevan was the Labour member who brought the NHS to fruition despite the grave economic conditions the UK faced post-war. (One might also ponder how the monied (moneyed) establishment when faced with a disciplined group of citizens with war experience felt it might be necessary to acquiesce to mere labourer’s demands during this era.) As Bevan stated in fulfilling Labour’s 1945 manifesto: “The collective principle asserts that… no society can legitimately call itself civilised if a sick person is denied medical aid because of lack of means.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurin_Bevan A nice and brief history of the NHS is available from the NHS itself: http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/nhshistory/Pages/NHShistory1948.aspx Whilst the war revealed that the “state” could indeed create responsive programs and institutions, it was the implacable will of the electorate and certain Labour politicians post-war that made the NHS a reality rather than a talking point. Reply ↓ Mark P. April 20, 2017 at 6:41 pm Implacable will, indeed. Here’s Bevan on his enemies — “No amount of cajolery, and no attempts at ethical or social seduction, can eradicate from my heart a deep burning hatred for the Tory Party that inflicted those bitter experiences on me. So far as I am concerned they are lower than vermin. They condemned millions of first-class people to semi-starvation.’ Reply ↓ financial matters April 20, 2017 at 7:37 am Nice job bringing these points to light. In an interview of Noam Chomsky by Abby Martin, Chomsky makes the point that the lower 70% of the population on the economic scale are disenfranchised. As an example the majority of people want a single payer/national health care program but the press keeps saying that it is ‘politically’ impossible. That is, it doesn’t matter what the public wants. The press doesn’t seem to be helping in the fight against the power of the large insurance and pharmaceutical companies. Trump campaigned on fighting for lower drug prices with some of the recent well publicized abuses but his meeting with Noseworthy doesn’t seem to bode well. Reply ↓ human April 20, 2017 at 9:51 am Nice rant from an insider. Now back to that discussion of melancholia … Reply ↓ oh April 20, 2017 at 10:01 am Healthcare should be a right not an option. Ever since Tricky Dick and his Congress ushered in the HMO’s health care costs have gone up, with the overriding cause being profit seekers at every level. Insurance companies serve to limit payments and decrease the overall level of care received. Hospitals serve to compound this by the use of RVU’s (Relative Value Units) so that the most expensive treatments are more $$$ for Physicians vis-a-vis preventative and/or one-on-one diagnosis/care sans expensive procedures. Hospital Administrators make a huge bundle (salary+bonuses+options). The net result is that even caring physicians are forced to gravitate toward high RVU care and worsening of health care and higher costs. Insurance companies need to be removed from the health care. Hospitals should be regulated. Physicians’ compensation need to be uniform rather than based on RVU’s (i.e. profit). Single payer will (hopefully) accomplish a lot of this. Then perhaps we’ll have decent health care. Reply ↓ Loblolly April 20, 2017 at 10:24 am To the sociopath MBAs that run everything, labor is a cost to be reduced.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck Donates $300,000 to Support Neglected Tropical Disease Elimination Efforts in Africa KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today a $300,000 cash donation to support non-governmental organization (NGO) partners working to eliminate river blindness (onchocerciasis) and lymphatic filariasis (LF) in Africa. The donation will be offered to 10 NGOs beginning this year, and will be administered through the MECTIZAN® Donation Program (MDP), a public/private partnership established in 1987 following the announcement by Merck to donate MECTIZAN® to control and eliminate river blindness. River blindness and LF are targeted for elimination in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Roadmap on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), and NGOs have long played a critical role in the broad partnership focused on achieving those targets. Grants will be given to support activities focused on the elimination of river blindness or LF, and will be offered to our partner NGOs who are directly involved in the distribution of MECTIZAN®. Eligible NGOs will be able to request funds through an application process in which they will be required to secure a 50-50 matching grant, effectively doubling the resources to $600,000. Through the MDP and its partners — including endemic countries, NGOs, the WHO, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the WHO’s Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO), the WHO’s Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (WHO EMRO), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department for International Development (DFID) and others — more than 200 million people in 32 countries are reached each year. NGOs play a critical role in this partnership, facilitating community-led efforts to distribute MECTIZAN® and educating people about the diseases. Since the inception of the program in 1987, Merck has donated more than 2.5 billion treatments for river blindness and LF. „Since the MECTIZAN® Donation Program began 30 years ago, Merck and its global partners have made great strides to control and eliminate river blindness and lymphatic filariasis. With both diseases now targeted for elimination, we hope this grant will enable our partner NGOs to achieve further progress toward that goal,” said Brenda Colatrella, executive director, corporate responsibility. The MDP’s impact extends beyond its immediate health benefits. The program has been a catalyst in the formation of similar donation programs for other NTDs. Initially focused only on river blindness, in 1998, Merck expanded the MDP to include MECTIZAN® for the prevention of LF in African countries where the disease coexists with river blindness. Further, the broad public-private partnership supports the training of community health care workers and strengthening distribution systems through which other medicines, vaccines and medical supplies can be delivered in resource-poor settings. About Merck For more than a century, Merck, a leading global biopharmaceutical company known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, has been inventing for life, bringing forward medicines and vaccines for many of the world’s most challenging diseases.

About the MECTIZAN ®Donation Program The MECTIZAN® Donation Program (MDP) was established at the Task Force for Global Health in 1987 to provide medical, technical and administrative oversight of the donation of MECTIZAN® by Merck for the treatment of onchocerciasis. In 1998, MDP expanded its mandate to include oversight of the donation of albendazole by GSK to be distributed in conjunction with MECTIZAN® for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis in onchocerciasis co-endemic areas.

Solomont Robert Merck (Photo by Studio Scrivo) Robert Merck is the global head of real estate for MetLife, one of the largest commercial lenders in the U.S., with a $67 billion real estate and commercial mortgage portfolio. The Georgia native joined the company in 1982 as a 24-year-old analyst and, after working his way up, was tapped to run the company’s real estate investment department in 2003. Since then, MetLife’s real estate business has grown exponentially: It originated a record $15 billion in commercial mortgages last year, up from $3 billion in 2002, and it invested $1.5 billion in commercial real estate globally. In 2005, the company sold its trophy headquarters building at 200 Park Avenue to Tishman Speyer for $1.72 billion. The following year, Merck oversaw MetLife’s historic sale of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village to Tishman Speyer for $5.4 billion. DOB: March 27, 1958 Hometown: Macon, Georgia Lives in:  Far Hills, New Jersey Family: Married; two grown children You grew up in Georgia. What was that like? It was just a regular, middle-class life. My father financed cars, and my mother stayed home. But in the mid-1960s, there were race riots in the South. My mother was basically raised by an African-American [nanny] in the 1930s, and she remembers sitting in the back of the bus with her. So from an early age, she raised us to treat all people the same. You started your career at MetLife, right? Pretty much. I graduated from Emory University in 1980. I was on scholarship. I really hadn’t been around people with so much money. It inspired me to work hard. I got my M.B.A. at night at Georgia State University. I started at MetLife in 1982 as a financial analyst in Atlanta. My father always told me, “Find a good place to work and stick with it.” So I did. How did you end up at MetLife in the first place? My parents had just moved into a sort of a new house, and somebody who was driving by stopped to look at it. It happened to be a guy who worked at MetLife. My father called me and said, “Write this down, this guy, you call him.”… There were probably five or six of us hired at the same time, and I was the only one left after a year. One of your marquee deals was selling Stuy Town. Did you know it would be a symbol of the boom and bust? We didn’t know it was the top of the market, nobody knew. But the market was pricing things very aggressively. … At the time, you’re living and breathing it, and it’s stressful. … I was waking up every day wondering what was going to be in the paper. A lot of it wasn’t accurate. Is there a place in New York real estate for Southern manners? Yes, but I like to joke that when we negotiate these big deals, I turn on the accent more. The initial reaction from people is that you’re not as smart as they are. You can use it to your advantage. Where do you live? We live out in horse country in Far Hills, N.J. My wife lives in Tampa for eight months out of the year now. People [in the South] don’t know what New Jersey is like. They think it’s the Sopranos and stuff. Do you have children? We have a daughter, who’s going to be 26, who’s doing office leasing at CBRE. Our son will be 28 this year, and he’s an officer in the Army. He spent time in Afghanistan [in 2014], so that was a little nerve-wracking. How’d you cope? My wife didn’t sleep much. I felt like he was probably OK. Of course, I’m sitting in a meeting one day and get this text from him and he’s like, “This rocket just blew up like 50 meters from where I am.” And I’m like, “What’s a meter?” What are you passionate about outside of work? I exercise a lot. And I’m passionate about raising money for rare-cancer research. I’ve done Cycle for Survival [a fundraiser] for the last two years. Why is that so important to you? I was diagnosed with this rare stomach cancer in 2015. It happens to be this cancer responds to a targeted therapy drug that they discovered in 2001. Prior to that, people lived maybe 15 months. I feel like there’s a reason maybe I got so lucky, so I want to give back. Did having cancer change your perspective on life? It helped me realize that there’s more to life than who has the most toys. What’s your workout routine? I run, I spin, I do weight training. When I was 53, I ran the Philadelphia Marathon. I don’t like to run with people. But, of course, my calves started seizing up as I’m walking back to my hotel. I had to sit down on a bench next to a homeless lady. I was almost like, “Can you rub my calves, please?” What’s something you couldn’t live without? Oh, God. My family. My TV. My man cave. I like to go home and vegetate. I just love Netflix and Amazon shows, where you can power-watch. What’s the most extravagant thing you’ve ever purchased? How much time do you have? Just kidding. What’s your most prized possession? I have the Silver and Bronze Stars my father got in the Army. I had no idea how big a deal a Silver Star was and it’s a big freaking deal. It’s something my dad never talked about. I wish I had talked to him about it before he died. Do you ever think about retiring? I’m only 58, so I’ve got lots of good years left. If I didn’t wake up with 50 emails, I don’t know what I’d do. I have inbox phobia. My goal is to clear out that inbox by the end of the day. Editor’s correction: An earlier version of this interview noted that Merck’s son was awarded a Silver Star. Only his father received it.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck Donates $300,000 to Support Neglected Tropical Disease Elimination Efforts in Africa KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today a $300,000 cash donation to support non-governmental organization (NGO) partners working to eliminate river blindness (onchocerciasis) and lymphatic filariasis (LF) in Africa. The donation will be offered to 10 NGOs beginning this year, and will be administered through the MECTIZAN® Donation Program (MDP), a public/private partnership established in 1987 following the announcement by Merck to donate MECTIZAN® to control and eliminate river blindness. River blindness and LF are targeted for elimination in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Roadmap on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), and NGOs have long played a critical role in the broad partnership focused on achieving those targets. Grants will be given to support activities focused on the elimination of river blindness or LF, and will be offered to our partner NGOs who are directly involved in the distribution of MECTIZAN®. Eligible NGOs will be able to request funds through an application process in which they will be required to secure a 50-50 matching grant, effectively doubling the resources to $600,000. Through the MDP and its partners — including endemic countries, NGOs, the WHO, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the WHO’s Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO), the WHO’s Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (WHO EMRO), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department for International Development (DFID) and others — more than 200 million people in 32 countries are reached each year. NGOs play a critical role in this partnership, facilitating community-led efforts to distribute MECTIZAN® and educating people about the diseases. Since the inception of the program in 1987, Merck has donated more than 2.5 billion treatments for river blindness and LF. „Since the MECTIZAN® Donation Program began 30 years ago, Merck and its global partners have made great strides to control and eliminate river blindness and lymphatic filariasis. With both diseases now targeted for elimination, we hope this grant will enable our partner NGOs to achieve further progress toward that goal,” said Brenda Colatrella, executive director, corporate responsibility. The MDP’s impact extends beyond its immediate health benefits. The program has been a catalyst in the formation of similar donation programs for other NTDs. Initially focused only on river blindness, in 1998, Merck expanded the MDP to include MECTIZAN® for the prevention of LF in African countries where the disease coexists with river blindness. Further, the broad public-private partnership supports the training of community health care workers and strengthening distribution systems through which other medicines, vaccines and medical supplies can be delivered in resource-poor settings. About Merck For more than a century, Merck, a leading global biopharmaceutical company known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, has been inventing for life, bringing forward medicines and vaccines for many of the world’s most challenging diseases. Through our prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products, we work with customers and operate in more than 140 countries to deliver innovative health solutions. We also demonstrate our commitment to increasing access to health care through far-reaching policies, programs and partnerships. Today, Merck continues to be at the forefront of research to advance the prevention and treatment of diseases that threaten people and communities around the world – including cancer, cardio-metabolic diseases, emerging animal diseases, Alzheimer’s disease and infectious diseases including HIV and Ebola.

About the MECTIZAN®Donation Program The MECTIZAN® Donation Program (MDP) was established at the Task Force for Global Health in 1987 to provide medical, technical and administrative oversight of the donation of MECTIZAN® by Merck for the treatment of onchocerciasis. In 1998, MDP expanded its mandate to include oversight of the donation of albendazole by GSK to be distributed in conjunction with MECTIZAN® for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis in onchocerciasis co-endemic areas.

KEYTRUDA, which was funded for melanoma last year, is now registered for PD-L1 positive patients in both pre-treated and untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Paul Smith, MSD New Zealand Director, says, “This KEYTRUDA registration has the potential to transform the way lung cancer is treated in New Zealand and is particularly important for patients who express PD-L1. PD-L1 is a protein expressed by cancer cells to evade the immune system. “The recent KEYNOTE-024 clinical trial results have been so compelling that trial investigators believe KEYTRUDA should replace platinum-based chemotherapy to become the new “Standard of Care” for untreated advanced NSCLC that expresses high levels of PD-L1. 1 “Chemotherapy has long been the standard of care for advanced NSCLC; however the latest data from the KEYNOTE-024 trial demonstrates superior overall survival with KEYTRUDA, compared to chemotherapy in patients with high PD-L1 expression.2 “In light of that trial data, the external data and safety monitoring committee recommended that the study be stopped early to give the patients who were receiving chemotherapy the opportunity to receive KEYTRUDA.” 2 “Lung cancer is New Zealand’s biggest cancer killer, accounting for more than 1,600 deaths per year. 3 More people die of lung cancer, than of breast cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma combined.” 3 Philip Hope, CEO of Lung Foundation New Zealand, says, “This KEYTRUDA lung cancer registration is a hugely welcome step forward in ensuring New Zealanders can benefit from this new generation of treatments. I hope that this medicine will be made available on a funded basis to all New Zealanders with life-threatening lung cancer. “As New Zealanders we need to acknowledge the gravity of this disease and look at ways we can work together to prevent it, treat it and ultimately save lives. Lung cancer often affects the most disadvantaged with male lung cancer rates in the most deprived areas 3.2 times higher than those in the least deprived areas. 4 “Lung cancer can affect anyone, not just smokers; in fact, one in five people diagnosed with lung cancer have never smoked. 3 “It also has a significant impact on Maori compared to the non-Maori population with rates three - four times higher in Maori men and women respectively.” 5 Paul Smith says, “MSD has made an application to PHARMAC for funding of KEYTRUDA in advanced NSCLC. We hope that PHARMAC can work with urgency to provide lung cancer patients with a new treatment option, and we believe it is possible to fund KEYTRUDA for this group of patients as early as 1 July. “Patients wanting to access KEYTRUDA should seek further advice from their cancer specialist about the options that may benefit them.” -ENDS- © Scoop Media   Tweet         Culture Headlines | Health Headlines | Education Headlines LIFESTYLE > >   Howard Davis: Never Too Old To Rock & Roll - Jethro Tull As Greil Marcus recently observed in an NYRB review of Robbie Robertson's autobiographical Testimony, in rock and roll there is always an origin story.

The founding chairman and first employee of ACE Limited, John R. Cox, wrote the company’s first insurance policy in Room 348 at the hotel on November 1, 1985. ACE, which adopted the Chubb name in 2016 following its acquisition of The Chubb Corporation, has since grown to become the largest publicly traded property and casualty insurance company in the world. Senior executives from Hamilton Princess & Beach Club and Chubb attended a ceremony to unveil the plaque outside the room on April 19. Pictured at the plaque unveiling are: Joseph Clabby, Division President, Bermuda & Global Accounts, Chubb; Allan Trew, Director of Community Involvement at Hamilton Princess & Beach Club; and Eric Dobkin, Director, Insurance & Risk Management, Merck & Co., Inc. Guests included Eric Dobkin, Director, Insurance & Risk Management, from Merck & Co., Inc. a U.S.-headquartered biopharmaceutical company, which held ACE’s first insurance policy, numbered 348 after the room. Chubb employees, past and present, who worked alongside Mr. Cox reminisced about the early years and the family-style work environment. Mr. Cox, who died at age 84 in February, was regarded as a giant in the property and casualty insurance industry. Not only did he shape ACE in its formative years, he also helped to establish Bermuda’s leading role in the international insurance and reinsurance industry. ACE was founded in 1985 with Mr. Cox playing a critical role in developing the company’s excess liability and directors and officers coverage in response to an availability crisis in the U.S. insurance marketplace. The new plaque outside Room 348 at Hamilton Princess & Beach Club The insurer later went public and, through a series of acquisitions, became a major global P&C insurer and reinsurer. “We are pleased to commemorate the room where ACE wrote its first policy, a legacy that will always be an important part of Bermuda’s history,” says Allan Federer, General Manager of the Hamilton Princess & Beach Club. “International insurance and reinsurance are such a large part of Bermuda’s growth and development and we are honoured to mark this occasion today.” Joseph Clabby, Division President, Chubb Bermuda said, “Room 348 of the Hamilton Princess has always held a special place in our company’s history as our first, albeit temporary, headquarters. We are honoured to be joined here again by our first policyholder, many of our earliest employees and colleagues from the broking community to commemorate John Cox, his vision and achievements.” Related Stories Hamilton Princess Hotel Hires Jasmine Quinn Princess Hotel Certifies In-House Tips Trainers Hamilton Princess: Official America’s Cup Hotel Video: Hamilton Princess Unveils New Sculpture Happy Hour Returns, 1609 Reopens For Season Social Media Contest For NYC America’s Cup Read More About #BermudaBusiness #BermudaInsurance #FairmontHamiltonPrincess #HotelNews Category: All, Business, News Comments (1) Trackback URL | Comments RSS Feed puzzled says: April 20, 2017 Is this John Cox the same as the Hon.Sir.

More recent missteps in skin and brain cancer trials have analysts scrambling to adjust their peak sales targets for the blockbuster cancer drug, while the big pharma's stock price languishes. Opdivo's misfortune should raise concerns, but the market's reaction seems out of proportion to the potential financial impact. In terms of market capitalization, Bristol-Myers Squibb is worth about $39 billion less at recent prices than it was at the beginning of last August. Image source: Getty Images. The depressed stock has piqued the interest of legendary activist investor Carl Icahn. Rather than just follow him blindly, let's take a closer look at the source of pessimism to see if the big pharma stock is a buy on the dip. Fall from grace Since earning the drug's first approval at the end of 2014, Bristol has deftly expanded Opdivo's addressable population to include patients with head and neck, skin, lung, kidney, and bladder cancers, plus Hodgkin lymphoma. In its second full year post-approval, the drug generated a stunning $3.77 billion in sales, and hasn't slowed down yet. Fourth-quarter sales suggest a $5.24 billion annual run rate. Lung cancer isn't the most common malignancy, but it is the deadliest. It's also ripe for better therapies, which explains why the market hammered Bristol's stock in response to Opdivo's failure to outperform age-old chemotherapy among newly diagnosed, untreated patients with the most common form of lung cancer. Merck & Co. rubbed salt into Bristol's wounds by announcing an FDA approval for its drug of the same class in the first-line lung cancer setting. Merck's Keytruda isn't the only drug of the same class that Opdivo will need to contend with in the future. More recently launched Tecentriq, from Roche, and Bavencio, from Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), also prevent tumor cells from exploiting the same checkpoint to evade immune system attacks. Pfizer's Bavencio recently entered the commercial stage as the only drug approved for Merkel cell skin cancer, and Tecentriq has launched into two of Opdivo's indications. Bristol's checkpoint inhibitor now competes with Roche's for lung and bladder cancer patients with disease progression on or after standard chemotherapy. Image source: Getty Images. Now the good news Opdivo isn't the only drug driving growth for Bristol-Myers Squibb. Eliquis is an oral blood thinner that's rapidly gaining popularity. Bristol markets it in partnership with Pfizer, and its share of sales last year bounded 80% higher than the previous year to $3.34 billion. Although emerging competition probably won't allow Opdivo sales to continue along their current trajectory, they're not about to slide either. In fact, the average Wall Street analyst following Bristol-Myers expects its bottom line to expand at an 11.8% annual rate over the next five years. You would expect shares of a company growing this quickly to command an above-average price-to-earnings ratio, but that just isn't the case. At recent prices Bristol-Myers shares can be purchased for just 20.2 times trailing earnings, while the average stock in the benchmark S&P 500 currently trades at around 24.5 times trailing earnings. Cautious investors who are after a steady dividend income will appreciate a juicy 2.9% yield at recent prices. Last year the company used only 57% of profits to make those payments, which should allow the payout to rise in step with bottom-line growth. With long-term double-digit growth on the horizon, and a big yield to begin with, this may be one of the best dividend-paying pharmaceutical stocks you can buy right now. Icahn see a merger on the horizon While you shouldn't follow billionaires blindly, the recent addition of Carl Icahn to the company's list of activist shareholders bodes well for the stock's price going forward. The octogenarian has a long history of making big bets on drugmakers, then pestering management to increase shareholder value. Icahn won't be alone in this endeavor. Jana Partners LLC already set some important wheels in motion. Following discussions with the activist investor group this February, Bristol-Myers added three independent directors to its board and initiated a $2 billion accelerated share-buyback program. If Icahn stays true to form, though, he won't be satisfied with buybacks and dividends. Years ago he was instrumental in the sale of Imclone Systems to Eli Lilly, and Sanofi's acquisition of Genzyme. Genzyme and Imclone shareholders benefited from the premiums paid by their current owners, and with a bit of luck Bristol could be next. At a recent market cap of about $88.1 million, there aren't many potential suitors to choose from. Even if Icahn doesn't succeed in steering the company toward a sale, increased focus on shareholder benefits is a big plus. Factor improved corporate governance in with a nice dividend and expectations of double-digit growth in the years ahead, and it sure looks like Bristol-Myers Squibb stock is a buy at recent prices.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Porcine Vaccine Market Research Report by Geographical Analysis and Forecast to 2024 Porcine Vaccine Market The North America porcine vaccines market for features an essentially fragmented marketplace, with the presence of a large number of small and large players. The market, however, is dominated by few; the top four players, namely Merial Animal Health, Zoetis, Inc., Elanco Animal Health, and Merck Animal Health, for instance, collectively held nearly 74% of the overall market in 2015, observes a recent report by Transparency Market Research. Factors such as diverse product portfolios, extensive geographical presence, and perceptive acquisitions, as well as intensive research and development and the timely introduction of new vaccines have kept these players ahead of the intense competition. Instances are: The launch of two new swine vaccines by Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health in 2015: Ingelvac and ReproCyc. The vaccines have been launched to fight against the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus. Zoetis’ November 2016 launch of Fostera PCV Metastim, a monovalent killed vaccine that protects against porcine circovirus associated diseases (PCVAD). Transparency Market Research estimates that the North America Porcine Vaccine market will exhibit a 5.3% CAGR from 2016 to 2024 and rise from a valuation of US$540.9 mn in 2015 to US$926.2 mn by 2024. Read Full Report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/north-america-porcine-… In terms of disease indication, the diarrhea vaccines segment dominates the North America porcine vaccine market and is expected to account for nearly 55% of the market by 2016. The segment is expected to exhibit a healthy 7.3% CAGR over the period between 2016 and 2024 and gain a much larger, nearly 60% of the overall market, by 2024. In terms of geography, the North America porcine vaccines market is dominated by the U.S., which accounted for over 63% of the overall market in 2015 and is expected to remain the dominant market over the forecast period as well. The market for porcine vaccines in North America is chiefly driven due to factors such as the rising prevalence of swine diseases and the continuously increasing demand for meat and gelatin in the global market. Owing to globalization and rapid climate changes, the rate of outbreak of various animal diseases, some of which are also transmissible to humans, has picked up pace. Swine being a highly popular source of meat, consumed in increasingly high volumes worldwide, the impact of zoonotic diseases emanating from this class of livestock can be highly devastating for livestock as well as human lives. North America is the third largest consumer of pork globally. As a result, concerns regarding the spread of zoonotic diseases from swine and related products are well-founded and are rising. These concerns will be key to the increased focus on the health and wellness of swines from livestock farmers and will drive the overall North America porcine vaccine market. Download exclusive Sample of this report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Appropriate storage and handling of vaccines play a key role in ensuring high success rate of a vaccine against any vaccine-preventable disease. The need to strictly adhere to proper storage and handling procedures, lest incur losses worth thousands of dollars in revaccination and wasted vaccine, requires maintaining proper cold chains. Such cold chains are required to be maintained across all nodes of the supply chain, starting from the manufacturers to the healthcare providers. The high costs of maintaining these storage and handling conditions, which continue to rise with every passing day, are one of the key challenges faced by the North America porcine vaccine market and are expected to restrain the market’s growth to a certain extent over the forecast period.

The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. Media release as of April 21, 2017 Interim Report of BB Biotech AG as of March 31, 2017 BB Biotech reports pleasing quarterly results The Swiss investment company with a special focus on small and mid-cap biotech stocks earned a bottom-line profit of CHF 375 mn in the first quarter of 2017 BB Biotech's share price advanced 7.7% in CHF and 7.1% in EUR in the first quarter amid a generally positive market environment. The healthcare sector showed signs of strength. Market-moving news stemmed primarily from the US, where Congressional leaders temporarily shelved a vote to repeal and replace Obamacare. In keeping with its strategy of investing in promising small and mid-cap stocks, BB Biotech opened a position in Five Prime Therapeutics. Profits were realized in the core shareholdings of Incyte, Celgene and Actelion and the proceeds reinvested to build up positions in numerous mid-cap stocks. The Board of Directors reiterated the company's shareholder-friendly dividend policy at the Annual General Meeting on March 16, 2017, consisting of a 5% dividend yield and share buybacks. Drug pricing practices and regulations will remain one of the key topics of discussion with regard to US healthcare policy in 2017. In the meanwhile, an even greater number of biotech products are likely to receive regulatory approval compared to last year. Overall, equity markets performed well in the first quarter of 2017 driven by hopes for stimulation of the US economy by lower corporate tax rates, potential repatriation of offshore cash and investments in infrastructure alluded to by President Trump. The S&P 500 gained 6.1%, the Dow Jones gained 5.2% and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 10.1 (all values in USD). European equity indices followed the same trend, apparently disregarding Brexit implications and national election risks, so that the Euro Stoxx 600 gained 6.3%, and the Dax Index gained 7.3% in EUR while the SPI's gained 7.5% in CHF. Healthcare markets were again influenced by a seesaw US healthcare agenda driven between the White House and Congress. Initial drafts of 'repeal and replace' legislation for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) failed to win sufficient votes in Congress after intensive debate and attempts at last-minute back-room deal making - at least for now. The associated short-term volatility and tweets however could not stop the overall positive trend in broad healthcare equity markets including the MSCI World Healthcare Index, which gained 8.7% in USD, and the Nasdaq Biotech Index, which gained 10.8% in USD for the quarter. BB Biotech's performance for the first quarter 2017 The total return for BB Biotech's share price was +7.7% in CHF and +7.1% in EUR for the first three months of 2017. The portfolio showed an overall gain of 12.5% in CHF, 12.4% in EUR and 14.4% in USD. Net profit of CHF 375 mn (CHF 1.2 bn loss in the corresponding period of the previous year) was driven by the overall portfolio appreciation. The currency impact in the first quarter was -1.9% as the US Dollar fell against the Swiss Franc. All total return calculations for BB Biotech take account of the dividend distribution of CHF 2.75 per share as set by BB Biotech's dividend policy, which was approved by shareholders at this year's AGM of March 16, 2017. Continued capital distribution BB Biotech paid out the proposed dividend of CHF 2.75 per share. The board confirmed continuation of the dividend policy, and expects to pay out a regular dividend calculated as 5% of the previous December average share price. The eleventh share repurchase program - started in April 2016 - continues, and allows BB Biotech to acquire up to 10% of the company's outstanding shares over a period of up to three years. Given the ongoing reduced difference between BB Biotech's Net Asset Value and share price, the company did not trade on the second trading line in the first quarter 2017 - in fact, that trading line has not yet been activated since April 2016. First quarter portfolio activity Existing portfolio positions were carefully adjusted amid volatile, yet upward-trending biotechnology equity market. BB Biotech took further profits from the core positions in Incyte, Celgene and Actelion - generating cash to increase its core positions in Novo Nordisk, Ionis and in several of its mid-sized investments. Continuing its strategy of investing in new promising smaller and mid-cap companies, BB Biotech added Five Prime Therapeutics to its portfolio in the first quarter of 2017. Located in South San Francisco, Five Prime is developing its lead asset FPA008, an anti-CSF1R (macrophage colony stimulating factor) antibody which blocks CSF1 and IL34 ligand binding. FPA008 is in clinical trials as monotherapy and in combination with Opdivo, Bristol Myers Squibb's PD1 antibody, in cancer patients. The same antibody is being developed for pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), a macrophage-driven tumor. In PVNS, macrophages express high levels of CSF1 and attract cells with CSF1 receptors to the joint, leading to the accumulation of non-neoplastic cells that form a tumor. Results for the Phase II study are expected in 2017. Solid progress of portfolio holdings Incyte (+33.3% in USD during 1Q 2017), BB Biotech's largest position at the end of March, announced further progress in the clinical development of epacadostat, an IDO1 inhibitor. Incyte will begin additional pivotal studies testing epacadostat in combination with Merck's Keytruda as well as with Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo. These moves position epacadostat as a leading agent which is likely to be combined with approved, market leading PD1 antibodies. The Phase II data, which prompted these exciting additional trials, will be presented in June at the 2017 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Ionis (-16.0% in USD during 1Q 2017) announced Phase III data for volanesorsen in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). The primary endpoint - triglyceride lowering - was met, showing a 77% reduction for volanesorsen versus an 18% increase for control group patients. But in addition, investors focused on safety data - and were disappointed by reports of thrombocytopenia and injection site reactions, leading to a significant correction of Ionis' share price. Nevertheless, BB Biotech is encouraged that there were no further cases of severe thrombocytopenia nor patient dropouts during the final 6-months of the study, following implementation of a monitoring program. Ionis intends to file volanesorsen for marketing approval in the US in the third quarter of 2017. In late January, Johnson & Johnson announced their intention to acquire Actelion (+28.0% in CHF during 1Q 2017) for USD 30 bn, or USD 280 per Actelion share. BB Biotech's end of Q1 2017 position means the sale will generate around USD 270 mn in cash upon once the deal is closed. In addition, BB Biotech will receive approximately one million shares of Idorsia, the spinout company that will retain Actelion's earlier stage pipeline. The main offer period ended on March 30, 2017, by which time 73.3% of Actelion's outstanding shares had been tendered and Actelion's shareholders had voted in favor of the demerger of Idorsia. BB Biotech believes that the transaction is on track to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. Vertex (+48.4% in USD during 1Q 2017) reported positive data from two Phase III studies of Kalydeco plus VX-661 in cystic fibrosis. Slightly better efficacy, but significantly improved tolerability were reported for patients who are carriers of the F508 deletion mutation on both alleles (so-called homozygotes), compared to Vertex's other product, Orkambi. Strong clinical benefit and good tolerability were reported for patients with residual function of the CFTR gene. If approved, the combination of VX-661 and Kalydeco should enable use of the treatment both in patients with residual function and also in some patients who previously stopped their Orkambi monotherapy treatment. Additional new data for various triple combination treatments (Kalydeco, Orkambi and VX-661 together) are eagerly anticipated in the second half of 2017. Kite (+75% in USD during 1Q 2017) released positive topline results from their complete pivotal trial population given KTE-019 to treat relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The data showed an impressive overall response rate of 82% including an initial complete response rate of 49%, (31% at 6 months) in this difficult-to-treat population. The median survival of the patients had not been reached after 8.7 months of follow-up. These data compare favorably with the initial complete response rate of just 8% and median survival of 6.6 months for historical controls. BB Biotech anticipates the approval of KTE-019 by the US FDA during 2017. Esperion's share price (+182% in USD during 1Q 2017) benefited strongly from Amgen's positive cardiovascular outcomes trial data for its PCSK9 antibody, Repatha. Amgen's data demonstrated once more that lowering LDL-cholesterol levels reduces clinical cardiovascular risk. Esperion also received encouraging news that the FDA is willing to grant an initial approval based on demonstration of LDL-cholesterol lowering. Outlook BB Biotech expects the US healthcare reform debate to simmer (discussion of the Affordable Care Act continues in Congress). Unless there is rapid consensus and action, which seems unlikely, the debate seems likely to focus on access to care and coverage - rather than purely on healthcare costs. However, drug pricing may remain a popular topic for Presidential tweets, and more serious initiatives may be expected around "best-prices" and "value-based prices" during 2017 and beyond. Each of these topics - particularly when tweeted by Donald Trump - will continue to rattle media interest and investor sentiment, but the related risk appears to be priced in for some time now. In contrast to the perennial political debate around drug prices and government payment, the biopharmaceutical industry has experienced increasing pressure on drug prices and on patient access by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and private insurance companies for years. BB Biotech's long standing criteria for selecting investments in companies delivering drugs for unmet medical needs and an increasing focus on pharmaco-economic driven price policy are solid grounds for confidence in its investments. For the remainder of 2017, BB Biotech expects a series of late stage clinical trial read-outs and an increase in the number of product approvals during 2017 compared to 2016. Merger and acquisition activities are also expected to continue to drive the performance of the biotech sector from time-to-time. Johnson & Johnson's acquisition of Actelion is expected to deliver significant cash for BB Biotech in the second quarter. BB Biotech will consider selective increases in undervalued portfolio positions and continue to add promising new smaller and mid-cap positions to its investment portfolio.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Birth Control Implant Market to Witness an Outstanding Growth by 2026 New York City, NY — (SBWIRE) — 04/20/2017 — Birth control implants are devices that are highly effective in preventing pregnancy for a short period. These implants are placed sub-dermally and contain progestin, release of which stops ovulation. It also leads to thickening of the vaginal fluid that avoids fertilization by preventing sperms from reaching the egg. It also causes thinning of uterine lining that makes it difficult for the fertilised egg to attach onto it. Birth control implants are reversible contraceptive birth controls and have very low failure rate and if properly placed are able to avoid pregnancy for three years. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/12052 The insertion and removal of the Birth control implants are done by healthcare professional after taking into consideration several other implications such as, history of blood clots, pregnancy, diabetes, breast cancer and heart, liver or kidney problems. These Birth control implants are also often associated with certain side effects such as headaches, acne or other pains. The Birth control implants now available are of single rod devices containing progestin, however, the first contraceptive implant that was developed and marketed as Norplant consisted of 6 rods. With further studies and researches, a 2-rod system that contained levonorgestrel with name Jadelle was eventually approved by FDA but was not, however marketed in United States. Later, in 1988, a single-rod implant containing etonogestrel, named Implanon entered the international market of birth control and was widely accepted for its convenience and better results. The 6 rod system was inconvenient and had difficulty with insertion and removal and thus was eventually removed from the US market. The 2-rod implant that was easier and better than 6-rod implants has been registered in 11 countries for birth control. The Birth control implants maker, Merck & Co. is phasing out its product Implanon and replacing it with its own another product Nexplanon. The Birth control implants market is a steadily growing market owing to the rise in awareness among people for birth control measures. The rise in the number of people undergoing treatments and the steady increase in the procedural volume implies that the market will be pushed further up in the forthcoming years. With not much competitors and products in the birth control implants market, the established key players have an added advantage. Technological innovations will keep driving the birth control implant market. However, the regulations related to the approval of the Birth control implants tend to restrain the market. The cost of these birth control implants and their inability for protection against STD’s act as another drawback. Advancements such as Nexplanon, which was launched in 2011 by Merck & Co. at United States. The Worldwide sales of Birth control implants by Merck & Co., that consist of Implanon and Nexplanon rose to $588 million in the year 2015 which indicates a 17% increase compared to 2014. This implies that these birth control products have a higher demand in the United States and the emerging markets. The birth control implant Jadelle, was developed and licensed by The Population Council. Further research and development activities pertaining to birth control implants are being undertaken with partnership with WomanCare Global. In 2016, Bayer announced its birth control implant Jadelle will be available at half the price until 2023, in order to cater to the needs of the poor. Thus, focusing and expanding its customer base to the emerging economies. Other birth control implants, such as Nesterone™ and Capronor™ comprising of different progestins, and biodegradable rods, pellets or microcapsules are under developmental stages. Geographically, Birth control implants is classified into regions viz. North America, Latin America, Europe, APAJ, Middle East and Africa. North America and Europe will remain key markets for Birth control implants due to rising awareness about the better results, hence a proportional increase in treatment procedures. The emerging regions are also anticipated to attain higher growth in the forecasted period for birth control implants market.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 20, 2017 4:05pm   Comments Share: WALTHAM, Mass., April 20, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Syndax," the "Company" or "we") (NASDAQ:SNDX), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing entinostat and SNDX-6352 in multiple cancer indications, today announced a poster presentation highlighting entinostat at the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting being held June 2-6, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois. The poster will feature data from the ongoing phase 2 ENCORE 601 trial of entinostat in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for the treatment of advanced melanoma patients who had progressed on prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Poster Presentation: Title: ENCORE 601: A phase II study of entinostat (ENT) in combination with pembrolizumab (PEMBRO) in patients with melanoma First Author: Melissa Lynne Johnson, MD, Sarah Cannon Research Institute Abstract Number: 9529 Poster Session: Melanoma/Skin Cancers Poster Board: 137 Date and Time: Saturday, June 3, 2017, 1:15-4:45 PM CT About Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Syndax is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative pipeline of cancer therapies. Our lead product candidate, entinostat, which was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA following positive results from our Phase 2b clinical trial, ENCORE 301, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial for advanced hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer. Given its potential ability to block the function of immune suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment, entinostat is also being evaluated in combination with approved PD-1 antagonists. Ongoing Phase 1b/2 clinical trials combine entinostat with KEYTRUDA from Merck & Co., Inc. for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma; with TECENTRIQ from Genentech, Inc. for TNBC; and with BAVENCIO from Pfizer Inc. and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, for ovarian cancer. Our second product candidate, SNDX-6352, is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the CSF-1 receptor and may also block the function of immune suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment. SNDX-6352 is being evaluated in a single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial and is expected to be developed to treat a variety of cancers.

Devastation Elizabeth Balboa , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} April 20, 2017 1:38pm   Comments Share: Neither Republicans nor Democrats are eager to cut the National Institutes of Health funding by the president’s suggested $5.8 billion, but with the proposal still on the table, the sum is not yet safe. And as 18 percent of the current $31.7 billion budget hangs in the balance, more Americans ought to be on the edge of their seats. “That’s a huge number,” Jason Napodano, managing director of BioNap Consulting, told Benzinga. “That’s a big number, 18 percent, and I think it could have potentially devastating effects in the years to come.” Limiting Seeds The NIH provides grant money critical to health research and drug development. Funds generally support academic institutions, private research firms and small pharmaceuticals, which then purchase equipment and eventually sell preclinical candidates to major pharmaceuticals. “The NIH in some instances is the very beginning of a lot of discovery that eventually turns into an idea that turns into a drug that gets in a trial and wins approval, so [the cut] is at the very early stage,” FBB Capital's Mike Bailey said. A disruption early in the schedule, then, could generate sector-wide upheaval. Although, it may go unnoticed for some time. The chain of events between initial NIH funding and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval sometimes takes between five and 20 years, so a delay in the foremost step is ultimately a delay in the decades-long process to get a drug into a patient’s system. Napodano drew this metaphor: A lush forest — or market of drugs — is the product of a small fraction of planted seeds — or early-stage research. Grant-reliant universities sow, while pharmaceutical companies reap. “I think it starts small, but what I think people need to be aware of is that these [molecules] are the seeds that start the forest,” he said. And when those seeds dry up, so does the spectrum of available drugs. Lab Droughts Essentially, the profitability of major industry players is largely tied to academic or private preclinical lab work — nearly all of which is grant-dependent. “People experiment and investigate at the university level, and then if something looks interesting, maybe one out of a thousand of molecules being investigated at the university level get spun out or scooped up into an actual biotech company,” Napodano said. “If a fifth of all the molecules that are being developed in academic labs right now dries up, you could see a significant ramification in a few years down the line with small startup biotech companies not being as prevalent because they are primarily getting these molecules from universities and small startup grants like this.” He estimated that the majority of biotech companies and university labs receive at least some NIH funding for any number of projects. Big Pharma Their funding restrictions could cripple major pharmaceuticals vulnerable to licensing droughts. The budgets of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE: NVS), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY), Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE: GSK) will remain relatively unaffected, as most generate funds through stock issuance and sales revenue rather than grants. But they’ll suffer from the loss of preclinical research. “I think [the NIH cut] will be a huge negative because Pfizer [for example] is an in-licensing machine,” Napodano said. The company spent nearly $7.9 billion on research and development with the majority of expenses acquiring large, late-stage programs, Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials and post-approval molecules from other industry players. “Pfizer is going to spend money to acquire and in-license a lot of the preclinical and small molecules to fill in its pipeline, and it’s going to spend its heavy R&D dollars on the late-stage stuff,” Napodano said. “So if the early stage stuff starts to dry up at the academic level or the small bio level, that’s less hunting that Pfizer gets to do with the dollars that it’s allocated for its early-stage pipeline.” The result could be “devastating,” both for Pfizer and its peers, as each approved drug comes from more than one thousand preclinical drugs, per Napodano’s estimation. In other words, for every thousand preclinical investigations, only one drug ever makes it to market. “If that ratio starts to get worse, you’ll see efficiency drop, and ultimately you’ll see profitability drop,” he said, adding that $5.8 billion generally supports thousands or tens of thousands of early clinical programs. But despite the early phase implications of an NIH cut, Bailey said he’s not too concerned for large-cap pharmaceuticals. “If we were to see something more dramatic, some meaningful cut in an NIH budget paired with something else, some drug pricing controls or some other really negative trends or regulations, that’s when I’d probably start thinking, ‘OK, let’s start adding up these pieces,’ but at this point, I think that the NIH cut just doesn’t really fit with the investment timeframe for a ‘Pfizer,’” he said. Small Pharma “Where the $5.8 billion getting cut hurts is the small companies that are asking for $500,000 grants, $1 million grants, because that’s all preclinical and Phase 1 studies cost,” Bailey added. Largely at risk are Phase 2 “proof of concept” programs funded by the NIH, particularly those of small, private companies unable to raise capital through stock issuance. However, a few publicly traded companies are exposed to the cutbacks. For example, the Institute currently funds Phase 2 clinical trials for Matinas BioPharma Holdings Inc (NYSE: MTNB)’s lead antifungal agent and Vistagen Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: VTGN)’s antidepressant candidate. The results of their $1- to $2-billion studies will be “instrumental” in supporting design for future trial programs and could have “significant ramifications” on stock price, market value and capacity to raise additional funds through the market. These factors, in turn, could limit the potential to advance their pipelines. As established companies like Matinas and Vistagen rest in jeopardy, those aspiring to follow their paths may never even move beyond early concepts. “Those are two examples of small companies that I think are developing potentially breakthrough new molecules that wouldn’t be where they are today without significant NIH funding for clinical programs,” Napodano said. “If the NIH budgets were to be cut by a fifth, that might be a [type of] program that going forward might not have gotten funded, so a company like Metinas that has what I think is a pretty powerful anti-infectant in stage two might not even be able to get where they are without NIH support.” Burets And Forceps Life sciences and tools companies are also vulnerable to the funding cuts. “There’s kind of historically a fairly close link between NIH spending and demand for some of these research tools,” Bailey said. The NIH or grant-dependent researchers could slash allocations for lab instruments, putting companies such as Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ: ILMN) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO) at risk. However, the magnitude of impact may be relatively small. Global sales could cushion cutbacks by the NIH and primary grant recipients, “so order magnitude, maybe a 10-percent NIH cut is a 5-percent or a 3-percent cut — something like that,” Bailey said. “They sort of water down the impact of those companies.” Labs For Hire And then there are contract research companies, such as Quintiles IMS Holdings Inc (NYSE: Q) and PAREXEL International Corporation (NASDAQ: PRXL), which perform outsourced, early-phase trials for the likes of Pfizer. Funding-strapped clients may limit services from these small- to mid-cap firms. “So if there is some kind of delay or slowdown in, let’s say, early stage research, that may hit some of these contract research companies,” Bailey said. What’s $5.8 Million, Anyway? At the end of the day, the jury is still out as to the large-scale impact of an NIH budget cut. “At this point I’m not too concerned,” Bailey said. “Having seen the NIH cuts before and then the budget ramps up, it’s really hard for me to detect kind of a straight mind from either a budget cut or a spike going to faster drug through-put for a Pfizer. I think about it as noise, frankly. I’m not that scared about it.” But Napodano is convinced of long-term effects. “That’s a big number, and it’s something that the market needs to pay attention to because you’re planting less seeds, and in this kind of business, you always have to be planting seeds because 99 percent of your seeds are going to die,” Napodano said. “I don't think you’re going to notice anything immediately, but again, it’s because you’re not looking at is ‘are there giant trees falling over,’ what you’re looking at is ‘are there less seeds being planted.’” Related Links: Trump: Drug Industry Is Getting Away With Murder President Trump Plans To Spend $54 Billion More On Defense Posted-In: News Education Health Care Politics FDA Legal Exclusives Trading Ideas Best of Benzinga © 2017 Benzinga.com.

The Antibacterial Drug Market report predicts market size, in-depth multi-scenario market forecast and company analysis. Pune, India - April 20, 2017 /MarketersMedia/ -- The antibacterial drug market covers the drugs used in the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial infections. With a growing global concern over antimicrobial resistance and its progressive growth, there is a pronounced need for innovation within this market. Browse 27 Tables and 76 Figures, 10 Companies Spread across 177 pages is available @ http://www.reportsnreports.com/contacts/discount.aspx?name=956399 . Company Analysis Profiled are Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co, Allergan, Cempra, Insmed, Otsuka, Roche, Bayer and AstraZeneca. The report, Global Antibacterial Drugs Market to 2022 - Vaccines Retain Market Prominence While Pipeline Offers Innovative Approaches to Tackling Antimicrobial Resistance, states that emerging companies and the approvals of new products will drive this growth, along with the continued success of the established marketed products Infanrix, which vaccinates against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, and Augmentin, which is amoxicillin sodium and clavulanate potassium. The antibacterial market is currently dominated by vaccines, in particular those for the prevention of pneumococcal infections, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. However, recent years have seen key additions in the form of therapies for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including strains with multi-drug resistance. The number of such products is expected to increase drastically between 2016 and 2022. Drugs for the prevention of bacterial infections are typically vaccines, which help to train the body's immune system to fight off specific infections, and can therefore help to prevent infections of certain bacterial strains. However, several prophylactic monoclonal antibodies are also currently in development. Drugs for the treatment of bacterial infections are slightly more varied. Most common are beta-lactam antibiotics, which include the very widely prescribed penicillin. However, bacteria have developed resistance to penicillin by producing beta-lactamase enzymes that break open the beta-lactam ring found in these antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. As a result modern beta-lactams are frequently combination drugs of a beta-lactam and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Order a Copy of Report @ http://www.reportsnreports.com/purchase.aspx?name=956399 .In addition to beta-lactams there are several other classes of drugs used to treat bacterial infections. These include fluoroquinolones, which inhibit DNA gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV; and protein synthesis inhibitors, which have applications within the treatment of bacteria that are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, bacterial resistance has also developed against these drugs, and as such there is a gap in the market for a new generation of drugs that are effective against drug-resistant bacteria. Scope Antibiotic resistance has caused a surge in the development of antibiotics: o How big is the antibiotic pipeline? o How are companies attempting to overcome antibiotic resistance? The Antibacterial Drug Market is forecast to rise from around $27.1 billion in 2015 to $35.6 billion in 2022: o How much will the approval of new products and the patent expiries of existing ones contribute to this market growth? o Will vaccines continue to drive market revenue? The pipeline contains a range of molecular targets: o Which molecular targets are most popular in the current pipeline? o How many late-stage products are active against drug-resistant bacteria? o What are the commercial prospects for the most promising late-stage pipeline products? Big Pharma maintains a strong presence within the antibacterial drug market: o Which of the leading companies are expected to have the highest share of the market by 2022? o Which of the leading pharmaceutical companies are expected to bring new products to market during the forecast period? o Which companies rely heavily of revenues derived from antibacterial drugs?

provided by Transparency Market Research 20 Apr, 2017, 09:00 ET Share this article ALBANY, New York, April 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The global market for Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics is expected to witness a high level of competition in the next few years, thanks to the rising number of players entering the market, states a research study by Transparency Market Research. A substantial rise in the number of collaborations between small companies with the leading players is estimated to encourage the growth of the market in the forecast period. This is expected to help the prominent players in the market in reducing the high cost required for the research and development activities and production processes. Some of the players, namely Pfizer Inc., Bayer AG, Sanofi, Merck & Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Plc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Novartis AG, and AbbVie Inc. are projected to lead the global Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics Market throughout the forecast period. According to the research report by Transparency Market Research, in 2015, the global Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics Market was worth US$86.7 bn. The market is estimated to reach a value of US$245.8 bn by the end of 2024, exhibiting a progressive 12.60% CAGR between 2016 and 2024. Favorable Reimbursement Policies to Bolster North America and Europe Markets  From a geographical point of view, the North America market for monoclonal antibody therapeutics is anticipated to witness a healthy growth and account for a key share of the market in the near future. North America is projected to be followed by Europe. The rapid growth of these two regions can be attributed to the rising geriatric population and the rising number of favorable reimbursement policies. In addition, the rising awareness among consumers regarding the availability of drugs and therapeutics in order to cure diseases and the affordable healthcare services are some of the other important factors that are likely to accelerate the growth of the market in the next few years. Furthermore, Asia Pacific is projected to witness a steady growth in the coming years. In terms of application, the autoimmune diseases segment is likely to account for a key share of the global Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics Market throughout the forecast period. The rising investments in research and development activities and the growing awareness among consumers related to the rising cases of autoimmune diseases are expected to encourage the growth of this segment in the next few years. In addition, the expansion of the monoclonal antibody therapeutics is another factor projected to accelerate the development of the market in the coming years. Advancements in Healthcare Facilities to Augment Global Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics Market  The rising number of cases of chronic diseases, including cancer is expected to encourage the growth of the global Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics Market in the next few years.

The rising production and popularity of biosimilars for the treatment of several chronic disorders and autoimmune diseases are estimated to hamper the development of the global market in the coming years. In addition, the rising concerns related to the patent expiry are predicted to restrict the overall development of the market.

According to Pint, there are approximately 10,000 new cases of AML diagnosed per year in Latin America and there is currently no approved treatment for the maintenance of  AML remission. „We are excited about the possibility of partnering with Pint Pharma, a market leader in Latin America with strong commercialization capabilities in the field of oncology. Pint Pharma’s desire to bring Ceplene/IL-2 immunotherapy to patients in Latin America  complements our strategy,” said Dr Daniel Teper, CEO of Immune. „Adding Ceplene to our portfolio of products will further leverage our experience and presence in the oncology field in Latin America,” said David Munoz, Chief Executive Office at Pint. „We are delighted to potentially have Immune as a committed partner to help strengthen our product portfolio.” Dr. Massimo Radaelli, Executive Chairman of Pint Pharma, has served as an independent director of Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. until  2016. He has held the position of President and CEO of Dompe International SA and previously held senior executive positions at Roche, Menarini and DuPont Merck. „We are very enthusiastic about this potential partnership with Immune and Cytovia which is developing much needed therapies in oncology,” said Dr. Radaelli. „We believe we can leverage the high unmet need  for relapse preventive immunotherapy to potentially accelerate the registration and commercial availability of Ceplene in Latin America for patients suffering from AML.” About Ceplene Ceplene (histamine dihydrochloride) is administered in conjunction with low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2), for maintenance of first remission in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). It has been shown in clinical studies to prevent leukemic relapses in AML patients in first remission and prolong leukemia-free survival while maintaining good quality of life during treatment.  Ceplene acts by enhancing the immunostimulatory effect of IL-2 and countering ROS-induced dysfunction and apoptosis of T and NK cells, thereby inducing immune-mediated killing of leukemic cells, providing a strong rationale for this combination therapy. A recent Phase IV study presented at the meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in 2016 confirmed the safety and efficacy of Ceplene in the international study that supported European approval. About Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) AML patients receive intensive induction treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs at diagnosis and typically become free of detectable leukemia, achieving „complete remission.” However, within 1-2 years, the majority (75-80%) of adult patients will experience a relapse of leukemia, with a survival prognosis of 33% in younger patients and 15-20% in patients over 60 years of age. According to the American Cancer Society, there will be approximately 21,380 new cases of AML and 10,590 deaths from AML in the US in 2017. The prognosis following first remission is poor and there are no other effective remission therapies currently available. AML represents an orphan condition with high unmet need. About Immune Pharmaceuticals Inc.    Immune Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: IMNP) applies a personalized approach to treating and developing novel, highly targeted antibody therapeutics to improve the lives of patients with inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immune’s lead product candidate, bertilimumab, is in Phase II clinical development for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis as well as for bullous pemphigoid, an orphan autoimmune dermatological condition. Other indications being considered for development include atopic dermatitis, Crohn’s disease, severe asthma and Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis (NASH), an inflammatory liver disease. Immune recently expanded its portfolio in immuno-dermatology with topical nano-formulated cyclosporine-A for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Immune’s oncology subsidiary, Cytovia, plans to develop Ceplene for maintenance remission in AML in combination with IL-2. Additional oncology pipeline products include Azixa® and crolibulin, Phase II clinical stage vascular disrupting agents, and novel technology platforms; bispecific antibodies and NanomAbs™.

(NASDAQ: IMNP) ("Immune" or "Immune Pharma") announced today that it has entered into a letter of intent with Pint Pharma GmnH, a pharmaceutical company focused on Latin America and other markets ("Pint"), which binds the parties to seek agreement regarding an exclusive license by Pint of the rights to commercialize Ceplene throughout Latin America, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. Immune and Pint target closing a final agreement within 30 days. Pursuant to the anticipated final agreement, Pint will be responsible for registration of Ceplene in Latin American countries based on the existing European marketing authorization and will carry out the full commercialization of the licensed product in the territory, including Ceplene registration, pricing and reimbursement, and sales and marketing activities.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Vaccine Market Research Report : : Brand Analysis and Forecast upto 2020 Over the past few years, the vaccine industry has established itself as one of the fastest-growing healthcare market segments. Vaccination has been of great help to public health. It has saved lives of millions of children, adults and animals, and provided them a better and healthier life. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diseases such as diphtheria, smallpox and polio have been completely eradicated while diseases such as measles, rubella and tetanus have been better controlled in the U.S. Thus, vaccination is considered as the most effective form of all preventive measures. The U.S. vaccine market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 4.3% during the forecast period between 2014 and 2020. The market has been broadly segmented into human and animal vaccines. The U.S. human vaccine market is expected to grow under the influence of factors such as low risk of serious and fatal side effects with vaccination, growing awareness regarding vaccination among common people as well as healthcare providers, federal government’s strict recommendations for immunization against certain diseases and growing demand for adult vaccines. On the other hand, the growth of the U.S. animal vaccine market is expected to be driven by the rising incidence of zoonotic diseases in animals and high risk of their transfer to humans, increasing pet ownership, and rising consumption of poultry meat, among other factors. Recently approved animal vaccines such as Prime Pac PRRS+ and Once PMH IN are also expected to drive the market growth in terms of revenue, primarily due to high prices associated with them. Browse full report on Vaccine Market – www.transparencymarketresearch.com/us-vaccine-market.html On the other hand, stringent regulatory approval process and high cost associated with new vaccine discovery and development is expected to affect market growth during the forecast period. Transportation, storage and handling of vaccines are the major challenges faced by manufacturers and distributors. For more than 90% of all vaccines, manufacturers have to rely on cold chain logistics to prevent loss of potency and efficacy by exposure to temperatures outside the recommended range which results in high maintenance costs. Therefore, the high cost associated with transportation, storage and handling of vaccines is also expected to hamper growth of the vaccine market. The human vaccine market is further segmented into pediatric and adult vaccines, based on vaccine type. However, on the basis of different antigens, the U.S. human vaccine market has been categorized into hepatitis, influenza, meningococcal, pneumococcal, human papillomavirus (HPV), combination vaccines and others. The combination vaccines market represented the largest segment of the human vaccine market in terms of revenue in 2013. The combination vaccines segment includes combination vaccines for diphtheria and tetanus along with other antigens such as pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenza type B. The pneumococcal vaccines market is projected to emerge as the largest segment in 2020, primarily due to the expected strong increase in the sales of Prevnar 13 during the forecast period. The meningococcal vaccine market has been identified as the fastest growing segment during the forecast period. This is primarily due to the anticipated launch of pipeline products during the forecast period. The animal vaccines market in the U.S. has been broadly classified as companion and livestock vaccines. The companion animal vaccines segment has been further categorized into canine and feline, while the livestock vaccines segment has been divided into porcine, bovine, ovine, poultry and equine sub-segments. The canine vaccines segment accounted for a slightly larger share (in terms of revenue) than the feline vaccines segment in 2013, due to higher average cost associated with canine vaccination. Of livestock vaccines, the bovine vaccine market accounted for the largest share in terms of revenue in 2013, followed by porcine. However, the poultry vaccines segment has been projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period from 2014 to 2020. The U.S. human vaccine market is dominated by players such as GlaxoSmithKline plc, Sanofi, Pfizer, Ltd., Merck & Co., Inc., and Novartis International AG. These players compete with each other by introducing new and innovative vaccines. Zoetis, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck Animal Health), Sanofi (Merial, animal health division of Sanofi) and Boehringer Ingelheim are the major companies in the U.S. animal vaccine market. Of these, Zoetis, Inc. was the largest stake holder in 2013, followed by Merck & Co., Inc. and Sanofi.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Therapeutics Market to Grow at a CAGR of 1.80% During the Period 2017 – 2021; Finds New Report Lewes, DE — (SBWIRE) — 04/20/2017 — Report forecast the global hypertrophic cardiomyopathy therapeutics market to grow at a CAGR of 1.80% during the period 2017-2021. HCM is the enlargement of the heart muscle (myocardium), which disrupts the functions of the heart. HCM is mostly caused due to gene mutation and is a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in any age group. Hypertrophy is defined as an enlargement of a tissue or organ, and cardiomyopathy refers to diseases related to heart muscles. Therefore, HCM is defined as a condition, which is characterized by abnormal thickening of heart muscles, which makes pumping of blood from the heart to various organs difficult. Therefore, the heart must induce more pressure to pump blood to various vital organs. The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global hypertrophic cardiomyopathy therapeutics market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, the report presents a detailed picture of the market by way of study, synthesis, and summation of data from multiple sources. The market is divided into the following segments based on geography: – Americas – APAC – EMEA According to the report, one driver in market is increasing cases of HF. HCM is an extended form of a diastolic HF when the heart fails to perform its functions normally. The diastolic HF occurs when the lower left chamber or the LV is not filled properly with blood during the diastolic phase. Therefore, the amount of pumped blood is less than the normal. Similarly, in HCM, the increasing myocardium size results in smaller LV cavity size accompanied by impairment of blood flow. This leads to the common symptoms of both HCM and HF such as dyspnoea, angina, palpitations, syncope, and presyncope. Hence, the drug development for relieving the symptoms of HF benefits the global HCM therapeutics market as well. As per the CDC, more than five million people are living with HF in the US, and about half of the affected population succumb within five years of diagnosis. However, the deaths due to HF have significantly declined in the past few years due to improved therapies to treat the disease. However, the risk of developing HF continues to rise with the increasing population. This risk-factor has further triggered R&D for newer drugs, which can be repurposed for the diagnosis and treatment of HCM. The traditional HCM drug market has a long history of repurposed drugs for its prevention and cure.

The summit coincided with the launch of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Fourth Report on NTDs, showing transformational progress against these debilitating diseases, and a commitment by the United Kingdom to more than double its funding for NTDs. The meeting comes five years after the launch of the London Declaration on NTDs, a commitment by the public and private sectors to achieve the WHO goals for the control, elimination and eradication of 10 NTDs. Currently, billions worth of treatments have been donated by pharmaceutical companies and delivered to impoverished communities in nearly 150 countries, reaching nearly a billion people in 2015. NTDs are some of the oldest and most painful diseases, afflicting the world’s poorest communities. One in six people suffer from NTDs worldwide, including more than half a billion children. NTDs disable, debilitate and perpetuate cycles of poverty, keeping children out of school, parents out of work, and dampening hope of any chance of an economic future. New Report Shows Dramatic Progress A new report titled Integrating Neglected Tropical Diseases in Global Health and Development by the WHO revealed that more people are being reached with the needed NTD interventions than ever before. In 2015, nearly a billion people received treatments donated by pharmaceutical companies for at least one NTD, representing a 36 percent increase since 2011, the year before the launch of the London Declaration. As more districts, countries and regions eliminate NTDs, the number of people requiring treatments has decreased from 2 billion in 2010 to 1.6 billion in 2015. “WHO has observed record-breaking progress towards bringing ancient scourges like sleeping sickness and elephantiasis to their knees,” says WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan. “Over the past 10 years, millions of people have been rescued from disability and poverty, thanks to one of the most effective global partnerships in modern public health.” The report detailed progress against each disease, citing countries and regions that are reaching the control and elimination goals for specific NTDs. Highlights include: Lymphatic Filariasis (LF): In the last year, eight countries (Cambodia, Cook Islands, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Niue, Sri Lanka, Togo and Vanuatu) eliminated LF, and 10 other countries are waiting on surveillance results to verify elimination. Thanks to strong programs, the number of people globally requiring preventative treatment has dropped from 1.4 billion in 2011 to fewer than 950 million in 2015. Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT, or sleeping sickness): in 2015, there were fewer reported cases of sleeping sickness than any other year in history, with fewer than 3,000 cases worldwide – an 89 percent reduction since 2000. Innovative vector control and diagnostic technologies, supported by increasing numbers of product development partnerships, are revolutionizing sleeping sickness diagnosis, prevention and treatment. There was an eighty-two percent decrease in Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) cases in India, Nepal and Bangladesh: Since 2008, cases of VL across India, Nepal and Bangladesh have decreased by 82 percent due to improvements in vector control, social mobilization of village volunteers, collaboration with other NTD programs and drug donations from industry partners. Guinea worm disease nearing eradication: Cases of Guinea worm disease have reduced from an estimated 3.5 million in 1986 to just 25 human cases in 2016 in just three countries – Chad, Ethiopia and South Sudan. Global Donors Pledge Additional Support Governments and other donors announced new commitments at the summit to expand the reach and impact of NTD programs around the world. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation committed $335 million in grants over the next four years to support a diverse group of NTD programs focused on drug development and delivery, disease surveillance and vector control. The commitment includes $42 million to support The Carter Center’s guinea worm eradication initiative, as well as dedicated funding to accelerate the elimination of African sleeping sickness. “NTDs are some of the most painful, debilitating and stigmatizing diseases that affect the world’s poorest communities. That’s why we helped launch the London Declaration, a historic milestone that led to significant progress in treating and reducing the spread of NTDs and demonstrated the impact that the public sector, the private sector, communities and NGOs can have by working together,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “Thanks to this partnership, these neglected diseases are now getting the attention they deserve so fewer people have to suffer from these treatable conditions. There have been many successes in the past five years, but the job is not done yet. We have set ambitious targets for 2020 that require the continued commitment of pharmaceutical companies, donor and recipient governments, and frontline health workers to ensure drugs are available and delivered to the hardest to reach people.” The Belgian government also pledged an additional $27 million, spread equally over the next nine years, toward the elimination of sleeping sickness in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This amount will be matched for the next three years by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, establishing a platform for increased collaboration between Belgium, the DRC and the broader NTD partnership. As part of its commitment to eliminating HAT, Vestergaard pledged to donate 20 percent of its insecticide-treated “tiny targets” used to control the tsetse flies that carry the disease, scaling over the next three years towards 100 percent as elimination nears. These commitments build on the UK Government’s announcement earlier this week, in which it pledged almost $450 million over 5 years to support NTD control and elimination efforts around the world. Industry Contributions Expand Scale and Reach of NTD Program Progress against NTDs has been enabled by the large-scale donation of medicines by 10 pharmaceutical companies. In the five years since the London Declaration, companies have donated over 7 billion treatments that, with the support of partners, now reach nearly 1 billion people every year. These donations, worth an estimated $19 billion from 2012 through 2020, greatly multiply the impact of donor investments; USAID estimates that each dollar invested in delivery leverages $26 worth of donated drugs. Industry leaders in a statement reaffirmed their 2012 pledge to do their part to beat these diseases and encouraged other sectors to maintain their commitments as well. “The London Declaration is a powerful example of the impact of successful partnerships,” said Haruo Naito, CEO of Eisai, an original signatory of the London Declaration. “By leveraging our resources and focusing on a common goal, we are already making unprecedented progress towards eliminating these horrific diseases. The work we are doing today is a long-term investment into a healthier and more prosperous future.” In addition to donations, pharmaceutical companies are working together with research institutes to discover and develop new tools to prevent, diagnose and treat NTDs. A report released today by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations collected the full scope of industry investment in NTD R&D, including: Sanofi and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) are developing a new oral drug candidate for HAT called Exinidazole, which would replace the current mixed oral-intravenous drug regimen. Fexinidazole could represent a therapeutic breakthrough which will support sustainable elimination efforts as per the WHO roadmap for 2020. The drug is expected to be submitted for regulatory approval later in 2017. Several companies are working to develop pediatric formulations of existing NTD medicines, including Bayer (Nifurtimox, for Chagas disease), Merck KGaA (Praziquantel, for schistosomiasis), and Elea/Mundo Sano (who are working with DNDi to develop a second pediatric source of benznidazole, for Chagas disease), while Johnson & Johnson (mebendazole, for soil-transmitted helminths) developed a new chewable form of mebendazole, recently approved by the FDA, for children too young to swallow. AbbVie, Bayer, Eisai, Johnson & Johnson and Merck KGaA are part of the Macrofilaricide Drug Accelerator Program, an initiative aimed at identifying and generating new drug compounds that can kill the adult worms that cause onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. Bayer is working with DNDi to develop Emodepside, an oral treatment for lymphatic filariasis and river blindness Eisai is working with DNDi to develop Ravuconazole, a new oral drug currently in clinical trials for Chagas disease, and is partnering with DNDi to develop Ravuconazole in a new disease area, mycetoma. GlaxoSmithKline and DNDi have agreed to jointly pursue the pre-clinical development of the two novel candidates for the treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis; the candidates were developed by a collaboration between GSK and the University of Dundee’s Drug Discovery Unit, and the work was funded by Wellcome. The agreement for pre-clinical development will be conditional on signing an additional agreement. In 2015, Eisai, Shionogi, Takeda, AstraZeneca and DNDi launched the NTD Drug Discovery Booster, a multi-company effort to accelerate the discovery of new drugs for Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. In 2016 they were joined by Celgene Global Health. Merck KGaA announced today that it will join the consortium. Many companies – including AbbVie, Astra Zeneca, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Chemo, Daiichi Sankyo, Eisai, Elea, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck KGaA, MSD, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi, Shionogi, and Takeda – have given DNDi and other non-profits access to their compound libraries and/or contribute scientific and technical expertise to DNDi and conduct pre-clinical and clinical studies to facilitate the development of new drugs to combat various NTDs. Gilead is collaborating with the US Department of Defense, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health as well as multiple academic institutions to discover and develop novel antiviral drugs for highly pathogenic infections and neglected/emerging viral diseases, including dengue fever. GS-5734, Gilead’s most advanced investigational agent, is currently being studied in Ebola survivors. Companies are also working with partners to solve supply chain problems, develop program strategies and build in-country capacity to ensure that drugs, tools and other interventions reach those who need them most. Addressing the Challenges Ahead Though tremendous progress has been made in reducing the burden of NTDs, global control and elimination targets cannot be met without increased financial support, stronger political commitment and better tools to prevent, diagnose and treat the diseases. This week, partners from private philanthropy, affected country governments and cross-sector partnerships recommitted to leveraging their respective resources and expertise to fill critical gaps. Financial Resources Although nearly a billion people received NTD treatments in 2015, more funding is needed to ensure that NTD programs reach all people and communities affected by the diseases. WHO estimates that 340 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa could be covered by new investments of $150 million per year through the year 2020. In addition to government commitments, private philanthropy is helping to address these gaps by supporting drug delivery and surveillance programs, as well as research and development into new medicines, diagnostics and other health tools. The END Fund, founded shortly after the London Declaration, has raised over $75 million to target the five most common NTDs, helping to treat over 145 million people around the world. Political Commitment Strong leadership from affected countries is vital to sustaining progress against NTDs, particularly in the face of shifting economic climates and competing health priorities. Despite these challenges, some countries are increasing financing for NTD programs and integrating them into national health systems. Among other countries, Ethiopia has made significant strides in fighting trachoma by including progress against the disease as a target in its national health plan, providing significant domestic funding, participating in the Global Trachoma Mapping Project and training surgeons to conduct eye-lid surgeries to correct the effects of trachoma. “Ethiopia is fully committed to realizing ambitious, yet achievable, elimination targets for trachoma and other NTDs with proactive program coordination,” said H.E Professor Yifru Berhan Mitke, Ethiopian Minister of Health. “An increased direct program financial contribution by the government to NTDs, as high as 3 million USD by 2016, is a big step forward in alleviating the burden and stigma of these diseases.” New Tools and Innovations To meet control and elimination targets, more research and development is needed to provide NTD programs with improved tools to prevent, detect and treat the diseases. Promising new therapies are in the pipeline: A new three-drug regimen for LF known as triple therapy has the potential to dramatically accelerate the pace of elimination in affected countries and is currently on large-scale safety trials in India. R&D organizations such as PATH and partnerships like DNDi and the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund have catalyzed the development of better and more cost-effective tools. These innovations, which include new drugs and rapid diagnostic tests for sleeping sickness and river blindness, are especially critical in the low-resource settings most burdened by NTDs. Several new vector control tools are under development and being piloted to address the growing problem of diseases transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. Rest of NTDs are: Onchocerciasis (River blindness); Schistosomiasis; soil-transmitted helminths; Chagas and Leprosy.

(PRWEB) April 20, 2017 A new clinical trial at Sanford Health examines whether medications that are FDA-approved for one cancer can effectively treat another. Sanford Health locations in Sioux Falls, Fargo and Bismarck are participating in this national effort. The Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry Study, or TAPUR, is sponsored by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the world’s leading organization representing oncologists. Precision medicine, which targets treatments based on genetics and changes unique to a specific person’s cancer, allows oncologists to provide individualized treatments that attack cancer at a molecular level. “Precision cancer therapy shows great promise, but despite our advances in genetic testing, treatment options have been limited,” said Steven Powell, M.D., the principal investigator for Sanford Health sites. “ASCO’s TAPUR study will increase the treatment options for our patients.” Patients who have had genomic testing and are identified to have a targetable alteration qualify for the study and will gain access to treatments matched to their needs. Right now, the study is for adults with advanced cancers that have progressed on standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists. Three medical oncologists from Sanford Health are principal investigators in the trial: Steven Powell, M.D., Sioux Falls; Anu Gaba, M.D., Fargo; and John Reynolds, M.D., Bismarck. Seven pharmaceutical companies are participating and have volunteered to give medications to this effort. As more companies sign on, more drugs that target additional cancers may be added to the trial. AstraZeneca, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Co., Genetech, Merck and Pfizer are participating. The study is open to cancer patients ages 18 and older who are no longer benefitting from standard anti-cancer treatment. To enroll, call 1-87-SURVIVAL.

Bill Gates. Picture: AFP. Bill Gates The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Email Print Tweet Share Reuters | 21 hours ago GENEVA – The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Western countries and drug companies pledged fresh support on Wednesday to wipe out diseases that blind, disable and disfigure millions of poor in tropical areas each year and urged new donors to join the fight. Some 1.5 billion people, mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, are infected with one of 18 neglected tropical diseases known as NTDs, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said. One billion of them are receiving treatment, half of them children. "The best thing with these diseases is not to debate whether they are neglected or not, but to proceed to make them history," Bill Gates told a global partners' meeting held at WHO. "We need a broader, deeper bench of investors... so that by 2030 we can achieve the goal of reaching 90% of the people who need treatment. I know this is achievable." Gates, who has supported the initiative for over a decade with $1 billion, pledged $335 million over the next 4 years, including $42 million to continue efforts to wipe out Guinea-worm disease. The crippling disease, transmitted by contaminated water, can lead to a 100 cm long worm growing in the body. "Guinea worm is one of our great success stories, even though we're not absolutely at zero, we are down to very small numbers. Thirty years ago over 3 million people in over 20 countries were afflicted," Gates said. Only 25 cases of Guinea-worm disease were reported in six countries last year, "putting eradication within reach", the WHO says. The Carter Centre, set up by former US President Jimmy Carter, has worked for more than 20 years to wipe it out. "We are close to finishing off this debilitating disease," Carter said, speaking by video from Atlanta, Georgia. "We cannot be complacent, we must be creative and persistent. The Carter Centre will not give up until the last Guinea worm is gone." Dengue, onchocerciasis (river blindness), and sleeping sickness are among those carried by mosquitoes or flies that are spreading from rural areas to urban slums, the WHO warned. "NTDs are really the diseases of neglected people, they are diseases of poverty and inequality that affect the most vulnerable among us," World Bank President Jim Kim said by video. "Now we have the largest drug donation program in history with 1.5 billion treatments in 2015 alone," he said. GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi are among major donors, WHO says. Merck said on Tuesday it was developing a children's formula of its drug to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm disease which kills 280,000 a year in Africa. Britain's Minister of State for International Development, Lord Bates, said the UK government was committing an additional 250 million pounds ($321.35 million) to NTD programs. Belgium's deputy prime minister Alexander de Croo pledged 25 million euros ($26.81 million) through 2025 to eradicate African sleeping sickness. "Today the stars are aligned to eradicate it completely," de Croo told the talks. "The pay-off is huge".

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Prophylactic Hepatitis B Virus Vaccines Market to See Incredible Growth During 2016 – 2024 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is disease related to the liver. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection results in deaths due to liver cancer and liver failure. The hepatitis B vaccine is available for all age groups to prevent HBV infection. The disease is caused due to transmission of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) through contact with body fluids, blood and semen of an infected person. Hepatitis B disease can cause acute and later may turn to chronic disease if not treated at early stage. In 2015, WHO estimated that 240 Mn people are infected with chronic hepatitis B virus. Every year more than 780,000 deaths occur due to complexity of hepatitis B viral infection. This infection caused by chronic hepatitis B virus develops fulminant hepatitis B (autoimmune disorder), liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), liver failure which can be treated by a liver transplant. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) provides direction and support to prevent transmission through vaccination. However, there is a significant decrease in incidence of hepatitis B virus infection after introduction of hepatitis B vaccine. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/10571 The prophylactic hepatitis B virus vaccines market is expected to grow remarkably during the forecast period due to increasing prevalence and incidence of hepatitis B infection, increasing public awareness (Patient Education Programs), government initiatives for promotion and creating awareness about prophylactic hepatitis B vaccines. However, factors such as side effects of the vaccine, high costs incurred during research and development and macro-economic factors like stringent regulations can affect the market adversely. The global prophylactic hepatitis b virus vaccines market is classified on the basis of end use and geography. Ever since 1982, vaccines were available for prevention of hepatitis B viral infections and currently more than 1 Bn doses of HBV vaccines have been distributed worldwide. The WHO recommends that all infants should receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. Thus, increase in the population base in APAC is expected to contribute significantly to the growth of global prophylactic hepatitis B virus vaccines market. Geographically, the global prophylactic hepatitis b virus vaccines market is segmented into five key regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. North America dominates the global prophylactic hepatitis B virus vaccines market followed by APAC and Europe. According to WHO, globally more than 240 Mn people suffer from chronic hepatitis B viral infection and about 780,000 people die every year due to consequences related with HBV infection. Of these majority of people belong to developing nations of APAC, Latin America and Africa. The prevalence is considerably low in countries with high level of living standards such as the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Request to View Tables of Content @www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/10571 Some of the major players operating in the market for prophylactic hepatitis B virus vaccines are Merck & Co, Inc., Sanofi Pasteur, Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline to name a few. Vaccine market is an oligopolistic market in which the major players such as GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co, Inc. and Sanofi Pasteur are using cost leadership and differentiating strategy. The strategy of the major companies in the global prophylactic hepatitis B virus vaccines market is to cut down the prices owing to the increased demand.

Microbiology Cultures Market by Culture Types (Bacterial Culture, Eukaryotic Culture) and Media Types (Simple Media, Complex Media, Synthetic Media and Special Media) and Forecast 2017-2021 Maryland Heights, MO, April 20, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Microbial cultures are used to determine the type of organism, and also its abundance in the sample being tested. It is one of the primary diagnostic methods of microbiology and used as a tool to determine the cause of infectious diseases by allowing the agent multiply in a predefined medium. Microbiology culture is a process of multiplying microbial organisms by allowing them to reproduce in predetermined culture media under controlled laboratory conditions. It is one of the principal diagnostic methods of microbiology used to determine the cause of infectious diseases by culturing the pathogen in a preset medium. One of the most important reasons for culturing microorganisms such as bacteria in vitro is for diagnosis of infectious diseases. Similarly, cultured bacteria are used to obtain antigens from developing serological assays or vaccines. Microorganisms are required to have an effective metabolism along with high productivity to achieve an economical production process.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Aerosol Therapy Market Estimated to Flourish by 2024 – Persistence Market Research New York City, NY — (SBWIRE) — 04/20/2017 — Aerosol is suspension of liquid or solid particles in a carrier gas, which makes use of it for treatment of respiratory system related diseases. Different forms of drugs can be utilized for aerosol therapy such as solid particles, liquid particles, solutions, and suspensions. Until recently, aerosol therapy concentrated primarily on treatment of asthma and COPD for which, pressurized metered-dose inhaler device was used. However, the role of aerosol therapy is expanding beyond the initial focus. This expansion eliminated CFC-based traditional metered-dose inhalers devices. This will ultimately boost the market growth of aerosol therapy in the field of gene therapy, inhalation therapy and vaccination. Aerosol therapy is a natural and easiest way to treat asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and broncho pulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Aerosol therapy is also used to deliver insulin, vaccines of influenza and measles, and pain medications. Aerosol treatment therapy gives an excellent and cost-efficient drug delivery. This therapy is effective for patients who cannot use metered-dose inhalers; primary inhalation devices are produced that guarantee breath-actuated aerosol delivery with minimal side effects. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/11944 Aerosol therapy provides a fast and non-invasive way for treatment of lung disorders as the drug is delivered at the receptor site. Effectiveness of the therapy depends on how deeply aerosol particles infiltrate into the bronchial track and where the particles are deposited. A particle size under 2?m is ideal and can permeate up to the peripheral airways. That is why most commercially available aerosol devices produce droplets of roughly this size. As per the World Health Organization, about half the cases of asthma and COPD are due to hereditary weakness and the other cases are due to environmental factors. The effect of pollution is likely to intensify globally along with industrialization of areas, and increasing the number of vehicles. Current government activities and rising healthcare investments are drivers of aerosol therapy market, which would upgrade over the examination time frame. Increasing prices are major factor that is restraining the growth of the market in terms of value. Currently metered dose inhaler majorly contributes to the market and is expected to dominate the market over the forecast period. As per the data, COPD is third leading cause of death and fifth leading cause of disability. Also, factors like increasing pollution, improper lifestyles are the factors that drive the growth of the market. On the basis of regional presence, global aerosol therapy market is segmented into five key regions viz. North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. Asthma symptoms were detected in 26 million persons who live in the U.S., of which, 19 million comprise adults and 7 million comprise children. With this rate, North America is expected to dominate the market. Asia Pacific (mostly China and India) market is estimated to grow at a relatively fast rate over the forecast period. To view TOC of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/11944 The largest manufacturers of aerosol therapy devices are Merck, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, GlaxoSmithKline, and AstraZeneca Plc.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Dental Caries Market to Develop Rapidly by 2024 The scientific term dental caries is known for the tooth decay or cavities. Tooth decays are generally caused by the specific endogenous bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus. It occurs by the production of acid that later destroys the layer and enamel of the tooth. The bacteria continues to grow to produce acid that gets into the inner layer of the tooth if the decay is not removed on time. In the U.S, approximately 90% of young adults have dental caries, while out of all dentate adults approximately 94% suffer from coronal caries. According to the estimation of WHO, on a global basis, 200,335,280 teeth were either decayed, filled or missing among just that age group A sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/10735 Factors contributing in the growth of Dental Caries Market are increased proportion of sugar based medication and existing life style factors. Additionally the increasing population in the Asia Pacific region is also the major factor to drive the growth of global dental caries market. However, according to WHO, it was observed that the cases with dental caries are declining due to the number of public health measures and improved self-care practices in the developed countries. These are the major restraints for the dental caries market. The increase in caries commonly occurs in the children, lower socio economic group and the new immigrants. With increasing base of dental caries prevalence, the dental caries market is expected to witness remarkable growth during the forecast period (2016-2024). The antimicrobial peptides are expected to hold maximum share in the overall treatment market for the dental caries owing to its high effectiveness.

Request For Sample@ www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-1038 “Revival of interest in peptides as potential drug candidates because of their low oral bioavailability has been a major factor fuelling growth of the global peptide therapeutics market. Lack of oral efficacy in peptide drug delivery has actually helped researchers to find innovative methods of peptide drug delivery. However, there is still low acceptance among end users; hence, creating awareness could open up opportunities in the market”, said FMI Analyst. Peptide therapeutics are used for treating prostrate, breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers. Peptides that are antagonists or agonists of specific receptors in oncology are increasingly being tested at the preclinical stages for their efficacy in cancer treatment. These increasing number of oncology studies indicate that there is an enormous cancer patient pool available globally, which is creating a larger niche for cancer application types in the global peptide therapeutic market. Increasing commercialisation costs and low oral bioavailability of peptide drugs can impede the demand for peptides during the forecast market.
