Merck, Regeneron, Sanofi, and Amgen have at least one thing in common: All signed pay-for-performance drug-pricing deals. How will this drug-pricing trend affect biotechs and their investors? Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Oct 30, 2016 at 3:06PM A new approach for how payers reimburse for drugs is gaining traction. Merck (NYSE:MRK) became the latest to jump on board. The drugmaker forged a pay-for-performance deal with Aetna for diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet. But could this trend wind up costing biotech investors lots of money? Image source: Getty Images. Pay for performance The idea behind pay-for-performance drug pricing is just what the name implies. Instead setting a price for a given drug, a biotech or pharmaceutical company would receive payment based on how well the drug controls or cures the targeted indication. This isn't a new concept. European countries have used the pay-for-performance approach, also known as value-based pricing, for years. However, that hasn't been the case in the U.S. until recently. With many high-cost specialty drugs now on the market, though, U.S. payers are pushing the pay-for-performance model. A 2015 survey conducted by Avalere Health found that payers are increasingly expressing interest in paying for performance. That interest level depends, though, on the targeted indication. Over half of payers responding to the Avalere survey said they were at least moderately interested in pay-for-performance deals on drugs treating hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, oncology, and rheumatoid arthritis.  And it's no coincidence that payers are most interested in seeing pay-for-performance pricing for the indications with the most expensive drugs. Impact on biotechs What does this trend mean for biotechs and their investors? The pay-for-performance deal for type 2 diabetes treatments Januvia and Janumet could be a good thing for Merck. Although both drugs continue to generate solid revenue, Merck faces competition from a newer class of diabetes drugs. Agreeing to be paid based on how well its drugs control diabetes could squeeze more revenue out of the aging drugs than the company would have otherwise received. How? Aetna will steer patients toward using the drugs instead of newer rivals. The dynamics are different in other scenarios, though. Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and Sanofi (NYSE:SNY) inked a pay-for-performance agreement with Cigna for new cholesterol drug Praluent. But this deal won't give Regeneron and Sanofi a competitive advantage. Rival Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) forged a similar agreement for Repatha. If real-world results don't match up to clinical study results, then the new pricing model will cause Regeneron, Sanofi, and Amgen to make less money on their cholesterol drugs than they would have under a traditional pricing model. The companies are already making less money than they'd hoped, though not because of the pay-for-performance deals. Sales of both Praluent and Repatha have started out relatively slowly as payers restrict authorizing reimbursement for the drugs pending the results of cardiovascular outcomes studies. The good news is that the biotechs gain access to patients they may not have reached without such a deal in place. For example, Cigna and other payers would be reluctant to embrace Regeneron's and Sanofi's costly cholesterol drugs without some guarantee of their effectiveness. Pay for performance might make the most significant impact when a drug is approved for multiple indications. Amgen's Kyprolis, for example, is currently approved as a treatment for relapsed multiple myeloma in combination with other drugs after a previous treatment was unsuccessful. Kyprolis is also in a couple of clinical studies, one for treating newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and another for small-cell lung cancer. Unlike Repatha, Kyprolis does not have a pay-for-performance deal right now. But let's suppose it did. Let's also suppose that Kyprolis ultimately wins approval for the two indications for which it is being evaluated in clinical studies, but it isn't as effective for those indications as it is for relapsed multiple myeloma. Under a pay-for-performance arrangement, Amgen would receive less money for the other two indications. Survival of the fittest Pay-for-performance drug pricing is likely here to stay. If the current deals that various drugmakers have made save money for payers, expect the approach to expand to more types of drugs. Will the trend cost biotechs and their investors lots of money? Probably, yes. Biotechs will likely make less money on their drugs than they have in the past. That will impact earnings growth, and it could mean that biotech stocks don't skyrocket to the extent they have in previous years. But it was inevitable that payers would push back on mounting drug costs. Something had to change. Pay-for-performance pricing still allows biotechs to make plenty of money on new drugs that work well. Those that don't work as well won't be as lucrative. Biotech companies are used to the "survival of the fittest" nature of drug research. -- and they're probably about to experience the Darwinian concept to a higher degree than ever before.

She also has significant investment ties to many companies involved in global deforestation, widespread chemical pollution, and human rights abuses. I learned these startling facts from taking a close look at Jill Stein‘s finances, a study in dramatic contradictions between her stated ideals and actions. I was prompted by a recent report in the Daily Beast on other aspects of this disconnect. Global replacement of virgin tropical rainforest with palm oil plantations is heavily financed by U.S. investors, including the Green Party’s Jill Stein. This is now the world’s greatest cause of deforestation, leaving orangutans, Sumatran tigers and many other species to face imminent extinction. Monsanto, GMOs, pesticides and toxins Stein rarely misses an opportunity to use her party’s greatest scare word Monsanto. The agribusiness that produces GMO seeds still remains the Greens’ symbol of evil, despite scientists — and increasingly, environmentalists — who say GMO crops increase yields, feed more starving people, and reduce both pesticide use and wildlife habitat loss. Stein says she wants GMOs banned and their producers jailed. Privately, however, the Greens’ crusader for purity invests her personal wealth heavily in GMO agribusiness, including the devil itself, Monsanto. Stein has invested between $0.8 and $1.7 million with the Vanguard Group, the world’s largest institutional holder of Monsanto stock (per NASDAQ on Oct 28). A Vanguard 500 Index report from June 30, 2016 showed a significant holding of Monsanto shares. Several of Stein’s Vanguard mutual funds that invest in Monsanto appear on a financial disclosure she filed on March 30, 2016 with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. They include Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (VBTLX, VBMFX), Vanguard 500 Financial Index Fund (VFINX), and Vanguard 500 Index (VFIAX). Vanguard Group is the world’s largest institutional holder of Monsanto stock (NASDAQ, Oct. 28) Stein has invested between $0.8 and $1.7 million with the Vanguard Group. In fact, Stein is a shareholder, via Vanguard, in a Who’s Who of the world’s largest GMO and pesticide producers: Monsanto, DuPont, Archer Daniels Midland, Dow Chemical, ConAgra, and Amgen. These names all appear in the holdings lists (links above) for the specific Vanguard funds she owns. Stein is also an individual stockholder in chemical manufacturer 3M, with between $50,000-$100,000 in shares. 3M is a major name in environmental news for creating a now-banned dispersing agent of a type called PFCs (perfluorochemicals), or PFASs (poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances). PFASs persist without breaking down in the environment and have been found to be both toxic and bioaccumulative. They were so widely used, they’re now present around the world in our drinking water, bloodstreams, and wildlife, potentially increasing a range of health risks. Through Vanguard, Stein also owns shares in chemical manufacturer DuPont, 3M’s main customer for its PFASs. DuPont continued releasing it for years after its own research showed its dangers. She also invests in other synthetic chemical manufacturers through funds managed by the Bessemer Trust. John Oliver and Time Warner Stein recently accused political satirist John Oliver of conspiring with his corporate bosses to aid her opponent, Hillary Clinton, after he criticized her policies on his HBO show Last Week Tonight. (Oliver has leveled plenty of criticism toward all four presidential candidates.) Much like Donald Trump and his unsupported accusations of journalistic conspiracy, Stein offered no evidence for her accusation other than the facts that his show is owned by a large corporation, Time Warner, and that his huge popularity among liberals has made him a millionaire. She posted this on her campaign site: There will always be the John Oliver’s of the world. His hands are far from clean — he’s a millionaire, yet proclaims bailing out students in debt as a wholly unworkable plan. Plus, his employer — Time Warner — is among Hillary’s top 10 donors! She also posted this meme on Facebook: Remember the Vanguard Group? They’re not only the largest institutional investor in Monsanto, they’re also the largest investor in Time Warner. The company appears in Stein’s specific Vanguard fund holdings. If John Oliver is a corrupt corporate shill simply because he works for Time Warner as an employee and is a millionaire, what does that make Stein, who’s part-owner of Time Warner and a multi-millionaire? (Besides Oliver’s boss, that is.) Stein implies she considers all 40,000 Time Warner employees unclean… for helping to make her rich. Stein owes them, and John Oliver, an apology. Vioxx, Merck, Big Pharma and vaccines Stein is famed for her oft-repeated claims of a conspiracy among the FDA, CDC, and “Big Pharma,” which she insists is so corrupt that American vaccines and drugs are untrustworthy. This is a theme for which she has come under fire from public health advocates for sowing vaccine paranoia and pandering to the anti-vaxxer movement. As evidence for corruption of the U.S. vaccine program, she routinely but irrelevantly offers Monsanto’s supposed role in U.S. agriculture policy. Journalists’ requests for actual evidence of an FDA-vaccine conspiracy have led Stein to start raising the spectre of the drug Vioxx as proof that FDA oversight of vaccines can’t be trusted.  This was an anti-inflammatory pulled from the market in 2004 by Merck after evidence of increased heart disease surfaced, a difficult choice when millions of arthritis sufferers were reporting no other drug provided comparable pain relief. Merck is also a maker of the MMR vaccine. You may be guessing by now where this is headed… Stein owns $50,000-$100,000 in Merck stock as an individual shareholder — that is, not through a mutual fund, but outright. This has been reported before, not widely, and not in the context of her Vioxx accusations. She is also an individual shareholder with between $15,000-$50,000 in pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson, while her mutual fund holdings are loaded with most of the remaining Big Pharma names, as the Daily Beast reported. In a recent town hall, Bec Gill with ScIQ asked Stein: You talk extensively on your concern about corporate influence over U.S. vaccine regulations. My question is, what evidence do you have that corporate influence has caused either the FDA or the CDC to make decisions that endanger American children’s health? Stein responded “Let me give you a piece of that evidence…” then referred to the “recent” Vioxx scandal (it was 12 years ago) in what she termed industry “tampering” with the FDA to suppress evidence of drug risks. It’s also possible that Vioxx helped Stein retire. Stein’s Vanguard holdings include Monsanto, Merck (maker of Vioxx and the MMR vaccine), and Time Warner. War, drones and the defense industry Halliburton, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman. Enough said. Fossil fuel, global warming and fracking Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Duke Energy, Marathon Oil. Same. Palm Oil, deforestation and biodiversity A July report by Friends of the Earth lists the Vanguard Group as the third largest investor in the world’s greatest cause of deforestation today: the global palm oil market: …millions of hectares of rainforests and peatlands [that] have been destroyed for plantations in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa… In all of these regions, deforestation is driving the loss of species, threatening the livelihoods and cultures of millions of local people, and contributing to climate change at an alarming rate. … Many of these workers are trafficked into bonded labor; forced to work and live under extreme conditions with limited legal recourse; suffer from abuse or the threat of abuse; or are children… land acquisitions are often carried out with a lack of community consultation and consent… palm oil land grabs devastate forest ecosystems and violate the human rights of affected communities through forced evictions, land clearing, forced labor, and other abuses… In a story titled “US investors ploughing billions into palm oil,” the Guardian reported that while many firms are increasingly pledging to end investment in deforestation, “others have no processes in place to deal with companies that commit human rights and environmental abuses.” Vanguard appears to fall in this latter category, and failed to reply to the Guardian‘s request for comments. Scientists are warning that “corporate inaction on deforestation” could make it impossible to achieve global warming reduction goals. The fate of many tropical wildlife species is at stake, including orangutans which may be driven to extinction in the wild within a decade. Stein’s response to earlier questions about her investments None of this is to say that everyone with an unmonitored pension or mutual fund is a monster. What it is saying is that 1) if Americans don’t make use of our financial leverage, who will? and 2) politicians who make a career out of attacking others for supporting harmful corporations shouldn’t live in a house made of blown Venetian glass. But after the Daily Beast opened the issue of her investments, Stein issued this response: I have no control in management or decision-making. Sadly, most of these broad investments are as compromised as the American economy — degraded as it is by the fossil fuel, defense and finance industries… While I have explored “green” mutual funds, I found their investments in fracking and large scale biofuels not much better than the non-green funds… We need real options for ethical investing.” It’s reminiscent of the recent debates when Clinton accused Trump of not paying taxes for years. Trump’s reply was essentially, “It’s not my fault, it’s yours, for letting laws exist that I can exploit.” One can’t help but think of the resulting memes with Trump protesting “Damn you, Hillary, stop me before I’m forced to go another year without paying taxes!” Stein does seem to blame shadowy forces, presumably named Clinton, for not stopping her from investing in questionable corporations. She also attacked the journalists for doing their job, suggesting they were part of the same conspiracy as John Oliver. The report, she said, was willful misinformation and manipulative framing… a blatant smear attack and hypocritical attempt to suggest conflicts of interest… an imagined conflict of interest, perhaps to distract from… the Clintons… Though Stein opposes journalists reporting on contradictions between a politician’s words and actions, she does find it fair for politicians to deflect criticism by targeting their opponents’ children, judging by her rebuttal’s title: “Jill Stein Responds to Daily Beast Smear Attack By Calling for Disclosure of Chelsea Clinton’s Role as Director of Beast’s Parent Corporation.” Okay then. Stein argues that, well, at least she’s “a far cry from the Clintons’ back room fundraising and quarter-million dollar speeches for the predatory banks, health insurance industry, and fossil fuel tycoons.” True. Stein earns her wealth from Goldman Sachs, predatory banks, the health insurance industry, and fossil fuel tycoons by supporting them with investments. Not for giving speeches to them, which is just dirty. Therein lies Jill Stein’s purity. ***Update***: A reader has just pointed out an astounding April 2016 post on Stein’s campaign website: Stein calls for total divestment from fossil fuels Stein said the time to deal with climate change is extremely limited and that it is not too much to ask for colleges and universities to divest 100 percent of their investments in fossil fuel companies… Stein said the country also needs to divest 100 percent of its economy from fossil fuels, and said as president she would call a state of emergency to deal with climate change…“This is not a sacrifice, this is a step forward to a better world that works for all of us,” Stein said. As I mentioned earlier, Stein is a shareholder in ExxonMobil, Chevron, Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Duke Energy, and Marathon Oil. This should be a troubling level of hypocrisy by anyone’s standards. There are some comments from people (who didn’t fully read the piece) that Stein somehow “has no choice” in her investments and “mutual funds don’t count.” Remember who we’re talking about. Not me, not you, struggling along with our own muddled priorities, but the leader of the American Green Party calling for radical environmental and economic change, a crusader for purity who calls for the jailing of political opponents and corporate targets. This same person chose to enrich herself with the one fund out of thousands that’s very publicly the top institutional backer in the world of global deforestation. Wealthy Americans whining “I’m not responsible” and “my personal actions don’t matter” are wiping out species after species; we will probably lose orangutans and Sumatran tigers from the wild within a decade. Our choices fucking matter. The one person on the planet who should be challenging that attitude is Jill Stein. Among thousands of funds, she bypassed all green funds and chose the one fund that is the world’s biggest institutional investor in Monsanto… while using Monsanto as the symbol of ultimate evil in so many of her speeches. She chose to own, not through index or mutual funds, two giants of Big Pharma, while nearly every day shouting that they’re all criminals. Meanwhile, all day every day, she’s pointing a finger at others and calling them unclean, like she did to John Oliver. It’s inconceivably hypocritical and demonstrates bizarrely poor judgment.

The company's MK-1293 may be battling for a share of the long-acting insulin market next year. Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Oct 29, 2016 at 11:40AM Last quarter, Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) filed for FDA approval of a biosimilar to Sanofi SA's (NYSE:SNY) megablockbuster, long-acting insulin, Lantus. If the FDA approves Merck's drug, then it could begin competing for a share of Lantus' $6 billion plus in sales as soon as next year. Image source: Getty Images. Awaiting approval MK-1293 is a Lantus biosimilar co-developed by Merck and Samsung Bioepis, a joint venture between Biogen and Samsung BioLogics. Lantus is an insulin glargine used by both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients to help keep their blood sugar steady throughout the day. Unlike mealtime insulin, which works like the insulin your body releases when you eat, Lantus releases insulin into your bloodstream at a slow and steady rate over the course of a day to better manage blood sugar in between meals and overnight. Typically, diabetes patients are first treated with oral drugs, such as metformin, however, these drugs become less effective over time, forcing the addition of injection-therapies, such as long-acting insulin, to continue controlling the disease. Because the global population is getting increasingly larger, wealthier, and living longer, more people are being diagnosed with diabetes. According to the International Diabetes Federation, 415 million people on the planet have diabetes and that number will grow to 642 million in 2040. Because most of these patients will ultimately progress to requiring long-acting insulin, Lantus has become one of the world's biggest selling drugs, generating over $6 billion in sales for Sanofi last year alone. Undeniably, Lantus pending patent expiration and megablockbuster status means that there's a massive market opportunity for generic drugmakers -- especially in the United States where Sanofi produces about two-thirds of its Lantus revenue. Hoping to capture a big chunk of those sales, Merck, with the help of Samsung Bioepis, evaluated MK-1293 in human trials involving both type 1 and type 2 patients. Those trials demonstrated that MK-1293 works similarly to Lantus. In August, the FDA accepted for review Merck's application for MK-1293's approval, starting the clock on a scientific review to determine if there are no clinically meaningful differences in terms of the safety, purity, and potency between it and Lantus.  Angling for share European regulators are also evaluating MK-1293, and an EU decision could be made before the end of 2016. While there's no guarantee the FDA would follow in the EU's footsteps on MK-1293, an approval in Europe could increase the likelihood that the FDA comes down in favor of the biosimilar next year. If approved, MK-1293 could add meaningfully to Merck's top line, however, an approval alone won't guarantee that happens because the market for long-acting insulin is increasingly competitive. Merck will need to convince doctors to prescribe MK-1293 instead of Lantus and outmaneuver competitors that have launched their own long-acting insulin. Sanofi may be one of Merck's fiercest competitors. In early 2015, Sanofi secured FDA approval of Toujeo, a next-generation, long-acting insulin, and the company is working ferociously to convert existing Lantus patients to it. Merck will also need to sidestep diabetes giant Novo Nordisk. Novo launched Tresiba, a long-acting insulin, last year, and in the first six months of 2016 Tresiba sales are up 167% year over year to more than $200 million. Merck won't be the only Lantus biosimilar on the market either. Eli Lilly cut a deal with Sanofi last year that allows it to begin marketing a Lantus SoloStar biosimilar this December. SoloStar is an injectable pen variation of Lantus that accounts for more than 60% of Lantus' U.S. revenue. Overall, there's unquestionably a big opportunity to reshape the long-acting insulin market, and MK-1293 positions Merck nicely to get its fair share of sales in the market. However, Merck's $42 billion in annualized third quarter revenue means that it may be a while before MK-1293 sales reach levels that really impress Merck investors.  Todd Campbell has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Oct 29, 2016 at 12:05PM Image source: Getty Images. Looking for a bright spot in the gloom of Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) long decline in share price? Earlier this month, news broke that all of Gilead's HCV drugs must now bear the so-called dreaded "black box" label -- the FDA's most serious warning on a prescription med. The market braced for a gut punch, because the warnings affixed to AbbVie's (NYSE: ABBV) hep-C drugs a year ago sliced 10% off its share price. Although Gilead's HCV franchise is of the utmost importance to this company, representing over 50% of total sales, the biotech's stock has barely budged. There are a couple of reasons why. First, a big sell-off based on a negative but commercially insignificant headline typically signals that the market was looking for a reason to dump the stock anyway. Correspondingly, when the share price holds firm, it indicates that those investors who panic easily have already exited. In other words, given that Gilead's trailing-12-month P/E is at a record low of 6.4, it's possible that a lot of bad news is already baked into the stock price. Put those things together, and shareholders should feel justified in maintaining a healthy optimism about Gilead's future. Let's look at how the biotech's HCV franchise could be impacted by the FDA warning and why the stock may finally be ready to turn the corner. "Black box" won't dent HCV drug sales long term The so-called "black-box warnings" -- officially known as boxed warnings -- are the most serious safety warnings the FDA imposes on a drug. First instituted in 1979, the warnings are intended to highlight a serious adverse reaction that may be life-threatening but could be prevented by limitations on drug usage. That warning will now be slapped on the entire crop of hep-C wonder drugs -- not just Gilead's and AbbVie's, but also Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ) Olysio, Merck &Co's (NYSE: MRK)Zepatier, and Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE: BMY) Daklinza. Why? The FDA said it noted 24 cases in which direct-acting antivirals brought patients' previous hep-B infections roaring back. Two patients died, and one required a liver transplant. While that sounds grim, investors should realize that hundreds of thousands of hep–C patients have been treated (and cured) by the antivirals. They have a near-perfect cure rate, and prior interferon-containing combo treatments were slower and less effective, and produced multiple side effects in many more patients. There's no doubt that physicians will continue to prescribe them. In fact, black-box warnings often have little impact on sales if the drugs are effective. Two noteworthy examples are attention-deficit drug Ritalin and popular antibiotic Cipro (ciprofloxacin). Ritalin is projected to take in a stunning $17.5 billion by the year 2020, and Cipro continues to be routinely prescribed by doctors for mild infections. What's more significant is that the FDA wants physicians to screen patients for hep-B infections before prescribing. That could delay the onset of treatment by Gilead's hep-C drugs, but it should not, in the long run, reduce the number of patients treated by more than a couple of percentage points. According to reports in the Annals of Gastroenterology, cases of HBV/HCV coinfection in the U.S. range in the low single digits.  The silver lining: Hep-B screening could open up a new market It's estimated that up to 1.4 million people have chronic hep-B in the U.S. Like hep-C, the disease can cause liver failure and also death, and it's also a silent killer, like hep-C. While around 50% of those stricken with hep-C don't realize they are at risk, raise that percentage to around 65% with hep-B. Gilead has a drug on the market to treat hep-B: Viread. Viread faces generic competition in December 2017, but Gilead's new version (TAF) will likely head that off and build stronger sales, because it causes far less damage to bones and kidneys. But the real opportunity for Gilead may be in GS-9620, which is now in human trials and being touted as a possible hep-B cure. In fact, Gilead has its sights set on curing two more viral epidemics -- hep-B and HIV -- just as it created the first cure for hep-C. Image Source: Gilead Sciences investor presentation. A pipeline aimed at the world's biggest killers Gilead faces long odds in curing either of those viral epidemics any time soon. Its biggest near-term success is more likely to come in another multibillion-dollar market: the treatment of a disease known as NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), which is reaching epidemic proportions in the United States. Gilead just announced today that it was advancing promising investigational drug GS-4997 into phase 3 trials against the disease. Despite the potential of Gilead's drugs, the company's valuation reflects a great deal of fear -- and very little hope about its future. The stock's forward P/E of 6.7 is a tiny fraction of the average biotech's forward P/E of 63, or the broader pharmaceutical industry's forward P/E of 28. With HCV sales declining and Wall Street laser-focused on quarterly numbers, unlocking near-term shareholder value in this stock may require an acquisitive Big Pharma company with a lucrative buyout offer. But in the long term, investors have more important things to rely on: Gilead's incredible track record of innovation, a rock-bottom P/E, and a pipeline that just might contain a cure for another one of the world's big killers.

Ogg October 29, 2016 9:50 am EST Print Email Tweet Investors have had to interpret a lot of data in this aging bull market and ahead of the election. Despite the recent volatility, the one undeniable trend is that investors have been willing to buy stocks into every market sell-off. That won’t be the case forever, but that has been true for five years or so. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning of the week. The goal is to find new investing ideas and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and some of these end up covering the top stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Investors need to consider many sorts of issues when it comes to buying a stock. How much risk is there? How much potential upside is there? Is the stock viewed as cheap, or does it have a premium because of its position today? Does it pay a dividend and/or does it buy back stock? How is its balance sheet and how solid are the business prospects? The ending on October 28 was the week that the earnings floodgates flew wide open. High valuations in general and the notion that the bull market is seven and a half years old just are not stopping investors from having an appetite. 24/7 Wall St. tracked three unusual research patterns emerging out of the 30 Dow stocks in the week ending October 28. The Big Apple Isn’t Just New York City Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) had a very unusual earnings report. Earnings and guidance were all in all pretty good, but CEO Tim Cook seemed uncertain how to capitalize on Samsung’s smartphone woes. Despite these issues, Apple’s consensus analyst price target has now climbed back above $130. Right before Apple’s earnings report, its consensus price target was $128.81, and was $126.73 just 30 days ago and $124.11 some 60 days ago. Within two days of earnings, 24/7 Wall St. tracked 13 key analyst changes. These were from the likes of Stifel, Credit Suisse, Mizuho, Merrill Lynch, S&P, Barclays and many more key firms. Apple shares were trading at $113.69 upon Friday’s closing bell, down from $118.25 earlier in the week before earnings. Apple has a 52-week range of $89.47 to $123.82. Conglomerate City General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) has seen a moderate downward trend on its consensus analyst price targets going into and after its third quarter earnings failed to impress. But with shares still trading under $30, it was interesting to see that Merrill Lynch not only reiterated its Buy rating but maintained its $37 price objective. That is a full $5 higher than what is now the consensus target, and the report even noted how GE’s third quarter was underwhelming and that the $2.00 earnings per share target would require more cost cuts and more cash deployment to hit. Still, the firm noted: We expect GE to stand out as one of the better growth stories in our large-cap space at the end of 3Q earnings season. GE did not back away from the $2 EPS by 2018, but highlighted that more cost-cuts and buyback are required to get to the goal. It is important to know that this is a tie for GE’s highest analyst target price. GE closed at $29.22 on Friday, and that was after a 2% gain on hopes of a Baker-Hughes partnership for its oil and gas services. GE’s consensus analyst target is $32.00 (versus $33.71 just 90 days ago), and its 52-week range is $27.10 to $33.00. Big Pharma This past week, Argus reiterated Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) at Buy, but what stood out was that the drug giant’s price target was raised to $80 from $65. That was up over 30% from the $60.87 prior close, plus there is the 3% dividend yield. Argus sees earnings growth driven by strong sales of oncology drug Keytruda, Zepatier for hepatitis C,and Gardasil for HPV. The Argus report said: Merck shares trade at 15 times our 2017 earnings per share estimate, above the average multiple of 13.9 for our coverage universe of pharmaceutical stocks. While Merck carries a premium valuation, we believe the company has a strong pipeline of new drugs that could contribute meaningfully to revenue over the next five years… We believe that Merck has a strong product pipeline and that Keytruda has substantial opportunities as a treatment for solid tumors, such as lung cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer. Recently approved and forthcoming indications for Keytruda, along with growth from Zepatier and Gardasil, should contribute significantly to future sales growth. Investors might want to notice that the consensus price target was $68.32 on Friday, and that consensus target is up over 10% in the past 90 days. Also note that Merck’s absolute highest price target is now up at $82.00, and it has a 3% yield. Merck shares closed down 4% at $58.84 on Friday, in a 52-week range of $47.97 to $64.86.

Here's what management had to say. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Oct 29, 2016 at 6:24AM Friday wasn't a good day for AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). The company announced its third-quarter results shortly before the market opened. AbbVie's stock fell over 6% in pre-market trading and didn't do much better the rest of the day. Here's what the company's management said while AbbVie stock was being hammered. (All quotes courtesy of S&P Global Market Intelligence.) Image source: Getty Images. 1. Humira sales are tracking with expectations Nothing is more important to AbbVie than Humira. The autoimmune disease drug generated over 60% of AbbVie's total revenue in the third quarter. A lot of the discussion on the company's earnings call related to Humira and what seems to be slowing momentum. AbbVie CEO Rick Gonzalez said that Humira is "performing exactly where we would have expected it to perform in the international markets" and has had "outstanding growth" in the U.S. Gonzalez said that biosimilars that are now available outside of the U.S. are only having a "very modest impact" on Humira's sales. But what about the slowdown in sequential sales growth for the drug? AbbVie CFO Bill Chase said, "It is not unusual in the U.S. or abroad to see a general flattening out over the summer and then an acceleration back in the back half of the year." Chase thinks that is what happened in the third quarter. He added that the company "feels very, very good" about the full-year growth forecast for Humira. 2. Imbruvica is just getting started There weren't any worries about Imbruvica losing momentum. Sales for the cancer drug soared in the third quarter. AbbVie's message about Imbruvica: Even better things should be ahead. Gonzalez said that Imbruvica's "market share position is steadily increasing" in the front-line chronic lymphocatic leukemia (CLL) indication. He noted that the drug already holds the market-leading position as a second-line treatment for CLL and for relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstroem's macroglobulinemia. AbbVie awaits regulatory approval for Imbruvica in treating relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma and expects to submit for approval for treating chronic graft-versus-host disease in the first half of 2017. Imbruvica could face competition relatively soon from AstraZeneca's (NYSE:AZN) acalabrutinib. AstraZeneca has stated that it plans to submit its drug for regulatory approval by the end of 2016 but didn't specify for which indication. AbbVie's management was asked twice about the possible threat from AstraZeneca. Mike Severino, AbbVie's chief scientific officer, acknowledged that he was aware that acalabrutinib could be moving toward approval but focused on the great potential for Imbruva. 3. As far as Viekira, um, well... AbbVie's executives mentioned Viekira all of two times during the company's earnings call. Once was to briefly mention strong international performance from the hepatitis C drug. The second brief statement referenced declining U.S. sales. AbbVie CFO William Chase said that Viekira had "seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entrance of a new competitor in the market." Who was that new competitor? Zepatier. Merck (NYSE:MRK) launched its hep C drug earlier this year. The entrance of Zepatier accounted for some of that market-share loss mentioned by Chase. Merck was squarely behind Viekira's price erosion. The drugmaker priced Zepatier lower than other hep C drugs on the market, forcing AbbVie and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) to offer discounts on their products. AbbVie undoubtedly knows Viekira's best days are behind it. Sales for the drug plunged nearly 20% in the third quarter compared to the prior-year period. Management talked more about the new hepatitis C combo treatment that it expects to launch next year. This combo will be taken once per day and will treat all genotypes of hep C. However, no one on AbbVie's team discussed the fact that Gilead has already hit the market with its own pan-genotypic once-daily combo. Epclusa was approved by the FDA on June 28 and saw huge sales in just three days at the end of the second quarter.    Looking ahead AbbVie's executives did exactly what they're supposed to do: paint as pretty a picture about the company's prospects as they can. What does that picture really look like?  Humira should still keep on plugging along, but sooner or later growth won't just slow down. It will evaporate. AbbVie must get success from newer drugs and its pipeline. Imbruvica is a cornerstone for its strategy to build revenue outside of Humira. The company also needs more winners and is likely to get one with Elagolix, which should be submitted for approval in treating endometriosis next year. I think the scenario for AbbVie still looks pretty good over the next two or three years. Beyond that point, the picture of the company's prospects is like a Monet painting: a little fuzzy.

Human papillomavirus, or HPV, is the most common sexually transmitted disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which along with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the three-dose (over a period of six months) vaccine at that age, meaning before kids generally become sexually active. More than 25 speakers — including doctors, researchers, executives from health-care foundations, high school students, cancer survivors and even a dentist — addressed Dr. Karen Hacker, head of the Allegheny County Health Department, and council members. Dr. Liz Miller, director of community health at Children's Hospital at Pittsburgh and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine, called the vaccine mandate "critically important" for "bridging the gap" in parts of Allegheny County where parents might not be educated on HPV, or where access to primary care is less likely. "The HPV vaccine is frankly a no-brainer," she said. According to the CDC, in most cases HPV will go away on its own. But when it doesn't, it can cause genital warts and cancers, including cervical cancer, cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis or anus. Cancer caused by HPV can also manifest itself in the throat, tongue and tonsils. Currently the vaccine is mandatory for school entry in Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington, D.C. "We have spoken with all three states to better understand their perspectives and experience," Hacker wrote in an email to City Paper. She says the vaccine is covered by most health-insurance plans and is included in the Affordable Care Act's preventive measures. John Rhodes, a 50-year-old assistant basketball coach for the Duquesne University Dukes, testified as a throat- and neck-cancer survivor. He called himself a "6-foot-9 walking billboard" for the HPV vaccine. He has been in remission for seven months after being treated for stage-four cancer that settled in his lymph nodes and was caused by HPV.  "My kids are vaccinated," he said. "As a coach and a competitive person, I challenge you [to mandate the vaccine]." Several doctors shared concern for the pain and complications their patients feel once they are diagnosed with a cancer caused by HPV. Dr. Umamaheswar Duvvuri, a head- and neck-cancer surgeon at UPMC and the local VA hospital, told the crowd about his 55-year-old male patient from Dubois, Pa., who found a lump on his neck. "I spent the day removing a large portion of this man's tongue," he said. "That could've been prevented." After the meeting, he explained that he and colleagues will be operating on six patients and treating four others for "oropharyngeal" cancers — head and neck cancers — and that those types of cancers are predicted to rise by 2020. Sixteen-year-old Sydney Reyes, of Riverview Junior-Senior High School, addressed another common argument against the vaccine — that it will encourage sexual promiscuity in teenagers. "This assumption can be resolved by having a proper discussion with your teen, not by blocking a vaccination," Reyes said. "Why should we risk a life like this when we really don't have to?" A few speakers against the vaccine mandate expressed their concerns to the councilors. A parent named Amy Rafferty read a letter from a friend whose daughter allegedly suffered severe hypertonia — muscles spasms — to the point where she couldn't walk anymore after receiving Gardasil, the HPV vaccine from Merck. James Lyons-Weiler, who formerly worked at the Hillman Cancer Center and who started his own research group entitled the "Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge," told the crowd he was concerned that the current vaccine would allow for stronger virus strains to attack humans in the future. Yesterday, Lyons-Weiler posted a 3,000-word essay on his blog denouncing the medical professionals who asked Allegheny County to mandate the vaccine. He also mentioned that he met Rafferty because she organized the local screening of VAXXED — an anti-vaccine documentary that was kicked off the Tribeca Film Festival schedule, and which City Paper's film critic Al Hoff said came "across as an infomercial by way of a conspiracy theory for a discredited argument." Speakers who followed opponents of the vaccine mandate contradicted their arguments. Hacker says the comments gathered at the hearing will be presented to the board of health in July. "They wanted us to consider what the public felt [about an HPV-vaccine mandate]," Hacker said by phone today.  If the board decides to recommend a mandate, a public-comment period would follow. Editor's note: This post has been udpated to include comments from Dr. Karen Hacker.

The worst may be yet to come. A year after presidential candidate Hillary Clinton first tweeted about outrageous price gouging, the reality of pricing pressure in the U.S. hit Wall Street in the most concrete way: earnings. From drug distributor McKesson & Co., to biotechnology giants Amgen Inc. and AbbVie Inc. and insulin maker Eli Lilly & Co., this week’s third-quarter results showcased widespread evidence that the industry has pulled back on prices under the growing pressure from politicians and pharmacy benefit managers. The crush has sent shares down in the U.S. and beyond, hitting foreign drugmakers like Denmark-based Novo Nordisk A/S, the world’s largest maker of insulin, that have a large portion of their business in the country. “We’re only just getting into the storm now,” Novo Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “We can’t in any way say that the worst is behind us.” The earnings season so far has yielded an apparent turning point in the industry -- a new era where drugmakers won’t be able to rely on price increases to boost revenue and profit. Most striking of all, according to Leerink Partners analyst Geoff Porges, was Amgen’s announcement late Thursday that it didn’t expect to be able to raise the price of its top drug, a medicine to treat autoimmune diseases called Enbrel, in 2017. The stock slumped 9.6 percent on Friday. ‘Still Shocking’ “It’s still shocking. This signals a really pretty profound sea change in the landscape for the industry,” Porges said by phone. “Payers are using more and more aggressive tactics to extract price concessions from manufacturers.” Porges estimated that more than 80 percent of Amgen’s operating income growth in the last six quarters came from Embrel price increases. Analysts covering the biotech industry -- who are used to wild stock moves in the high-risk sector -- expressed their bafflement on Friday. “After this week, we’re almost speechless, which, as you know, doesn’t happen often,” Baird & Co. equity analysts wrote in a note. The price shocks rippled far and large. AbbVie plunged 6.3 percent on Friday after reporting that third-quarter sales of its top-selling arthritis injection, Humira, fell short of predictions. Novo’s decision to cut its long-term growth profit target sent shares of U.S. rivals Lilly and Merck & Co. down as well. Earlier in the week, Lilly had posted a 14 percent slump in U.S. sales of its Humalog insulin, because of lower prices. Price War Casualties McKesson Chief Executive Officer John Hammergen took investors by surprise on a conference call Thursday when he said a rival wholesaler, which he didn’t identify, had started a price war. The stock plunged 23 percent on Friday, the most since 1999. Competitors Cardinal Health Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corp. sank 9.8 percent and 13 percent, respectively. “The idea that a key industry participant could potentially harm industry economics on price baffles us,” Ross Muken, an analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients. So far this month, only three stocks in the 59-member Standard & Poor’s 500 Health Care Index have increased, while 11 have declined more than 10 percent. The index ended the week at its lowest since March 28. The rest of earnings season may show more evidence of price pressure. Pfizer Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. -- maker of hepatitis C drugs that have list prices of $84,000 to $94,500 -- report quarterly earnings next week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc., the target of government probes on pricing, is scheduled to post earnings on Nov. 8, the day of the U.S. presidential election. And Mylan NV, the center of public outrage over the price of its EpiPen allergy shots, reports the following day. “Halloween comes early to haunt biotech,” the Baird analysts said in their note. “Rhetoric this week on commercial payers has us believing we may be seeing the end of days.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Click here to return to MM&M's and PRWeek's Health Influencer 50 list and features. 30. Wendy Lund, CEO, GCI Health Wendy Lund said the best career advice she had ever given was, "Stick with it. It will get easier and everything is possible." Perhaps taking her own advice led her to become GCI Health's first CEO in 2010, following the merger of Cohn & Wolfe and GCI Group. She came to the agency with more than 20 years of healthcare comms experience and has built out the agency's capabilities. Under Lund's eye, GCI Health has tripled its size and expanded its presence in Europe with the 2013 opening of a London office. Lund began her career in the nonprofit world, giving back to the healthcare industry. She started as marketing VP for the National League for Nursing and then moved to a marketing role with Planned Parenthood. Plus, she served as a board member for the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association. Lund moved to the agency world in 1997 at MS&L, then to Publicis Consultants. –––––––––––––––––––––– 29. Anne de Schweinitz, MD, global healthcare, FleishmanHillard Anne de Schweinitz has led FleishmanHillard's global healthcare practice since 2012. When she joined the firm, Fleishman's then EMEA president — and now CEO — John Saunders said de Schweinitz got the role because of her history of positive client relationships. Saunders added that she "understands the importance of establishing sustainable and value-based relationships with clients." De Schweinitz has spent more than 15 years in healthcare communications. She's worked primarily in the agency world, with roles at MS&L, Big Arrow Group, and Hill & Knowlton before joining Fleishman. She is particularly experienced in comms for biotech, medical devices, patient advocacy, and U.S. and European regulation, among other areas of healthcare. She also worked in comms for the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. She has lived in San Francisco, New York, and London in her career and has spent time in Antigua, Guatemala, and Budapest. When not running a global healthcare practice, she has a passion for arts and culture. De Schweinitz has supported New York institutions including the New York Historical Society, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. –––––––––––––––––––––– 28. Ray Kerins, SVP and head of U.S. comms, government relations and policy, Bayer Ray Kerins, who has led comms for pharmaceutical giants including Pfizer, Merck, and now Bayer for a decade, has taken an "engage-and-educate" approach to everything he does. Since joining Bayer in 2013, he has helped launch and lead a number of innovative programs, initiatives, and partnerships. See also: Bayer creates new role: VP of comms for consumer health "Engagement of the stakeholder, regardless of who they are, should be your first move [as a communications head]," Kerins told PRWeek in an interview last year. "When we are not engaging, we don't know what stakeholders are thinking." Kerins' team makes sure the "right information" about Bayer is promoted through video, historical views on a particular product, and the publication of research on products in question. However since March, he has been spearheading Bayer's fight against the Zika virus. Indeed, Kerins handles any number of responsibilities that require him to parry scrutiny from regulators, NGOs, and consumers. He serves as chairman of Bayer's PAC and as executive sponsor of Bayer Resources for Armed Forces Veteran Employees and BLEND, a global resource for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employees and supporters. –––––––––––––––––––––– 27. Donna Murphy, global CEO, Havas Health Donna Murphy has spent much of the past year trying to better align Havas Health's capabilities with growing client demands. Judging by the company's recent maneuvers, it's a task she has embraced. In June 2015, the firm acquired Just:: Health Communications, a London-based PR shop it renamed Havas Just::. Three months later, Havas Health launched a consultancy named Xigxag. See also: 3 questions for 5 of the agency's world's leading executives In November, the company picked up med-ed agency Symbiotix, a deal that added 45 employees to the agency's roster. Finally, in February 2016, Havas Health announced it would partner with Vencore Health Analytics to expand usage of Vencore's patient-finder technology, which identifies clinical trial candidates with rare diseases. In July, Murphy told MM&M Havas Health aims to remain hyper-focused on results-oriented solutions. "We will continue to push diversification so our ability to solve problems across the complex health matrix is comprehensive and unparalleled," she said. "Changes in healthcare are not stopping, so you can be sure we won't stop, either." –––––––––––––––––––––– 26. Eileen Sheil, executive director, corporate communications, Cleveland Clinic By Johna Burke, EVP, BurrellesLuce Two of the most highly considered traits of an effective communicator are "taking the complex and making it simple" and using research and measurement to guide strategy. Working in the ever-changing and incredibly complex world of healthcare, Eileen is superb at working with the media. See also: Cleveland Clinic aims to get guys talking in first men's health campaign To the benefit of both the clinic and its patients, she embraces challenging topics. One example is the March 2016 story about America's first uterus transplant. Women facing infertility watched with eager anticipation and could clearly understand the process, challenges, and unfortunate disappointment as they followed the story and progress of this case. A technical and emotionally charged issue was communicated clearly and effectively, in no small part owing to Eileen's leadership at the Cleveland Clinic. Her communications strategy is based on research, and the clinic measures progress in outputs, outcomes, and organizational results on an ongoing basis. She also is a global leader on the need to use research as part of communications. I work with Eileen through AMEC, where she co-chairs the AMEC nonprofit group. Its goal is to bring better communications research and measurement to nonprofits. So her exceptional work at the Cleveland Clinic is not an anomaly, but rather a trend that reinforces the value and strength of her quiet and thoughtful leadership style. Her expertise and style are unmatched, whether she is promoting global nonprofit's comms efforts or clearly communicating a complex medical procedure. –––––––––––––––––––––– 25. Chuck Greener, SVP, global communications and corporate affairs, Walgreens Boots Alliance By Yves Romestan, SVP, communications and international affairs, Walgreens Boots Alliance In-depth knowledge, industry expertise, and intense motivation are some of the key characteristics of any fine influencer. But the true essence of Chuck ­Greener's influence lies much deeper, starting with his ability to bridge gaps and bring people together. For me, Henry Ford's famous "Coming together is a beginning, keeping together is progress, working together is success" lies behind Chuck's influence. Chuck is an outstanding expert in U.S. public affairs and a gifted communicator. From advising the Reagan administration to serving Walgreens Boots Alliance, Chuck has always demonstrated that effective and innovative communications has the ability to powerfully engage and empower stakeholders. Passionate about bringing people together and developing meaningful projects wherever he goes, Chuck always pulls it off by involving and listening to those around him, as well as by creating strong dynamics for everyone to work toward. Brilliant at public speaking, Chuck is also driven by a strong set of personal and professional values. It is impossible to list all of Chuck's achievements, but his contribution to the successful merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots into the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance was outstanding. I feel privileged to know a loyal, committed, and talented gentleman I am proud to call a great friend and business partner. –––––––––––––––––––––– 24. Dana Maiman, CEO and president, FCB Health While no big-agency chief lacked big-picture challenges during the tumultuous past two years, FCB Health's Dana Maiman had perhaps the most difficult with which to contend: In March 2015, FCB and McCann Health parent, Interpublic Group, eliminated its third health-marketing network, ICC Lowe, and folded its three brands into FCB. The unexpected move delivered some 275 employees and a raft of potential client conflicts onto Maiman's doorstep. She didn't so much as blink. Nearly two years later, FCB has smoothly integrated the entirety of the former ICC Lowe operation. See also: ICC and Pace merge, renamed Cure Two brands were united as FCBCure, while the other was recast as a med-ed specialty shop. In the process, it blew past the 800-employee and $140 million milestones, expanding its relationships with A-listers including Novartis, Teva, and Amgen. The secret to Maiman's success lies in her approachability and flexibility. Every agency leader claims a warm connection with employees up and down the company organizational chart, but Maiman actually walks the walk. She's also hands-on with FCB clients — in a good way. Asked last year by MM&M about the pros and cons of working with biotech startups compared with pharma monoliths, Maiman doesn't take the bait. "Come on. Do you have more than one kid? Even if you have 20, you find something awesome and adorable about each one." –––––––––––––––––––––– 23. Elaine Leavenworth, SVP, chief marketing and external affairs officer, Abbott Since Elaine Leavenworth assumed her current role as SVP, and chief marketing and external affairs officer in 2014, Abbott has overtaken a number of memorable consumer efforts. The company grew its rehydration fluid, PediaLyte, audience in 2015 by focusing on See the Lyte, a spot that features clever ways of showing how it fits into adult lifestyles. During her tenure, Abbott struck gold again for Similac, with the Sisterhood of Motherhood, whose video featured a playground confrontation between different kinds of moms and attracted nearly 6 million views in less than two weeks. Beyond her marketing efforts, Leavenworth is, by any account, deeply embedded within her community and her company's philanthropic efforts. During her 25-year career at Abbott, she has held roles from manager of strategic planning to licensing and new business development, VP of government affairs, and division president of Abbott health systems. –––––––––––––––––––––– 22. Carolyn Castel, VP, corporate communications, CVS Health Carolyn Castel has spearheaded comms during CVS' game-changing announcement to cease selling tobacco products in 2014. More recently, CVS began replacing 25% of candy at the front end with healthier snacks. Castel, a 10-year CVS veteran, has also had to shape messaging around the company's decision to add 35 products to its list of excluded drugs in 2017 due to “hyperinflation” in pricing in favor of lower-priced alternatives. See also: PBMs unveil 2017 formularies, retain focus on exclusions Early on, Castel played a key role in defining CVS Caremark's message around its evolution — from CVS, a top drugstore chain, to CVS Caremark, a pharmacy healthcare provider with $139.4 billion in annual revenue in 2015. Castel leads the company's efforts in corporate reputation, media relations, crisis planning and issues management, and CSR. Prior to working at CVS, she was SVP, corporate and public affairs, at Edelman. –––––––––––––––––––––– 21. Julie Gerberding, EVP, chief patient officer, strategic comms, global public policy and population health, Merck Julie Gerberding's career has spanned the health system. After starting her career in academia at the University of California, San Francisco, Gerberding went on to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as its director from 2002 to 2009. During that time, she presided over the agency during a remarkable number of public health crises, including the anthrax attacks that killed five people, Hurricane Katrina, and the outbreaks of West Nile virus and SARS. See also: Merck educates doctors about biosimilars, long before it will sell one in the U.S. Gerberding stepped down from that post in 2009 when President Barack Obama took office. After a year as a consultant, she was named president of Merck's vaccine division, then a $5 billion business. While at the helm of the company's vaccine division, she oversaw the proliferation of the first vaccine for the human papillomavirus, Merck's Gardasil. –––––––––––––––––––––– MM&M's and PRWeek's Health Influencer 50 50-41 • 40-31 • 30-21 • 20-11 • 10 • 9 • 8 • 7 • 6 • 5 • 4 • 3 • 2 • 1 From the November 2016 Issue of MMM » Share this content: facebook twitter linkedin google Comments Print Previous Post Health Influencer 50 4031 Next Post Health Influencer 50 2011 Similar Articles Health Influencer 50 How We Picked the Health Influencer 50 Health Influencer 50: No. 9 Health Influencer 50: 50-41 Health Influencer 50: No. 3 Related Topics People Health Influencer 50 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Photo credit: King-of-Herrings/Creative Commons Drugmakers took issue with the design of two planned FDA studies examining the use of animation in direct-to-consumer advertising, according to comment letters released this week. The FDA had announced plans to study the use of superimposed text and animation in DTC advertising. The agency said it hopes the studies will answer two questions: Do consumers process ads with animation differently? And is consumer understanding affected when animation is used to personify a disease, a drug's benefit, or the patient? The FDA first posted a notice in March asking for public comment on how it will conduct this research. That comment period ended in May. The notice published earlier this week is to allow for comment on that proposed collection, which includes both industry comments and the agency's responses to their input.  The FDA, in the proposed guidance, said it would look at how rotoscoping or live action animation is used in DTC ads, with plans to ask participants about the uncanny valley hypothesis or whether they felt that live action animation elicits a feeling of eeriness in viewers. See also: The FDA wants to study DTC tactics One recent example of this is Allergan and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals' ad for IBS-C treatment Linzess, which used live action animation to show the different ways the disease affects a patient's daily life. Eli Lilly criticized that question in a comment letter, calling it “leading” and saying “it directs participants to respond only negatively about their perceptions of the character.” Citing the uncanny valley hypothesis, the FDA responded that it felt it was crucial to keep the question. Merck also weighed, saying that results from this research “may not translate readily into FDA DTC policy/guidance” because the research largely addresses how the execution of certain kinds of animation affects perception. The FDA responded by saying that it needs to build a foundation of research on this subject “because there is no previous research of this kind. This will be an informative study that will help FDA develop guidance and policy in the future, should the research reveal a need to.” See also: Industry criticizes FDA's proposed DTC studies Another drugmaker, GlaxoSmithKline, said the research may be reductive because it “oversimplifies animation by not incorporating multiple types of animation or examining ads that are 100% versus partially animated” and because of that “is unlikely to yield any general conclusions about the use of animation.” The FDA said that it is using a “reasonable” number of variations including full animation and rotoscoping, saying it will “ensure that our conclusions are reasonable.” The comment period highlights tension between the FDA and the pharma industry over the extent to which regulatory research should inform new policy and to what degree animation affects consumer perception. The industry levied criticism at the agency over its word choice for some survey questions, the extrapolation of this study's results into policy, and oversimplifying animation by not incorporating multiple types of the tactic. The full comments from the industry and responses by the FDA can be read here. Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the drug advertised by Allergan and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals using live-action animation. It is Linzess, not Viberzi.  Share this content: facebook twitter linkedin google Comments Print Similar Articles FDA to study DTC ads Drugmakers eye growing IBS market with DTC push Industry criticizes FDA's proposed DTC studies The FDA wants to study DTC tactics The FDA warns drugmakers over promotion of experimental opioid Related Topics DTC FDA Pharma Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.
