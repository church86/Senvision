Tune in to CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" at 10am Tuesday. Bill George will be a guest. The disregard for children's health that Mylan CEO Heather Bresch demonstrated in her testimony to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee directly harms consumers. Less directly, Mylan's exceptionally high price increases erode public confidence in all medical companies, including those investing billions in research to help people suffering from life-threatening diseases. When companies like Mylan, Valeant and Turing Pharmaceuticals — which have grown profits through financial engineering, not drug discovery — take advantage of loopholes in our health-care system, they create public outrage against all medical companies. I have a growing concern this outrage will have dire consequences for research-based pharmaceutical companies, and could even lead to price controls. Rather than acknowledging her mistakes in raising EpiPen prices 500 percent from $100 to more than $600, Bresch has tried to obfuscate her actions by shifting the blame to health plans and pharmacy benefits managers that have instituted co-payment and high deductible plans to keep premiums low for strapped consumers. Mylan's largest price increases came shortly after the FDA pulled its competitors off the market, leaving the firm with a monopoly. Meanwhile, Bresch claimed Mylan was not making much money on EpiPens while admitting it earned $100 on a net selling price of $274 (after normal discounts). In her testimony she said Mylan earned $100 on a net selling price of $274 (after normal discounts). It turns out that Bresch misstated Mylan's profit on Epipens – it's actually $160, not $100, as the Wall Street Journal reported. That is a profit margin of 60 percent – exceptionally high by any standard. Yet she could not answer basic questions from Congress about revenues from EpiPens and their contribution to Mylan's profits. Bresch used EpiPen's success to fuel her rapid rise to the CEO's office, yet she proved in that testimony that she is not stepping up to the responsibilities her role demands. Publicly, she led with her chin by saying, "I am running a business to make money" as if she were running a financial fund. Bresch may feel protected from the wrath of Congress and the public by Mylan's highly unusual governance procedures, established when the company executed a tax inversion to The Netherlands in 2015 after it turned down a purchase offer from rival Teva valued at more than twice today's stock price. Under its procedures shareholders don't get to nominate board members; only the board can do that. Authentic health-care companies from Mayo to Merck understand they are in business to restore people's health, and if they did that well, profits would follow. Mylan seems to be ignoring Merck founder George Merck's admonition, "Medicine is for the people. It is not for the profits. The profits follow, and if we have remembered that, they have never failed to appear." At Medtronic, our founder Earl Bakken charged us with "using biomedical engineering … to restore health." As Medtronic revenues grew from $400 million in 1985 to $30 billion today, every CEO has faithfully followed Bakken's mission through good times and difficult ones. Medtronic's proudest achievement over these 31 years is not its growth in shareholder value from $400 million to $120 billion, but fulfilling its original mission by expanding the number of new patients restored each year from 150,000 to 30 million today. In 1990 in response to public concerns over rising health-care costs, Medtronic instituted a "no price increase" policy. This put pressure on us to reduce our costs while spurring investment in more advanced products. It paid off with rapid growth and high profits, which were invested in research and development, expansion into emerging markets, and acquisitions to broaden the company's base. One of Bresch's only defenders in this experience is disgraced former hedge-fund manager Martin Shkreli, who resigned as CEO of Turing after his outrageous 5,500 percent price increases on an AIDS drug fueled public anger. To Bresch's credit, she tried to answer questions, while just Shkreli smirked in his Congressional appearance while taking the Fifth Amendment. He later arrogantly called the congressmen, "imbeciles." The public furor these bad actors have stirred up will not subside soon, especially in this election year, and are stimulating legislative actions rather than market-based solutions. Pharmaceutical companies have long argued that they need patent protection and pricing freedom in order to justify returns on large investments in research. Yet that argument falls flat in the cases of Mylan, Valeant and Turing, which historically have not invested in research. As long as these types of companies stay in news, public pressure will mount for government price controls or at least the ability to negotiate prices. The unintended consequence of such actions could be cutbacks in high-risk research aimed at curing and healing the most threatening diseases that require high returns to justify high costs. In contrast, the major pharmaceutical companies base their success on high-cost, high-risk science with long lead times and no assurance of returns. In recent years some short-term investors have argued for cutting back research and simply buying drugs from others. Yet those who have committed to research without hesitation — Merck, Amgen, Genentech and Novartis, just to name a few – have created breakthrough drugs that saved millions of lives and generated high returns on their investments for their long-term shareholders. With pharmaceutical prices now under public scrutiny, responsible leaders of medical companies should call for and demonstrate restraint in setting prices for their products, especially when they enjoy protected positions. Thus far, the only CEOs to speak out publicly against these abuses are GSK's Andrew Witty, Merck's Ken Frazier and Allergan's Brent Saunders. They should be voluntarily joined by other CEOs and industry associations like PhRMA and AdvaMed. The time for health care's leaders to act is now, before Congress acts for them.

It is one of the huge challenges our public health facilities have, for long, grappled with. The hospitals are supplied drugs by the MSD. By Citizen In yesterday’s issue of The Citizen, we carried a story highlighting a perennial problem in our health sector: drug shortage in public hospitals. The story brought to light the desperate situation the Medical Stores Department (MSD) is in. It is owed Sh142 billion by the government. The issue is not new. It is one of the huge challenges our public health facilities have, for long, grappled with. The hospitals are supplied drugs by the MSD. Unfortunately, not much has been done to address the matter once and for all, which would have entailed putting in place a systems that ensures smooth-running of the MSD. The supply of drugs to public hospitals is being hampered by serious shortage of funds the MSD faces. A drugs supply monitoring undertaken by the health NGO, Sikika, indicates that the government has provided only 32 per cent of the money that the agency needs for quarter ending on Friday. It further reveals that the government has only released Sh20 billion to MSD for the purchase of important medicines and medical supplies by September 16, out of the Sh62.5 billion that should have been released for the July-September quarter. In mid this year, the Parliament approved for the MSD Sh250 billion for the 2016/17 fiscal year. As of September 16, the agency’s warehouses in the country had only 170 units of Paracetamol tablets with one unit containing 1,000 tables. It is the ordinary citizens who are seriously affected by the shortage of drugs and other medical sundries at public hospitals. Private pharmacies In some government health institutions, patients are forced to buy medicines from private pharmacies. This is something which can no longer be glossed over, for it endangers the lives of many hapless patients. It is a situation that calls for a swift and pragmatic response from relevant authorities. This depressing scenario isn’t confined to one or two public hospitals; it is a worrying situation which is quite widespread. In rural areas, some State-run health facilities have ceased to perform their primary function. Looking at the cases highlighted above, it is easy to find out where the problem is. In most of these cases, the Medical Stores Department (MSD) has been castigated by health centres for the delays. MSD has, however, often blamed slow supply of drugs to the public hospitals on lack of funds as it owed billions by the State. In some cases, the agency says it supplies health units after receiving their orders. So where is the problem? Do the health centres send their orders late? Is the government not committed to addressing the challenges that affect timely delivery of drugs and other medical supplies to health facilities? These are questions the Health ministry, administrators of facilities and MSD should critically study and answer if we are to rid our health sector of the chronic problem of drug shortage. While the government is hailed for its cost-cutting drive and war against corruption, for some, shortage of drugs in public hospitals is a clear case of misplaced priorities.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 27, 2016 at 12:06PM Flat across the past 52 weeks, and down 3% since the year began, Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) has had a hard time keeping up with the rest of the stock market lately. But according to one analyst, that's all about to change -- and Lilly doesn't even need a blockbuster to prove it. This morning, megabanker Goldman Sachs announced that it is upgrading shares of Eli Lilly from neutral to buy, and assigning the stock a $95 price target. If Goldman is right about that, new investors stand to earn an 18% profit on Eli Lilly stock, and collect a 2.5% dividend yield on top of it, resulting in total returns of better than 20% on their investment. But is Goldman Sachs right? Here are three things you need to know. Goldman Sachs thinks Eli Lilly investors could be sitting on potentially big profits. Image source: Getty Images. 1. "A long lasting period of accelerating revenue and EPS growth" Despite the stock's lackluster performance of late, Goldman Sachs sees a bright future for Eli Lilly -- which is kind of curious. Just five years ago, Wall Street was worrying that all of big pharma -- Lilly included -- would tumble off a "patent cliff" and break its collective neck. But just five years later, Goldman says that today, Eli Lilly boasts "a diversified late stage pipeline" of drugs coming to market.  These drugs, argues Goldman, will enable "many years of margin expansion" at Lilly, ushering in "a long lasting period of accelerating revenue and EPS growth" for the drugmaker. As sketched out in a write-up on StreetInsider.com this morning, Goldman describes how Lilly stock "can grow earnings by double digits over the next five years and by high single digits out to 2025 as it has among the most durable franchises in the industry." 2. How good could this get? Goldman predicts "$12.5 [billion] of new product sales by 2020" at Lilly, which will account for "nearly 50% of total sales" that year. That implies total sales of $25 billion -- about 20% greater than what Lilly collects in revenue today. (And that number could be conservative. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the consensus expectation for Lilly's sales in 2020 is $26.6 billion). Granted, that still won't put Lilly in the same league as Merck (NYSE:MRK) or Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), expected to grow revenue to $44 billion and $58 billion, respectively. But relative to the revenues these three Big Pharma giants collect today, Goldman's projections for Lilly imply that Lilly stock will grow its revenue twice as fast as either Merck or Pfizer. Additionally, Goldman says that Lilly is already starting to "show improvements" in its "operational performance," where operating profit margin hit 18.8%. 3. Ace in the hole Again, an 18.8% margin falls short of the big boys. Last year, Merck outclassed Lilly on margins by 2 full percentage points (20.8%), while Pfizer led the pack with a 28.1% operating profit margin. But Lilly still has one more card to play that could lift it above the competition. That would be Sola, Lilly's experimental Alzheimer's drug, which Goldman Sachs calls a "potential blockbuster." The analyst only gives Sola about a 35% "probability of success." But if the drug works as promised, and the FDA approves it, Goldman says that single drug could add a further $7.5 billion in peak sales for Lilly, "and super charge LLY's earnings profile." Bonus thing: Goldman Sachs' record With Eli Lilly stock selling for 34.5 times earnings today, Goldman Sachs' recommendation to buy the stock is not without risk. Currently, Merck stock costs 34.1 times earnings, and Pfizer less than 30, so Goldman is urging us to buy a stock with less revenue, and lower profit margins, than its rivals -- and pay a higher P/E ratio in the process. That sounds dangerous. On the other hand, we've been tracking Goldman's record on Motley Fool CAPS for well over a decade now, and according to our data, Goldman is actually pretty good at picking winners in big pharma. The past decade has seen Goldman's pharmaceuticals picks outperform the market by a combined 448 percentage points. 58% of the time, when Goldman says a stock will beat the market, that's precisely what it does. While that doesn't necessarily mean Goldman will be right this time, the potential is certainly there. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

It is used as a prefilter with the firm's Viresolve Pro Device for more robust, cost-effective viral clearance. When the two products are used together, the Viresolve Pro Shield H significantly increases processing capacity, while preserving high virus removal and high flux, the firm said. The result is an efficient virus filtration process with lower filter costs, faster processing times and less sensitivity to feed stream variability. 'As feed stream characteristics continue to change, filtration products must evolve to enable successful viral clearance to ensure drug safety,' said Andrew Bulpin, Head of Process Solutions Strategic Marketing & Innovation at Merck's life science business. 'Viresolve Pro Shield H effectively improves aggregate removal and reduces the required virus filtration area needed to process feed streams, while delivering the same high level of virus clearance our customers rely on.' Recombinant protein, mAb, fusion protein and antibody fragment feed streams can be challenging to process efficiently, both in terms of time and cost, because these proteins tend to aggregate during production. Aggregates can cause virus filters to foul more rapidly, reducing the amount of feed that can be processed and increasing the number of filters required to process the same volume.

The parties hope to complete the deal in Q1 2017.  Pharmaron sees this as a unique opportunity to acquire state-of-the-art Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standard facilities for the development of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) and formulation development in Europe to complement Pharmaron’s existing world class chemistry and integrated drug discovery and development services globally. Under the deal, MSD will remain on site on and lease-back the main office buildings. MSD UK and Ireland managing director Louise Houson said: “We are very pleased to be progressing this deal with Pharmaron.

AgWired Animal Ag Precision Energy AgNewsWire ZimmComm Navigation Subscribe Advertise About Subscribe Advertise About Merck Animal Health Beef Sustainability Calculator App Merck Animal Health Beef Sustainability Calculator App Jamie Johansen September 27, 2016 Leave a Comment Facebook Twitter Email Print Merck Animal Health has launched a new app for Apple and Android. The Meat Sustainability Calculator, which is designed to help producers, suppliers and others in the food chain better understand how the beef production systems and technologies they use impact the environment. The app was created in partnership with Jude Capper, Ph.D., an independent sustainability consultant. Data from peer-reviewed journals was utilized to establish a standard of the environmental impact of North American beef production practices. The Meat Sustainability Calculator enables users to evaluate their own impact on sustainability by comparing their results to the North American average. Producers and suppliers can compare on a per-head-of-cattle scenario, while food service members or retailers can assess based on amount of beef produced or purchased. Users simply enter the number of cattle they desire to evaluate, or the pounds or kilograms of beef they will be supplying or purchasing. Next, they select various production technologies to determine how they impact sustainability. By comparing individual results to industry benchmarks, individuals can identify opportunities to improve the sustainability of their operations through things such as water usage and land management. “We are excited about this app, as it is unique to the industry – helping those in the beef supply chain realize the impact of their current production methods,” said Jennie Hodgen, Ph.D., Senior Account Manager, Veterinary and Consumer Affairs Team, Merck Animal Health. “Regardless of a person’s role in the chain, the calculator helps assess an operation’s greenhouse gas emissions, as well as water and land usage. Armed with this data, users can be more mindful of their environmental footprint by making a conscious effort to use fewer natural resources to raise healthy animals.” Agribusiness, Animal Health, Apps, Beef, Cattle, Merck, sustainability Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Sep 27, 2016 at 8:06AM Image source: Getty Images. Last week, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) agreed to a deal with privately held biopharma company OncoImmune. It could be worth up to $250 million in up-front and milestone payments if the monoclonal antibody at the center of the licensing agreement succeeds. While investors in this industry should hardly be surprised by speculative R&D deals, such agreements can provide clues as to which disease targets larger pharma companies are interested in before they go mainstream (see: CAR-T, CRISPR, etc). In this case, Pfizer's latest deal hints that investors may want to keep a closer eye on Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN). Here's why things could heat up for the $630 million company. What's the deal? The Pfizer-OncoImmune entanglement will investigate a single immunotherapy that targets CTLA-4, a protein secreted by cancer cells that blocks the activation of T cells. Related mechanisms have demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in several small studies and even larger trials. Blockbuster melanoma drug Yervoy from Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, is a first-in-class CTLA-4 antagonist. If this newly acquired immunotherapy is successful in the early going, then Pfizer has the option to secure rights to other CTLA-4 antibodies in OncoImmune's pipeline. What's funny is that Pfizer actually owned an immunotherapy candidate in the same class years ago, but it licensed most of the rights to AstraZeneca. Oops. The renewed interest in targeting CTLA-4 could be great news for Agenus, whose lead lead drug candidate is a CTLA-4 antagonist in phase 1 trials. Better yet for investors, the drug candidate is currently unpartnered -- an oddity, given that the company's active pipeline of 10 trials includes six partnered programs with Incyte and Merck.  And Agenus may have even more to offer a potential partner. Although the company was due to receive royalties from sales of two GlaxoSmithKline vaccines that contained adjuvants it developed, Agenus opted to sell rights to the royalties to a capital firm for an up-front infusion of $115 million in cash. It was a clear signal that management is going all in on its most valuable asset -- an antibody discovery platform that was integral to grabbing the attention of Incyte and Merck, and to finding the CTLA-4 antagonist in the first place. Executing currently partnered programs and bringing in new deals will be the deciding factor in Agenus' existence. A few past pivots have left it with an unenviable balance sheet. While it has about five quarters' worth of cash remaining, the early-stage pipeline necessitates bringing in additional capital. Perhaps partnering its prized anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy candidate could provide some relief. Then again, if the company could push the drug candidate through phase 2 trials before partnering, then it would be able to get even sweeter financial terms. Given the company's cash position, it may be best not to take that route, but it's too early to tell. What does it mean for investors? After selling its own CTLA-4 antagonist to AstraZeneca five years ago, Pfizer decided that it wanted back in on the potentially lucrative immunotherapy class of drugs. The deal with OncoImmune could signal renewed interest in the drug target, which could put Agenus in an advantageous position if other pharma leaders go on the prowl. Investors should definitely keep an eye on the company and its antibody discovery platform.  Maxx Chatsko has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Revenues were US$5.5mln in the six months to June, a 30% increase and slightly ahead of a forecast in July. “We are trading in-line with expectations for the full year as both our partnered cell therapy and CARMA programs progress,” said Doug Doerfler, chief executive. MaxCyte’s cell engineering tech is used by AstraZeneca, Merck and Roche among others but it is also developing CARMA, its own proprietary platform to tackle cancer. At present, MaxCyte is involved in more than 35 partnered programmes, with seven clinical trials underway using its technology. "As the convergence between gene editing technologies and immuno-oncology therapeutic advances, MaxCyte is poised to foster the next-generation of therapies," said Doerfler. Its cell engineering technology was being used to leverage cells for drug discovery, cells for biologics/vaccine development and manufacture and cells as drugs in immuno-oncology and gene editing, he added. Underlying losses dipped to US$0.8mln from US$0.9mln, but including a further US$500,000 invested in CARMA net losses rose to US$1.27mln (US$0.96mln).Cash at the half year was  Cash at the period end of US$12.2mln.  "Our IPO has also allowed us to advance CARMA, our exciting, new generation of immuno-oncology treatments, from incubation to pre-clinical work that is laying the foundation for an initial US regulatory submission that is expected to allow clinical trials to begin in 2017. “ Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version Philip Whiterow Why Invest In MaxCyte?

Angeleño elderlies get free anti-pneumonia vaccination Skip to main content Archive Webcast E-paper Videos Multimedia Home Local News Business Opinion Sports Feature Lifestyle Entertainment Home / Pampanga / Local News / Angeleño elderlies get free anti-pneumonia vaccination Angeleño elderlies get free anti-pneumonia vaccination Time to read less than 1 minute Share Print a- a+ Read so far Angeleño elderlies get free anti-pneumonia vaccination Tuesday, September 27, 2016 ANGELES CITY -- As part of the Grandparents Day celebration, the local government here and the Department of Health Region III (DOH-3), administered a pneumococcal disease immunization program to over 250 senior citizens here on September 26 at the City Hall. The said program aims to prevent Pneumonia among the elderly by intensifying DOH's nationwide efforts in implementing the Expanded Immunization Program for Senior Citizens. This is in cooperation with a US-based pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD). The program encourages senior citizens, aged 60 and 65 years old to avail of free pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination which will be administered in their community health centers. "Vaccines have long been available in the Philippines, specifically in the private sector. DOH is ensuring that there are enough resources and access to life-saving medicines and services, particularly to the Filipinos who need them most," said Dr. Leonita Gorgolon, DOH cluster head for Central Luzon and Visayas. The vaccination consists of two doses: senior citizens aged 60 years old will be given the first dose and will receive the second dose after a 5-year interval. On the other hand, senior citizens aged 65 years old will receive one dose. Pneumococcal disease is a leading cause of serious illness throughout the world. It is caused by a common type of bacteria, the Streptococcus Pneumonia, which can attack different parts of the body. Illnesses caused by pneumococcus include pneumonia, meningitis, middle ear and sinus infections and a condition called sepsis or infection of the bloodstream. DOH urges senior citizens to avail of free Anti-Pneumonia vaccination in designated health centers in the city.

Shares of Deutsche Bank hit an all-time low and interest rates are moving lower. Pfizer is pulling drugmakers down after it announced it won’t break up into two companies. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average lost 153 points, or 0.8 percent, to 18,107 as of 3:15 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell 17 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,147. The Nasdaq composite dropped 44 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,262. Stocks also fell Friday, but they are coming off two weeks of solid gains, and the Nasdaq set all-time highs twice last week. LET’S STAY TOGETHER: Pfizer, one of the largest drug companies in the world, traded lower after it said it will not split up into two smaller companies. Some of its investors had supported that plan in the hope it would bolster the value of their stock and accelerate growth, but the Viagra maker has been signaling that it probably wouldn’t break up. Its stock fell 62 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $33.64. QUEASY FEELING: Other drugmakers also slipped. Merck fell 90 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $62.06 and Bristol-Myers Squibb slid 91 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $55.57. DEUTSCHE DOWN: Deutsche Bank slumped after German newsweekly Focus said the German government won’t help the bank by intervening with U.S. officials who want Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities. The report, published Friday, cited government sources. Deutsche Bank stock tumbled 89 cents, or 7 percent, to $11.86. It’s down 51 percent in 2016 and is setting all-time lows. BANKS: Deutsche Bank’s woes weighed on financial stocks, especially those in Europe. Banks were also hurt by falling bond yields, which mean lower interest rates and smaller profits on lending. Goldman Sachs took the largest loss among Dow stocks and sank $3.74, or 2.3 percent, to $161.39. Citigroup shed $1.24, or 2.4 percent, to $45.91. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 1.59 percent from 1.62 percent. CONSUMER CHILL: Shares of Home Depot and Lowe’s sank after the government said sales of new homes fell almost 8 percent in August. That followed a big jump the month before. While sales of new homes have risen over the last year, there simply aren’t a lot of houses on the market. Home Depot shed $2.17, or 1.7 percent, to $125.62 and Lowe’s fell $1.50, or 2.1 percent, to $70.85. That was part of a broad slump for consumer companies. GOOD CHEMISTRY: Specialty chemicals maker Chemtura climbed after it agreed to be bought by Germany’s Lanxess. Lanxess is paying $33.50 per share for Chemtura, a 19-percent premium, and the companies valued the deal at $2.5 billion. Chemtura stock gained $4.44, or 15.7 percent, to $32.62. MAKING A TRADE: CBOE Holdings, the parent company of the Chicago Board of Exchange, will buy stock exchange operator Bats Global Markets. The companies valued the deal at $3.2 billion, or $32.50 in cash and stock per share of Bats. Bats stock jumped 20 percent Friday as investors hoped that a deal was imminent, and it fell $1.28, or 4 percent, to $30.52. CBOE stock lost $3.47, or 4.9 percent, to $66.83. OIL: Oil prices bounced higher as investors monitor a meeting of oil producers in Algeria. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.45, or 3.3 percent, to $45.93 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose $1.46, or 3.2 percent, to $47.35 a barrel in London. Oil exploration companies rose the most. Transocean climbed 45 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $9.55 and Noble Energy added 63 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $33.65. TENURE’S END: Casual clothing retailer Lands’ End skidded after the departure of its CEO. Federica Marchionni left Dolce & Gabbana to join Lands’ End less than two years ago but was unable to stop a decline in sales. Lands’ End stock lost $2.70, or 15 percent, to $15.30. It is down 35 percent this year. ARISE, ARRAY: Drug developer Array BioPharma surged $2.57, or 70.3 percent, to $6.22 after it reported good results for an experimental melanoma treatment in a clinical trial. CURRENCIES: The dollar slid to 100.36 yen from 101.09 yen. The euro rose to $1.1255 from $1.1231. METALS: Gold edged up $2.40 to $1,344.10 an ounce. Silver dipped 21 cents to $19.60 an ounce. Copper stayed at $2.20 a pound. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.40 a gallon. Heating oil rose 4 cents, or 3 percent, to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas added 4 cents to $3 per 1,000 cubic feet. OVERSEAS: The DAX in Germany dropped 2.2 percent and France’s CAC 40 fell 1.8 percent. In Britain, the FTSE 100 was down 1.3 percent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 edged down 1.3 percent. South Korea’s Kospi slipped 0.3 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 1.7 percent. banking Business finance Mississippi NASDAQ New York Stock Exchange NEWS stocks 2016-09-26 Associated Press tweet Tagged with: banking Business finance Mississippi NASDAQ New York Stock Exchange NEWS stocks Previous: Polo Custom Products expanding in Louisville, creating 30 Jobs Next: State economist: Mississippi economy grows, but lags US About Associated Press More Stories Like This Mississippi wants former college students to finish degrees November 17, 2016 Doe’s replicating its steak and tamales formula November 17, 2016 Hancock panel hires adviser for development plan November 17, 2016 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Being the third such request I’d received in as many weeks, I figured it was time to take a closer look at the shingles vaccine. Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, can cause a serious and very painful rash. Judy’s friend Jane was urging her to get vaccinated for shingles. Jane’s husband Stan had a case of shingles that Stan described as “worse than anything he has ever known, including spinal surgery.” Sometimes, open sores accompany the rash and the pain is so severe people have trouble walking and sleeping. In rare cases, the complications of shingles can last for months and sometimes years. That fact surely caught Judy’s attention. In fact, she admitted she had a profound fear of the disease having seen her aunt go through postherpetic neuralgia where the pain continues to last even after the rash and blisters have disappeared. In her opinion, any level of pain seems bearable if you know it will eventually end, but the thought of living with such pain for life made a compelling argument for getting vaccinated. So what could I say about the vaccine called Zostavax being promoted to prevent shingles? I always like to start my research by looking at the pointy end of things: the marketing. If there is one principle in play, it’s that the marketing diverges from the science. And since the advertising is what patients and physicians will likely see first, that’s a good place to start. The ads for Zostavax, made by drug giant Merck, lay out the hook in bold letters: “Have you had your shingles vaccine yet?” In typical marketing style, that innocent question is driven home by the fear factor, reminding us that this is something we all need to be worried about. In smaller print, the ad says, “In Canada, it is estimated that nearly 1 in 3 people will develop shingles in their lifetime.” Ok, if true, this establishes that shingles doesn’t seem to be such a rare condition. Most of us who have had chicken pox as children are susceptible and it usually strikes people over 60, though no one is really sure how or why this happens. Many of us know someone, maybe our mother, friend or neighbour, who has a horror story to tell about the unbearable pain shingles can deliver. I didn’t have to go far to hear some anecdotes. I asked my mother about it and learned that she had had shingles a few years ago that lasted several weeks, which included three visits to the hospital and incredible pain across her stomach. Treatment for shingles usually involves antivirals (drugs such as acyclovir), which, if given early enough, can help shorten the length and intensity of the rash. The vaccine marketer captures the disease’s potential for serious pain with graphic ads featuring a lot of flames and thorns with a clear and unspoken question: “Do you want your life to be a living hell?” Now that we’ve established the nastiness of the disease, the first question has to address the science: “Does the Zostavax vaccine work?” If a vaccine is about protecting you from a disease, you need to know your likelihood of getting the disease in the first place. One study from the British Medical Journal says that for people over 50, approximately two to three people out of a thousand per year get shingles; that increases to about eight per thousand for those 70 and over. The average doctor with 1,500 patients in his care would see about three to five cases per year. A 2005 study in the New England Journal of Medicine enrolled over 38,000 people over 60 and reported that, over three years, the vaccine Zostavax “reduces the occurrence of herpes zoster by 51.3%.” Wow. So if you know 100 people who got vaccinated, the vaccine would prevent half of them from getting shingles, right? Wrong. Remember, if the average doctor sees five cases a year in his practice and he manages to reduce that load by 50%, he’d only see maybe 2.5 cases per year. But how many thousands would he have to vaccinate to prevent those other 2.5 cases? A lot. This study of the vaccine, which was a gold standard, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, measured the incidence, severity and duration of the pain caused by shingles. Let’s focus on just one of those: incidence. Basically, how many people were prevented from getting shingles? The study noted there were 315 shingles cases among those vaccinated and 642 among placebo recipients, concluding that it reduced the rate of shingles by 51.3 percent. Another way this is expressed is in “1,000-person years” where the effects are examined in 1,000 people for one year. The study found that the vaccine dropped the rates of shingles per 1,000 person-years from 11.12 (those on placebo) to 5.42 (those given the vaccine). What this means is the vaccine ‘helps’ about 5.7 people per thousand per year (11.12 minus 5.42= 5.7). Where did the “51.3 % reduction” come from? Well, when you drop the rate from 11.12 to 5.42, that’s about half the rate, or a 51.3% reduction. To summarize, here are two ways of presenting the same data: 1) “The vaccine helps five people per thousand vaccinated. Or 2) “The vaccine helps 50% of the people vaccinated.” Hmmm. You can imagine which one gets the most traction with the marketers. So let’s talk cost. If you have to vaccinate 1,000 people per year at $150 a shot, it would cost $150,000. That’s a fair bit of money to save five people from getting shingles. In other words, the cost of avoiding shingles is about $30,000 per person per year. Does that sound like a bargain? Depends on whom you ask. If you asked Judy’s friend Jane, she’d probably say that not seeing her husband in such pain is “priceless.” If you ask governments to pay for the vaccine, seems they think it’s too high a price to pay and it isn’t covered in BC. It’s not that the vaccine doesn’t work; it’s that it hardly works. And that’s before you wander into the other side of the equation: the vaccine’s potential for adverse effects. By August 2011, in the US, the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) had received 442 serious vaccine adverse reports following Zostavax vaccination, including 36 reported deaths. While these are ‘associations’ and not causations, it still makes one pause before hitting the “jab” button. The kinds of serious shingles vaccine reactions included things like joint and muscle pain, fever, abnormally swollen glands and so on. Some might ask, “Is it possible the vaccine can actually cause shingles?” A good question to which there is no definitive answer, but rashes akin to chicken pox are mentioned on the vaccine’s label as one of the potential adverse effects. At the end of the day, facts can be twisted in any way to make a point, especially when the ‘point’ comes at the end of a syringe. But back to Jane who was caring for her husband and his very nasty bout of shingles. Seeing Stan in such pain was enough for her. She begged Judy and her other friends to get vaccinated. She went and paid the $150 to get herself vaccinated. And a few weeks later? You guessed it; she too came down with a new diagnosis. That’s right, shingles. — Alan Cassels is a pharmaceutical policy researcher at the University of Victoria and the author of Seeking Sickness: Medical Screening and the Misguided Hunt for Disease (Greystone, 2012).

This was the only article I could find not funded by the Government or Pharma with a clear analysis to the actual vaccine. I’m still in search of an ingredient list of the vaccine, and other information for her. Thanks again. Reply Tara Charles / November 26, 2012 Do you have any thoughts, or found any evidence that the rate and intensity of Shingles is increasing in North America? From what I’ve read, the U.K. didn’t implement the chickenpox vaccine for children because it feared that doing so would affect the cases of Shingles. And OMG…I work in healthcare and although this is only my anecdotal observation, Shingles is now extremely prevalent, painful, and can even lead to vision problems. (I’ve also talked to a GP who firmly believes it to be rather self evident that there has been a dramatic upswing and severity in cases of Shingles. She points to the vaccine as a likely candidate. ) Reply mary alexander / March 2, 2013 I got the vaccine about 4 years ago. I currently have a very painful Shingles. My breast and back have the rash – no itch, but horrible, horrible pain. The vaccine did not work for me Reply Sandy Foley / March 20, 2013 Is it possible that the injection is a money scam and of all the people who have received the vaccine The ones who did not get shingles, would probably never have gottem them in their life Anyway? Is there any proof to show that it really helps? Reply Lilla / March 21, 2013 I am 68 year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. I’m just getting over Shingles and I still have pain and can’t sleep because of that even if I take extra strength Tylenol…! After reading your studies regarding the Shingles Vaccine, I’ve decided to not get vaccinated for any future bouts with Shingles…! (Hopefully it won’t find me again…!) Do you have any information on how to alleviate this pain??? Thank you Lilla Reply Beth Gessinger / May 23, 2013 According to my book “Prescription for Nutritional Healing”, it advises to “avoid taking medications that contain acetaminophen (Tylenol, Datril, and others), as they may prolong the shingles. Perhaps you should try another pain killer? Good Luck, Beth Reply Carol Marica / April 12, 2013 I am 86, had shingles about 5 years ago.I had mild chest pains over my heart for about two weeks, A doctor that I went to see, spotted one blister on my back. He gave me a prescription for valacyclovir 500mg I started the pills right away and had no further pain or blisters.After reading this article I may not get the vaccination that I was contemplating. Carol Reply Chard Breed / May 12, 2013 brilliant, and so true. Thanks! Reply John Arkelian / June 16, 2013 Revised (to fix some small typos): In your article, you pose the question: “Is it possible the vaccine can actually cause shingles?” A good question to which there is no definitive answer…” Well, I know of one case in which the vaccine indisputably did cause the very illness it was intended to prevent. And neither the pharmaceutical company that made the drug (Merck Canada), nor Canada’s or Ontario’s health ministers, nor the FDA in the United States showed the slightest interest in investigating or reconsidering (or even quantifying) the vaccine’s potential risks. My published op-ed article on the case appears at this link — though you will have to scroll down to find the article, titled “When the Cure Causes the Disease…” http://artsforum.ca/ideas/regional-perspectives John Arkelian Canada Reply Larry Phillips / January 11, 2014 Like the author and many of the readers, I too have my doubts about the efficacy of the shingles vaccine. However, I question the $30,000 calculation cost to prevent one case. I believe the vaccine lasts for 10 years so wouldn’t the cost per year be $3,000. Certainly still a significant sum. Reply Kevin Friesen / January 21, 2014 While most of the numbers stated are correct (although the $30000 per person is not right, but 30000 per case of shingles avoided may be), the 5 cases per 1000 patient years is slightly misleading. By the time you are sixty, you have a 30% chance of having shingles, if you live to 80, you have a 50% chance. Imagine 100 patients observed for 60 years. This is 6000 patient years. If you have 5 cases per 1000 patient years, this ends up with 30 cases. Thirty cases in 100 people is 30%. The thing is that citing incidence rates can be very misleading unless you know how to interpret them. When I was first learning how to do population research I started by learning about zoster. When I heard about the vaccine, I to thought that if the incidence is only 5 per 1000 patient years why even bother, especially since it is only 50 to 65% effective (different studies have had different results, but the 50% is pretty good). But when you consider that you have a 30% chance of getting it by the time you are sixty, and 50% by the time you are eighty (I plan on living that long anyways), then it seems a bit more likely. More important though, in my mind, is that it is 67% effective in preventing post herpetic neuralgia, which is that intense burning nerve pain that is so extremely difficult to treat that can follow shingles. It is true that there are adverse reports, most of them are mild, but yes, a self limited rash is possible. Whether full outbreak of shingles could occur is not so obvious. We already have the virus, all of us, sleeping in all of our spinal nerves, it is not like the vaccine will wake it up, rather, it will cause the immune system to suppress it. That being said, anything can happen, but just because she got it does not necessarily mean it was from the vaccine, she might have gotten shingle anyways. Whether I think the public should pay for it, well, it is pretty expensive on a nationwide basis for how well it works, so I don’t know. Reply Dick de Seve / September 5, 2016 The problem is that these manufacturers state that ANYBODY has a 1 in 3 chance of getting shingles in their lifetime. That is absolutely false. My physician, who combines homeopathy and standard medicine, states that the actual number is more like 11%. For that, I will not be getting the vaccine. Another medical scam. Reply RJ Patterson / November 22, 2014 My interest in reading this article is that I have just had a shingles like outbreak, although the appears and symptoms are consistent my doctor has yet to examine me. The original discussion fails to consider that the ZOSTAVAX vaccination is a once in a lifetime vaccination. A booster is not recommended. As one comment noted the study population was not comprised only of seniors with elevated incidence rates. Once these issues are considered group cost of prevention is reduced substantially, by a factor of at least 30, possibly by as much as 60 ~ 90. So the cost per case of shingles prevention is reduced to as little as $350, otherwise as much as $1000. Much less than the suggested $30,000. If you get the ZOSTAVAX vaccination before you are 60 years old, you are on average providing yourself with nominally 30 years of protection, or reduction of severity. Even with only a 50 ~ 65% effectiveness rate it is a minor cost for an average budget. So, with that said, I will have the vaccination what ever my doctor advises the rash to be! Reply Cheryl / February 1, 2015 Recent studies demonstrate that immune system antibodies from vaccine are quite low after just two years. Most researchers now agree that vaccine provides a maximum of five years protection. So it is doubtful that this is a one time vaccine. As people age, incidence of shingles increases. So vaccinate a 60-year-old and he/she will have NO protection at age 70, when even more vulnerable to shingles. I will wait for vaccination until age 70. If I get Shingles before then, I will take antivirals immediately to shorten length and severity. A second bout is rare so having a case before getting vaccinated would decide that I don’t need to get vaccinated. Reply Justin White / February 18, 2016 Thanks for this – been seeing a poster at my local Coop pharmacy, and they’ve started putting it in their flier too. The ‘1 in 3 people will develop shingles’ seemed sketchy to me, I thought shingles were pretty rare. Seeing these numbers help – but where do these posters get off saying ‘1 in 3’ people will develop shingles in their lifetime? If we take into account the number of children that die, that means pretty much everyone who reaches a certain age will get it. I simply don’t believe it. Reply Reg Reid / February 20, 2016 After carefully considering the over-the-top marketing and speaking to others, I have to say the type of scare-mongering practiced by Merck pharma doesn’t have me convinced of the benefit of the vaccine. It does have me convinced the company has an ethics problem though. Reply victoria / April 26, 2016 I am a healthy person, but couple of years ago my Dr. urged me to get this vaccine, which I would not touch with 10 foot pole. When the Gov. and the doctors are suggesting the medicine, I am very sceptical. However, my friend developed a small rash on her behind, achy, itchy and blistery. As I study, read and try home remedies with anything that ails me or my friends. I suggested to her to put toothpaste on her blisters or Apple cider vinegar. IT WORKED, even the pain was gone. A lot of people are not aware, when in blisters, it is contagious if touched with body fluids. The wife who was vaccinated and then came up with diagnose of shingles, she probably got it from her husband and vaccine just made it worse. Reply Robert Dares / August 30, 2016 I contracted shingles on 19 Feb. 2016 and now after 6 months it is nearly gone. only some slight pain and itching left. I am trying to find out if it is possible to get shingles a second time. Do I need to get the vaccine? Reply daryl / September 20, 2016 I have a viral inner ear infection. It could be caused be chicken pox or herpes virus. Would the shingles vaccine affect this for good or bad?

Astellas Pharma, Accenture, and the FDA are three examples of healthcare organizations that have recently launched innovation competitions.   Innovation challenges are events or competitions that bring together disparate groups of people to generate ideas around a certain topic or to solve a difficult business issue. These ideas are then judged by experts. See also: What 10 innovation teams look like Regulatory restrictions, public scrutiny, and a risk-adverse culture are the oft-cited reasons why healthcare companies — and the FDA — are characterized as slow to adapt to change. But hackathons and other types of challenges have become prevalent in recent years. At a MM&M SkillSets Live conference in 2015, Merck executive director Aman Bhandari said there have been more than 200 hackathons in healthcare since 2010. The FDA last Wednesday announced one such contest, the 2016 Naloxone App Competition, to create a mobile app to connect overdosing opioid users with a nearby carrier of an antidote, known as naloxone. The winner will receive $40,000. Peter Lurie, the FDA's associate commissioner for public health strategy and analysis, said that bringing outside talent in to try and help solve this public health crisis is pivotal to the agency's mission of preserving the public health. “We think there's a group of people who can bring their own unique creativity to this,” Lurie said, “and we're more likely to capture that creativity by leaving them to their own devices instead of being overly prescriptive.” This marks the agency's second innovation challenge; the first one resulted in the development of an app that allowed the agency to quickly identify salmonella bacteria on fresh produce. See also: Healthcare Opens Up to Innovation and Says 'Ah' For drugmakers, the business case for these competitions is clear. The industry's interest in creating beyond-the-pill services — such as Boehringer Ingelheim's gamified support program for COPD and Biogen's partnership with Fitbit — are one way for manufacturers to differentiate their products to payers, providers, and patients. But pharmaceutical companies' expertise lies in drug development and traditional marketing methods like DTC advertising — and not in creating innovative mobile apps.   Astellas Pharma, a Japanese drugmaker, brought together five finalists for its Changing Cancer Care (C3) innovation challenge in mid-September. Three winners will receive grants to help fund their projects; one will receive a $50,000 grant and the other two will receive $25,000. The challenge launched on April 25 and is meant to help develop non-medicine innovations in cancer care. In a statement, Mark Reisenauer, SVP, oncology for Astellas, described the importance of creating new patient services, saying that “more remains to be done for people with cancer and their loved ones outside of clinical treatment.” Astellas' submission criteria for C3 focuses on developing services that go beyond treatment — to help patients navigate the healthcare system, adhere to complex medical requirements, coordinate care, and life after treatment. The winner is expected to be announced in early October at the ESMO Congress in Copenhagen, Denmark. Pfizer used an internal innovation challenge to help create a new mobile tool for patients seeking to stop smoking. The company created a shark-tank style competition for its brand teams, which generated roughly 100 ideas. The winning idea was an unbranded mobile smoking-cessation app developed with the American Lung Association. Pfizer manufactures the prescription smoking cessation aid Chantix. See also: Hello, 2005? Would You Like your Innovation Team Back? A McKinsey & Company report from 2015 posited that digital innovation challenges are attractive to large companies because they produce ideas that companies can act on quickly. “In cases we've seen, post-hackathon prototypes are often tested, built out, and scaled in an accelerated eight- to 12-week cycle,” the report's authors wrote, “and, since the principals — top management and brand leaders — are all part of the initial event, they don't need to be sold on the approach or the strategy.” Life-sciences consultancies are also seeing the value in connecting startups with drugmakers through innovation events and challenges. Accenture, which estimates that start-up funding for wearables and virtual health will reach $6.5 billion by next year, launched its HealthTech Innovation Challenge on September 15 as a way to bring start-ups together to develop creative solutions for how people can better access and manage their own healthcare. The events, scheduled to take place in London on November 25 and New York on December 1, will include two pitching sessions with senior executives from Novartis, UCB, and other life-science companies. “Creating an innovation challenge helps startups infuse fresh ideas across the system to improve patient care. Innovation challenges are important because it advances innovative collaborations between startups and a broad spectrum of stakeholders,” Anne O'Riordan, senior managing director of Accenture Life Sciences, said in a statement.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) BEIJING, China - Global stock markets were higher Tuesday as traders followed the U.S. presidential debate between candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. KEEPING SCORE: In early trading, France's CAC-40 rose 1.5 per cent to 4,410.55 points and Germany's DAX gained 0.2 per cent to 10,412.22. London's FTSE 100 advanced 0.2 per cent to 6,830.99. On Monday, the DAX fell 2.2 per cent and the CAC-40 lost 1.8 per cent. The FTSE 100 was down 1.3 per cent. Wall Street looked set for gains, with the future for the Standard & Poor's 500 up 0.4 per cent and that for the Dow Jones industrial average up 0.1 per cent. On Monday, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite all dropped 0.9 per cent. ASIA'S DAY: Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.1 per cent to 23,564.59 points and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 0.8 per cent to 16,683.93. The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.6 per cent to 2,998.17 and Seoul's Kospi advanced 0.9 per cent to 2,017.94. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 rose 0.4 per cent to 5,497.40 and India's Sensex added 0.1 per cent to 28,319.04. Benchmarks in New Zealand and Thailand rose. Other Southeast Asian markets declined. DEBATE WATCH: Investors watched the Clinton-Trump debate in a tight race that has unnerved markets seeking certainty about the future of U.S. policy. Trump has called for controls on trade and immigration, while Clinton is seen as more engaged with Asia. Uncertainty about the election outcome has made global markets risk-averse. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Markets are searching for the least worse option between the two U.S. candidates. One is a known market bad, the other an unknown bad," said Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets in a report. "Any ramping up of populist rhetoric would likely rattle investors. Any perception that the outsider candidate won the debate could bring a market rout." EUROPEAN BANKS: European banks tumbled after the German magazine Focus said Deutsche Bank won't get a government bailout if it asks for one. U.S.-traded shares of Deutsche Bank fell 7.1 per cent. Focus said the German government also won't help the Deutsche Bank by intervening with U.S. officials who want it to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities. WALL STREET: Stocks fell for a second straight day. Banks were hurt by a drop in bond yields, which means lower interest rates and smaller profits on loans. Consumer companies fell as home improvement retailers were affected by a slowdown in sales of new homes. Stocks are coming off two weeks of solid gains. The Nasdaq set all-time highs twice last week. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 27 cents to $45.66 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract jumped $1.45 on Monday to close at $45.93. Brent crude, used to price international oils, declined 42 cents to $47.51 in London. It gained $1.45 the previous session to $47.93.

BUSINESS Stocks slide broadly; Deutsche Bank worries hit other banks New York Stock Exchange Richard Drew / Associated Press The New York Stock Exchange building. The New York Stock Exchange building. (Richard Drew / Associated Press) Associated Press U.S. stocks slumped Monday, and banks took the biggest losses. Deutsche Bank plunged as investors worried about the financial health of Germany's largest bank. Pfizer pulled drugmakers down after it announced it won't break up into two companies. Stocks fell for the second day in a row. Banks were hurt by a drop in bond yields, which means lower interest rates and smaller profits on loans. Consumer companies fell as home improvement retailers were affected by a slowdown in sales of new homes. European banks tumbled after the German magazine Focus said Deutsche Bank won't get a government bailout if it asks for one. Its report, published Friday, cited “government circles” as its source. “There's some stress in the banking industry there, and questions about whether governments have the will to step in,” said Steve Chiavarone, associated portfolio manager for Federated Investors. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 166.62 points, or 0.9%, to 18,094.83. The Standard & Poor's 500 index tumbled 18.59 points, or 0.9%, to 2,146.10. The Nasdaq composite dropped 48.26 points, or 0.9%, to 5,257.49. Stocks are coming off two weeks of solid gains, and the Nasdaq set all-time highs twice last week. Focus' article also said the German government won't help Deutsche Bank by intervening with U.S. officials who want the bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities. The bank's U.S.-listed shares tumbled 7.1% to $11.85. The stock is down 51% this year. Other banks also dropped. Goldman Sachs took the largest loss among Dow stocks and sank 2.2% to $161.48. Citigroup sank 2.7% to $45.89. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 1.58% from 1.62%. That also affects banks, as lower bond yields mean lower interest rates and smaller profits on lending. Stocks overseas also weakened. The DAX in Germany dropped 2.2% and France's CAC 40 sank 1.8%. In Britain, the FTSE 100 slid 1.3%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 1.3%. South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 1.7%. Home Depot and Lowe's sank after the government said sales of new homes went down sharply in August. Home Depot fell 1.8% to $125.45 and Lowe's fell 2.1% to $70.81. Pfizer, one of the world's largest drug companies, slid 1.8% to $33.64 after it said it will not split into two smaller companies. Some of its investors had supported that plan in the hope it would bolster the value of their stock and accelerate growth, but lately the Viagra maker has been signaling that it probably wouldn't break up. Oil prices bounced higher as investors monitored a meeting of oil producers in Algeria. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.45, or 3.3%, to $45.93 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose $1.46, or 3.2%, to $47.35 a barrel. Oil exploration companies rose the most. Transocean climbed 4.6% to $9.52 and Noble Energy advanced 1.8% to $33.62. Specialty chemicals maker Chemtura climbed 15.8% to $32.64 after it agreed to be bought by Germany's Lanxess. Lanxess is paying $33.50 a share for Chemtura, a 19% premium, and the companies valued the deal at $2.5 billion. Several companies started the week with deal news. CBOE Holdings, the parent company of the Chicago Board of Exchange, will buy stock exchange operator Bats Global Markets. The companies valued the deal at $3.2 billion, or $32.50 in cash and stock per share of Bats. Bats stock jumped 20% Friday as investors hoped that a deal was imminent, and it fell 4.6% to $30.35. CBOE stock sank 5.3% to $66.59. Casual clothing retailer Lands' End skidded 14.1% to $15.46 after the departure of its chief executive. Federica Marchionni left Dolce & Gabbana to join Lands' End less than two years ago but was unable to stop a decline in sales. The dollar slid to 100.34 yen from 101.09 yen. The euro rose to $1.1255 from $1.1231. Gold rose $2.40 to $1,344.10 an ounce. Silver fell 21 cents to $19.60 an ounce. Copper stayed at $2.20 a pound. Wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.40 a gallon. Heating oil rose 4 cents, or 3%, to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas added 4 cents to $3 per 1,000 cubic feet.  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Northern Californians who voted for Trump feel forgotten by the state, Megyn Kelly's new book took a new turn due to the elections, Twitter is trying to clean up, and the Crystal Cathederal is getting a new look.

KEEPING SCORE: In early trading, France’s CAC-40 rose 1.5 per cent to 4,410.55 points and Germany’s DAX gained 0.2 per cent to 10,412.22. London’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.2 per cent to 6,830.99. On Monday, the DAX fell 2.2 per cent and the CAC-40 lost 1.8 per cent. The FTSE 100 was down 1.3 per cent. Wall Street looked set for gains, with the future for the Standard & Poor’s 500 up 0.4 per cent and that for the Dow Jones industrial average up 0.1 per cent. On Monday, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite all dropped 0.9 per cent. ASIA’S DAY: Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 1.1 per cent to 23,564.59 points and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.8 per cent to 16,683.93. The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.6 per cent to 2,998.17 and Seoul’s Kospi advanced 0.9 per cent to 2,017.94. Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 rose 0.4 per cent to 5,497.40 and India’s Sensex added 0.1 per cent to 28,319.04. Benchmarks in New Zealand and Thailand rose. Other Southeast Asian markets declined. DEBATE WATCH: Investors watched the Clinton-Trump debate in a tight race that has unnerved markets seeking certainty about the future of U.S. policy. Trump has called for controls on trade and immigration, while Clinton is seen as more engaged with Asia. Uncertainty about the election outcome has made global markets risk-averse. ANALYST’S TAKE: “Markets are searching for the least worse option between the two U.S. candidates. One is a known market bad, the other an unknown bad,” said Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets in a report. “Any ramping up of populist rhetoric would likely rattle investors. Any perception that the outsider candidate won the debate could bring a market rout.” EUROPEAN BANKS: European banks tumbled after the German magazine Focus said Deutsche Bank won’t get a government bailout if it asks for one. U.S.-traded shares of Deutsche Bank fell 7.1 per cent. Focus said the German government also won’t help the Deutsche Bank by intervening with U.S. officials who want it to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities. WALL STREET: Stocks fell for a second straight day. Banks were hurt by a drop in bond yields, which means lower interest rates and smaller profits on loans.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Cipla x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Abbott x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ MUMBAI: Cipla, ranked third in the $17-billion Indian pharmaceutical market after Sun Pharma and Abbott, is setting its eyes on reaching a billion dollar sales mark, backed by new drug launches from its own research labs and a slew of partnerships with multinational and Indian drug firms. On a moving annual total basis, Cipla’s India sales rose 8.6% to Rs 5,033 crore in August, according to the AIOCD PharmaTrac data. Its market share stood at 4.9% compared to Sun Pharma’s 8.7% and Abbott’s 6.23% during the same period. Umang Vohra, the newly-designated managing director of Cipla, told ET Now that he hoped the India sales to cross a billion dollar “relatively soon.” Cipla has stepped up launch plans in areas like respiratory, dermatology, cardiovascular and urology, which will help speed up its India growth. Also, several Indian and multinational drug makers have evinced interest in partnering with Cipla, said Vohra, who took over from Subhanu Saxena this month. He said both Indian and multinational drug makers are approaching Cipla to partner for the India launch of several products. “And so, India will continue to launch 3% to 4% of our sales year-on-year and our volume growth will continue to be upward of 8% to 10%. We are looking at our India growth at 13% to 15% range over a longer time period,” he said. In 2014, Cipla partnered with Merck to sell its HIV drug brand, Isentress, under a different brand name. The same year, Cipla signed a licensing agreement with Gilead, alongside a bunch of other Indian companies, to market Hepatitis C drug sofosbuvir. An analyst said the plan to reach a billion dollar in India sales in the foreseeable future seems ambitious and may be “uphill”, unless the company signs deals of substantial size, either for brands or companies or enter into strategic joint ventures with other drug makers. Last year, Cipla changed its reporting structure for sales in the Indian market. It started booking revenues on actual sales against the earlier process, which booked sales at the stage of despatching the product.

The global cancer immunotherapy market is expected to reach USD 119.39 billion by 2021 from USD 61.97 billion in 2016, at a CAGR of 14.0% from 2016 to 2021. Factors such as increasing incidence of cancer, rising healthcare expenditure, and increased access to medical insurance in developed countries are driving growth in the caner immunotherapy market. However, stringent regulatory policies and side effects associated with cancer therapy are the major factors restraining the growth of this market. The global cancer immunotherapy market has been segmented on the basis of type, application, end user, and region. The monoclonal antibodies segment is expected to register the highest growth rate in the cancer immunotherapy market, by type, during the forecast period. Factors such as high success rate and less recovery time are contributing to the high growth in this segment. Geographically, the cancer immunotherapy market is dominated by North America, followed by Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Rest of the World (RoW). The large share of North America can be attributed to the growing aging population and the increased funding from government and non-government agencies in order to increase the research capacity.

Michael Hiltzik Columnist BUSINESS Michael Hiltzik Column This drug company placed a nearly $10,000 price tag on drugs that may not even work novum Novum Pharma Novum's Alcortin A may not work, but it will still cost nearly $10,000 per tube. Novum's Alcortin A may not work, but it will still cost nearly $10,000 per tube. (Novum Pharma) Michael HiltzikContact Reporter Profiteering in the drug business has been generating outrage for months now. Gilead Sciences and Mylan have been taking the heat for huge increases in the prices, respectively, for their hepatitis-C cures and injectors to fend off life-threatening allergic reactions. But at least we can say this about them: Their products work. That may not necessarily be true about some of the drugs for which Chicago-based Novum Pharma has raised prices as much as 40-fold. Two of the three topical gels for dermatological conditions distributed by Novum are listed by the Food and Drug Administration as only “possibly effective.” That’s one of the lower classifications in the FDA’s roster, coming below “effective” and “probably effective.” “Final classification of the less-than-effective indications,” the company says in the prescribing circular for the drugs, “requires further investigation.”  It troubles me greatly that the EpiPen product has become a source of controversy. — Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, testifying before Congress Those drugs are Alcortin A, the wholesale price of which Novum jacked up from $226 to $9,561 per 48-gram tube, and Aloquin, which went from $241.50 to the same price of $9,561 for 60 grams. Both can be prescribed for dermatitis, eczema and other such conditions. Novacort, a corticosteroid ointment for skin inflammations which doesn’t carry any FDA doubts, went from $4,186 to $7,142 for a 29-gram tube. And it costs almost $10,000 per tube: warnings in the prescription circular that Novum's Aloquin gel might not even work. Novum Pharma And it costs almost $10,000 per tube: warnings in the prescription circular that Novum's Aloquin gel might not even work. And it costs almost $10,000 per tube: warnings in the prescription circular that Novum's Aloquin gel might not even work. (Novum Pharma) Novum told us that those prices, which were ferreted out by the Financial Times and in a follow-up article by Ed Silverman of Stat News, aren’t accurate but wouldn’t provide its own figures. In any event, according to company spokesman Rand Walton, the prices “are not even close to the actual price Novum ultimately realizes.” Walton’s point was that the drug prices are inflated by “thousands of dollars in extra charges that are added by various third-party middlemen and passed onto patients.” Where have we heard this before? We heard it from Heather Bresch, the CEO of Mylan, who appeared before a House committee looking into her price increases for the EpiPen, the epinephrine injector for which Mylan has been charging a wholesale price of more than $600 for a two-pen pack. That figure included “rebates and various fees,” she asserted in her written remarks, reducing Mylan’s actual take by more than half. (See her testimony below.) This is all misdirection. It’s aimed at making it appear that the drug companies have no choice but to jack up their prices by enormous amounts, merely to eke out a modest profit. When pressed, they talk about “the complex environment in which pharmaceutical prices are determined” (Bresch) or the “broken and unsustainable … pharmaceutical pricing process in the United States” (Novum’s Walton). The truth is that the drug companies set the price, period, and they set it according to what they think the market will bear.  To talk about manufacturing or research and development costs, as Bresch did, is merely a dodge. Bresch bragged to Congress that Mylan is spending “$1.2 billion on R&D and manufacturing facilities, or roughly $3 million per day”; she didn’t complete the equation by acknowledging that the company collects revenue of about $26 million a day.  The products for which Mylan and Novum charged their stratospheric prices are based on generic drugs that have been available for years, even decades. Their research and development amounted largely to acquiring rights to existing drugs from others. Novum was founded and acquired the rights to its three drugs in 2015. Mylan bought the rights to the EpiPen from Merck in 2007. The R&D leading to Gilead’s hepatitis wonder drug Sovaldi was performed by Pharmasset, an independent company that Gilead bought for $11 billion, cash, in 2012, to get its mitts on the product. Mylan will help more patients pay for its EpiPen. Here's why that's bad news for healthcare Michael Hiltzik Mylan, the profiteering, tax-dodging drug company currently taking immense heat for jacking up the price of its Epipen by 500%, announced Thursday that it will help more patients cover their soaring out-of-pocket costs for the allergy drug device. That’s good for some individual patients and families.... Mylan, the profiteering, tax-dodging drug company currently taking immense heat for jacking up the price of its Epipen by 500%, announced Thursday that it will help more patients cover their soaring out-of-pocket costs for the allergy drug device. That’s good for some individual patients and families.... (Michael Hiltzik) The drug companies all point out that their patient assistance programs reduce the out-of-pocket costs to patients substantially, sometimes even to zero. “All patients with commercial insurance only pay $0 for Novum products, even when their insurance doesn’t cover them,” Walton told us by email. “Furthermore, cash-paying patients never have to pay more than $35.” Similarly, Mylan is bringing out a “generic” version of its EpiPen at half the retail price, and is expanding its  low-cost or free pen program to cover more patients. As we’ve pointed out before, such programs are aimed at shrouding from view the broader consequences of the drug makers’ business models. Someone pays the wholesale price, or something near it; that someone is you, via your insurance premiums and taxes used to support Medicare and Medicaid. The drug companies hope that by taking the burden of high prices off the little guy by covering his or her co-pays, they can continue to charge full price to the deep-pocketed payers.  But that doesn’t entirely work. It still imposes huge costs on the healthcare system overall. Some insurers and government programs respond to the burden by limiting coverage of these overpriced drugs to only certain patients. That makes a mockery of Bresch’s assertion in her congressional testimony that Mylan’s great goal was to “expand access” for patients to the EpiPen, which apparently it thought it could do by inflating its price by 500%. The more that cases like these proliferate, the more it becomes clear that market forces have failed to spread the benefits of pharmaceuticals fairly in the United States, one of the few developed countries with hands-off policies on drug prices. The solutions are becoming clearer every day: provide U.S. patients with access to lower prices in Canada or elsewhere, ease the introduction of generic rivals to high-priced drugs, require that drug prices be related in some way to manufacturing or research costs and require documentation of the same. Or all three.

In the future, if the company gets its way, the software will interpret that information, turning it into advice for users, doctors and others. Scores of health-care experts hired by Apple in recent years are building improved electronic health record software that can better analyze and understand the implications of patient data, according to people familiar with the team’s plans. The iPhone maker is also working on new apps for the Apple Watch. One helps users track sleep patterns, one of the people said. Another app gauges fitness levels by measuring the time taken for the heart rate to fall from its peak to resting level, according to one of the other people. Apple already has an app that measures heart rate, but doesn’t interpret that data. The ultimate goal of Apple’s medical technology team is to turn HealthKit into a tool that improves diagnoses, the people said. The system could chip away at two problems that plague the industry and have stumped other specialist firms in the field: interoperability -- allowing data to be transferred from hospital to hospital across different databases; and analysis -- making it quick and easy for physicians to extrapolate salient information from mountains of data. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook wants Apple to do more in software and services to secure new sources of revenue and make customers more dependent on the company’s devices. The $8 trillion global health-care industry is a big opportunity. “If you drive for a while and your car gets too hot, it says pull over. If you need an oil change, it says check your oil. What’s the equivalent for the body?" Cook said at a May conference in Amsterdam. “Health is a huge issue around the world and we think it’s ripe for simplicity and a new view.” An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. GLIIMPSE OF THE FUTURE Earlier this year, Apple bought Gliimpse Inc., a startup that built software to pull electronic health records from different databases and in different formats, then store them in one place. “I will be working on building a platform, a set of application program interfaces, and a simple product that will bring what we believe will be a disruptive consumer health-care application to the U.S. for the first time,” Apple Health senior engineer Mohan Randhava wrote on his LinkedIn profile, which states he was employed at Gliimpse until February.  He likened the product to Apple’s music business. That started with the iPod, but as people became accustomed to storing all their music files digitally, Apple built a lucrative music platform on top of the device. Apple health software could become a revenue driver, too, by keeping people wedded to the company’s devices. If a patient’s health records, and related suggestions, are accessible through Apple’s system, it would be harder to trade in an iPhone for a smartphone running Google’s Android operating system, and its health-tracking software Google Fit. The second version of Apple’s Watch has a faster processor, a built-in GPS tracker and is water resistant so people can run, swim and do other exercise with the device. The updated Watch software, dubbed watchOS 3, places health tracking information more prominently in the user interface, and adds a breathing exercise app as well as swim tracking. Building more sensors into the Watch serves a limited purpose. An accelerometer can generate most of the useful data needed to monitor a person’s well-being, according to one person with knowledge of Apple’s plans. A glucometer or blood-pressure sensor would only help a small percentage of users, the person said. Adding new medical sensors would also likely require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a much higher bar for Apple to cross. “If they are going to an FDA device, it would need to have enough battery life to last a day, and something where it independently functions from your phone,” said Yuri Teshler, a health-care consultant at Moor Insights & Strategy. Apple can’t really do anything more with health-related sensors until the watch has a wireless LTE chip and the independent cellular connection that comes with that, he added. Apple has so far struggled to do that. EMBEDDING It’s unclear how soon improvements to Apple’s HealthKit may be introduced. ResearchKit, another Apple software, lets research institutions and drugmakers conduct clinical trials using iPhone apps, and some of the trials hint at possible future applications for HealthKit. Each clinical study using ResearchKit brings Apple a step closer to embedding itself in hospitals, labs and doctors’ surgeries. North Carolina’s Duke University developed a ResearchKit app using the iPhone’s front-facing camera to conduct facial recognition checks which try to screen for and diagnose autism. Johns Hopkins University is using the Apple Watch’s accelerometer and heart-rate sensor to track the onset and duration of seizures and try to predict them. In July, GlaxoSmithKline Plc became the first drug maker to start a ResearchKit clinical study. “Apple is working hard with many of these large institutions to generate tools that are medically correct, to take data from sensors,” said Scott Jenkins, CEO of health data management company Certainty Health LLC. “They want to be the repository, the open collection space.” Stephen Friend, a Merck & Co. veteran who founded health data non-profit Sage Bionetworks, is credited with being the brains behind ResearchKit. He joined Apple full-time in June having worked as a consultant for more than two years. Flipboard co-founder Evan Doll rejoined Apple in July as a director of health software engineering. Yoky Matsuoka, formerly technology chief at Google’s Nest Labs unit, also joined Apple’s health team last year. Nest is known mostly as a hardware specialist, but Matsuoka led the development of software that interpreted and learned from data that its internet-connected thermostats collect. She’s using that machine-learning experience as she oversees a health-data team at Apple. Apple’s greatest hurdle for now is proving to medical professionals that data delivered from wearables through HealthKit and ResearchKit is reliable.  Brennan Spiegel, a gastroenterologist at Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sinai Hospital, said clinical studies are crucial to making wearables useful. “It’s wonderful to have advanced methods of aggregating and presenting data, but there’s a risk of it becoming a garbage-in, garbage-out project,” Spiegel said. “It doesn’t matter how sophisticated the technical solution is. What matters is whether the data going into that solution are generating clinically valuable, actionable results that’s improving human health in a way that’s cost-effective.

Adding new medical sensors would also likely require approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, a much higher bar for Apple to cross. “If they are going to an FDA device, it would need to have enough battery life to last a day, and something where it independently functions from your phone,” said Yuri Teshler, a health-care consultant at Moor Insights & Strategy. Apple can’t really do anything more with health-related sensors until the watch has a wireless LTE chip and the independent cellular connection that comes with that, he added. Apple has so far struggled to do that. Embedding It’s unclear how soon improvements to Apple’s HealthKit may be introduced. ResearchKit, another Apple software, lets research institutions and drugmakers conduct clinical trials using iPhone apps, and some of the trials hint at possible future applications for HealthKit. Each clinical study using ResearchKit brings Apple a step closer to embedding itself in hospitals, labs and doctors’ surgeries. North Carolina’s Duke University developed a ResearchKit app using the iPhone’s front-facing camera to conduct facial recognition checks which try to screen for and diagnose autism. Johns Hopkins University is using the Apple Watch’s accelerometer and heart-rate sensor to track the onset and duration of seizures and try to predict them. In July, GlaxoSmithKline Plc became the first drug maker to start a ResearchKit clinical study. “Apple is working hard with many of these large institutions to generate tools that are medically correct, to take data from sensors,” said Scott Jenkins, CEO of health data management company Certainty Health LLC. “They want to be the repository, the open collection space.” Stephen Friend, a Merck & Co veteran who founded health data non-profit Sage Bionetworks, is credited with being the brains behind ResearchKit. He joined Apple full-time in June having worked as a consultant for more than two years. Flipboard co-founder Evan Doll rejoined Apple in July as a director of health software engineering. Yoky Matsuoka, formerly technology chief at Google’s Nest Labs unit, also joined Apple’s health team last year. Nest is known mostly as a hardware specialist, but Matsuoka led the development of software that interpreted and learned from data that its internet-connected thermostats collect. She’s using that machine-learning experience as she oversees a health-data team at Apple. Apple’s greatest hurdle for now is proving to medical professionals that data delivered from wearables through HealthKit and ResearchKit is reliable. Brennan Spiegel, a gastroenterologist at Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sinai Hospital, said clinical studies are crucial to making wearables useful. “It’s wonderful to have advanced methods of aggregating and presenting data, but there’s a risk of it becoming a garbage-in, garbage-out project,” Spiegel said. “It doesn’t matter how sophisticated the technical solution is. What matters is whether the data going into that solution are generating clinically valuable, actionable results that’s improving human health in a way that’s cost-effective.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Pushing the limits of science at the first Cyborg Olympics (VIDEO) Facebook fake news writer on how he possibly influenced the US election Soar above the planet’s most spectacular sights with Google Earth VR (VIDEO) Udacity, an online learning startup, offers tech job trials Cyber hack of UK’s Three put six million customers at risk, Telegraph reports Sony’s PS3 celebrates 10-year anniversary WhatsApp joins rivals from Snapchat to WeChat in video calls Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Tinder launches transgender-inclusive update, allowing users to select personalised gender identity (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Most Watched Now Week Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ ‘Fantastic Beasts’ of the TSA with James Corden, Eddie Redmayne Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Toms launches Apple Watch wrist bands How accurate are fitness trackers when it comes to heart rate readings?

AMGN today announced the approval of Amjevita (adalimumab-atto), a biosimilar version to AbbVie Inc.’s ABBV rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug Humira. Amjevita has been approved for the same indications that Humira is being used for – including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), adult Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), plaque psoriasis (PsO) – all in specific patient populations. The U.S. sales of Humira were about $8.4 billion in 2015. We remind investors that in July, the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee voted in favor of an approval of Amjevita. The approval of Amjevita is based on positive data from two phase III studies comparing the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of Amjevita with Humira in patients with moderate-to-severe RA and moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The studies met their primary endpoints. Amjevita is the first biosimilar version of Humira to be approved by the FDA as well as Amgen’s first biosimilar medicine to be approved. AMGEN INC Price   AMGEN INC Price | AMGEN INC Quote Amgen is exploring the world of biosimilars and expects to launch five such new products between 2017 and 2019. The biosimilars opportunity represents annual revenues of more than $3 billion for Amgen. The company also has a partnership with Allergan, Inc. AGN for the worldwide development and commercialization of oncology antibody biosimilar medicines. Other than Amjevita, other candidates being developed include biosimilar versions of Roche’s Avastin (ABP 215), Herceptin (ABP 980; breast cancer) and Rituxan (ABP 798), Eli Lilly and Company’s LLY Erbitux (ABP 494), and Johnson & Johnson/Merck’s Remicade (ABP 710). Amgen has also tied up with Daiichi Sankyo for the commercialization of nine biosimilars in Japan, including biosimilars of Humira, Avastin and Herceptin. The approval of Amjevita would be a huge boost for Amgen which itself is facing biosimilar threats for quite a few of its key drugs. Anemia drug Aranesp faces competition in Europe from biosimilars marketed by companies like Pfizer and Novartis. Biosimilars are also starting to have a negative impact on sales of its key products like Neupogen and Neulasta in the EU. In August this year, Novartis’ generic arm, Sandoz received FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Amgen’s blockbuster RA drug Enbrel. Both Amgen and AbbVie are Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks.

In the future, if the company gets its way, the software will interpret that information, turning it into advice for users, doctors and others. Scores of health-care experts hired by Apple in recent years are building improved electronic health record software that can better analyze and understand the implications of patient data, according to people familiar with the team’s plans. The iPhone maker is also working on new apps for the Apple Watch. One helps users track sleep patterns, one of the people said. Another app gauges fitness levels by measuring the time taken for the heart rate to fall from its peak to resting level, according to one of the other people. Apple already has an app that measures heart rate, but doesn’t interpret that data. The ultimate goal of Apple’s medical technology team is to turn HealthKit into a tool that improves diagnoses, the people said. The system could chip away at two problems that plague the industry and have stumped other specialist firms in the field: interoperability -- allowing data to be transferred from hospital to hospital across different databases; and analysis -- making it quick and easy for physicians to extrapolate salient information from mountains of data. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook wants Apple to do more in software and services to secure new sources of revenue and make customers more dependent on the company’s devices. The $8 trillion global health-care industry is a big opportunity. “If you drive for a while and your car gets too hot, it says pull over. If you need an oil change, it says check your oil. What’s the equivalent for the body?" Cook said at a May conference in Amsterdam. “Health is a huge issue around the world and we think it’s ripe for simplicity and a new view.” An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Gliimpse of Future Earlier this year, Apple bought Gliimpse Inc., a startup that built software to pull electronic health records from different databases and in different formats, then store them in one place. “I will be working on building a platform, a set of application program interfaces, and a simple product that will bring what we believe will be a disruptive consumer health-care application to the U.S. for the first time,” Apple Health senior engineer Mohan Randhava wrote on his LinkedIn profile, which states he was employed at Gliimpse until February.  He likened the product to Apple’s music business. That started with the iPod, but as people became accustomed to storing all their music files digitally, Apple built a lucrative music platform on top of the device. Apple health software could become a revenue driver, too, by keeping people wedded to the company’s devices. If a patient’s health records, and related suggestions, are accessible through Apple’s system, it would be harder to trade in an iPhone for a smartphone running Google’s Android operating system, and its health-tracking software Google Fit. The second version of Apple’s Watch has a faster processor, a built-in GPS tracker and is water resistant so people can run, swim and do other exercise with the device. The updated Watch software, dubbed watchOS 3, places health tracking information more prominently in the user interface, and adds a breathing exercise app as well as swim tracking. Building more sensors into the Watch serves a limited purpose. An accelerometer can generate most of the useful data needed to monitor a person’s well-being, according to one person with knowledge of Apple’s plans. A glucometer or blood-pressure sensor would only help a small percentage of users, the person said. Adding new medical sensors would also likely require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a much higher bar for Apple to cross. “If they are going to an FDA device, it would need to have enough battery life to last a day, and something where it independently functions from your phone,” said Yuri Teshler, a health-care consultant at Moor Insights & Strategy.

D. Wells Tags: SB277, Dr Sears, vaccine exemptions (NaturalNews) In California, any medical doctors who oppose the state's mandatory forced vaccinations face prosecution and the possible loss of their licenses to practice medicine, even though the law, known as SB277, states that they are allowed to grant medical exemptions. Science on the safety of vaccines is not settled; in fact, in case after case, vaccines have been reported as spreading infectious diseases, causing neurological disorders like autism, and crippling the immune systems of the "immunized" infants and children. Still, big government and the "nanny" state of California are enforcing the unethical and dangerous practice of injecting mercury, aluminum, MSG and formaldehyde into children's muscle tissue, based on the false claim that all vaccines are proven 100 percent safe and 100 percent effective. In fact, they know full well that this is a huge lie that generates more "patients for life" for the doctors who form part of the tyrannical Western chemical medicine complex. Chemical medicine complex enforcing mass vaccination in California, prosecuting doctors who don't complyIs your baby allergic to mercury and formaldehyde? The California Medical Board doesn't care. Could your new baby develop autism, Asperger's or an autoimmune disorder from vaccines? The California medical "police" don't give a damn. Does your pediatrician recommend that your child stagger the vaccine schedule, spread it out more, or leave a few dangerous, untested and unsafe vaccines out of the mix? California medical tyrants could care less. You and your doctor will be prosecuted for non-compliance, your children will not be attending school, and your doctor may lose his/her license. Now shut up and inject every toxin the CDC declares is safe, even though the senior scientist at the CDC has already confessed that the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella) causes autism. A California medical doctor, Bob Sears, is being "disciplined" by the state Medical Board of California for writing a medical exemption, which is perfectly legal according to SB277, for a 2-year old child who experienced severe allergic reactions to previous toxic injections. Dr. Sears is not anti-vaccine, mind you – he simply assessed the situation and recommended that the parents leave out a couple of vaccines and spread some others out to spare the child further neurological damage, as well as the digestive and intestinal complications that the parents observed shortly after the child received the previous series of shots. Why did the California Medical Board single out Dr. Sears for prosecution, for what they are calling "gross negligence?" Simple: It's a "witch hunt." Dr. Sears authored a book about vaccine dangers, and he favors informed consent that abides by the AMA's own ethics statutes. American citizens have the right to choose medical procedures, medicines and treatments, and according to law cannot be force-medicated by the state or government – but that's now how it's "going down" in California. Dr. Sears is a burning scarecrow, intended by the state to intimidate other medical doctors who are thinking about writing medical exemptions for their patients. After all, the state didn't write SB277 to allow doctors to let parents of young children "off the hook." Rather, SB277 – a blatant violation of the constitution – is part of a sinister plan to increase autism cases and create more income flow for the vaccine and pharmaceutical medical complex. Even though Dr. Sears may have saved a child's life, he is being "burned at the stake" because he simply wrote a medical exemption letter. Who put California's vaccine-extremist agenda in effect in the first place?The author of SB277, California Senator Dr. Richard Pan, received campaign donations – on record – from Merck during the 2010 election cycle. Pan delivered a highly aggressive agenda to support forced vaccinations as it coincides with financial and powerful lobby interests that directly pad his pockets. Pan is on record as saying that he wouldn't persecute doctors who wrote medical exemptions, but SB277 forbids children from attending public or private school if they aren't injected with flu shots, swine flu jabs, infectious boosters and more. Senator Pan benefits directly from a chemical medicine industry chock full of corruption. Health Impact News and natural health enthusiasts at Natural News are now calling on the California Medical Board to close the case against Dr. Sears and respect the AMA stated ethics of medicine and the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship.

Just about every year at this time, I offer ratings — buy, neutral or sell — on the largest U.S. stocks. These giants aren't my meat and potatoes. My real sweet spot is in small- and mid-cap stocks. But I rate the behemoths because I know a lot of readers are interested; these stocks are widely owned. Apple Inc. (AAPL, $607 billion) is the largest U.S. stock by a mile. The company is highly profitable and has a mountain of cash. But the iPhone, its flagship product, may be slowing a little. Avoid. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT, $448 billion) is still a great company, but growth and profitability aren't as impressive as in the glory days. I recommended it in 2010-2013, but now I think its price is too high. Avoid. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN, $382 billion) is a stock about which I've been consistently skeptical. I've been wrong, as sales and the stock price have soared. But all my experience tells me that paying 200 times earnings for a stock is insane. Avoid. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM, $346 billion) is king of the energy business, which has been a troubled realm since mid-2014. The troubles aren't over, but I think the tide is slowly turning. Buy. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ, $325 billion) is a broadly diversified health-care company with a business model I admire. It's not especially popular with Wall Street's analysts today, but its profit margin has been expanding. Buy. Facebook Inc. (FB, $297 billion), one of the four popular “FANG” stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google), boasts rapid earnings growth as ad sales improve. It's popular with analysts, but I dislike it at 61 times recent earnings. Avoid. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, $270 billion) is the proud parent of Google. I admire its innovations, its talent pool and its acquisitions. But valuations (31 times recent earnings, almost 7 times sales) keep me on the sidelines. Neutral. General Electric Co. (GE, $268 billion) has been reemphasizing its industrial roots. A year ago, I said I wanted to see how this strategy played out for the next 12 months. Results are mixed, so I want to wait longer. Neutral. AT&T Inc. (T, $254 billion) sports a 4.6 percent dividend yield. I like it for income-oriented investor. Buy. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) has shown only mediocre growth and profitability of late, but I have faith in the ability of CEO Jamie Diamond. Buy. Procter & Gamble Co. (PG, $234 billion) is a household word, but its 10-year revenue and earnings growth rates are near 1 percent. People are paying 24 times earnings for a stock that's solid but not growing much. Avoid. Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC, $231 billion) has the same problem all banks have. It's hard to earn a good spread on lending when interest rates are low. I think things will improve, but slowly. Neutral. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT, $224 billion) remains a leader in low-price retailing, but competitors have copied many of its innovations such as detailed computerized tracking of sales and inventory. Avoid. Verizon Communications (VZ, $214 billion) made a good move in my opinion by buying Internet portals AOL and Yahoo. However, I view it as inferior to AT&T in labor relations and balance-sheet strength. Avoid. Pfizer Inc. (PFE, $208 billion) is a stock I own for my more conservative clients, but I am getting nervous as the price has climbed to 30 times earnings. Neutral. Chevron Corp. (CVX, $187 billion) should gradually strengthen with the energy industry, like its big brother Exxon Mobil. I believe it is doing a better job in exploration than most. Buy. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B, $186 billion) looks like a bargain to me at 14 times earnings. It's run by investment genius Warren Buffett. No one can replace him, but he's clearly been working hard on succession planning.Buy. Coca-Cola Co. (KO, $184 billion) continues to show high profitability but little growth. People are starting to cut back on soda, and profit margins aren't as high on most other beverages. Avoid. Intel Corp. (INTC, $176 billion), the largest player in semiconductor chips for personal computers, has suffered as people move to smartphones and away from PCs. I think the stock will be a buy sometime, but not yet. Avoid. Merck & Co., like Pfizer, is a stock I've often owned for clients. But at present, with the stock at 35 times earnings, my enthusiasm is weak. Neutral. Past Results This is the 13th column I've written rating the biggest stocks. Overall, results for the first 12 columns have been respectable. My Buys returned an average of 12 percent in 12 months, my Neutrals 11.3 percent and my Avoids 9.3 percent. Last year, however, I had enough egg on my face to make a king-sized omelet. Led by Amazon.com, the stocks I said to avoid scored a 24.7 percent return, while my Buy-rated stocks managed only 4.8 percent.
