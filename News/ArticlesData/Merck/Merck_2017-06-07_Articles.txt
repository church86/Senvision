Saag, associate dean for global health, and director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. “The addition of a convenient once-daily version with a comparable efficacy and safety profile at 48 weeks to the existing twice-daily version of Isentress provides physicians with a new therapeutic option for some patients with HIV-1 infection.” Isentress and Isentress HD do not cure HIV-1 infection or AIDS. Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with Isentress or Isentress HD and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develop and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely. For more information, see “Selected Safety Information” below. The FDA approval of once-daily Isentress HD (raltegravir) is supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 ONCEMRK trial. At Week 48, 89 percent (N=531) of treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients receiving Isentress HD 1200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once a day achieved viral suppression of HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL compared to 88 percent (N=266) of patients receiving Isentress 400 mg twice a day, each in combination therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with a treatment difference of 0.5 percent, and a 95 percent confidence interval of -4.2, 5.2. This was consistent across demographic groups at initiation of therapy and a variety of patient populations, including those with high viral load (HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL). “Because of improvements in the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies and with appropriate access to care, HIV infection can now be managed as a chronic disease,” said Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute. “For people living with HIV, having a wide range of effective therapies is important because it provides options to fit patients’ individual needs and lifestyles.” In ONCEMRK, through 48 weeks, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was low (1 percent in patients receiving Isentress HD 1200 mg once daily and 2 percent in patients receiving Isentress 400 mg twice daily). There were no drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥2 percent of patients in either treatment group. Clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate, and severe) occurring in ≥2 percent of patients on Isentress HD or Isentress included abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Treatment-emergent viral mutations leading to any drug resistance were detected in less than 1 percent (4/531) of those treated with Isentress HD once daily. Isentress HD can be co-administered with a wide range of antiretroviral agents and non-antiretroviral agents. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. The co-administration of Isentress HD with aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids, calcium carbonate antacids, rifampin, tipranavir/ritonavir, etravirine, and other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is not recommended. “Isentress HD exemplifies Merck’s unwavering commitment to innovation in HIV therapy, and we are pleased to be able to offer this option to a broad range of appropriate adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg who are living with HIV,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, global clinical development, infectious diseases and vaccines, Merck Research Laboratories. The price of Isentress HD will be the same as Isentress twice daily. Merck anticipates ISENTRESS HD to be available in pharmacies in approximately four weeks. About ONCEMRK The ONCEMRK study is an ongoing Phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active comparator-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily Isentress HD 1200 mg, given as two 600 mg oral tablets, compared to twice-daily Isentress 400 mg, each in combination therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in previously untreated adults with HIV-1 infection with HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL. The primary efficacy objective was the proportion of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 48. About Isentress (raltegravir) Approved in 2007, Isentress was the first integrase inhibitor developed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Isentress is one of the regimen options recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services – in combination with other antiretroviral agents – as a first-line therapy in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults. Isentress chewable tablets and oral suspension, each in combination therapy, are approved to treat pediatric patients aged at least four weeks of age, and weighing less than 20 kg. Isentress works by inhibiting the insertion of HIV-1 DNA into human DNA by the integrase enzyme and has demonstrated rapid antiviral activity. Inhibiting integrase from performing this essential function limits the ability of the virus to replicate and infect new cells. Isentress is approved as part of combination therapy in 112 countries for treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients. Isentress, in combination therapy, for use in children and adolescents with HIV-1 aged two years and older has also been approved for use in 69 countries, and Isentress oral suspension for infants at least four weeks of age is approved for use in 33 countries.

The highest dose evaluated, 50 mg, reduced Awake Cough Frequency (coughs/hour), the primary endpoint, by 37 percent from baseline relative to placebo (p=0.003). The 50 mg dose also demonstrated a reduction in patient-reported cough severity. Lower doses (7.5 mg and 20 mg) were not statistically significant. The results were presented today at the American Thoracic Society 113th Annual Conference 2017 in Washington, D.C. MK-7264 is an orally-administered, non-narcotic, P2X3 receptor antagonist. Merck plans to discuss these results and the Phase 3 clinical development plan for MK-7264 with regulatory agencies later this year. “There is a significant unmet need for effective treatments for chronic cough,” said Dr. Jacky Smith, professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Manchester and University Hospital Manchester NHS Foundation Trust. “We are encouraged by the results of the MK-7264 study and look forward to further evaluations of this investigational therapy.” The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study evaluated MK-7264 in patients (n=253) with refractory chronic cough (chronic cough for ≥ 1 year; patients were included in the study per ATS/BTS guidelines). Patients were randomized to receive placebo (n=63), 7.5 mg (n=63), 20 mg (n=63), and 50 mg (n=63) doses of MK-7264 twice daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in Awake Cough Frequency after 12 weeks of treatment vs. baseline. Cough frequency was measured using sound recordings obtained by a digital recording device. Patients who received a 7.5 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg dose of MK-7264 experienced a reduction in Awake Cough Frequency from baseline compared to placebo of 22 percent, 22 percent and 37 percent respectively; the difference for the 50 mg dose compared to placebo was statistically significant (p<0.05). The secondary endpoint of patient-reported Cough Severity (0-100mm on the Visual Analog Scale) compared to baseline showed a reduction of 15.2mm for placebo, 19.2mm for 7.5 mg, 23.4mm for 20 mg and 31.1mm for 50 mg doses. Dysgeusia, an alteration in taste, was the most common adverse event reported in 4.8 percent, 9.5 percent, 33.3 percent and 47.6 percent of patients receiving placebo, 7.5 mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg of MK-7264, respectively. Hypogeusia, reduced ability to taste, was reported in 1.6 percent, 0 percent, 17.5 percent and 23.8 percent of patients on placebo, 7.5 mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg of MK-7264, respectively. One patient in the placebo group and six patients in the 50 mg treatment group discontinued due to taste-related adverse events. No patients in the 7.5 mg and 20 mg groups discontinued due to taste-related adverse events. “These results, from the largest study to date in chronic cough, provide evidence to continue evaluating MK-7264,” said Dr. Andrew M. Tershakovec, executive director, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to further discussions with regulatory agencies this year to discuss next steps.” About MK-7264 MK-7264 (formerly AF-219) is an investigational orally administered non-narcotic therapeutic candidate that selectively blocks the P2X3 receptor. It is believed that excessive activation of P2X3 receptors is associated with hyper-sensitization of sensory neurons. Neuronal hyper-sensitization in the airways and lungs, triggered by injury or infection, can cause an exaggerated, persistent and frequent urge to cough, so called chronic cough. About Chronic Cough The prevalence of chronic cough (a cough lasting more than 8 weeks) is estimated at ~10 percent of U.S adults. There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of chronic cough.

Urovant's lead therapeutic candidate is vibegron, an oral β3-adrenergic agonist being developed for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Urovant has licensed global rights, excluding Japan and certain Asian territories, for the development and commercialization of vibegron (formerly MK-4618) from Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., USA. Over 2,700 patients with symptoms of overactive bladder have been enrolled in clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of vibegron, including a completed global randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled Phase 2b study of over 1,300 subjects that met its primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints, as well as a completed randomized, placebo and active comparator-controlled Phase 3 study of over 1,000 patients conducted outside of the United States that met its primary and key secondary endpoints. Urovant plans to initiate a multinational Phase 3 registration program for vibegron in 2017. "We are delighted to welcome another 'Vant' to our growing family of companies," said Vivek Ramaswamy, founder and CEO of Roivant Sciences. "Urologic conditions such as overactive bladder adversely impact millions of individuals, and the current treatment options are unsatisfactory for many patients. Our aim is to provide patients with better options as quickly as possible." About Overactive Bladder Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition that affects potentially 46 million American adults. The most common symptoms of OAB include the experience of sudden urges to urinate that cannot be controlled, frequent urination, and urinary incontinence due to involuntary contractions of the detrusor muscle. While several conditions may contribute to signs and symptoms of overactive bladder, the underlying cause of OAB remains unclear. About Vibegron Vibegron is an investigational oral β3-adrenergic agonist being studied for overactive bladder (OAB). β3-adrenergic receptors play a role in the bladder fill-void cycle. By stimulating that pathway, vibegron has the potential to relax the bladder detrusor muscle. Relaxing the bladder allows it to store urine more efficiently, thereby decreasing the symptoms of OAB. Over 2,700 patients with symptoms of OAB have previously been enrolled in clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of vibegron. Advertisement Advertisement View the discussion thread.

Specifically, Doll is now a director of health software engineering at Apple, a position which he began sometime in July, but his profile information doesn't provide any further details into his role at the company. The software engineer worked at Apple from 2003 to 2009, helping create and develop the software operating system for the iPhone. In 2009, he left Apple and co-founded magazine app Flipboard with Mike McCue. Similar to Apple News, Flipboard curates content and stories tailored to each user's personal tastes and preferences, and has even been endorsed by Apple in the past. The launch of Apple News was reported as a steep competitive challenge for the small company, resulting in a majority of its executives leaving the company -- including Doll himself -- in September 2015. Despite his background in the news curation space, Doll's new placement at Apple has him focused on potential new health initiatives, an area that the company has slowly been building upon lately. Apple has been beefing up its engineering team for health-care applications, hiring Sage Bionetworks founder and Merck & Co. veteran Stephen Friend and former Nest Labs technology chief Yoky Matsuoka earlier this year. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is increasingly positioning the Apple Watch as a wellness accessory as he tries to win a slice of the $4.6 trillion U.S. health and fitness industry. A report from earlier in the week suggested that Apple is working on a new health-tracking piece of hardware to launch alongside the 10th anniversary iPhone in 2017. Although details are still lacking for a product launch over a year away, the product is said to collect heart rate, pulse, and blood sugar changes, which could be describing a next-generation Apple Watch if it's not an entirely new addition to the company's hardware lineup. Earlier in the year, Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke with Jim Cramer on "Mad Money," discussing Apple's initiatives in the health landscape. Cook described services like ResearchKit and the Health app as "significantly underestimated" sections of the technology market. Ultimately, when asked what the "next frontiers" in product development, Cook described health, and all the inroads taken by Apple to provide detailed analysis of a user's well-being, as "the biggest one of all."

Rating: 3 Votes Adam Warlock 11 months ago When Apple breaks into the Health market, I want to see what the people that say that Apple should focus on macOS in lieu of iOS and watchOS have to say... Please. Health is or rather should be a serious endeavour, not fashionable or taken lightly like 'a hobby'. Would you trust your health or that of a loved one to a company whose software leaves so much to be desired of late? Maybe if you'd like to replace the cuff on your blood pressure monitor with colourful ones once in a while, or be 'cool' (*snicker, snicker*) with a Beats-banded pacemaker or something. I dunno. Perhaps a garishly-colored UI on those multi-parameter monitors they hook you up to in hospitals? One in which nurses struggle to figure out where to find various functions because most of them are hidden, some units require Force Touch, others don't have enough RAM to juggle all your vitals at the same time and still others prompt you to use Apple Pay to purchase more space in iCloud because your complimentary 5 GB is filled with episodes of Planet of the Apps. Let's get serious: Apple in the health industry would be similar to so-called health stores: fluffy crap that may make some people feel good about themselves but ultimately does little or nothing for your actual health, and in fact do harm in some cases. Best leave health to the real professionals IMO. Rating: 2 Votes JamesDo 11 months ago The Android POS spyware festooned by TouchWiz and the slower processor? I forgot the device-cracking pen, but I guess they managed to fix that in v7. I'm talking hardware, but you are acting like another iSheep that closes his eyes for everything that isn't Apple. Note 7: best screen on the market (it even supports HDR, max brightness 1000+ nits), much better camera, IP68 waterproof, wireless charging, headphone jack.

Xconomy Xperience EXOME National Regions Channels Events Enter Now • Xconomy Awards → EXOME all the information, none of the junk | biotech • healthcare • life sciences Want EXOME sent to you daily? Meet the Contributors → ASCO Roundup: Checkpoint Combos, Tumor Profiling, Financial Toxicity Alex Lash June 6th, 2017 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  [Note: Ben Fidler coauthored this report.] The American Society of Clinical Oncology conference is wrapping up, and the closely watched medical meeting-slash-hype machine produced its usual array of data. There were a few big business-focused “horse race” stories—one company’s stumble was another company’s gain—but much of the news consisted of mid-trial updates that companies produce because, well, it’s ASCO and everyone is watching. Drug costs remain a big worry, but there was no galvanizing moment like two years ago, when Leonard Saltz of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center fired a broadside at the drug industry over the prices it was demanding for its new drugs. Saltz was on hand this year, too, and sat for an interview with Medscape that’s worth a read. But there seemed to be a relative lack of headlines about drug costs. There was not, however, a lack of papers trying to measure “financial toxicity” as a side effect that’s just as tangible for a patient as an overheated immune system or debilitating nausea. One study also looked at the barriers that impede doctors from discussing with their patients the financial burdens of medicine. As people digest the ASCO data in the coming weeks, expect to see more discussion of drug costs, such as this urologist’s take in Forbes. What else was shaking in Chicago? Read on. CHECKPOINT BATTLES AND A NEW ENTRANT —Checkpoint inhibitors, which stymie proteins such as PD-1 and CTLA4 that tumors use to evade the immune system, are now established cancer treatments: six have been approved for skin, lung, bladder, and other cancers. The two checkpoint leaders—nivolumab (Opdivo, from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY)) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda, from Merck (NYSE: MRK))—are in a topsy-turvy battle for market supremacy. Last year, nivolumab failed a key trial in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients, and pembrolizumab didn’t. Bristol-Myers is looking to rebound by combining nivolumab with another of its immunotherapy drugs, ipiliumuab (Yervoy), in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients. The latest detailed results from an early-stage study, Checkmate-012, were released Saturday. (A much larger study of the same combination, called Checkmate-227, is ongoing and has not produced public data yet.) Checkpoint inhibitors continue to expand into other cancers. ASCO featured updates from nivolumab and pembrolizumab studies in liver, stomach, cervical, and colorectal cancers. Merck also reported more data underscoring pembrolizumab’s recent approval for patients with a particular genetic signature, regardless where their tumors originated. Longtime partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi (NYSE: SNY) have entered the checkpoint scrum with their PD-1 blocker REGN-2810, starting in an indication with no PD-1 inhibitors, advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer that also has no widely used standard of care. Their Phase 1 results, posted Sunday, were “interesting” but too early to draw much from, Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham wrote in a research note. A Phase 2 study is ongoing. TARGETING TUMOR DNA Just before ASCO, the FDA approved pembrolizumab to treat tumors with a specific genetic fingerprint regardless of the part of the body where they began growing. Over the weekend, Loxo Oncology (NASDAQ: LOXO) added to the enthusiasm for genetically-targeted cancer therapy with Phase 2 data that showed people with a wide range of tumors, all with a mutation called a TRK fusion, responded well to the company’s drug larotrectinib. Shares of Loxo surged more than 43 percent. Loxo will soon seek to have larotrectinib join pembrolizumab as an approved tumor-agnostic drug, but in the meantime the trial’s lead investigator told Xconomy that the positive results could push more researchers and companies to “engage in this newer paradigm of drug development.” A big hurdle, however, is acceptance of the tests required to identify a tumor’s signature. The cutting-edge DNA tests are not easily reimbursed and remain confusing for many doctors who don’t have access to the resources of major medical centers, as Xconomy reported last week. Some of these tests look for TRK fusions, but Loxo’s CEO told Xconomy he is hedging bets, enlisting Roche to develop an older-school (and cheaper) test that looks at a tumor under a microscope. Meanwhile, companies that make tumor DNA diagnostics were in full force at ASCO. One developer of blood-based diagnostics known as liquid biopsies, Grail, began the ASCO run-up with a merger announcement, then presented early data from its massive clinical study program. Grail wants to make tests that screen for cancer—that is, detect it in otherwise healthy people. Others have similar ambitions, also using … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Alex Lash is Xconomy's National Biotech Editor. He is based in San Francisco.

on the  North America Cancer Vaccines Market " which estimates the market which was worth $ 1.08 billion in 2016 and expected to reach $ 2.38 billion by the end of 2021 with a growing potential of 17.03%. View report at: http://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/north-america-cancer-vaccines-market-1420/ Cancer treatment vaccines are different from the vaccines that work against viruses. These vaccines try to get the immune system to mount an attack against cancer cells in the body. Instead of preventing disease, they are meant to get the immune system to attack a disease that already exists. Some cancer treatment vaccines are made up of cancer cells, parts of cells, or pure antigens. Sometimes a patients own immune cells are removed and exposed to these substances in the lab to create the vaccine. Once the vaccine is ready, its injected into the body to increase the immune response against cancer cells. Vaccines are often combined with other substances or cells called adjuvants that help boost the immune response even further. Cancer vaccines cause the immune system to attack cells with one or more specific antigens. Because the immune system has special cells for memory, its hoped that the vaccine might continue to work long after its given.

Cancer Centers' ICLIO Initiatives Support Multidisciplinary Cancer Teams to Better Deliver New and Emerging Cancer Therapies News provided by Association of Community Cancer Centers 07 Jun, 2017, 09:00 ET Share this article ROCKVILLE, Md., June 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Institute for Clinical Immuno-Oncology (ICLIO) has launched two unique initiatives that support community cancer programs in implementing and advancing access to new and emerging immunotherapies for cancer. Through these initiatives, ICLIO faculty engage multidisciplinary care teams in robust discussions on the real-world challenges and complexities of delivering immunotherapy to patients in the community setting. ICLIO is an institute of the Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC). "With the mounting number of approvals and new indications for immuno-oncology, there comes an increased need for education and communication among all members of the care delivery team. Through tailored, intimate learning opportunities, these ICLIO initiatives are meeting a critical need for clinicians working in the community on the frontlines of cancer care delivery," said ICLIO Advisory Committee Chair Lee S. Schwartzberg, MD, FACP.  It is estimated that 85% of the nation's cancer patients receive care in the community setting. ICLIO Visiting Experts The ICLIO Visiting Experts program brings a multidisciplinary team of oncology professionals experienced in the delivery of immunotherapy for cancer into ACCC member cancer programs for a one-day workshop. The workshops delve into clinical, operational, and programmatic issues specific to these innovative new therapies. The curriculum centers on evolving challenges in this field, including patient selection, management of immune-related side effects, support for patients and caregivers, and effective approaches for educating clinical colleagues in allied specialties on the unique intricacies of immunotherapy for cancer. A key takeaway for workshop participants: The critical need for ongoing, consistent communication among all providers. "It was encouraging to see overlap in the workshop with what we see in our clinic," commented ICLIO Visiting Experts workshop participant Kelsey Finch, PharmD, oncology pharmacist, Columbus Regional Health. "Our cancer center has a very interdisciplinary practice and patients tell different parts of their story to different clinicians, particularly about the side effects they are experiencing, so clinicians need to be able to communicate with each other to get the full story." "Programs like those put together by ACCC's ICLIO are good because they represent everyone's perspective, not just the oncologist. [Presenting] there were a medical oncologist, a pharmacist, an administrator, as well as a nurse—all of whom have extensive immuno-oncology experience and each with unique ways that their particular institutions have dealt with some of the challenges of delivering these therapies," said workshop participant Magi Khalil, MD, PhD, Physician Practice Director for Medical Oncology, Riverside Health System. Case Studies in Immuno-Oncology Launching in summer 2017, Case Studies in Immuno-Oncology will bring an ICLIO expert to ACCC Cancer Program Members for a 60-minute, case-based tumor board discussion on immunotherapy treatment decision-making and the management of associated immune-related adverse events. All ACCC member programs are invited to apply for this opportunity. Both the ICLIO Visiting Experts and the Case Studies in Immuno-Oncology initiatives are exceptional opportunities for in-depth bi-directional learning, allowing the ICLIO expert presenters to learn from the experiences of the local multidisciplinary teams successfully providing immunotherapy in the community while discussing difficult, real-world cases and sharing their own best practices and care delivery experiences. "As an ICLIO Visiting Expert, I learned a lot myself about other aspects of immunotherapy delivery such as pharmacy storage and how to minimize wastage. We can all stand to learn new things in relation to immuno-oncology therapy, whether we are coming from academia or the community," said Jarushka Naidoo, MBBCh, Assistant Professor of Oncology and attending physician at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University. As new approvals and indications for immunotherapies continue to transform approaches to patient treatment in community oncology, cancer programs have an ongoing need to equip themselves with the most up-to-date knowledge and skills to recognize, triage, and manage immune-related adverse events and prepare for leadership roles in educating their colleagues about the benefits and risks of immunotherapy for cancer treatment. Through these initiatives, ICLIO brings needed education and expertise into the community where most of the nation's cancer care is delivered. About the Institute for Clinical Immuno-Oncology The Institute for Clinical Immuno-Oncology (ICLIO), an institute of the Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC), is the only comprehensive initiative to prepare all members of the multidisciplinary cancer care team for the complex implementation of immuno-oncology in the community setting.  Learn more and explore ICLIO resources at accc-iclio.org. ICLIO is made possible by a charitable donation from Bristol-Myers Squibb and supported by an education grant from Merck & Co., Inc.

More than 23,000 cancer care professionals from over 2,500 hospitals and practices nationwide are affiliated with ACCC.

"With the mounting number of approvals and new indications for immuno-oncology, there comes an increased need for education and communication among all members of the care delivery team. Through tailored, intimate learning opportunities, these ICLIO initiatives are meeting a critical need for clinicians working in the community on the frontlines of cancer care delivery," said ICLIO Advisory Committee Chair Lee S. Schwartzberg, MD, FACP.  It is estimated that 85% of the nation's cancer patients receive care in the community setting. ICLIO Visiting Experts The ICLIO Visiting Experts program brings a multidisciplinary team of oncology professionals experienced in the delivery of immunotherapy for cancer into ACCC member cancer programs for a one-day workshop. The workshops delve into clinical, operational, and programmatic issues specific to these innovative new therapies. The curriculum centers on evolving challenges in this field, including patient selection, management of immune-related side effects, support for patients and caregivers, and effective approaches for educating clinical colleagues in allied specialties on the unique intricacies of immunotherapy for cancer. A key takeaway for workshop participants: The critical need for ongoing, consistent communication among all providers. "It was encouraging to see overlap in the workshop with what we see in our clinic," commented ICLIO Visiting Experts workshop participant Kelsey Finch, PharmD, oncology pharmacist, Columbus Regional Health. "Our cancer center has a very interdisciplinary practice and patients tell different parts of their story to different clinicians, particularly about the side effects they are experiencing, so clinicians need to be able to communicate with each other to get the full story." "Programs like those put together by ACCC's ICLIO are good because they represent everyone's perspective, not just the oncologist. [Presenting] there were a medical oncologist, a pharmacist, an administrator, as well as a nurse—all of whom have extensive immuno-oncology experience and each with unique ways that their particular institutions have dealt with some of the challenges of delivering these therapies," said workshop participant Magi Khalil, MD, PhD, Physician Practice Director for Medical Oncology, Riverside Health System. Case Studies in Immuno-Oncology Launching in summer 2017, Case Studies in Immuno-Oncology will bring an ICLIO expert to ACCC Cancer Program Members for a 60-minute, case-based tumor board discussion on immunotherapy treatment decision-making and the management of associated immune-related adverse events. All ACCC member programs are invited to apply for this opportunity. Both the ICLIO Visiting Experts and the Case Studies in Immuno-Oncology initiatives are exceptional opportunities for in-depth bi-directional learning, allowing the ICLIO expert presenters to learn from the experiences of the local multidisciplinary teams successfully providing immunotherapy in the community while discussing difficult, real-world cases and sharing their own best practices and care delivery experiences. "As an ICLIO Visiting Expert, I learned a lot myself about other aspects of immunotherapy delivery such as pharmacy storage and how to minimize wastage. We can all stand to learn new things in relation to immuno-oncology therapy, whether we are coming from academia or the community," said Jarushka Naidoo, MBBCh, Assistant Professor of Oncology and attending physician at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University. As new approvals and indications for immunotherapies continue to transform approaches to patient treatment in community oncology, cancer programs have an ongoing need to equip themselves with the most up-to-date knowledge and skills to recognize, triage, and manage immune-related adverse events and prepare for leadership roles in educating their colleagues about the benefits and risks of immunotherapy for cancer treatment. Through these initiatives, ICLIO brings needed education and expertise into the community where most of the nation's cancer care is delivered. About the Institute for Clinical Immuno-Oncology The Institute for Clinical Immuno-Oncology (ICLIO), an institute of the Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC), is the only comprehensive initiative to prepare all members of the multidisciplinary cancer care team for the complex implementation of immuno-oncology in the community setting.  Learn more and explore ICLIO resources at accc-iclio.org.

Business Vaccine may cut HPV infections, an oral cancer risk, in men MARILYNN MARCHIONEAssociated Press The HPV vaccine that helps prevent cervical cancer in women also might lower the risk in young men of oral infections that can cause mouth and throat cancers, a new study finds. These cancers are rising fast, especially in men, and research suggests that HPV, the human papillomavirus, is spreading through oral sex. The actor Michael Douglas brought attention to this risk several years ago when he blamed his cancer on it. This is the first study of whether the vaccine might prevent oral HPV infections in young men, and the results suggest it can. No men who had received at least one dose were later found to have infections of HPV strains linked to cancer, but more than 2 percent of unvaccinated men had them. "There may be additional benefits to vaccinating your son or daughter" besides the problems the vaccine already is known to prevent, said Dr. Maura Gillison of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Results were released Wednesday by the American Society of Clinical Oncology ahead of presentation at its annual meeting next month. THE VIRUS HPV is very common — most sexually active people have been exposed to it. Some types cause genital warts. Usually, the virus causes no symptoms and goes away, but some people develop long-lasting infections of strains that can cause cancer. The vaccine was approved in 2006 to prevent cervical cancers in women, and later, for some others including anal cancer in men. But acceptance has been slow — only about half of those eligible are getting it now, according to the latest information. Now, awareness is growing of HPV's other risks — oral infections are blamed for 70 percent of cancers in the mouth and back of the throat. About 11,600 of these occur each year in the U.S. and rates are rising 5 percent per year. They're four times more common in men than women. There are now more mouth and throat cancers caused by HPV in the U.S. each year than there are cervical cancers. Oral sex is the main risk factor for getting an HPV infection in the mouth or throat, Gillison said. While "oral sex does not give you cancer," the infection in rare cases can develop into cancer over many years, she explained. THE STUDY She led the study, funded by the National Cancer Institute , while previously at Ohio State University. Researchers interviewed 2,627 men and women ages 18 to 33 years in a national health study from 2011 to 2014 about whether they had been vaccinated, and tested oral rinse samples from them for HPV. Infections with worrisome HPV strains were found in far fewer people who had received any shots — an 88 percent lower risk. The results in men were striking — no infections in the vaccinated group versus 2.13 percent of the others. The study was observational, so it can't prove the vaccine was responsible. But it may no longer be ethical to do an experiment where one group gets no vaccine, because its benefits for preventing other cancers is known. It might be possible to do such a study in people over 26, the age limit now for HPV vaccination, Gillison said. If a benefit were shown, it might lead to expanding the group for whom the vaccine is recommended. The bottom line is that the vaccine helps, and "so few people who should be getting it are," said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the oncology society who had no role in the study. WHAT PATIENTS SAY Scott Courville wishes it existed when he was young. The 43-year-old construction inspector from St. Martinville, Louisiana, was treated last year for HPV-related tonsil cancer that spread to lymph nodes. "I went through 33 rounds of radiation and six rounds of chemotherapy," lost 100 pounds, and now has damaged taste buds and sinuses, and constant ringing in his ears, he said. His three teenaged sons and stepsons are getting the vaccine. "There was no question at all" that they would, only how soon, he said. Tom Jackson also had an HPV-related tonsil cancer, found in 2013, and works to fight stigma over an infection that is largely sexually spread. As a school board trustee in Houston, "I believe strongly that all children should receive all vaccinations," Jackson said. "The horror of HPV cancer is tremendous," and not to be "whitewashed" by squeamishness or reluctance to discuss prevention, he said. THE VACCINES The vaccines are recommended mostly for young people, ideally before they're exposed to HPV. Merck's Gardasil is approved in the U.S. for females 9 through 26 to prevent cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers and genital warts. For males ages 9 through 26, it's approved for preventing anal cancer and genital warts. A newer version of Gardasil that includes more HPV virus types is approved for males 9 through 15. GlaxoSmithKline's Cervarix vaccine is approved for females 9 through 25 to prevent cervical cancer. All require two or three shots, depending on age. Other ways to help prevent oral HPV infections are limiting the number of sex partners and not smoking. Condoms or dental dams may help. Signs and symptoms of mouth and throat cancers may include a long-lasting sore throat, earaches, hoarseness, enlarged lymph nodes and pain when swallowing. ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter: @MMarchioneAP Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Note that the magnitude of this effect was smaller than had been previously postulated by an analysis of data from the International Register of Lithium Babies. Infants exposed to lithium in utero in the first trimester had a modest increased risk of cardiac malformations compared with both unexposed infants and those exposed to another common mood stabilizer, a large retrospective cohort study found. Compared with unexposed infants, those who were exposed to lithium had a 65% increased risk of cardiac malformations (adjusted RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.02-2.68), albeit with a wide confidence interval, reported Elisabetta Patorno, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, and colleagues. When compared with exposure to lamotrigine, those exposed to lithium had more than twofold increased risk of cardiac malformations (adjusted RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.17-4.34), the authors wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. While they said that their findings support prior research that found associations between lithium use in pregnant women and cardiac defects in babies, they added that "the magnitude of increased risk appeared considerably lower than originally suggested by the International Register of Lithium Babies. That registry-based study from the 1970s found a risk increased by a factor of 400 for Ebstein's anomaly, a right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defect, among infants exposed to lithium in utero, they said. By contrast, this study found "up to tw0 additional cases per 100 births" of women who were exposed to lithium in the first trimester. Moreover, most of the research on the safety of lithium is based on case reports and small studies, the authors said, which have had conflicting results. Because lithium remains a first-line treatment for women of reproductive age with bipolar disorder, some women will choose to either discontinue lithium therapy or terminate their pregnancy "to avoid the potential teratogenicity of the drug." The authors noted that those women who are planning to become pregnant have to "balance the risks and benefits of treatment continuation on the basis of limited and conflicting evidence" about the safety of lithium during pregnancy. Researchers examined data from 2000 to 2010 in the U.S. Medicaid Analytic eXtract , which contained data from live births in 46 states and the District of Columbia among women, ages 12 to 55 years, for which Medicaid covered the health expenses. Overall, 1,325,563 pregnancies met this criteria, with 663 (0.05%) exposed to lithium and 1,945 (0.15%) exposed to lamotrigine. Exposure was defined as at least one filled prescription for lithium during the first trimester. Women exposed to lithium were more likely to be older, white, with a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder and depression, have pain conditions, and use psychotropic and pain medication. Examining cardiac malformations, there were 16 present among 663 infants exposed to lithium (2.41%) compared with 27 out of 1,945 exposed to lamotrigine (1.39%) and 15,251 cardiac malformations (1.15%) in the unexposed cohort. There was no increased risk of cardiac malformations among infants exposed to lamotrigine versus unexposed infants (adjusted RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61-1.30). Secondary outcomes included a dose-response analysis, where higher risks of cardiac malformations were linked with increasing daily dosages of lithium: 600 mg or less: adjusted RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.46-2.64 600-900 mg: adjusted RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.67-3.80 >900 mg: adjusted RR 3.22, 95% CI 1.47-7.02 The authors noted that while dose-dependent teratogenicity of lithium was seen in rodent models, it has not been "well-studied" in humans. Other secondary outcomes looked at particular types of cardiac malformations, and found that infants exposed to lithium had a more than twofold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects (adjusted RR 2.66, 95% 1.00-7.06) and a 46% increased risk of other cardiac defects (adjusted RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.84-2.57) compared to unexposed infants. Limitations to the data include the possibility of unmeasured confounders, that the database only measures prescriptions filled, not taken, and that because diagnoses were based on ICD-9 codes, there is the potential for misclassification. "Findings from this observational study support a modest increase in the risk of cardiac malformations in infants that are associated with lithium use in early pregnancy," the authors concluded.

A systematic review suggested that exercise intensity was a key regulator of gastric emptying rate, with higher intensity exercise (≥70% peak power output) causing the greatest disturbance to gastric motility, according to Ricardo J.S. Costa, MD, of Monash University in Victoria, Australia, and colleagues. Read Full Article However, steady state moderate exercise (60-70% peak power output or 66% VO2max equivalent) did not appear to influence gastric emptying and intestinal transit compared with rest in well-trained individuals, they wrote online in Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics. Additionally, they found that the impact of high-intensity exercise on gastric motility appeared to be ephemeral, as the intensity of prior exercise had a negligible effect on post-exercise gastric emptying rate of a glucose solution. "Understanding the effect of prolonged strenuous exercise on gastrointestinal motility is important since the consumption of foods/fluids during exercise aids in the maintenance of blood glucoseconcentration and euhydration, aimed at attenuating fatigue and enhancing exercise performance," Costa stated. The researchers searched five databases -- PubMed, EBSCO, Web of Science, SPORTSdiscus, and Ovid Medline -- to review publications that focused on the impact of acute exercise on markers of GI injury, permeability, endotoxemia, motility, and malabsorption in healthy populations and populations with gastrointestinal diseases or disorders. They included original field observational studies and laboratory controlled trials from the previous 20 years. Costa's group found that as exercise intensity and duration increased, so did indices of intestinal injury, permeability and endotoxemia, as well as impairment of gastric emptying, slowing of small intestinal transit, and malabsorption. Exercise stress of ≥2 hours at 60% VO2max appeared to be the threshold, while significant GI perturbations manifested, irrespective of fitness status. Running and exercising in hot ambient temperatures exacerbated the indicators of gastrointestinal disturbance, they added. Additionally, low to moderate physical activity may be beneficial for patients who have irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease. "Despite excessive exercise being confirmed to compromise gut integrity and function, we have identified several exacerbating factors which can be controlled, and several prevention and management strategies that can attenuate and abolish the damage and compromised function," said Costa. Two common risk factors included the type of exercise and the duration of the experience. For example, 96%, 85% and 73% of an ultra-endurance athlete cohort competing in a 161 km, multi-stage, and 24 hours continuous ultra-marathon, respectively, reported severe GI symptoms during competition. Conversely, only 11% and 7% of endurance runners who respectively completed a half-marathon and marathon reported GI symptom. Hot ambient conditions, being female, eating during exercise, and having a history of recurrent exercise-associated GI symptoms were also linked to greater incidence and severity of symptoms during exercise. "It is recommended that a full gut assessment during exercise should be undertaken by individuals with symptoms of gut disturbances during exercise, to ascertain what is causing the issue and to develop individually tailored management strategies," said Costa. Several strategies for preventing or reducing the severity of exercise-associated GI perturbations: Maintenance of euhydration Consumption of carbohydrate during exercise Dietary adaptation of the GI tract pre-exercise Avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Dietary supplementation, such as antioxidants, glutamine, L-arginine, L-citrulline, bovine colostrum, and probiotics The researchers called for further research on the safety and health implications of prolonged strenuous exercise in patients with chronic GI diseases and disorders. Costa disclosed no relevant relationships with industry. One co-author disclosed relevant relationships with AbbVie, Ferring, Janssen, Merck, Nestle Health Science, Danone, Allergan, Pfizer, Celtrion and Takeda.
