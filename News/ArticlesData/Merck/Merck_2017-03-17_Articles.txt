Box 964, Chiloquin, OR 97624 ← This is the knowlege they don’t want us to know Couple in N.S. hopes for last-minute reprieve from ‘devastating’ deportation → Pharmaceutical Crimes Continue Unpunished as Cholesterol Drug Lawsuits Stall Posted on March 18, 2017 by Paul Health Impact News – by Paul Fassa The statin or cholesterol reduction drug push has been tagged as the biggest medical scam of all time by medical practitioners who know better and are not afraid of being sued or harassed by drug makers. This actually happened when Merck threatened to sue a Milan health agency official, Alberto Donzelli, for issuing warnings about the dangers of Merck’s new statin drug, Zetia, and advising doctors in Italy against prescribing it. Donzelli was forced to back down in early 2104. (Source)   But this incident was from Merck’s attempt to ride the coattails of Pfizer’s earlier success with Lipitor, which recorded sales revenue exceeding 140 billion dollars until its patent expired in 2011. The generic spin-off of Lipitor marketed currently is Atorvastatin. Despite several peer reviewed published studies that show both the ineffectiveness and dangers of statin drugs, they continue to dominate the pharmaceutical drug market. Cholesterol reducing statin drugs are prescribed unnecessarily and often with serious side effects, even as the whole theory of cholesterol causing heart attacks is being proved as false. (Source) The Lipitor Lawsuit When pharmaceutical companies are not protected by law from injury lawsuits, the way vaccine makers are, we often look to the court system for some sense of justice. It usually occurs after a grassroots tide of lawsuits accumulate. A few years ago a flurry of epidemiological studies demonstrated an increased risk of diabetes from using Lipitor or other statin drugs long term. Suspiciously, FDA warnings were not ordered until just after Pfizer’s patent on Lipitor had expired. (Source) This is an excerpt from that part of the document that lists all the adverse reports prior to the two newly added ones and since marketing had begun for Lipitor. Adverse reactions associated with Lipitor (…) anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. (…) reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. Comment: The last item, “cognitive impairment,” is the result of lowering cholesterol enough to rob cholesterol from brain cells and the nervous system where it’s needed. Here’s what was added to that list in February of 2012: (Source) Liver issues including non-fatal and fatal hepatic failure were reported and added to that list. But here’s the one that led to the current Lipitor class action suit. “Increases in HbA1c [Hemoglobin A1C] and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including Lipitor.” These are both strong indicators of late onset diabetes or diabetes 2. And the two items mentioned earlier, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis, are manifestations of unabated diabetes 2. The plaintiffs assert that this risk was known prior to 2012, and prior to that is when most of the plaintiffs had been placed on statin drugs, including Lipitor. That’s the crux of the case. With several study reports indicating increased diabetes, especially among post-menopausal women taking Lipitor or its generic form Atorvastatin, garnering a large amount of plaintiffs turned out to be easy. By 2015 there were close to 3,000 plaintiffs involved in the class action suit against Lipitor for failure to warn of diabetes 2 as a potential outcome of taking their statin drugs. Unfortunately, what looked like a slam-dunk turned out to be a rebound for the other team representing Pfizer to fast-break the ball down court for an easy lay-up. Actually it was up-court. In the Charleston, SC January 2017 MDL (multi-district litigation) hearing U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel dismissed almost all of the 2800 cases being heard in his court due to insufficient evidence of causation. The warning shot came several months earlier in a painfully parsed document that supported the defendant Pfizer’s claim that two plaintiffs’ expert witnesses reports were seriously flawed and should be dismissed. One of the other two studies was considered inconclusive and open for debate, while the most critical study and cross-examination of that expert witness determined the fatal blow. The court considered the evidence for general causation was sufficient for Lipitor dosing above 80 mg only. And almost all the plaintiffs had been taking Lipitor with well under 80 mg dosages. Without substantially established causation there could be no case against Lipitor. Judge Richard Gergel stated, “Plaintiff[s] must first demonstrate general causation because without general causation, there can be no specific causation. Here, if Lipitor is not capable of causing diabetes, it follows that it is not the cause of diabetes in particular plaintiffs.” (Court Document Source) It’s unfortunate that legal proceedings are so incredibly complex and understandably take so long because so much nomenclature is parsed in areas that rely on experts who can be as much on the wrong trail as anyone. There are arguments in this class action suit that propose only high glucose levels determine diabetes type 2, insulin resistance is not the same. Yet diabetes 2 is defined as, and is the result of, insulin resistance. This is how one of the epidemiological studies offered by the plaintiffs was marginalized successfully by Pfizer’s counsel and expert witnesses. This focus went to cases of raised blood sugar in Lipitor studies, which were conveniently lower in number than insulin resistance percentages. Unfortunately, there are medical practitioners who also agree wrongly. Their idea for treating type 2 diabetics is to administer insulin, which exacerbates their diabetes because type 2 diabetes is the result of sufficient pancreas produced insulin’s inability to escort glucose into cells for energy because the cells are insulin resistant. (Source) Remember, the FDA updated its warning on Lipitor in 2012 to include “Increases in HbA1c [Hemoglobin A1C] and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including Lipitor.” These are usually strong diabetes 2 warning signs. In case you’re curious about natural alternatives for heart health, information under the sub-topic “The Pauling Therapy: Simple, Effective, Inexpensive, and Safe” in this article may prove helpful. A Legal Set-Back to Be Overcome? Unlike many injury cases, these more complex medical study and expert reliant proceedings can be tediously drawn out for quite some time. One could have hoped for choosing victims with other side effects from Lipitor. But diabetes 2 risk subjects created the largest pool of plaintiffs, and most of Lipitor’s other side effect warnings had become labeled prior to Lipitor patients’ developing diabetes 2, making claims of withholding evidence or insufficient warning irrelevant for the earlier side effects warned. Despite this seemingly enormous setback, it appears the Schmidt Firm, a national law firm, is taking on more Lipitor class action participants of different types, even though this firm is the one that broke the recent early 2017 news of all those plaintiff claims being dismissed. Perhaps they have a new approach to remedy this recent summary ruling or are taking it to higher courts. Contact this firm here. If jury duty is considered a civic duty, one could consider the same is true for engaging in litigation against the pharmaceutical industry. Other types of suits, involving statin drug adverse effects, against manufacturers can be perused here. http://healthimpactnews.com/2017/pharmaceutical-crimes-continue-unpunished-as-cholesterol-drug-lawsuits-stall/ Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News, Videos.

Wells A sexually transmitted disease called human papillomavirus (HPV) is the only form of cancer known to be contagious, but what the medical community won’t tell parents of teenagers and preteens is that HPV is easily defeated by a normal functioning immune system. Of the 120 or more different strains of HPV, only about 15 are carcinogenic, and the HPV vaccines, which have never been proven safe or effective in any clinical trials, literally take a shot in the dark at a couple of these strains, much like the haphazard flu shot administered every year to tens of millions of unsuspecting victims of neurological poisoning.   Still, the CDC and rogue hacks and shills from Big Pharma use scare tactics to all but force-vaccinate girls as young as 9-years-old with sodium chloride and two versions of the dormant HPV cancers hidden in protein and genetically modified organisms. Scare tactics and medical propaganda con mothers into getting their young daughters jabbed with deadly neurotoxins “You won’t be able to have children if you get cervical cancer.” “You can catch cancer from having sex and die.” “The shot will make you immune to cancer.” “The shot prevents cancer.” “You wanna have children later? You better get this shot.” The propaganda is mind-blowing, and it unfortunately works. It convinces parents to do the unthinkable: have their little girls (and boys) jabbed with some of the most dangerous carcinogens on earth to “prevent” a couple of strains of a rather benign, pre-cancerous STD. It doesn’t even make sense. What’s even worse is that the HPV vaccine’s protection effect wears off after a few years (as does the cancer itself under normal immune conditions), so what’s the use of taking the risk of getting jabbed with all these neurotoxins? Just how young are kids becoming promiscuous enough to worry about STDs anyhow? More than 10,000 adverse events have been reported from victims of the HPV scam, including blood clots in the heart and lungs, anaphylactic shock, loss of muscle use and seizures. Most infections from HPV are benign and cleared rapidly by the human immune system and never progress to cervical cancer, or even precancerous lesions of the vagina, vulva or anus. No valid reason for administering the HPV vaccine has ever even been established. Why are HPV vaccines, like Gardasil (made by Merck) and Cervarix (made by GSK) so dangerous? Answer: They’re made with “denatured” forms and fragmented strains of the virus, meaning the virus is weakened and can remain dormant for months, if not years, so if you do get the virus later, who’s to say you didn’t get it from the vaccine itself? No studies on this have ever been conducted, nor will they likely ever be. Plus, Gardasil contains aluminum, sodium chloride, polysorbate 80 and l-histidine, the latter of which interferes with the brain’s defenses against metal toxins. That means the aluminum has a heightened chance of crossing the blood/brain barrier. Got brain damage? No wonder. The following are just four examples of the hundreds (if not thousands) of girls permanently damaged by HPV vaccines. Case I: 13-year old Norwegian girl never consented to Gardasil; now her face is half-paralyzed Caroline is now 15 years old. She used to run, cycle and play football. At 13 years of age, two nurses force-vaccinated Caroline with Gardasil (one nurse literally held her down while the other stuck the needle in her), even after her mother had given notice that if she did not want it, she must not be given it. Within a few days, Caroline’s face became paralyzed. Doctors blamed Caroline’s condition on the fact that she was grieving her grandmother who had died six months earlier. Caroline only got one of the three recommended HPV jabs. She now feels pain throughout her body, suffers from poor memory and heart palpitations, and has breathing difficulties. She can’t walk or cycle much or her legs go weak and lose feeling. She is mostly bedridden. The nurses responsible have visited her home and told them not to ever mention the vaccine in connection with Caroline’s health problems or they will scare other children. Case II: Healthy, athletic 13-year old girl’s menstrual period abruptly ends after toxic Gardasil jab Back in November of 2014, Laura, a now 15-year-old girl living in Michigan, was a healthy, straight-A student and avid volleyball player. After the first Gardasil shot she got her first period, then never got a period again. After a second HPV jab, severe headaches kicked in, then constipation, nausea, brain fog and extreme abdominal pains, as attested by Laura and her parents. While Laura was sick from the first two toxic jabs, their “trusted” pediatrician conned and “guilted” them into getting a third HPV injection for Laura in order to further “protect her from cancer.” The doctor said, “While you’re here, you might as well get the third.” Then, after the third toxic Gardasil jab, Laura’s skin turned a greenish-hue, her hair started falling out and she started experiencing intolerable muscle spasms to the point where she could no longer play volleyball. Her legs went weak like “Jello.” After the third jab, Laura was hospitalized for a full week, and her parents consulted seven doctors, who administered MRIs and CAT scans and prescribed anti-seizure medication. The doctors, according to the family, were rude and all denied any link to Gardasil. One doctor went so far as to tell Laura that her severe health problems were “all in her head.” Since then, the family has completely stopped vaccinating all of their children and changed over to a doctor that does not push vaccines. Laura’s father, who is a school principal, is very angry about the whole extended health nightmare, saying, “You don’t know until something happens to you.” Case III: Sydney Weggen of Iowa got the Gardasil jab in conjunction with Tdap vaccine, became anemic and one of her lungs filled with fluid Sydney used to dance five hours a day, but can no longer dance at all. At just 11 years of age, she received three Gardasil STD jabs just a few months apart. After spending $20,000 on medical tests, losing over 20 pounds and getting a stint put into her lung to drain fluid and keep it functioning, Sydney almost died. Case IV: Kate died at age 19 after suffering horrific pain for three years from Gardasil vax The film VAXXED, produced by Del Bigtree, tells the story of the biggest medical scandal and cover-up in U.S. history regarding the dangers of vaccines. The film crew continues to interview parents and children who suffer from vaccine injuries and want to tell their stories to the world to help protect others from similar nightmares. One mother tells the story of the biggest regret of her life: allowing her teenage daughter Kate to receive the Gardasil HPV vaccine, here. Want to build up natural immunity to cancer?

Wells Tags: cancer, Cervarix, chemical violence, Gardasil, HPV, toxic vaccines, vaccine damage, vaccine side effects (Natural News) A sexually transmitted disease called human papillomavirus (HPV) is the only form of cancer known to be contagious, but what the medical community won’t tell parents of teenagers and preteens is that HPV is easily defeated by a normal functioning immune system. Of the 120 or more different strains of HPV, only about 15 are carcinogenic, and the HPV vaccines, which have never been proven safe or effective in any clinical trials, literally take a shot in the dark at a couple of these strains, much like the haphazard flu shot administered every year to tens of millions of unsuspecting victims of neurological poisoning. Still, the CDC and rogue hacks and shills from Big Pharma use scare tactics to all but force-vaccinate girls as young as 9-years-old with sodium chloride and two versions of the dormant HPV cancers hidden in protein and genetically modified organisms. Scare tactics and medical propaganda con mothers into getting their young daughters jabbed with deadly neurotoxins “You won’t be able to have children if you get cervical cancer.” “You can catch cancer from having sex and die.” “The shot will make you immune to cancer.” “The shot prevents cancer.” “You wanna have children later? You better get this shot.” The propaganda is mind-blowing, and it unfortunately works. It convinces parents to do the unthinkable: have their little girls (and boys) jabbed with some of the most dangerous carcinogens on earth to “prevent” a couple of strains of a rather benign, pre-cancerous STD. It doesn’t even make sense. What’s even worse is that the HPV vaccine’s protection effect wears off after a few years (as does the cancer itself under normal immune conditions), so what’s the use of taking the risk of getting jabbed with all these neurotoxins? Just how young are kids becoming promiscuous enough to worry about STDs anyhow? More than 10,000 adverse events have been reported from victims of the HPV scam, including blood clots in the heart and lungs, anaphylactic shock, loss of muscle use and seizures. Most infections from HPV are benign and cleared rapidly by the human immune system and never progress to cervical cancer, or even precancerous lesions of the vagina, vulva or anus. No valid reason for administering the HPV vaccine has ever even been established. Why are HPV vaccines, like Gardasil (made by Merck) and Cervarix (made by GSK) so dangerous? Answer: They’re made with “denatured” forms and fragmented strains of the virus, meaning the virus is weakened and can remain dormant for months, if not years, so if you do get the virus later, who’s to say you didn’t get it from the vaccine itself? No studies on this have ever been conducted, nor will they likely ever be. Plus, Gardasil contains aluminum, sodium chloride, polysorbate 80 and l-histidine, the latter of which interferes with the brain’s defenses against metal toxins. That means the aluminum has a heightened chance of crossing the blood/brain barrier. Got brain damage? No wonder. The following are just four examples of the hundreds (if not thousands) of girls permanently damaged by HPV vaccines. Case I: 13-year old Norwegian girl never consented to Gardasil; now her face is half-paralyzed Caroline is now 15 years old. She used to run, cycle and play football. At 13 years of age, two nurses force-vaccinated Caroline with Gardasil (one nurse literally held her down while the other stuck the needle in her), even after her mother had given notice that if she did not want it, she must not be given it. Within a few days, Caroline’s face became paralyzed. Doctors blamed Caroline’s condition on the fact that she was grieving her grandmother who had died six months earlier. Caroline only got one of the three recommended HPV jabs. She now feels pain throughout her body, suffers from poor memory and heart palpitations, and has breathing difficulties. She can’t walk or cycle much or her legs go weak and lose feeling. She is mostly bedridden. The nurses responsible have visited her home and told them not to ever mention the vaccine in connection with Caroline’s health problems or they will scare other children. Case II: Healthy, athletic 13-year old girl’s menstrual period abruptly ends after toxic Gardasil jab Back in November of 2014, Laura, a now 15-year-old girl living in Michigan, was a healthy, straight-A student and avid volleyball player. After the first Gardasil shot she got her first period, then never got a period again. After a second HPV jab, severe headaches kicked in, then constipation, nausea, brain fog and extreme abdominal pains, as attested by Laura and her parents. While Laura was sick from the first two toxic jabs, their “trusted” pediatrician conned and “guilted” them into getting a third HPV injection for Laura in order to further “protect her from cancer.” The doctor said, “While you’re here, you might as well get the third.” Then, after the third toxic Gardasil jab, Laura’s skin turned a greenish-hue, her hair started falling out and she started experiencing intolerable muscle spasms to the point where she could no longer play volleyball. Her legs went weak like “Jello.” After the third jab, Laura was hospitalized for a full week, and her parents consulted seven doctors, who administered MRIs and CAT scans and prescribed anti-seizure medication. The doctors, according to the family, were rude and all denied any link to Gardasil. One doctor went so far as to tell Laura that her severe health problems were “all in her head.” Since then, the family has completely stopped vaccinating all of their children and changed over to a doctor that does not push vaccines. Laura’s father, who is a school principal, is very angry about the whole extended health nightmare, saying, “You don’t know until something happens to you.” Case III: Sydney Weggen of Iowa got the Gardasil jab in conjunction with Tdap vaccine, became anemic and one of her lungs filled with fluid Sydney used to dance five hours a day, but can no longer dance at all. At just 11 years of age, she received three Gardasil STD jabs just a few months apart. After spending $20,000 on medical tests, losing over 20 pounds and getting a stint put into her lung to drain fluid and keep it functioning, Sydney almost died. Case IV: Kate died at age 19 after suffering horrific pain for three years from Gardasil vax The film VAXXED, produced by Del Bigtree, tells the story of the biggest medical scandal and cover-up in U.S. history regarding the dangers of vaccines. The film crew continues to interview parents and children who suffer from vaccine injuries and want to tell their stories to the world to help protect others from similar nightmares. One mother tells the story of the biggest regret of her life: allowing her teenage daughter Kate to receive the Gardasil HPV vaccine, here. Want to build up natural immunity to cancer?

The changed outlook emerged after one member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee voted to raise interest rates on Thursday. Stable oil prices also lifted Royal Dutch Shell (RDSB) by 1.2% and helped to offset weakness in utilities. The FTSE 100 advanced 0.2% to 7,429. West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil slipped 0.6% higher to $49 and $52 per barrel, respectively. Gold was stable at $1,227 per ounce and copper retreated 0.3% to $5,864 per tonne. OVERSEAS MARKETS In the US, pharmaceutical firms such as Merck and Pfizer weighed on investors sentiment, causing both the Dow Jones and S&P 500 to close approximately 0.1% lower. In Asia, the markets focused on the G20 meeting in Germany as Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng were flat on Friday, while the Chinese index SSE Composite fell by 1%. FTSE 100 RISERS AND FALLERS Housebuilder Berkeley (BKG) excited the market as its pre-tax profit for the year to 30 April will be at the top end of market forecasts. It said the London and South East property market is returning to normal. However, it reported a 16% decline in reservations year-on-year between August 2016 and February 2017. Berkeley’s share price rose 5.9% to £31.38. FTSE 250 RISERS AND FALLERS Tullow Oil (TLW) announced a $750m rights issue to help strengthen its balance sheet, although this will only partially fix its big debt problem. The oil and gas producer had $4.8bn net debt at the end of 2016. The stock tumbled 15.7% to 199.9p. Despite a new contract with the US Air Force Civil Engineer Center, shares in Amec Foster Wheeler (AMFW) were flat as it remains in a merger situation with Wood Group (WG.). SMALL CAP RISERS AND FALLERS Stockbroker Panmure Gordon (PMR) received a 100p cash per share takeover offer from Middle Eastern investor and shareholder QInvest and Atlas Merchant. The offer was a 68% premium to last night’s closing price. Panmure soared 63.6% to 97.3p on the news. Circassia Pharma (CIR) struck a deal to buy US commercial rights to two products from drugs giant AstraZeneca (AZN). It will see the latter business become a shareholder in Circassia and sent its shares shooting 14.6% higher to 100p. The private equity backers of budget-friendly The Gym Group (GYM) finally sold their remaining shares in the business. Phoenix and Bridges Capital offloaded their remaining stock at 175p per share, which was sold to institutional investors and represented 30.5% of Gym’s issued share capital. Henderson High Income Trust (HHI) announced it will acquire Threadneedle UK Select Trust (UKT) through a merger. Threadneedle said it struggled to close a large discount to net asset value, so it had to take action by combining forces with another investment trust. Shares in both products nudged higher on the news. Electronics group Laird (LRD) fell 38.9% as the price adjusted for a rights issue announced in February. Marketing tech group Adgorithms (ADGO) won a ‘significant’ contract with one of the world’s largest nutrition, health and wellness companies. It reported the contract will generate at least $300,000 of annual software-as-a-service fees. The market liked the news, marking the stock 21% higher.

March 17, 2017 /MarketersMedia/ -- According to the global lifestyle drugs market report, one driver in the market is the lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes such as physical inactivity, stress, consumption of fast foods, and limited intake of water can lead to the development of acne.

Insulin resistance leads to the production of higher levels of sebum in the skin, resulting in acne development. Research studies also put forth that excess insulin can increase the levels of androgens in the body. High levels of androgens also lead to an increased production of sebum in the skin, resulting in acne development. The following companies are the key players in the global lifestyle drugs market: Allergan, BMS, Eli Lilly, and Pfizer. Other prominent vendors in the market are: Acerus Pharmaceuticals, Alkermes, Amorepacific, AndroScience, Anterios, AstraZeneca, Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Avolynt, Celtaxsys, Cerecor, Corcept Therapeutics, Cosmo Pharmaceuticals, CTC Bio, Dermira, Dong-A ST, Euthymics Bioscience, Foamix, Follicum, Forendo Pharma, Futura Medical Developments, Galderma, Hanmi Pharmaceutical, Incyte, Intrepid Therapeutics, Ion Channel Innovations, iX Biopharma, Johnson & Johnson, Legacy Healthcare, LEO Pharma, H.

Order a copy of Global Lifestyle Drugs Market 2017-2021 report @ http://www.reportsnreports.com/purchase.aspx?name=917357 One trend in the lifestyle drugs market is the increase in M&A. The lifestyle drugs market has been witnessing an increase in M&A, which will lead to further consolidation. The vendors are pursuing inorganic growth strategies such as acquisitions and/or partnerships to expand their lifestyle drugs portfolio and to improve their presence in the market. For instance, in August 2015, Allergan completed the acquisition of Naurex. The acquisition enhanced Allergan's portfolio of depression drugs with the addition of rapastinel, a Phase III-ready molecule that demonstrated rapid and sustained efficacy in multiple Phase II clinical studies in depression. With the patent expires in the market place, vendors are also looking to enhance their portfolio through acquisition of generics. Inquire for Discount at http://www.reportsnreports.com/contacts/discount.aspx?name=917357 Further, the lifestyle drugs market report states that one challenge in the market is the patent expiries. The market is currently dominated by key drugs, namely Cymbalta by Eli Lilly, Abilify by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), Cialis (tadalafil) by Eli Lilly, Staxyn/Levitra (vardenafil) by Bayer, and Viagra (sildenafil citrate) by Pfizer. The depression drugs such as Cymbalta witnessed a patent expiry in 2013. Due to the patent expiry, Cymbalta reported a YoY decline of 36.36% in 2015. Also, Abilify reported a YoY decline of 63.07% in 2015 due to patent expiration in the US and EU. In addition, the erectile dysfunction drugs Viagra (approved in 1998), Cialis (approved in 2003), Staxyn/Levitra (approved in 2003) drugs were approved long back, and their patents are nearing expiration in the next few years.

"This is a useful and safe clinical pathway for managing these patients," said Philip S. Wells, MD of the University of Ottawa, who reported the results from the 3,396-patient EINSTEIN CHOICE study today during a late-breaking clinical trials session at the American College of Cardiology meeting. Based on these results, speaking at a press conference Wells said there is "really no role for aspirin in this setting ... I hope these findings will encourage more physicians to prescribe rivaroxaban for these patients." "Clotting and bleeding have been the focus of so many studies over the years, but those studies are usually focused in the coronary bed, so I am really glad to see these data," said Sandra Lewis, MD, of Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. Lewis, who served as a discussant, added that her patients find it hard to stay on long-term anticoagulation with warfarin due to the need for testing and dietary restrictions. The decision, she said, often comes down to "equipoise and so we rely on aspirin." The EINSTEIN CHOICE findings suggest that "... we can improve outcome and prevent events in a very safe way." Patients were randomized to rivaroxaban 20 mg or 10 mg daily or to aspirin 100 mg daily. Prior to study enrollment patients completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and were in equipoise in terms of needing additional anticoagulation. The study drugs were administered for up to 12 months and the efficacy endpoint was symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism (fatal or nonfatal); the safety endpoint was major bleeding. "We are talking about an area of clinical care that is very challenging," said Timothy J. Gardiner, MD, who was not involved in the study. "In our own vascular institute we are trying to develop a clinical pathway for this. There are very few guidelines and those that do exist are conflicting," Gardiner, a surgeon, is medical director of Christiana Care's Center for Heart & Vascular Health and executive director of the Value Institute and is a former president of the American Heart Association. "This looks like it could be the answer, " Gardner said, noting that warfarin is often difficult to manage and "aspirin is just not adequate." In the U.S. there is a pressing need for a clinical pathway such as Gardner mentioned because recurrent VTE is one of the quality markers used by Medicare. Wells told MedPage Today that using rivaroxaban as described in the current study is a recognized clinical pathway in Canada, but "little was known about the efficacy of the lower (10 mg) dose." The study was also simultaneously published online by The New England Journal of Medicine. Recurrent VTE occurred in 17 of 1,107 patients taking 20 mg rivaroxaban and in 13 of the 1,127 treated with the 10-mg dose. Among 1,131 patients receiving aspirin, there were 50 VTEs reported. These results translated to a hazard ratio of 0.34 for 20 mg rivaroxaban vs aspirin (95% CI 0.20-0.59); for 10 mg of rivaroxaban vs aspirin, HR 0.26 (95% CI 0.14-0.47). The major bleeding rate were similar in both rivaroxaban doses (0.5% and 0.4% for 20 mg and 10 mg, respectively). The rate was also low, 0.3%, in the aspirin control group. "The rates of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 2.7%, 2.0%, and 1.8%, respectively. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all three groups," Wells and colleagues wrote. EINSTEIN-CHOICE was funded by Bayer Pharmaceuticals. Wells disclosed grant and personal support from Bayer Healthcare, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Pfizer, as well as personal fees from Janssen and Daiichi-Sankyo outside the submitted work.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 March 2017 by Military News Selvita Announces First Patient Dosed in Phase I/II Clinical Trial of SEL24 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Kraków, Poland, March 17, 2017 / B3C newswire / — Selvita (WSE:SLV),  a clinical stage drug discovery and development company focused on innovative medicines for patients with blood cancers, announced today that the first patient was dosed with SEL24 in a Phase I/II clinical trial, for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). SEL24 is a Selvita-developed first-in-class dual PIM/FLT3 kinase inhibitor with a unique activity profile in oral formulation. It is intended for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML. The major goal for treatment of R/R AML is to achieve remission or to significantly prolong life, with acceptable quality. This Phase I/II study is the first clinical trial initiated by Selvita, demonstrating the significant progress achieved in the Company’s pipeline of proprietary product candidates. The SEL24 clinical program is anticipated to provide important safety, tolerability and biomarker efficacy data for SEL24 to support its clinical potential in AML, other hematological malignancies as well as solid tumors. „I am both proud and appreciative of the Selvita team and our clinical investigators in the USA, who have helped to make this key milestone possible” said Krzysztof Brzozka, Chief Scientific Officer at Selvita. „This is an important step toward Selvita’s biggest goal – bringing to market a potentially life-saving treatment for patients suffering from aggressive AML.” The preliminary data established in the first part of the study will include the recommended dose and evaluation of SEL24 pharmacokinetic profile. About AML Leukemia is cancer of the blood cells. Leukemia begins when healthy blood cells change and grow out of control. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disorder of the process that normally produces neutrophils, red blood cells, and/or platelets, which are types of healthy blood cells. It develops quickly and needs immediate treatment.  AML occurs in people of all ages but is most common in adults older than 65. Despite progress in the understanding of leukemia pathophysiology, the treatment of AML remains challenging. AML has the lowest survival rate of all adult leukemias. Approximately 20,000 patients have been diagnosed with AML with greater than 10,000 AML patient deaths in the United States only during 2016. While complete response rates can be as high as 80% in patients undergoing initial induction cytotoxic chemotherapy, the majority of AML patients will ultimately be diagnosed with relapsed or refractory disease. Patients with relapsed or refractory AML (RR-AML) have, in general, a poor prognosis. These patients represent a population that is difficult to treat, having a very dismal outcome with approximately 10% of patients surviving. There is no current standard of care for adult R/R AML other than offering referral to an appropriate clinical trial. Selvita Oncology Pipeline In its internal research and development efforts, Selvita focuses on oncology. The company’s most advanced R&D program is SEL24, a dual PIM/FLT3 kinase inhibitor currently in Phase I/II clinical study. The second most advanced program is SEL120, a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of CDK8 with potential use in hematological malignancies, colorectal cancer and breast cancer. Several Selvita programs have been partnered with Merck/EMD Serono, H3 Biomedicine/Eisai and Nodthera/Epidarex. Selvita Early Discovery programs include:  Immunooncology platform, Eptheron – an oncology platform with an aim to develop novel molecules specifically targeting certain epigenetic and metabolic abnormalities in cancer, as well as an early discovery stage immunometabolism program and project targeting novel kinase targets. About Selvita Selvita S.A. is a clinical stage drug discovery company engaged in the research and development of novel cancer therapies, as well as provision of integrated drug discovery services. Selvita is headquartered in Krakow, Poland, with offices in the USA (Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay), and in the UK (Cambridge). Selvita has currently several projects at early or late discovery stage. Drug discovery clients of Selvita include numerous large and medium-sized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies from USA and Europe. The company is listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE:SLV).

Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail March 17, 2017 12:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time PARSIPPANY, N.J. & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Medicines Company (NASDAQ: MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALNY) today announced positive final results from the ORION-1 Phase II study of inclisiran, an investigational, first-in-class PCSK9 synthesis inhibitor being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The results are being presented today in the “Late-Breaking Clinical Trials - Featured Clinical Research 1” session at the American College of Cardiology’s 66th Annual Scientific Session, ACC.17, and have been published in the March 17, 2017 online issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. The detailed data from ORION-1 showed that inclisiran delivered significant and sustained reductions of LDL-C and high standards of safety and tolerability. Remarkably, every patient who received the two dose starting regimen displayed a significant response and the mean LDL-C reductions over time were practically constant. Inclisiran was well tolerated and no material safety issue was observed, including no investigational drug-related elevation of liver enzymes and no neuropathy, change in renal function, thrombocytopenia, or anti-drug antibodies. “The groundbreaking results from ORION-1 are compelling and affirm inclisiran’s unique and highly-differentiated attributes, and its game-changing potential to address the unmet needs of millions of at-risk, often non-adherent, patients worldwide who continue to struggle with high cholesterol given the limitations of available therapies,” said Clive Meanwell, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of The Medicines Company. “We are singularly focused on thoughtfully and aggressively advancing inclisiran into Phase III development, including the initiation of ORION-4, which we expect to include cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk primary and secondary prevention patients with an average baseline LDL-C of approximately 130 mg/dL.” John J.P. Kastelein, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Vascular Medicine at the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, continued, “We are pleased to see the complete results from this comprehensive 497 patient Phase II study. Inclisiran’s universal and practically constant effect is unprecedented in my experience of over 30 years of dyslipidemia clinical trials. The unique dosing regimen virtually eliminates variability in LDL-C levels over time and inclisiran may, therefore, solve one of the most vexing challenges of cardiovascular medicine – namely, how to make sure everyone responds to treatment.” David Kallend, MBBS, Vice President and Global Medical Director of The Medicines Company, added, “The results from ORION-1 have the potential to significantly advance the treatment paradigm with robust and durable knockdown of LDL-C and a convincing and highly-reassuring safety and tolerability profile. The data support the selection of 300 mg as the optimal dose, as well as our conclusion that a two dose starting regimen, followed by dosing two times per year, constitutes a highly-differentiated and competitive treatment for patients with hypercholesterolemia. We believe the strength of the data will enable a quick and efficient transition to Phase III development.” John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam, added, “We are delighted with these final data from the ORION-1 study and impressed by the progress made by investigators and our partner, The Medicines Company. Importantly, as the largest study yet to be performed for an RNAi therapeutic, we believe the results provide compelling support for the positive safety and tolerability profile of our investigational medicines.” In ORION-1, the mean baseline LDL-C was approximately 130 mg/dL among 497 randomized and treated patients. The optimal starting dose regimen (300 mg injection administered on Day-1 and Day-90) achieved a mean LDL-C reduction of 52.6% and up to 81% at Day-180, and a time-adjusted mean of >50% for the six month period from Day-90 through Day-270. For all dose groups, at all time points, differences in the primary (LDL-C) and secondary (PCSK9) endpoints between inclisiran and placebo were statistically significant (p <0.0001). The overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events was 76% in both patients randomized to placebo and patients randomized to inclisiran, with no significant difference between inclisiran doses. Injection site reactions associated with inclisiran were infrequent (observed in 6.5% of patients given the two dose starting regimen and 3.8% of patients given the one dose starting regimen), mild or moderate, and transient. The results from the Phase II study of inclisiran, published in today’s online issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, can be found here.

About ORION-1 ORION-1 is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase II study of single or multiple subcutaneous injections of inclisiran in a total of 501 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) and elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies. The study compares the effect of different doses of inclisiran and evaluates the potential for an infrequent dosing regimen. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline at Day-180. About Inclisiran Inclisiran (formerly known as PCSK9si and ALN-PCSsc) is an investigational GalNAc-conjugated RNAi therapeutic targeting PCSK9 – a genetically validated protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism – being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In contrast to anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bind to PCSK9 in blood, inclisiran is a first-in-class investigational medicine that acts by turning off PCSK9 synthesis in the liver. The Medicines Company and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are collaborating in the advancement of inclisiran pursuant to their 2013 agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Alnylam completed certain pre-clinical studies and the Phase I clinical study, with The Medicines Company leading and funding the development of inclisiran from Phase II forward, as well as potential commercialization. About The Medicines Company The Medicines Company is a biopharmaceutical company driven by an overriding purpose – to save lives, alleviate suffering and contribute to the economics of healthcare.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 March 2017 by Military News The Medicines Company and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Report Positive Final Results from ORION-1 Phase II Study of Inclisiran PARSIPPANY, N.J. & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The Medicines Company (NASDAQ: MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALNY) today announced positive final results from the ORION-1 Phase II study of inclisiran, an investigational, first-in-class PCSK9 synthesis inhibitor being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The results are being presented today in the “Late-Breaking Clinical Trials – Featured Clinical Research 1” session at the American College of Cardiology’s 66th Annual Scientific Session, ACC.17, and have been published in the March 17, 2017 online issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. The detailed data from ORION-1 showed that inclisiran delivered significant and sustained reductions of LDL-C and high standards of safety and tolerability. Remarkably, every patient who received the two dose starting regimen displayed a significant response and the mean LDL-C reductions over time were practically constant. Inclisiran was well tolerated and no material safety issue was observed, including no investigational drug-related elevation of liver enzymes and no neuropathy, change in renal function, thrombocytopenia, or anti-drug antibodies. “The groundbreaking results from ORION-1 are compelling and affirm inclisiran’s unique and highly-differentiated attributes, and its game-changing potential to address the unmet needs of millions of at-risk, often non-adherent, patients worldwide who continue to struggle with high cholesterol given the limitations of available therapies,” said Clive Meanwell, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of The Medicines Company. “We are singularly focused on thoughtfully and aggressively advancing inclisiran into Phase III development, including the initiation of ORION-4, which we expect to include cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk primary and secondary prevention patients with an average baseline LDL-C of approximately 130 mg/dL.” John J.P. Kastelein, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Vascular Medicine at the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, continued, “We are pleased to see the complete results from this comprehensive 497 patient Phase II study. Inclisiran’s universal and practically constant effect is unprecedented in my experience of over 30 years of dyslipidemia clinical trials. The unique dosing regimen virtually eliminates variability in LDL-C levels over time and inclisiran may, therefore, solve one of the most vexing challenges of cardiovascular medicine – namely, how to make sure everyone responds to treatment.” David Kallend, MBBS, Vice President and Global Medical Director of The Medicines Company, added, “The results from ORION-1 have the potential to significantly advance the treatment paradigm with robust and durable knockdown of LDL-C and a convincing and highly-reassuring safety and tolerability profile. The data support the selection of 300 mg as the optimal dose, as well as our conclusion that a two dose starting regimen, followed by dosing two times per year, constitutes a highly-differentiated and competitive treatment for patients with hypercholesterolemia. We believe the strength of the data will enable a quick and efficient transition to Phase III development.” John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam, added, “We are delighted with these final data from the ORION-1 study and impressed by the progress made by investigators and our partner, The Medicines Company. Importantly, as the largest study yet to be performed for an RNAi therapeutic, we believe the results provide compelling support for the positive safety and tolerability profile of our investigational medicines.” In ORION-1, the mean baseline LDL-C was approximately 130 mg/dL among 497 randomized and treated patients. The optimal starting dose regimen (300 mg injection administered on Day-1 and Day-90) achieved a mean LDL-C reduction of 52.6% and up to 81% at Day-180, and a time-adjusted mean of >50% for the six month period from Day-90 through Day-270. For all dose groups, at all time points, differences in the primary (LDL-C) and secondary (PCSK9) endpoints between inclisiran and placebo were statistically significant (p <0.0001). The overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events was 76% in both patients randomized to placebo and patients randomized to inclisiran, with no significant difference between inclisiran doses. Injection site reactions associated with inclisiran were infrequent (observed in 6.5% of patients given the two dose starting regimen and 3.8% of patients given the one dose starting regimen), mild or moderate, and transient. The results from the Phase II study of inclisiran, published in today’s online issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, can be found here. Webcast Information for Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Presentations Live audio and video of the “Late-Breaking Clinical Trials – Featured Clinical Research 1” presentation by ORION-1’s principal investigator, Kausik K. Ray, M.D., MPhil (Cantab), FRCP, Professor of Public Health, Imperial College London, will be webcast over the internet at 1:30 p.m., Eastern Time, today.

About ORION-1 ORION-1 is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase II study of single or multiple subcutaneous injections of inclisiran in a total of 501 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) and elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies. The study compares the effect of different doses of inclisiran and evaluates the potential for an infrequent dosing regimen. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline at Day-180.

Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail March 17, 2017 12:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time PARSIPPANY, N.J. & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Medicines Company (NASDAQ: MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALNY) today announced positive final results from the ORION-1 Phase II study of inclisiran, an investigational, first-in-class PCSK9 synthesis inhibitor being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The results are being presented today in the “Late-Breaking Clinical Trials - Featured Clinical Research 1” session at the American College of Cardiology’s 66th Annual Scientific Session, ACC.17, and have been published in the March 17, 2017 online issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. The detailed data from ORION-1 showed that inclisiran delivered significant and sustained reductions of LDL-C and high standards of safety and tolerability. Remarkably, every patient who received the two dose starting regimen displayed a significant response and the mean LDL-C reductions over time were practically constant. Inclisiran was well tolerated and no material safety issue was observed, including no investigational drug-related elevation of liver enzymes and no neuropathy, change in renal function, thrombocytopenia, or anti-drug antibodies. “The groundbreaking results from ORION-1 are compelling and affirm inclisiran’s unique and highly-differentiated attributes, and its game-changing potential to address the unmet needs of millions of at-risk, often non-adherent, patients worldwide who continue to struggle with high cholesterol given the limitations of available therapies,” said Clive Meanwell, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of The Medicines Company. “We are singularly focused on thoughtfully and aggressively advancing inclisiran into Phase III development, including the initiation of ORION-4, which we expect to include cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk primary and secondary prevention patients with an average baseline LDL-C of approximately 130 mg/dL.” John J.P. Kastelein, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Vascular Medicine at the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, continued, “We are pleased to see the complete results from this comprehensive 497 patient Phase II study. Inclisiran’s universal and practically constant effect is unprecedented in my experience of over 30 years of dyslipidemia clinical trials. The unique dosing regimen virtually eliminates variability in LDL-C levels over time and inclisiran may, therefore, solve one of the most vexing challenges of cardiovascular medicine – namely, how to make sure everyone responds to treatment.” David Kallend, MBBS, Vice President and Global Medical Director of The Medicines Company, added, “The results from ORION-1 have the potential to significantly advance the treatment paradigm with robust and durable knockdown of LDL-C and a convincing and highly-reassuring safety and tolerability profile. The data support the selection of 300 mg as the optimal dose, as well as our conclusion that a two dose starting regimen, followed by dosing two times per year, constitutes a highly-differentiated and competitive treatment for patients with hypercholesterolemia. We believe the strength of the data will enable a quick and efficient transition to Phase III development.” John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam, added, “We are delighted with these final data from the ORION-1 study and impressed by the progress made by investigators and our partner, The Medicines Company. Importantly, as the largest study yet to be performed for an RNAi therapeutic, we believe the results provide compelling support for the positive safety and tolerability profile of our investigational medicines.” In ORION-1, the mean baseline LDL-C was approximately 130 mg/dL among 497 randomized and treated patients. The optimal starting dose regimen (300 mg injection administered on Day-1 and Day-90) achieved a mean LDL-C reduction of 52.6% and up to 81% at Day-180, and a time-adjusted mean of >50% for the six month period from Day-90 through Day-270. For all dose groups, at all time points, differences in the primary (LDL-C) and secondary (PCSK9) endpoints between inclisiran and placebo were statistically significant (p <0.0001). The overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events was 76% in both patients randomized to placebo and patients randomized to inclisiran, with no significant difference between inclisiran doses. Injection site reactions associated with inclisiran were infrequent (observed in 6.5% of patients given the two dose starting regimen and 3.8% of patients given the one dose starting regimen), mild or moderate, and transient. The results from the Phase II study of inclisiran, published in today’s online issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, can be found here.

About ORION-1 ORION-1 is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase II study of single or multiple subcutaneous injections of inclisiran in a total of 501 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) and elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies. The study compares the effect of different doses of inclisiran and evaluates the potential for an infrequent dosing regimen. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline at Day-180. About Inclisiran Inclisiran (formerly known as PCSK9si and ALN-PCSsc) is an investigational GalNAc-conjugated RNAi therapeutic targeting PCSK9 – a genetically validated protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism – being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In contrast to anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bind to PCSK9 in blood, inclisiran is a first-in-class investigational medicine that acts by turning off PCSK9 synthesis in the liver. The Medicines Company and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are collaborating in the advancement of inclisiran pursuant to their 2013 agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Alnylam completed certain pre-clinical studies and the Phase I clinical study, with The Medicines Company leading and funding the development of inclisiran from Phase II forward, as well as potential commercialization.

Animal diagnostics consists of various instruments and consumables, which can assist in the diagnosis of diseases, whereas therapeutic agents are useful in the treatment of diseases via their mode of action. Animal diagnostics involves determination of the factors responsible for the onset of any disease and transmission of the same. This determination is done by diagnostic instruments and consumables. Therapeutic products used in the treatment of animals comprise of different drugs that help cure the disease through their mode of action. Summary of the Animal Diagnostics and Therapeutics Market can be accessed on the website at: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/animal-therapeutics-diagnostics-market Increase in number of animal population in the developing countries, rise in demand for animal-based foods, and the rise in adoption of companion animals is the major factor that fuels the growth of this market. The animal therapeutics and diagnostics market has experienced moderate growth in the recent years due to emerging diseases affecting livestock. The outbreak of epidemics results in severe mass wipeouts of animals and is a growing concern for the industries dependent on products obtained through farm animals. Moreover, zoonotic diseases affecting animals pose a threat to the public health making diagnosis and therapeutic products an important component in disease management. Animal therapeutics segment is anticipated to dominate the market with maximum share, in 2015 in terms of revenue. Therapeutic products are used for the treatment of various animal diseases. The treatment of diseases that affect commercial animals such as poultry and cattle is even more important, as their products in the form of milk and meat can be consumed by humans, which can lead to foodborne diseases in case of infected animals. Companion animals is expected to be the fastest growing segment throughout the analysis period and accounts for almost one-thirds of the total share of the market in 2015. This is due to the increase in adoption rate of these animals, presence of strong bond between the owner and their companion animals, and high disposable income of the owners. According to Hemali Narkhede, Research Manager, Healthcare at Allied Market Research, "Thegrowthin the adoption rate of companion animals, increase in prevalence of animal diseases, and rise in the demand for meat and milk by consumers hasledtoanincrease in demand fordiagnostic and therapeutic products worldwide." Key finding s of the study   Consumables is projected to be the fastest growing segment during the analysis period. Anti-parasitic drugs generated the highest revenue and is expected to continue its dominance throughout the forecast period. North America dominated the global animal therapeutics and diagnostics market and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4%. Consumable animals segment occupied nearly one-third of the total market in 2015. China is the fastest growing country in the Asia-Pacific region, registering a CAGR of 7.8% from 2016 to 2022. In 2015, North America displayed maximum contribution in the animal diagnostics segment accounting for one-third of the total revenue generated that year. North America also was the highest contributor in the growth of the market for therapeutics in 2015. Asia-Pacific region observes fast paced growth in both animal diagnostics and animal therapeutics market registering a CAGR of 7.8% and 6.6%, respectively. Rise in disposable income, increase in animal healthcare expenditure, and increase in trend of adopting companion animals boost the growth of the animal therapeutics and diagnostics market in the Asia-Pacific region.

Meet the Contributors → Bio Roundup: Trump Budget, FDA Chief, CAR-T Qs, CRISPR Cash, & More Alex Lash March 17th, 2017 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  If it wasn’t clear that the Trump administration disdained most types of scientific inquiry and practice, the White House’s proposed budget drove the point home. The top-line figures: a nearly 20 percent cut in the National Institutes of Health, and a 30 percent cut in the Environmental Protection Agency. These and other cuts to programs for foreign aid and the poor prompted this tweet from Sue Desmond-Hellman, the head of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. US investments in health & development have created healthier, more stable societies at home & abroad. It’s critical they remain a priority. pic.twitter.com/cX4F9YDwcO — Sue Desmond-Hellmann (@SueDHellmann) March 16, 2017 And these thoughts, via e-mail, from Robert Darnell, the founding director of the New York Genome Center: “The proposed Trump NIH budget cuts expose, at their root, a fundamental lack of appreciation of the value of investing in science and discovery.” Details of the cuts at NIH, which funds biomedical research across the country as well as within its own walls, were scant. The White House hinted of a major reorganization, which would be nothing new for the sprawling agency. But the two changes mentioned in the budget—eliminating the global-health focused Fogarty Center and moving the FDA’s health-care quality group into NIH—do “not bode well for the Administration’s reorganization plan,” said Ellie Dehoney, vice president of policy and advocacy at Research!America, a nonprofit advocate for science research. “Global health research tends to get short shrift, despite the fact that not only do some of the most profound threats to American lives emerge in other countries, but working collaboratively with the global community is a cost-efficient approach to medical progress,” Dehoney wrote in an e-mail. One big question now: Which Republicans, who control Congress, will stand up for science funding? So far, there has been no Arlen Specter for our era—a moderate Republican senator who made sure the NIH got a $10 billion bump from President Obama’s 2009 recession stimulus package. There were plenty of other health and life science related stories this week from Washington and around the country, so let’s get to the roundup. —Late last Friday, the Trump administration nominated Scott Gottlieb to be FDA commissioner. Biopharma breathed a sigh of relief; Gottlieb, a physician, venture capitalist, and former FDA deputy commissioner, was considered least likely among the floated candidates to cause drastic upheaval. —Seema Verma, a longtime healthcare consultant in Indiana, was sworn in to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. She and Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price immediately issued a letter to all 50 state governors that called Medicaid’s expansion under the Affordable Care Act a “clear departure from the core, historic mission of the program.” —Price also questioned the idea behind a House bill that would let employers require genetic testing of their employees as part of “workplace wellness” programs. CANCER NEWS AND VIEWS —Xconomy examined the current state of CAR-T therapies, which use live modified T cells to fight cancer. The first-ever CAR-T approvals could come this year, but the field faces safety and affordability obstacles that could prevent use beyond small patient populations. —The FDA approved Merck’s pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients who have failed at least three treatments. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s rival nivolumab (Opdivo) is also approved for cHL patients who have failed multiple prior therapies. —Shares of Waltham, MA-based Tesaro (NASDAQ: TSRO) slid 11 percent after AstraZeneca released Phase 3 data for a “PARP” blocking cancer drug, olaparib (Lynparza), that rivaled Tesaro’s own niraparib in ovarian cancer. TheStreet.com has more here. —The FDA approved ribociclib (Kisqali) for previously untreated HR-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, and owner Novartis said it would put in place a flexible pricing scheme. TRIAL TRIBULATIONS —Following the failure of its experimental microbiome drug last summer, Seres Therapeutics (NASDAQ: MCRB) revealed its plan to try again—this time using a different diagnostic, a higher dose, and a larger sample of patients. —Waltham, MA-based Proteon Therapeutics (NASDAQ: PRTO) is trying to overcome the failure of one study of its blood vessel drug vonapanitase with a larger trial that has a modified goal. —Cempra (NASDAQ: CEMP) retained Morgan Stanley to explore “strategic options.” The Chapel Hill, NC-based antibiotics developer recently cut 67 percent of its staff after its lead drug failed to win FDA approval in pneumonia, then failed in a separate clinical trial for gonorrhea. —AstraZeneca’s hyperkalemia drug, ZS-9—acquired in its $2.7 billion buyout of ZS Pharma in 2014—was rejected by the FDA for a second time due to manufacturing problems. CRISPR AND OTHER DEALS —Allergan (NYSE: AGN) is the latest large biopharma company to place a bet—albeit a small one—on emerging CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. It paid $90 million to Cambridge, MA-based Editas Medicine (NASDAQ: EDIT) for an option to grab rights to up to five experimental eye disease therapies. —Harvard University spinout eGenesis raised $38 million in its pursuit of the once-abandoned field of xenotransplantation. The firm is using CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer pigs that grow up with human-compatible organs. —One of eGenesis’s lead investors, Biomatics Capital Partners, announced the close of a $200 million fund, its first. The two Biomatics principals have ties to Bill Gates. —San Francisco-based Pivotal bioVenture Partners closed a $300 million fund, its first, to invest in early stage biotechs. The fund is led by Tracy Saxton, who previously had stints at Roche Venture Fund and SV Life Sciences Advisors. —South Plainfield, NJ-based PTC Therapeutics (NASDAQ: PTCT) acquired Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug deflazacort (Emflaza) from Marathon Pharmaceuticals, and in the process inherited the pricing controversy surrounding the drug.

Vaccines Market, published by Market Data Forecast, the North America market projected to reach USD 1707.26 Million by 2021, at a CAGR of 4.93% from 2016 to 2021.   (EMAILWIRE.COM, March 17, 2017 ) According to the report North America Veterinary Vaccines Market, published by Market Data Forecast, the North America market projected to reach USD 1707.26 Million by 2021, at a CAGR of 4.93% from 2016 to 2021. For full report refer to http://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/north-america-veterinary-vaccines-market-79/ The major goals of veterinary vaccines are to increase production of livestock in a cost-effective manner, improve the health companion animals, and prevent zoonotic disease transmission from both domestic and wild animals. Veterinary vaccine market has shown significant growth in recent years which can be attributed to better management of farms and increasing husbandry practices. This makes the estimation of further growth in the market due to advancement in biotechnological research. Free sample of the report is available at http://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/north-america-veterinary-vaccines-market-79/request-sample The North America veterinary vaccines market has undergone considerable progress during the past few years with the increasing usage of continuous cell lines as a substrate and embracing of the fermenter technology for antigen production. These vaccines are produced for administration by oral or parenteral routes depending on the vaccine characteristics. But it should be kept in mind that USDA APHIS regulations must be stringently followed for distribution and approval of veterinary biologics across USA which is the major economy in this region. Growing prevalence of animal diseases, various government agencies and animal associations; continuous innovations, increasing awareness against the use of antimicrobials is driving the vaccine producers to invest significantly into development of new products, rising incidences of zoonotic diseases in humans; increasing investments by leading players. However, rising maintenance costs for the storage of vaccines, increasing adoption of vegetarian diet in major economies owing to increasing risk of obesity and chronic diseases are key constraints of this market.

http://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/europe-veterinary-vaccines-market-81/ The major goals of veterinary vaccines are to improve the health companion animals, prevent zoonotic disease transmission from both domestic and wild animals, and increase production of livestock in a cost-effective manner. Veterinary vaccine market has shown significant growth in recent years which can be attributed to better management of farms and increasing husbandry practices. This marks the estimation of more growth in the market due to advancement in biotechnological research. Free sample of the report is available at http://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/europe-veterinary-vaccines-market-81/request-sample The Europe veterinary vaccines market has undergone considerable progress during the past few years with the embracing of the fermenter technology for antigen production and growing usage of continuous cell lines as a substrate. These vaccines are produced for administration by oral or parenteral routes depending on the vaccine characteristics. But it should be kept in mind that USDA APHIS regulations must be stringently followed for distribution and approval of veterinary biologics across USA which is the major economy in this region. Rising prevalence of animal diseases, growing incidences of zoonotic diseases in humans; increasing investments by leading players, various government agencies and animal associations; increasing awareness, continuous innovations against the use of antimicrobials is driving the vaccine producers to invest significantly into development of new products. However, increasing maintenance costs for the storage of vaccines, growing adoption of vegetarian diet in major economies owing to increasing risk of obesity and other chronic diseases are key dampening this market.

Introduction of novel approved drugs, expected to be commercialized post-2020, intended for treatment of suicidal ideation would be a major breakthrough for the global anti-suicide drugs market. Until recently, suicidal ideation has been treated with anti-depressants, anti-anxiety, and anti-psychotic drugs. The trend would continue until the expected launch of Cyclurad by NeruoRx Pharma during the latter half of the forecast period (2016–2024). Cyclurad is a combination of D-cycloserine and Lurasidone and indicated for Acute Suicidal Ideation/Behavior (ASIB) in Bipolar Depression. Other drug candidates are also in the pipeline, intended for treatment of suicidal ideation in major depressive disorder (MDD). Suicide is among the major economic burdens to the global economy. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 800,000 people commit suicide every year. Most of the suicidal deaths occur in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe. Moreover, many suicidal attempts go unnoticed until and seldom are reported to suicidal prevention organizations, who can help alleviate the issue. Stop Suicide, Yellow Ribbon Suicide Prevention Program, and American Foundation for Suicide Prevention are some of the leading organizations working for preventing suicides. High prevalence of suicidal attempts and deaths would be another stimulus besides the introduction of novel drugs for the growth of anti-suicide drugs market. N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) agonists and antagonist are the prospective candidate for treating suicidal ideation. Companies banking on anti-depressants and anti-psychotic drugs for treating patients at risk for suicide should reconsider their strategy, considering these are not very effective at addressing the issue. Nonetheless, these drug class are not approved for use in treating patients at risk for suicide. The global anti-suicide drugs market has been driven majorly by off-label recommendations and prescriptions of anti-depressants, anti-anxiety and anti-psychotic drugs. Inadequate reach of healthcare facilities and affordable medications is hindering growth of overall healthcare market in emerging economies such as India, China, Brazil, and Indonesia. Therefore, companies introducing novel anti-suicidal drugs would be facing a challenge in market penetration in these nations and would be able to capture only a part of these markets to capitalize on the lucrative growth opportunities in these regions. North America and Europe remain potential markets at initial stages for the anti-suicidal drugs. High suicidal rates and accessibility to better medical therapies would be the major contributing factors for the anti-suicide drugs market in these regions.

At 2.2 years, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one of those events was 74, a finding that University of Wisconsin cardiologist James Stein, MD, said was "Not a home run, but still an extra base hit." The Cleveland Clinic's Steve Nissen, MD, called it "a triple." "As a practicing cardiologist who sees a lot of patients with severe dyslipidemia and/or statin intolerance, I am very excited by these data because I need all the tools I can get to reduce CVD risk, especially for patients with severe dyslipidemia or who can't tolerate statins, " Stein wrote in an email. He said the NNT was "comparable to that seen in other landmark studies like TNT and JUPITER. Indeed, it does for treatment of lipids in coronary artery disease today what TNT did over a decade ago -- it shows us that lower is better and safe in the mid-term." Those earlier trials were with statins, drugs that even when they were on-patent were much less expensive than evolocumab, which has an estimated annual cost of $15,000 per patient. The results are not surprising because Amgen, which developed evolocumab and paid for the trial, announced the topline results last month. That move added to the drum beat of interest leading up to ACC.17 and when Marc Sabatine, MD, of the TIMI Study Group and Brigham and Women's Hospital, finally took the podium to report the findings from the 27,564-patient study, the audience was ready for a grand slam. And, in fact, the results were good enough for Amgen to announce that it would refund the cost of the drug "for all of [third-party payers'] eligible patients who have a heart attack or stroke." Moreover, the company said it would "continue to offer innovative contracts that provide reasonable budget predictability to help address budget impact concerns raised by payers." FOURIER, as the study is called, was hands-down the most anticipated event on the schedule for the meeting, and as such it was the highlight of the meeting's opening late-breaking clinical trials session. Yet the question remains: Is it enough to drive uptake of the drug, which was highly touted even in its earliest clinical trials but slow out of the box? Can the findings turn this PCSK9 drug into the blockbuster that many had been predicting since Amgen won FDA marketing approval for it in August 2015? 2% Absolute Benefit Journal of the American College of Cardiology editor Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD, noted that the trial was positive but he cautioned that relative risk reductions -- 15% for the primary endpoint and 20% for the key secondary endpoint -- while encouraging, should not be the focus of attention. "The absolute benefit was just 2% ... and this is a very expensive drug." Fuster was a co-moderator of the late-breaking trials session. Steven Ellis, MD, a Cleveland Clinic interventional cardiologist, said he was surprised by how small the absolute difference was. Ellis questioned whether a 1.5%-2.0% absolute difference would be sufficient to influence evolocumab use. Just moments after the FOURIER findings were reported, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), announced that it would release an updated report on the clinical effectiveness and value of PCSK9 inhibitors in May. An initial ICER review of PCSK9s concluded that "evidence was not sufficient to show that the drugs provided a net health benefit for patients with cardiovascular disease who cannot take statins, or who take statins but have not reached a suitable cholesterol level." That update will "incorporate the newly released data, including updated economic analyses and value-based price benchmarks." In FOURIER, mean patient age was 63 and 75% were men. All patients had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease -- 81% had a history of myocardial infarction, 19% stroke, 13% symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. At baseline 69% of the patients were on high intensity statin therapy, 30% on moderate intensity statin therapy and 5% were taking ezetimibe. On average, patients receiving evolocumab reduced LDL by 56 mg/dL and achieved average LDL of 30 mg/dL but some patients "had LDL levels as low as 20 or 25," Sabatine said. Moreover, "the reduction was rock solid ... we seen similar results out to 4 years," he added. Because it "takes a long time to make unhealthy arteries healthy," Sabatine said it was reasonable to expect that the NNT to prevent one event at 5 years could be in 20-25 range, and the discussant panel assembled for the presentation agreed with that estimate. Why No Mortality Benefit? The lack of a benefit for cardiovascular death was a sticking point for some discussants, but Sabatine noted that none of the previous LDL reduction trials demonstrated a mortality benefit and said one reason may be the flip side of advances in cardiovascular treatment. He pointed out that the study that put statins on the map -- the Scandinavian Simvastin Survival Study (4S) -- was reported in 1994 when the mortality rate after MI or stroke was about 25%. "Today that case rate is about 5%," Sabatine said, which makes it more challenging to demonstrate a reduction in deaths. Fuster said he was encouraged that "the event lines appear to diverge with time. They are going in the right direction," so he theorized that the 2% absolute benefit might grow to 4% by 4 years and by that time there might also be a measurable mortality benefit. "The future looks brighter than the present," he added. At baseline, the average LDL was 92 mg/d, but after 48 weeks the median was just 30 mg/d (P<0.001). Patients were randomized to receive 140-mg evolocumab by injection every 2 weeks or a single injection of 420 mg/month or to sham injections. Even more impressive were the clinical results: Evolocumab reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, stroke, heart attack, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization by compared to placebo, which worked out to a difference of 219 patients, a risk reduction of 15% (P<0.001), but the absolute risk reduction compared to placebo was 1.5% (9.8% of evolocumab patients reached the endpoint vs 11.3% of controls). A similar benefit was seen for a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction as a secondary endpoint: 816 evolocumab patients achieved the composite endpoint versus 1,013 in the placebo arm (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.88, P<0.001). But the evolocumab benefit was driven by a reduction in heart attacks, revascularization, and stroke, with no difference in mortality, or hospitalization for unstable angina, or worsening heart failure. For that reason, Sabatine said the P values for outcomes should be considered "exploratory." Stein noted that "these are the lowest lipid levels that have been achieved in a randomized controlled trial, I'm not surprised that it's not a perfect predictive relationship. I also won't be surprised if the investigators present it and say that it is. That devil will be in the details." Next Hurdle: Insurance Coverage ACC scientific program chair Jeffrey Kuvin, MD, called the trials results game changing but, turning to those devilish details, he added, "The question is, is it going to be actually able to change practice. We have to see how patients respond, how practitioners respond, how insurers respond.... A significant portion of this is going to be how it's going to be accepted by insurance." And with a list price of $14,400 per patient per year, that question for third-party payers will be significant. During a press conference following the late-breaking presentations, MedPage Today asked about rumored difficulties in getting third-party payers to cover PCSK9 treatments. ACC President Richard A. Chazal, MD, medical director of the Heart and Vascular Institute for Lee Memorial Health System in Fort Myers, Fla., called the process "a war of attrition." "You can't expect a cardiologist who is working 12 hours to spend another 3 hours on the phone to get approval for these drugs," said Roxana Mehran, MD, of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. Mehran, who chairs the ACC's Interventional Leadership Council, agreed that it's important to identify the patients who will most benefit from PCSK9 therapy but it is also important to remove the barriers so "when the physician makes a decision to prescribe the drug, the patient can get it." Asked to cite specific difficulties, Fuster said he had 13 patients that he wanted to put on PCSK9 therapy; "only three were approved." He added that it is easier to get approval for a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia "with an LDL of 190 than it is to get approval for 150 or 160. That is just the way it is." Sabatine reported grants from Abbott Laboratories, Critical Diagnostics, Daiichi-Sankyo, Eisai, GlaxoSmithKline, RocheDiagnostics, Takeda, Gilead, Poxel, Novartis, Janssen Research Development, and Genzyme, grants and personal fees from Amgen, AstraZeneca, Intarcia, Merck, and MedImmune, and personal fees from CVS Caremark, Alnylam, Ionis, Cubist, Esperion, The Medicines Company, MyoKardia, and Zeus Scientific, outside the submitted work. 1969-12-31T19:00:00-0500 last updated 03.17.2017 Primary Source American College of Cardiology Source Reference: Sabatine M, et al "Evolocumab and clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease" ACC/JACC 2017; Late-Breaker.

Mar 17, 2017, 09:00 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Mar 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Nanomedicine Market - Drivers, Opportunities, Trends, and Forecasts: 2017-2023" report to their offering. The Nanomedicine Market to Grow at a CAGR of 17.1% During the Forecast Period 2017-2023 to Aggregate $392.80 Billion By 2023 The nanomedicine market is analyzed based on two segments - therapeutic applications and regions. The major drivers of the nanomedicine market include its application in various therapeutic areas, increasing R&D studies about nanorobots in this segment, and significant investments in clinical trials by the government as well as private sector. The Oncology segment is the major therapeutic area for nanomedicine application, which comprised more than 35% of the total market share in 2016. A major focus in this segment is expected to drive the growth of the nanomedicine market in the future. Moreover, nanomedicines are introducing new therapeutic opportunities for a large number of agents that cannot be used effectively as conventional oral formulations due to poor bioavailability. The therapeutic areas for nanomedicine application are Oncology, Cardiovascular, Neurology, Anti-inflammatory, Anti-infectives, and various other areas.
