Photo by iSpot.tv Laura Ries was moved to action when she saw a TV commercial that portrayed a woman enjoying time with her grandchildren after taking Lyrica, a prescription medication for diabetic nerve pain. Ries’ elderly mother suffered from just that problem. “The ad showed someone who was enjoying life again,” said Ries, president of a marketing strategy firm in Atlanta, who then researched the drug and spoke with her mother’s doctor. “This … was very relatable to what my mom was experiencing.” Her reaction was precisely the aim of direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising: getting patients or their family members to remember a drug’s name and ask by name for a prescription. Spending on such commercials grew 62 percent since 2012, even as ad spending for most other product types was flat. “Pharmaceutical advertising has grown more in the past four years than any other leading ad category,” said Jon Swallen, chief research officer at Kantar Media, a consulting firm that tracks multimedia advertising. It exceeded $6 billion last year, with television picking up the lion’s share, according to Kantar data. Shows such as the major network’s evening news programs, the CBS comedy “Mike & Molly” and ABC’s daytime drama “General Hospital” are heavy with drug ads, Kantar data show. But the proliferation of drug advertisements has generated new controversy, in part because the ads inevitably promote high-priced drugs, some of which doctors say have limited practical utility for the average patient-viewer. The cost of Lyrica, the drug Ries was asked about for her mom, is about $400 for 60 capsules, for example. Critics say the ads encourage patients to ask their doctors for expensive, often marginal — and sometimes inappropriate — drugs that are fueling spiraling health care spending. The American Medical Association took a hard-line position on these ads in 2015 by calling for a ban, saying “direct-to-consumer advertising also inflates demand for new and more expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not be appropriate.” Such a prohibition is unlikely. Previous efforts to push such an outcome have stalled, generally on free-speech arguments by the powerful drug lobby and assertions that such ads provide valuable information to patients about treatment options. Spending Zooms One thing is certain: DTC advertising is big. And, as nearly everyone who watches TV knows, it’s getting bigger. Some programs — the nightly news and sitcoms aimed at older Americans — get most of their advertising from drugmakers. A Kantar analysis shows 72 percent of commercial breaks on the “CBS Evening News” have at least one pharmaceutical advertisement. Commonly, the ads target a range of conditions that generally affect this demographic, such as dry eyes, erectile dysfunction, pain and constipation. Sixty-two percent of commercial breaks during “General Hospital” include a drug ad. “A lot of these ads target the caregivers and the children of older folks,” said consultant Tom Lom, a former managing partner of Saatchi & Saatchi Consumer Healthcare, which has created ads for pharmaceutical giants from Pfizer to Merck. Drugmakers were on track to spend an estimated $6.4 billion on DTC advertising in the U.S. last year, up 5 percent from 2015, according to Kantar. In 2012, spending for pharmaceutical TV ads was the 12th-largest category. By last year, drug ads were sixth. While substantial, the spending was less than the amount spent by automakers, retail and restaurants. Networks — ABC, CBS, NBC — along with cable channels like CNN — draw a lot of the pharmaceutical advertising. According to Swallen, the effect of the ban on networks would be a daunting, 8 percent loss of total ad revenue, and its impact would be most evident for programming popular with viewers older than 60 — for instance, evening news shows. Similarly, cable networks such as the Hallmark Channel, which draw viewers from this demographic, would feel the pinch because they “have more skin in the game,” he said. Why Some Drugs Are Advertised For years, the DTC industry was mostly focused on drugs that relieved chronic, typically non-fatal afflictions like heartburn (Nexium), allergies (Claritin) and high cholesterol (Lipitor). More recently, Lom said, advertising has focused on cancer and illnesses affecting seniors, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Ads for drugs that target constipation caused by other drugs — opioids — hit the scene last year, reflecting the large numbers of people taking painkillers. For years, the DTC industry was mostly focused on drugs that relieved non-fatal afflictions like allergies. Advertising has more recently focused on cancer and illnesses affecting seniors. Screenshot by KHN In 2016, the top three ads based on total spending were Lyrica, with $313 million in spending; rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira at $303 million; and Eliquis, a treatment for a type of heart arrhythmia, at $186 million, according to Kantar. Reasons why some drugs are advertised more than others vary, with drugmakers evaluating which products are most likely to bring them the most revenue. Drugmakers don’t care “whether it’s a rare, expensive drug or a popular cheap drug,” said Amanda Starc, associate professor of strategy at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. “They’re looking at the marginal return on advertising. A small number of customers spending a lot or a big number spending a little.” How Advertising Plays To Consumers The United States is one of two countries — the other is New Zealand — that allows DTC advertising, a long-standing practice that became more common in the mid-1980s after the FDA issued new rules. Most advertising was in print. But more television advertising began appearing when some of the rules were relaxed a decade later. Lom said the ads give consumers a “head start” on knowing about drugs that might be available for their ailments, speeding up the consumer education process. But, surprisingly, 62 percent of physicians, for instance, said they would or might prescribe an innocuous, even placebo treatment to a patient who didn’t need it but demanded it, according to a 2016 poll conducted by Medscape, an online physician education website. Current rules require that if a drug is named in an ad, information must be included about side effects and adverse reactions. That makes it even more important that drug advertising be visually captivating — if not surprising, say consultants. The ad for Spiriva, a drug for people with lung diseases that can make it hard to breathe, shows an elephant sitting on actress Jeanette O’Connor’s chest. During the 2016 Super Bowl, viewers saw a man emerging from a restroom with a pleased look on his face in an advertisement about opioid-induced constipation. Cialis, which treats erectile dysfunction, uses images of couples in side-by-side bathtubs, which sticks in consumers’ minds. Meanwhile, the side effects are glossed over. “They describe the risks at the same time they play pleasant music — or show pleasant pictures — which helps to distract people from getting the message,” says Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. And while President Donald Trump said he wants to reduce the high costs of prescription medicines, he is also likely to encourage fewer government restrictions on the development and marketing of drugs. But whether the advertising empowers patients or leaves them vulnerable is debatable. Those that do advertise, however, appear to have a leg up. Ries, the brand consultant, says it wasn’t just the ad that helped her to remember Lyrica, but the name, too, which was easy to spell and pronounce. Reis said her mother did take the Lyrica “and it’s helped.” That’s a good thing, says the brand guru who takes pride in looking out for her mom. “The ad spurred the conversation.” This report is a cross-post from the Kaiser Health News website. KHN’s coverage of prescription drug development, costs and pricing is supported in part by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.

Save $300 by 3/28. Kaiser, Pharma Pharma TV ad spend promoting prescription drugs has increased 62 percent since 2012 By Bruce Horovitz and Julie Appleby Post a comment / Mar 20, 2017 at 12:46 PM Shares32 Laura Ries was moved to action when she saw a TV commercial that portrayed a woman enjoying time with her grandchildren after taking Lyrica, a prescription medication for diabetic nerve pain. Ries’ elderly mother suffered from just that problem. “The ad showed someone who was enjoying life again,” said Ries, president of a marketing strategy firm in Atlanta, who then researched the drug and spoke with her mother’s doctor. “This … was very relatable to what my mom was experiencing.” Her reaction was precisely the aim of direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising: getting patients or their family members to remember a drug’s name and ask by name for a prescription. Advertisement Spending on such commercials grew 62 percent since 2012, even as ad spending for most other product types was flat. “Pharmaceutical advertising has grown more in the past four years than any other leading ad category,” said Jon Swallen, chief research officer at Kantar Media, a consulting firm that tracks multimedia advertising. It exceeded $6 billion last year, with television picking up the lion’s share, according to Kantar data. Shows such as the major network’s evening news programs, the CBS comedy “Mike & Molly” and ABC’s daytime drama “General Hospital” are heavy with drug ads, Kantar data show. But the proliferation of drug advertisements has generated new controversy, in part because the ads inevitably promote high-priced drugs, some of which doctors say have limited practical utility for the average patient-viewer. The cost of Lyrica, the drug Ries was asked about for her mom, is about $400 for 60 capsules, for example. Critics say the ads encourage patients to ask their doctors for expensive, often marginal — and sometimes inappropriate — drugs that are fueling spiraling health care spending. The American Medical Association took a hard-line position on these ads in 2015 by calling for a ban, saying “direct-to-consumer advertising also inflates demand for new and more expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not be appropriate.” Such a prohibition is unlikely. Previous efforts to push such an outcome have stalled, generally on free-speech arguments by the powerful drug lobby and assertions that such ads provide valuable information to patients about treatment options. Spending zooms One thing is certain: DTC advertising is big. And, as nearly everyone who watches TV knows, it’s getting bigger. Some programs — the nightly news and sitcoms aimed at older Americans — get most of their advertising from drugmakers. A Kantar analysis shows 72 percent of commercial breaks on the “CBS Evening News” have at least one pharmaceutical advertisement. Commonly, the ads target a range of conditions that generally affect this demographic, such as dry eyes, erectile dysfunction, pain and constipation. Sixty-two percent of commercial breaks during “General Hospital” include a drug ad. “A lot of these ads target the caregivers and the children of older folks,” said consultant Tom Lom, a former managing partner of Saatchi & Saatchi Consumer Healthcare, which has created ads for pharmaceutical giants from Pfizer to Merck. Drugmakers were on track to spend an estimated $6.4 billion on DTC advertising in the U.S. last year, up 5 percent from 2015, according to Kantar. In 2012, spending for pharmaceutical TV ads was the 12th-largest category. By last year, drug ads were sixth. While substantial, the spending was less than the amount spent by automakers, retail and restaurants. Networks — ABC, CBS, NBC — along with cable channels like CNN — draw a lot of the pharmaceutical advertising. According to Swallen, the effect of the ban on networks would be a daunting, 8 percent loss of total ad revenue, and its impact would be most evident for programming popular with viewers older than 60 ­— for instance, evening news shows. Similarly, cable networks such as the Hallmark Channel, which draw viewers from this demographic, would feel the pinch because they “have more skin in the game,” he said. Why some drugs are advertised For years, the DTC industry was mostly focused on drugs that relieved chronic, typically non-fatal afflictions like heartburn (Nexium), allergies (Claritin) and high cholesterol (Lipitor). More recently, Lom said, advertising has focused on cancer and illnesses affecting seniors, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Ads for drugs that target constipation caused by other drugs — opioids — hit the scene last year, reflecting the large numbers of people taking painkillers. For years, the DTC industry was mostly focused on drugs that relieved non-fatal afflictions like allergies. Advertising has more recently focused on cancer and illnesses affecting seniors. (Screenshot) In 2016, the top three ads based on total spending were Lyrica, with $313 million in spending; rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira at $303 million; and Eliquis, a treatment for a type of heart arrhythmia, at $186 million, according to Kantar. Reasons why some drugs are advertised more than others vary, with drugmakers evaluating which products are most likely to bring them the most revenue. Drugmakers don’t care “whether it’s a rare, expensive drug or a popular cheap drug,” said Amanda Starc, associate professor of strategy at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. “They’re looking at the marginal return on advertising. A small number of customers spending a lot or a big number spending a little.” How advertising plays to consumers The United States is one of two countries — the other is New Zealand — that allows DTC advertising, a long-standing practice that became more common in the mid-1980s after the FDA issued new rules. Most advertising was in print. But more television advertising began appearing when some of the rules were relaxed a decade later. Lom said the ads give consumers a “head start” on knowing about drugs that might be available for their ailments, speeding up the consumer education process. But, surprisingly, 62 percent of physicians, for instance, said they would or might prescribe an innocuous, even placebo treatment to a patient who didn’t need it but demanded it, according to a 2016 poll conducted by Medscape, an online physician education website. Current rules require that if a drug is named in an ad, information must be included about side effects and adverse reactions. That makes it even more important that drug advertising be visually captivating — if not surprising, say consultants. The ad for Spiriva, a drug for people with lung diseases that can make it hard to breathe, shows an elephant sitting on actress Jeanette O’Connor’s chest. During the 2016 Super Bowl, viewers saw a man emerging from a restroom with a pleased look on his face in an advertisement about opioid-induced constipation. Cialis, which treats erectile dysfunction, uses images of couples in side-by-side bathtubs, which sticks in consumers’ minds. Meanwhile, the side effects are glossed over. “They describe the risks at the same time they play pleasant music — or show pleasant pictures — which helps to distract people from getting the message,” says Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. And while President Donald Trump said he wants to reduce the high costs of prescription medicines, he is also likely to encourage fewer government restrictions on the development and marketing of drugs. But whether the advertising empowers patients or leaves them vulnerable is debatable. Those that do advertise, however, appear to have a leg up. Ries, the brand consultant, says it wasn’t just the ad that helped her to remember Lyrica, but the name, too, which was easy to spell and pronounce.

It issued a proposed rule Wednesday, Feb 15, 2017 aimed mainly at quelling insurers' concerns and stabilizing the marketplace for 2018. File- President Donald Trump on Friday... By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Obamacare may eventually become Trumpcare. And even though there are issues that must be worked out before the Affordable Care Act is repealed and replaced by the American Health Care Act, investors are excited. Health care stocks are soaring. Two big health care ETFs -- the Health Care Select Sector SPDR and iShares U.S. Healthcare funds -- are each up nearly 10% this year. That's better than the overall market. Several insurers are even hotter than that. Cigna and Anthem, which had hoped to merge, are up 14% and 17% respectively. (Humana and Aetna, the other two that were looking to combine, are each up about 6%.) Drug makers Johnson & Johnson and Merck are up about 10% too. Big biotech Amgen has soared 16%. It appears that investors are betting that the final bill will ultimately be favorable to many of the larger players throughout health care. It's clear that Republican lawmakers are going to have to make some changes after the Congressional Budget Office reported that 24 million more Americans would have no insurance by 2026 under the GOP plan than under Obamacare. So investors seem to be pricing in the likelihood that a reworked ACA replacement will not be as damaging for insurers, especially those like Anthem, UnitedHealth and the smaller Centene...which are all big players in Medicaid managed care business. Shares of Centene are up 20% this year. Wall Street is also ignoring tough talk from President Trump about reining in the cost for many key drugs. Sure, Big Pharma and biotech stocks took a hit earlier this month after Trump once again blasted the drug industry. He said in a tweet that his administration was "working on a new system where there will be competition" in the drug sector and that "pricing for the American people will come way down." That tweet came just two months after Trump, in a press conference shortly before his inauguration, said that drug companies were "getting away with murder" and vowed to crack down on them. But drug stocks and other health care stocks have bounced back in the past few weeks. It's a pattern that is becoming familiar for investors. Stocks fall immediately after an incendiary Trump tweet or sound bite, but eventually recover once investors realize that he may just be publicly posturing as a negotiating ploy. One company that was dragged in front of Congress for a hearing last year due to concerns about big drug price hikes is even rallying. Mylan, maker of the EpiPen allergy medication, is up 10% this year. Another reason why health care investors may not be fearing Trumpcare? The president isn't just using a Teddy Roosevelt-esque big stick to bash the industry for price hikes. Trump is offering them a potentially huge carrot by promising to streamline the approval process for medications from the Food & Drug Administration. Trump said In a meeting with executives from Amgen, J&J, Merck, Eli Lilly, Novartis and other pharma companies at the end of January that he was "disturbed" by how long it takes the FDA to approve some drugs for terminally ill patients. So even though there are still a lot of questions as to what the new version of Obamacare is going to look like and what impact it will have on those currently without insurance, investors are betting that Trumpcare will be good for health care stocks.

Dynavax is presenting data which summarizes the clinical responses and biomarker assessments from an ongoing Phase 1b/2 study investigating SD-101, Dynavax's intratumoral TLR9 agonist, in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada). The results provide insight into the immune mechanisms underpinning the activity of SD-101 and its effect on the tumor microenvironment. Dynavax is also presenting preclinical data demonstrating significant anti-tumor activity of an inhaled TLR9 agonist in mice bearing lung tumors. This treatment highlights the synergy of the TLR9 agonist with anti-PD-1 leading to further reduction of both lung tumor burden and metastases in other organs along with long-term survival of treated mice. These studies provide the rationale for the development of DV281, a TLR9 agonist optimized for aerosol delivery. DV281, in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, will enter clinical studies in non-small cell lung carcinoma patients later this year. A third presentation shows that intratumoral vaccination with nanoparticles incorporating tumor antigen peptides and a TLR9 agonist provides anti-tumor immunity superior to conventional subcutaneous vaccination. Direct intratumoral vaccination using this novel vaccine platform and mode of administration significantly increases both the magnitude and functional activity of vaccine-primed cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and enhances control of metastatic disease.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 March 2017 by Military News Immuno-Oncology Summit Europe 2017 20 March 2017   Scancell Holdings Plc („Scancell” or the „Company”)   Scancell to present at the Immuno-Oncology Summit Europe 2017   Professor Lindy Durrant, Scancell’s CSO, to chair and present in a session entitled: „Combining Checkpoint Inhibitors with Other Modalities”   Scancell Holdings plc, (‚Scancell’ or the ‚Company’) the developer of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, announces that it will be participating in the upcoming Inaugural Combination Immunotherapy meeting, part of the Second Annual Immuno-Oncology Summit Europe 2017, 20-24 March 2017 at the Hilton Canary Wharf, London, UK, alongside other industry leaders from Merck, Sharp and Dohme, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Cancer Research UK.   Prof. Lindy Durrant, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Scancell and Professor of Cancer Immunotherapy, University of Nottingham, will chair the session entitled: „Combining Checkpoint Inhibitors with Other Modalities” on Thursday 23 March 2017. Prof. Durrant is also featured as a presenter in this session and will deliver a presentation entitled: „Combinations of Novel Vaccines with Checkpoint Inhibitors”, scheduled to take place at 14.20 GMT.   During the presentation, Prof. Durrant will discuss progress made with Scancell’s two cancer immunotherapy platforms, ImmunoBody® and Moditope®.   ImmunoBody® utilises both cross- and direct-presentation to increase T-cell avidity by 100 fold.  In Phase 1/2 trials, it induced T-cell responses, tumour regression and long term survival. In combination with checkpoint inhibitors, it induced 100% tumour regression in established models. Phase 2 trials of ImmunoBody® vaccines in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer are being planned.   Moditope® stimulates powerful anti-tumour T-cell responses against neo-epitopes produced by enzymes induced by cellular stress. First-in-man clinical studies for breast cancer, ovarian cancer and osteosarcoma are anticipated to commence in 2018.   For Further Information:   Dr John Chiplin, Executive Chairman Dr Richard Goodfellow, CEO Scancell Holdings Plc   +1 858 900 2646 +44 (0) 20 3727 1000 Freddy Crossley (Corporate Finance) Tom Salvesen (Corporate Broking) Panmure Gordon & Co +44 (0) 20 7886 2500 +44 (0) 20 7886 2500 Mo Noonan/Simon Conway FTI Consulting +44 (0) 20 3727 1000   About Scancell   Scancell is developing novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer based on its ImmunoBody® and Moditope® technology platforms.   Scancell’s first ImmunoBody®, SCIB1 is being developed for the treatment of melanoma.  Data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial demonstrate that SCIB1, when used as monotherapy, has a marked effect on tumour load, produces a melanoma-specific immune response and highly encouraging survival trend without serious side effects.  In patients with resected disease there is increasing evidence to suggest that SCIB1 may delay or prevent disease recurrence.   Scancell’s ImmunoBody® vaccines target dendritic cells and stimulate both parts of the cellular immune system: the helper cell system where inflammation is stimulated at the tumour site and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte or CTL response where immune system cells are primed to recognise and kill specific cells.   Pre-clinical data on a combination of SCIB1 or SCIB2 and checkpoint inhibition (blockade of the PD-1 or CTLA-4 immune checkpoint pathways) have shown enhanced tumour destruction and significantly longer survival times than when either treatment was used alone.  Experimental data suggests that the high avidity T cells induced by ImmunoBody® vaccines increase expression of PDL-1 on the tumour cell surface, thereby making the tumours more sensitive to checkpoint inhibitor drugs.  Re-challenging animals with tumour cells after SCIB1 treatment resulted in 100% survival suggesting that ImmunoBody® induces a powerful memory response.  Such an effect has not been observed with checkpoint inhibitors.   Scancell has also identified and patented a series of modified epitopes that stimulate the production of killer CD4+ T cells that destroy tumours without toxicity.  The Directors believe that the Moditope® platform could play a major role in the development of safe and effective cancer immunotherapies in the future.     About Immuno-Oncology Summit Europe 2017   Following the success of our inaugural Cancer Biotherapeutics conference in London, we are pleased to announce the Immuno-Oncology Summit Europe 2017, to be held 20-24 March in the heart of London’s Canary Wharf Business District.   With an expanded three-track program, attendees can now experience a full week of cutting-edge science and discussion. The first track on Novel Approaches for Cancer focuses on advances in T-cell technology including next-generation CAR Ts, TCRs, and TILs. In addition it covers bispecifics: for T and NK cell engagement; in the clinic; and modelling for optimal affinity. The track also presents genetic engineering technologies for T cells, preclinical models, and production strategies, and focuses on specificity, off-target tox, and safety. The second track on Immunomodulatory Approaches will present advances with checkpoint inhibitors, agonistic receptor engagement, NK and macrophage activation, Fc-engineering technologies, and cytokine-based therapies, and address the challenge of tumours unresponsive to checkpoint blockade. It includes a keynote session on current understanding of the role of the immune system in cancer. Combination Immunotherapy will review the strategies and clinical trials for designing rational combination immunotherapies, provide case studies of immune modulator combinations, as well as combinations of checkpoint inhibitors with other modalities, and discuss biomarker- and mechanism-based selection of IO combinations.

(iSpot.tv) Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print Republish Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print Republish Laura Ries was moved to action when she saw a TV commercial that portrayed a woman enjoying time with her grandchildren after taking Lyrica, a prescription medication for diabetic nerve pain. Ries’ elderly mother suffered from just that problem. “The ad showed someone who was enjoying life again,” said Ries, president of a marketing strategy firm in Atlanta, who then researched the drug and spoke with her mother’s doctor. “This … was very relatable to what my mom was experiencing.” Her reaction was precisely the aim of direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising: getting patients or their family members to remember a drug’s name and ask by name for a prescription. Spending on such commercials grew 62 percent since 2012, even as ad spending for most other product types was flat. This KHN story also ran in USA Today. It can be republished for free (details). “Pharmaceutical advertising has grown more in the past four years than any other leading ad category,” said Jon Swallen, chief research officer at Kantar Media, a consulting firm that tracks multimedia advertising. It exceeded $6 billion last year, with television picking up the lion’s share, according to Kantar data. Shows such as the major network’s evening news programs, the CBS comedy “Mike & Molly” and ABC’s daytime drama “General Hospital” are heavy with drug ads, Kantar data show. But the proliferation of drug advertisements has generated new controversy, in part because the ads inevitably promote high-priced drugs, some of which doctors say have limited practical utility for the average patient-viewer. The cost of Lyrica, the drug Ries was asked about for her mom, is about $400 for 60 capsules, for example. Critics say the ads encourage patients to ask their doctors for expensive, often marginal — and sometimes inappropriate — drugs that are fueling spiraling health care spending. The American Medical Association took a hard-line position on these ads in 2015 by calling for a ban, saying “direct-to-consumer advertising also inflates demand for new and more expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not be appropriate.” Such a prohibition is unlikely. Previous efforts to push such an outcome have stalled, generally on free-speech arguments by the powerful drug lobby and assertions that such ads provide valuable information to patients about treatment options. Spending Zooms One thing is certain: DTC advertising is big. And, as nearly everyone who watches TV knows, it’s getting bigger. Some programs — the nightly news and sitcoms aimed at older Americans — get most of their advertising from drugmakers. A Kantar analysis shows 72 percent of commercial breaks on the “CBS Evening News” have at least one pharmaceutical advertisement. Commonly, the ads target a range of conditions that generally affect this demographic, such as dry eyes, erectile dysfunction, pain and constipation. Sixty-two percent of commercial breaks during “General Hospital” include a drug ad. “A lot of these ads target the caregivers and the children of older folks,” said consultant Tom Lom, a former managing partner of Saatchi & Saatchi Consumer Healthcare, which has created ads for pharmaceutical giants from Pfizer to Merck. Drugmakers were on track to spend an estimated $6.4 billion on DTC advertising in the U.S. last year, up 5 percent from 2015, according to Kantar. In 2012, spending for pharmaceutical TV ads was the 12th-largest category. By last year, drug ads were sixth. While substantial, the spending was less than the amount spent by automakers, retail and restaurants. Networks — ABC, CBS, NBC — along with cable channels like CNN — draw a lot of the pharmaceutical advertising. According to Swallen, the effect of the ban on networks would be a daunting, 8 percent loss of total ad revenue, and its impact would be most evident for programming popular with viewers older than 60 ­— for instance, evening news shows. Similarly, cable networks such as the Hallmark Channel, which draw viewers from this demographic, would feel the pinch because they “have more skin in the game,” he said. Why Some Drugs Are Advertised For years, the DTC industry was mostly focused on drugs that relieved chronic, typically non-fatal afflictions like heartburn (Nexium), allergies (Claritin) and high cholesterol (Lipitor). More recently, Lom said, advertising has focused on cancer and illnesses affecting seniors, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Ads for drugs that target constipation caused by other drugs — opioids — hit the scene last year, reflecting the large numbers of people taking painkillers. For years, the DTC industry was mostly focused on drugs that relieved non-fatal afflictions like allergies. Advertising has more recently focused on cancer and illnesses affecting seniors. (Screenshot) In 2016, the top three ads based on total spending were Lyrica, with $313 million in spending; rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira at $303 million; and Eliquis, a treatment for a type of heart arrhythmia, at $186 million, according to Kantar. Reasons why some drugs are advertised more than others vary, with drugmakers evaluating which products are most likely to bring them the most revenue. Drugmakers don’t care “whether it’s a rare, expensive drug or a popular cheap drug,” said Amanda Starc, associate professor of strategy at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. “They’re looking at the marginal return on advertising. A small number of customers spending a lot or a big number spending a little.” How Advertising Plays To Consumers The United States is one of two countries — the other is New Zealand — that allows DTC advertising, a long-standing practice that became more common in the mid-1980s after the FDA issued new rules. Most advertising was in print. But more television advertising began appearing when some of the rules were relaxed a decade later. Lom said the ads give consumers a “head start” on knowing about drugs that might be available for their ailments, speeding up the consumer education process. But, surprisingly, 62 percent of physicians, for instance, said they would or might prescribe an innocuous, even placebo treatment to a patient who didn’t need it but demanded it, according to a 2016 poll conducted by Medscape, an online physician education website. Current rules require that if a drug is named in an ad, information must be included about side effects and adverse reactions. That makes it even more important that drug advertising be visually captivating — if not surprising, say consultants. The ad for Spiriva, a drug for people with lung diseases that can make it hard to breathe, shows an elephant sitting on actress Jeanette O’Connor’s chest. During the 2016 Super Bowl, viewers saw a man emerging from a restroom with a pleased look on his face in an advertisement about opioid-induced constipation. Cialis, which treats erectile dysfunction, uses images of couples in side-by-side bathtubs, which sticks in consumers’ minds. Meanwhile, the side effects are glossed over. “They describe the risks at the same time they play pleasant music — or show pleasant pictures — which helps to distract people from getting the message,” says Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. And while President Donald Trump said he wants to reduce the high costs of prescription medicines, he is also likely to encourage fewer government restrictions on the development and marketing of drugs. But whether the advertising empowers patients or leaves them vulnerable is debatable. Those that do advertise, however, appear to have a leg up. Ries, the brand consultant, says it wasn’t just the ad that helped her to remember Lyrica, but the name, too, which was easy to spell and pronounce. Reis said her mother did take the Lyrica “and it’s helped.” That’s a good thing, says the brand guru who takes pride in looking out for her mom. “The ad spurred the conversation.” KHN’s coverage of prescription drug development, costs and pricing is supported in part by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.

Login Register Public Release: 20-Mar-2017 Pembrolizumab shows promise in treatment of mesothelioma Penn study is first to show immunotherapy drug can be effective for lung cancer caused by asbestos University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Share  Print  E-Mail PHILADELPHIA - Pembrolizumab, an antibody drug already used to treat other forms of cancer, can be effective in the treatment of the most common form of mesothelioma, according to a new study led by investigators from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The study, published this month in The Lancet Oncology, is the first to show a positive impact from checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy drugs on this disease. Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer that represents about 90 percent of all malignant mesothelioma cases. It's primarily caused by the inhalation of asbestos, a fiber commonly found in some forms of insulation, vinyl floor tiles, and other material. Tumors form in the pleura, a thin membrane of cells that line the lungs and chest wall. Most patients survive less than a year. This poor prognosis is partially due to the fact that most patients are not diagnosed until they are already at a late stage of the disease. The standard first-line therapy treatment involves chemotherapy, and currently there is no approved second-line therapy. "There have been a lot of studies looking at different drugs, but researchers have not seen positive results," said the study's lead author Evan Alley, MD, PhD, chief of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Penn Presbyterian Hospital. "But we've found this new class of drugs, checkpoint inhibitors, seems to be more effective than what's been available in the past." Checkpoint inhibitors are a class of drugs designed to free the body's immune system to fight back against cancer. Pembrolizumab, in particular, has been used to treat melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and in some cases, head and neck cancers. Alley and his team presented data from KEYNOTE-028, an ongoing trial involving 13 different research sites in six different countries all looking at the effect of pembrolizumab on patients with advanced malignancies, including malignant pleural mesothelioma. The study evaluated 25 patients with pleural mesothelioma, all of whom were over the age of 18 and had either already been treated with chemotherapy or were unable to receive it. Patients who had already received another checkpoint inhibitor were not included in the study. Beginning with the first enrollees two years ago, doctors gave each patient a dose of pembrolizumab every two weeks. The tumor reduced in size in 14 of those patients. On average, patients went about six months without their disease progressing, and overall survival was about 18 months. Fourteen patients passed away during the study, while four were still undergoing treatment as of the study's writing. "Most patients who receive a second-line therapy have a life expectancy of about six or seven months, so to have four patients still ongoing at two years is very encouraging," Alley said. The most common side-effects reported were fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and dry mouth. "One great sign in this study is that none of the patients had to stop treatment because of side-effects," Alley said. "Some had temporary stoppages, but they were able to continue. The drug appears to be well-tolerated." There are multiple studies going on right now to confirm these findings, which the authors note is a necessary step before the drug can become a standard second-line therapy. "This study provides evidence that some patients can have long-term disease control with this drug, which we haven't seen before," Alley said. "We need to better understand what we can do next to make immunotherapy more effective for more patients." Alley said there are already plans for trials that will test combination therapies, which will utilize pembrolizumab in conjunction with other treatments. Those studies are expected to launch later this year, including two at Penn. ### The study was funded by Merck, which manufactures pembrolizumab. Alley has no personal financial relationship with Merck. Penn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.

Al, who provides wealth management services to high-net worth individuals, senior executives, physicians and business owners, believes:  „Everyone can live the life they want, now and in the future.  You have to become the master of your cash flow.” Indeed, Al shares the following straightforward advice and valuable information to help people: Al, who worked for Ernst & Young and pharmaceutical giant, Merck & Co., Inc before starting his own firm 30 years ago, stresses that one can attain his or her financial objective, „But it’s important to understand that making better financial choices is not something you can visit once in a while or learn to do simply by reading a book, even this one, and/or by taking a course. Your best bet is to surround yourself with people who are going to help guide you on making better financial choices around a financial plan that lays out the way you want to live, now and in the future.” „At Traust Sollus,” writes Al of his firm with clients in 22 states, „our philosophy is that we don’t believe that penny-pinching — skipping Starbucks to have a cheap latte or giving up whatever it is that makes you happy –- is the way to live your life. Our philosophy is that if you make better financial decisions around your cash flow consistently, you will have the money for the way you want to live your lifestyle now, to save and/or build your wealth for how you want to live in retirement, and to achieve financial independence.” Tax season is now upon us, but the planning for the future of one’s retirement is right around the corner.

Biological drugs, based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) would emerge as a preferred option for treating various cancer types, especially blood cancer (leukaemia). The rising incidence and prevalence of various cancer types, new cancer treatments and growing importance of biological and targeted drug therapies, are driving the market growth of LAMEA oncology/anti-cancer drugs. In addition, increasing demand of anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of ageing population, rising government funds and improved treatment results, are major factors boosting the market growth. However, the high cost involved in new drug development, coupled with threat of failure and adverse effects associated with anti-cancer drugs therapies, would restrain the growth of the LAMEA market. Moreover, accessibility of anti-cancer drugs incurred by high cost, is a major challenge that is expected to further impede the performance of anti-cancer drugs in LAMEA region. Nevertheless, commercialization of advanced therapeutics, such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies (biologic therapies) would reduce the negative influence of restraints and fuel the market growth. Browse Full Report Visit – http://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/lamea-oncology-anti-cancer-drugs-market The LAMEA oncology drugs market is segmented into therapeutic modalities, cancer types and countries.

Further, the biological therapy is the fastest growing segment at a CAGR of 12.2%, throughout the analysis period, on account of high efficacy and target specific action. Moreover, blood cancer drugs market was the largest revenue generating application segment in 2015, owing to the high cost of drugs (immunotherapies), used for the treatment of blood cancer. Based on countries the LAMEA region is segmented into nine countries named Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria, South Africa, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Brazil dominates the LAMEA market closely followed by Argentina, owing to rising incidence of cancer, high expenditure and gross national income (GNI) of Brazil specifically. In addition, LAMEA market is poised to grow at a promising CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period. This high growth rate is majorly attributed to the increasing awareness towards advanced therapies, namely immunotherapies and increase in per capita healthcare spending.

Sunday Chronicle Hyderabad Chronicle Chennai Chronicle Bengaluru Chronicle Kerala Chronicle Science Editors' Picks Lifestyle, Health and Wellbeing New drug for diabetes found to have heart protective potential REUTERS Published Mar 20, 2017, 10:29 am IST Updated Mar 20, 2017, 10:29 am IST The data was obtained from real-world sources, such as medical records, claims databases and national registers.  More than 400 million people worldwide have diabetes, of whom at least 90 percent have type 2 (Photo: AFP) A newer class of type 2 diabetes drugs significantly cut the risk of death and hospitalization for heart failure compared with other medicines for the disease, according to data released on Sunday from a so-called real world study sponsored by AstraZeneca. The drugs, known as SGLT-2 inhibitors, work by removing blood sugar via the urine and include Astra's Farxiga, Jardiance from Eli Lilly and Co and Boehringer Ingelheim, and Invokana from Johnson & Johnson. Jardiance caused a stir in 2015, when a clinical trial conducted to reassure it does not cause heart problems instead showed it reduced the combined risk of hospitalization for heart failure or death from heart failure by 39 percent in high risk patients. The heart benefit has since been incorporated into Jardiance's label. AstraZeneca is conducting its own large clinical trials to determine the heart effect of Farxiga with results expected in 2019. But the latest data presented by Dr. Mikhail Kosiborod at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Washington appears to indicate that heart protection is not limited to Jardiance. "The fact that the results are remarkably consistent from country to country regardless of which compound predominates, that certainly seems to suggest that it's a class effect," said Kosiborod, a cardiologist from Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City. He noted that most Americans in the data were taking Invokana, while Farxiga was dominant in Europe. The study, which analyzed data from more than 300,000 type 2 diabetes patients collected from six countries, found the SGLT-2 drugs slashed the combined risk of hospitalization for heart failure and death from any cause by 46 percent. The data was obtained from real-world sources, such as medical records, claims databases and national registers. Most patients were taking Farxiga or Invokana with less than 10 percent on Jardiance. The comparator medicines included a wide variety of diabetes treatments, including metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, such as Merck & Co's Januvia, and insulin, among others. The vast majority of patients had no history of heart disease. But heart disease is the number one killer of people with diabetes, and mounting evidence of heart protective qualities of SGLT-2 drugs could lead to greater use. "This class has a real potential of improving patient outcomes," Kosiborod said.

The drugs, known as SGLT-2 inhibitors, work by removing blood sugar via the urine and include Astra's Farxiga, Jardiance from Eli Lilly and Co and Boehringer Ingelheim, and Invokana from Johnson & Johnson. Jardiance caused a stir in 2015, when a clinical trial conducted to reassure it does not cause heart problems instead showed it reduced the combined risk of hospitalization for heart failure or death from heart failure by 39 percent in high risk patients. The heart benefit has since been incorporated into Jardiance's label. AstraZeneca is conducting its own large clinical trials to determine the heart effect of Farxiga with results expected in 2019. But the latest data presented by Dr. Mikhail Kosiborod at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Washington appears to indicate that heart protection is not limited to Jardiance. "The fact that the results are remarkably consistent from country to country regardless of which compound predominates, that certainly seems to suggest that it's a class effect," said Kosiborod, a cardiologist from Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City. He noted that most Americans in the data were taking Invokana, while Farxiga was dominant in Europe. The study, which analyzed data from more than 300,000 type 2 diabetes patients collected from six countries, found the SGLT-2 drugs slashed the combined risk of hospitalization for heart failure and death from any cause by 46 percent. The data was obtained from real-world sources, such as medical records, claims databases and national registers. Most patients were taking Farxiga or Invokana with less than 10 percent on Jardiance. The comparator medicines included a wide variety of diabetes treatments, including metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, such as Merck & Co's Januvia, and insulin, among others. The vast majority of patients had no history of heart disease. But heart disease is the number one killer of people with diabetes, and mounting evidence of heart protective qualities of SGLT-2 drugs could lead to greater use. "This class has a real potential of improving patient outcomes," Kosiborod said. Given the observational nature of the study the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors exists, researchers noted. More than 400 million people worldwide have diabetes, of whom at least 90 percent have type 2.

(Adds word in last paragraph)
    By Bill BerkrotWASHINGTON, March 19 (Reuters) - A newer class of type 2
diabetes drugs significantly cut the risk of death and
hospitalization for heart failure compared with other medicines
for the disease, according to data released on Sunday from a
so-called real world study sponsored by AstraZeneca <AZN.L>.
    The drugs, known as SGLT-2 inhibitors, work by removing
blood sugar via the urine and include Astra's Farxiga, Jardiance
from Eli Lilly and Co <LLY.N> and Boehringer Ingelheim, and
Invokana from Johnson & Johnson <JNJ.N>.
    Jardiance caused a stir in 2015, when a clinical trial
conducted to reassure it does not cause heart problems instead
showed it reduced the combined risk of hospitalization for heart
failure or death from heart failure by 39 percent in high risk
patients. The heart benefit has since been incorporated into
Jardiance's label.
    AstraZeneca is conducting its own large clinical trials to
determine the heart effect of Farxiga with results expected in
2019.
    But the latest data presented by Dr. Mikhail Kosiborod at
the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in
Washington appears to indicate that heart protection is not
limited to Jardiance.
    "The fact that the results are remarkably consistent from
country to country regardless of which compound predominates,
that certainly seems to suggest that it's a class effect," said
Kosiborod, a cardiologist from Saint Luke's Mid America Heart
Institute in Kansas City. He noted that most Americans in the
data were taking Invokana, while Farxiga was dominant in Europe.
    The study, which analyzed data from more than 300,000 type 2
diabetes patients collected from six countries, found the SGLT-2
drugs slashed the combined risk of hospitalization for heart
failure and death from any cause by 46 percent.
    The data was obtained from real-world sources, such as
medical records, claims databases and national registers.
    Most patients were taking Farxiga or Invokana with less than
10 percent on Jardiance. The comparator medicines included a
wide variety of diabetes treatments, including metformin, DPP-4
inhibitors, such as Merck & Co's <MRK.N> Januvia, and insulin,
among others.
    The vast majority of patients had no history of heart
disease. But heart disease is the number one killer of people
with diabetes, and mounting evidence of heart protective
qualities of SGLT-2 drugs could lead to greater use.
    "This class has a real potential of improving patient
outcomes," Kosiborod said.
    Given the observational nature of the study the possibility
of unmeasured confounding factors exists, researchers noted.
    More than 400 million people worldwide have diabetes, of
whom at least 90 percent have type 2.

The two vaccine doses should be administered at least 6 months apart and up to 12 to 15 months apart. Girls who are HIV positive should receive three doses of vaccine. In maximal and enhanced resource settings, girls who are 15 or older and received a first vaccine dose before 15 may complete the two-dose regimen. Unvaccinated girls 15 or older should receive three doses. The vaccine may be administered through age 26, according to the guideline, published online in the Journal of Global Oncology. The guideline represents the first resource-stratified recommendations for vaccination to prevent cervical cancer. Approximately 85% of new cervical cancer diagnoses and 87% of cervical cancer deaths occur in less developed regions of the world. Although HPV infection causes genital warts and other cancers, the guideline focuses on prevention of cervical cancer, the most serious potential consequence of HPV infection. "Because resource availability varies widely, both among and within countries, we need to adjust strategies to improve access to HPV vaccination everywhere," guideline panel co-chair Silvia de Sanjose, MD, PhD, of the Institut Catala d'Oncologia in Barcelona, Spain, said in a statement. "This guideline is unique in offering cervical cancer vaccination recommendations that can be adapted to different resource levels, and we expect it to have a major impact on the global health community." The multinational ASCO panel that developed the guideline defined four types of resource settings: Basic: Core resources or fundamental services absolutely necessary for any public health or primary healthcare system to function. Limited: Second-tier resources or services intended to produce major improvements in outcomes and that are attainable with limited financial means and modest infrastructure. Enhanced: Third-tier resources or services that are optional but important and that produce further improvement in outcome and increase the number and quality of options. Maximal: High-level or state-of-the-art resources or services that may be used or available in some high-resource countries and/or may be recommended by high-resource setting guidelines that do not adapt to resource constraints. In basic and limited-resource settings, if sufficient resources exist after achieving coverage of the target population (girls 9 through 14), girls who received one dose of vaccine may receive additional doses up to age 26. Vaccination of boys is a secondary consideration for prevention, regardless of resource setting. The panel recommended vaccinating boys in maximal, enhanced, and limited resource settings only after at least 50% coverage of the targeted female population has been achieved. Vaccination of boys is not recommended in basic resource settings. In addition to publication in the ASCO journal, the entire guideline is available on the ASCO website. Sanjose disclosed relevant relationships with Merck and GlaxoSmithKline.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 March 2017 by Military News Chronix test predicts response to immuno-oncology Chronix Biomedical study demonstrates its blood test can predict response to cancer immunotherapy   –     First study of a liquid biopsy to predict response to immunotherapy –     Highly accurate with a PPV of 92% and 100% for progression after one and two cycles respectively –     Early discovery of treatment-induced hyper-progressive disease –     Published in the peer-reviewed journal, Clinical Cancer Research   San Jose, CA, USA and Göttingen, Germany (20 March 2017) – Chronix Biomedical, Inc., a developer of novel cancer blood-based molecular diagnostics, announces the publication of positive results of a study using its circulating cell-free tumour DNA-based test as a means to predict therapeutic response to immunotherapy in multiple solid tumour types. The paper, by lead author Dr Glen J Weiss et al, was published online today in the journal Clinical Cancer Research1.   Immunotherapy has become prominent in recent years as a result of remarkable response rates seen in previously unresponsive cancers and overall survival benefits seen in patients. However, there are several issues with the approach. First, only a minority of patients usually respond or have disease control with treatment. Second, there can be serious adverse effects with immunotherapy, including an acceleration of cancer growth referred to as hyper-progression. Third, immunotherapy is in general very expensive and consequently there is a high cost to healthcare payers given that many patients do not respond.   The publication describes a blinded, prospective study designed to validate an algorithm, based on changes in Chronix’s proprietary genomic copy number instability (CNI) score, for predicting response to treatment after one or two cycles of immunotherapy in a range of cancers. The study was conducted using blood samples from 56 patients with different tumour types including lung, kidney, breast, pancreatic, colorectal cancers and melanoma. All patients were undergoing treatment with immunotherapy, mostly anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitors with concurrent chemotherapy2.   Three important points were observed in this study: ·   The study showed Chronix’s test provided an 83% overall prediction accuracy in predicting response and disease control/progression, with a positive predictive value for progression of 92% after one cycle of immunotherapy. After a second cycle of immunotherapy, the CNI-score yielded a 100% positive predictive value for progression. ·     Six cases of hyper-progression were observed, five of which could be identified by CNI-score at a significantly earlier time point than by the current practice of imaging (six- nine weeks earlier).   ·   One patient with progressive disease who had had been misclassified as stable on the basis of imaging assessments was able to be identified by the CNI score.   The Clinical Cancer Research paper is the first peer-reviewed publication describing Chronix’s CNI-based approach with immunotherapy and may be the first for any therapeutic monitoring strategy based on a liquid biopsy with this class of drug3.   The study demonstrates that Chronix Biomedical’s CNI-based therapeutic monitoring test can identify progressing and hyper-progressive patients earlier than with currently available technologies. This could allow treating physicians to switch progressing or hyper-progressive patients to alternative therapies sooner and achieve better treatment outcomes, as identifying these patients through imaging or other methods can take several months.  Furthermore, the fact the study showed accurate prediction of response and disease control with different cancers and with patients undergoing various treatments suggests the test should have broad applicability.   The paper’s lead author Dr Weiss commented: „The key finding is the ability of the test to make an early prediction of response and disease control, just three to four weeks after initiation of immunotherapy. The flexibility to switch treatments early on based on an accurate prediction has great potential to improve the treatment of many cancers.”     An interim dataset from the study was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting last year4. Chronix and its collaborators have now published and/or presented results of pilot studies the CNI therapeutic monitoring tests in patients receiving immunotherapy, chemotherapy5, and radiotherapy. Results of recently completed pilot studies in pancreatic cancer and head and neck cancer have also been submitted for presentation at a scientific meeting later this year.   Chronix intends to conduct a number of larger studies in individual cancers to validate CNI-based testing in specific therapeutic monitoring applications and support regulatory submissions. The first such study in metastatic pancreatic cancer, where the standard assessment of treatment is particularly insufficient, is already well underway.   Chronix Biomedical’s CEO, Dr Howard B. Urnovitz, commented: „We are pleased to be able to share fully the details of this study with the oncology community, and highlight the performance of our CNI-based test, with the publication in Clinical Cancer Research. With advances occurring almost daily in the treatment of cancer with immunotherapy, we expect therapeutic monitoring of response to gain additional importance.”   About Chronix Biomedical Chronix Biomedical, Inc. is a US-based molecular diagnostics company developing blood tests for the screening and monitoring of cancer. Chronix’s tests use proprietary algorithms to derive a copy number instability (CNI) score from sequencing of circulating cell-free tumour DNA (cfDNA), which can be used in the prognosis, diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic response to cancer. Chronix already offers supplemental screening evaluation tests based on copy number instability for diagnosis of breast and prostate cancer.

Patients received anti-PD1 therapy, either pembrolizumab (Merck & Co’s Keytruda(R)) or nivolumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo(R)), almost all in combination with chemotherapy. Patients with renal cancer or melanoma received interleukin-2, aldesleukin (Nestle’s Proleukin(R)).
