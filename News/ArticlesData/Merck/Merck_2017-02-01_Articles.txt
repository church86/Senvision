By Elizabeth Landers CNN WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Donald Trump issued a message Tuesday to pharmaceutical company executives akin to one he delivered to auto executives last week: bring your production back to the United States and the Trump administration will lower regulations for you. In a "pharma" meeting in the Oval Office, the President told executives from companies such as Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson that they have done a "terrific job over the years" but that prices for drugs must come down. "So you have to get your companies back here. We have to make products ... We have to get rid of a tremendous number of regulations," Trump said. "I know you have some problems where you cannot even think about opening up new plants. You can't get approval for the plant and then you can't get approval to make the drugs." "We have no choice," the President added, sitting at a table surrounded by aides, Vice President Mike Pence and eight pharmaceutical executives. "For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get prices way down, so that's what we're going to be talking about. We're also going to be streamlining the process so that from your standpoint so that when you have a drug you can actually get it approved -- if it works -- instead of waiting for many, many years." Reading from a statement for a portion of the meeting, which was partially closed to the press, the President stressed that drug pricing has been astronomical in the United States -- a talking point that crosses party lines with support from progressive senators such as Bernie Sanders -- and that he wants to accelerate cures and accelerate US Food and Drug Administration drug approvals. The President said that he's been "disturbed" to see terminally ill patients who need a drug that the FDA has yet to approve. Much like his stance on taxing foreign-made cars, Trump said that there will be a trade policy that will "prioritize that foreign countries pay their fair share for US manufactured drugs so our drug companies have greater financial resources to accelerate development of new cures." Reiterating a favorite line of his, Trump said: "It's very unfair what other countries are doing to us," pointing to devaluation. "Look at what China is doing. You look at what Japan has done over the years. They play the money market, they play the devaluation market and we sit there like a bunch of dummies," he said. The President said he plans to announce someone "fantastic" to the FDA soon. Robert Bradway, chairman and CEO of Amgen, said that he shared a desire to eliminate and eradicate disease, noting the company is adding 1,600 jobs. The CEO of Eli Lilly, based in Pence's home state of Indiana, said to the President that "some the policies you've come out and suggested could help us do more ... and tax deregulation, is a thing that could really help us expand." Merck & Co CEO Kenneth Frazier spoke with reporters by the West Wing of the White House after the meeting concluded. "The President is very much focused on how we can actually do better for patients, giving them more choice, helping them to deal with the medical bills that they have in a way that also stimulates innovation," he said. When asked if he's more hopeful for this administration than he was of the last, Frazier said: "I think there is a real opportunity if we actually work on all those things." Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, issued a joint statement shortly after the meeting saying they hope Trump "really" takes on the pharmaceutical industry. The pair said they will introduced measures to lower prescription drug prices, a cornerstone of Sanders' presidential campaign. Part of the proposal would allow Medicare to negotiate with drugmakers for lower prices, according to the news release. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

German pharmaceutical company Merck has signed a cooperative agreement with Ramot at Tel Aviv University Ltd. for commercialization of new cancer treatment technology developed at Tel Aviv University. The technology was developed in the laboratory of Prof. Ronit Satchi-Fainaro from the Faculty of Medicine and Prof. Doron Shabat from the School of Chemistry. The technology developed at the university makes it possible to connect a new type of antibody that is able to identify malignant tumors to drugs that can kill them. In other technologies, such combinations have given the world best-selling anti-cancer drugs. These focused treatments succeed in attacking the malignant tumor, while reducing the damage caused to healthy tissue. According to Regine Shevach, CEO of Inter-Lab, Merck's Israeli R&D division, this technology makes it possible to connect the antibodies with the drugs in a new way that was formerly considered impossible, thereby significantly improving the effectiveness and safety of this type of treatment. The new product will not pass through Merck's biotech incubator in Yavne, which is subordinate to Inter-Lab; it will be subordinated directly to Merck's research laboratories. The financial particulars of the agreement were not disclosed, but it will initially include two years of support by Merck for development of the product at the university. The agreement also includes an option for Merck to later acquire the technology and rights to additional discoveries resulting from Merck-financed research. A joint steering team composed of representatives from both companies will supervise the project. Ramot VP business development, life sciences Dr. Adi Elkeles said, "We hope to extend the connection between the two enterprises in the coming year, and add additional promising cooperative efforts to it."

Trump told them the government was paying "astronomical" prices for medicines in its health programs for older, disabled and poor people and said he would soon appoint a new U.S. Food and Drug Administration leader. "We’re going to streamline the FDA," Trump said in a statement, referring to the regulatory agency responsible for vetting that new drugs are safe and effective. The meeting between Trump and the pharmaceutical executives signaled a defusing of tensions that have kept drug stock prices in check since the presidential election. Shares of most of the group rallied on Tuesday following the meeting, even as the broader stock market slid. “Trump is a populist above all else, and having these (drug) prices skyrocket, he’s commented that under his administration, this is not going to happen,” said market strategist Quincy Crosby of Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. She said Trump was playing a balancing act between controlling prices and loosening regulations. "I don’t think the majority of Americans want all regulations lifted from drug makers.” Attending the meeting were top executives at Merck & Co Inc, Johnson &, Celgene Corp, Eli Lilly & Co, Amgen Inc and Switzerland's Novartis AG <NOV N.S> as well as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) lobbying group. According to a transcript of the televised portion of the meeting, Amgen Chief Executive Officer Robert Brad way promised to add 1,600 U.S. jobs at his California-based biotechnology company this year. Amgen clarified in an email that it currently employs around 20,000 people worldwide, including 12,000 in the United States, and said the 1,600 includes new staff as well as hires to address attrition. Celgene, Lilly, Merck and Amgen said by email after the meeting that they were encouraged by Trump's focus on innovation, tax reform and the need for a more value-driven health care system. Lilly said discussion topics also included stronger trade agreements and removing "outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow innovation." PhRMA echoed those points in its own post-meeting statement, adding that the policies, if enacted, would result in up to 350,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. "Tax, deregulation - those are things that could really help us expand operations," Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said. Officials at Novartis and J&J did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment. Shares of the six companies were mostly higher, for an overall gain averaging 0.7 percent, compared with a 0.4 percent drop in the broad S&P 500. The Nasdaq Biotech Index was up 1.2 percent, reversing earlier losses, and the S&P 500 health care index gained 0.6 percent. WORLD'S HIGHEST DRUG PRICES "We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid," Trump said, citing the nation's government insurance programs for the elderly, the poor and the disabled. Trump also said currency devaluation by other countries had increased drugmakers' outsourcing their production, and he called on the companies to make more of their products in the United States. Foreign countries must pay a fair share for drug development costs, he added. "We're going to end global freeloading." The United States typically pays more for drugs than any other developed nation. Most Western European countries, as well as Japan, have government-run health care coverage under which drug prices are negotiated. High drug prices have become a national issue during the past two years as healthcare costs have risen Trump spooked pharmaceutical and biotech investors by saying on Jan. 11, before his inauguration, that drug companies were "getting away with murder" on what they charged the government for medicine and that he would do something about it. Company executives, meanwhile, have tried to tread a careful line in defending their industry while expressing optimism that the United States would continue to reward scientific advances. "Regulations - great, streamlining the FDA, perhaps," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago said. "But if Trump is going to address his constituency, drug prices have to come down. So I think this is maybe a Pyrrhic victory.” (Additional reporting by Eric Beech, Ben Hirschler, John Miller, Chuck Mikolajczak, Rodrigo Campos, Susan Heavey and Caroline Humer; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Cynthia Osterman) Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next In Donald Trump’s White House, Female Staffers Must ‘Dress Like Women’ 2815 messages6%67%27% Get a $100 AT&T Visa® Reward Card DIRECTVSponsored Lady Gaga Remains Mysterious on Super Bowl Halftime Show Details 6 messages0%60%40% Trump Supporter Fired Over Twitter Exchange With Patton Oswalt 3997 messages5%60%35% #2 of 10 Most Popular News Galleries of 2016: 9/11: Then and now - 15 years later 1135 messages5%58%37% The New Face of Marijuana Investing MONEY MORNINGSponsored Former Giants Kicker Josh Brown Speaks Out After Domestic Abuse Allegations Quadruple Homicide of Washington Family Is ‘Not a Random Act,’ Police Say 152 messages3%68%29% N.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Welcome to President Trump’s New War on Drugs Posted on January 31, 2017 by Brad Hoppmann The news out of Washington keeps flooding out, and specifically news that’s being made straight from the Oval Office. In a meeting this morning with pharmaceutical industry executives, President Trump sent out a few new salvos in what might be described as a new “war on drugs.” This war isn’t about fighting the import of illegal drugs. Rather, it’s all about the pharmaceutical industry coming under fire from the president over the high cost of drug prices. Now, the industry is feeling the heat for where it makes its products, too. “I want you to manufacture in the United States,” President Donald Trump said to the group of pharmaceutical CEOs at the White House. This group included Robert A. Bradway, chairman and CEO of Amgen Inc. (AMGN), Joaquin Duato of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Merck (MRK) CEO Kenneth Frazier. That meeting also came with President Trump’s admonition on costs: “We have to get the prices way down.” Yet there is good news on this new war on drugs. Rather than it being a war waged against pharmaceutical companies, President Trump wants to frame the government as an ally in helping the industry reduce costs. To offer aid and assistance in this new drug war — or, more precisely, this new war on drug prices — the president said he plans to reduce regulations and taxes to encourage more domestic drug manufacturing. The president has yet to provide any specifics on how his administration would foster renewed drug manufacturing in the U.S. But the most-obvious way to “encourage” it also is likely to cause costs to go up. That obvious way is to impose what the president has called “very major” border taxes on companies with operations overseas. This would comport with some Republican congressional proposals designed to increase taxes on imported goods. Taxes on imports would likely only serve to boost the cost of drugs for consumers. But the administration hasn’t worked that out yet. What President Trump has done is appoint two seasoned pharma executives — the aforementioned Frazier of Merck, and Alex Gorsky of Johnson & Johnson — to a 28-member advisory council that’s tasked with expanding manufacturing in the U.S. Though I’m quite sure President Trump would like to engineer a reduction in drug costs as well as an expansion of pharmaceutical manufacturing in the U.S., these two goals will, I suspect, be difficult to achieve. While the pharmaceutical industry tries to work with the administration on reducing drug costs and increasing homegrown manufacturing, the industry has another front to deal with that has nothing to do with politics. *** That issue is the slew of drugs coming off-patent in 2017. In the case of Merck, the company has four big-selling drugs set to go off-patent in 2017. These include Invanz, Vytorin, Cancidas and Cubicin. Perhaps that helps explain why CEO Frazier is participating actively in ways to help the administration? Pfizer (PFE) is another big pharma firm with several very big drugs going off-patent. Somavert and Relpax are two of the company’s brands that will be off-patent this year. Yet by far the biggest seller is the company’s “little blue pill.” That’s right, Pfizer’s biggest drug, Viagra, is set to lose patent protection in 2017. Israeli generic pharma leader Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) is going to put out a generic version of the erectile dysfunction drug, and that will likely impact Pfizer’s bottom line. While Merck and Pfizer are the two biggest off-patent losers in 2017, they aren’t the only ones. Novartis (NVS) will lose Sandostatin LAR while Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) loses Reyatz. Both medications are respective billion-dollar products. Eli Lilly (LLY) also will suffer the loss of its Strattera, the ADHD treatment that brings in some $700 million per year. So, between patent losses — and the push for lower drug prices and more U.S. production — the pharmaceutical industry faces a lot of unknowns … as well as a lot of challenges … in 2017. Yet if the administration and Congress can make good on tax cuts and incentives for the industry, 2017 just might turn out to be a good year for the sector. *** If you want to sound off on this issue, or on any of the issues we cover in the Afternoon Edition, then simply leave me a comment on our website or send me an e-mail. *** Yesterday was the worst day for stocks in 2017. Today we were greeted with another triple-digit (-107, or 0.5%) Dow slide. This added to Monday’s 123-point drop, but the Industrials still logged a 0.5% gain for January. The January gains were bigger for the Nasdaq Composite (+4.3%) and the S&P 500 (+1.8%). Meanwhile gold’s 9% advance made this its best month since June. Weakness in the greenback and travel-ban uncertainty helped gold to rise. But neither factor did much for oil, which fell 1.7% during the first month of 2017. Elsewhere in the news … • The year’s first Fed meeting kicked off today. Traders are not expecting any rate hikes, after Janet Yellen telegraphed last month that the Fed is in “wait-and-see” mode. Traders are in the same mode — but this year, not only will they be awaiting tomorrow afternoon’s statement, but also Trump’s reaction to it. • Will that reaction come via Twitter (TWTR)? President Trump is tweeting from two accounts now, @POTUS and his @realDonaldTrump account. Shares gained 4% today. • 82% compliance: That’s how much OPEC is complying with its promised production cuts, according to a Reuters survey. The news lifted WTI crude 0.3%. • ExxonMobil (XOM) missed out on today’s oil gains. Shares fell 1.1% after the company’s EPS came in at 41 cents vs. 70 cents expected. Exxon took a $2 billion upstream asset impairment charge in Q4, which left it with $1.7 billion in net income (down from $2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter). • U.S. consumer confidence eased off its 15-year high. But survey respondents, while slightly more cautious, saw an uptick (from 3.3% to 5.9%) in their view of the jobs market. • A trifecta of misses on the earnings, revenue and guidance fronts sent Under Armour (UA) down 23.4%. CEO Kevin Plank says the “growth story is still intact” despite a 20% drop in footwear sales and 17% drop in apparel sales during the holiday Q4. • Pfizer (PFE) posted a Q4 profit today. It wasn’t a big one (47 cents per share), and it was 3 cents below estimates, but it beat last year’s quarterly loss. Several of its drugs will go off-patent this year, but it is hoping for approval of a new cancer drug along with approvals to expand three existing drugs’ uses. Shares gained 1.3%. • Apple (AAPL) returned to sales growth in its fiscal Q1. Shares dipped 0.3% during the day but shot 3% higher after-hours. EPS came in at $3.36 vs. $3.21 estimated thanks to surging iPhone 7 sales. Good luck and happy investing, Brad Hoppmann Publisher Uncommon Wisdom Daily Your thoughts on “Welcome to President Trump’s New War on Drugs” Jeff says: January 31, 2017 at 6:08 pm Brad, The best way to reduce the cost of drug prices is through tort reform. This can be done through: 1. Reform laws to require that there be a fee charged by the law firm whether they win or lose the lawsuit. 2.

Reply Chuck Burton says: January 31, 2017 at 7:04 pm Mr. Trump should be a little pleased by today’s announcement by the foreign company, Diageo, that it plans too brew it’s famous Guinness in a new brewery outside Baltimore. This would presumably reduce, at least, the need to import the stuff from Ireland – which likely won’t make the Irish fiscal authorities all that happy, of course. Reply John says: February 1, 2017 at 5:02 am If it really were a war on drugs, Trump would investigate just how effective many alternative treatments that can’t be patented are.

Drug prices are insane, and thats becasue ” the fix is in” with the FDA. In the 1990s a law was passed where Big Pharma paid fees to support the FDA. since then the FDA has been a rubber stamp for Big Pharma. I don’t believe that most of the drugs being prescribed are of any good at all( just look at the disclosures after the advertisement). Instead of using Natural remedies to cure disease, we must use the prescribed meds which are really non effectual and just designed to keep the medicine trade making billions. Since Obamacare, I have had to change my insurance company three times, as insurance companies are leaving the health care industry. I also got the letter from Social Security that my medical coverage would be increased by $14……nice. Trump should be helping natural homeopathic remedies….not Big Pharma. I have kept two diseases at bay….heart condition and diabetes…just by changing my diet and taking over the counter supplements. In both cases the dr wanted to put me on Rx drugs…..such is the way in the usa….I say Natural……not Rx…!!! Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and Visa Inc. (NYSE: V). We have seen the markets hit new highs so far in 2017, but they seem to be in the midst of a pullback at the moment as the Trump administration is kicking into gear. We included the consensus earnings estimates from Thomson Reuters and the stock price and trading history, as well as added some additional color on each. Merck is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings report before the markets open on Thursday. The consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters call for $0.89 in earnings per share (EPS) and $10.22 billion in revenue. The same period of last year reportedly had EPS of $0.93 and $10.21 billion in revenue. Comments from President Donald Trump regarding high U.S. drug prices were initially considered to be a headwind for Merck and other pharmaceutical houses at the beginning of the year. But after comments this week regarding speeding up the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, the health care sector saw a nice gain. At the beginning of January, the U.S. Senate also defeated an amendment to the budget bill that would have allowed a review federal policy preventing re-importation of prescription drugs into the United States. Shares of Merck were last seen at $61.80, with a consensus analyst price target of $68.21 and a 52-week trading range of $47.97 to $65.46. Visa is set to report its fiscal first-quarter financial results after the markets close on Thursday. Analysts are looking for $0.78 in EPS and revenue of $4.29 billion. In the same period of last year, Visa posted EPS of $0.69 and $3.56 billion in revenue. This company has a few new avenues open for it this year. Just this past summer, Visa initiated a deal with famed online payment provider PayPal. Together the companies will partner up, giving Visa customers a network online network for digital payments while also bringing more business to PayPal. But keep in mind they will face some stiff competition breaking into this market; Visa and PayPal are up against the likes of Google Wallet and Apple Pay. PayPal had a similar deal with Mastercard, which reported its results earlier this week. Unfortunately Mastercard earnings did not live up to the hype. Visa shares were trading at $82.31 on Wednesday. The 52-week range is $66.12 to $84.27, and the consensus price target is $95.45.

Johnson February 1 Follow @carolynyjohnson Merck chief executive Ken Frazier, left, talks with President Trump during a meeting with pharmaceutical industry leaders in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) As leaders from across the business world chimed in to speak against the temporary travel ban President Trump implemented last week on citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries and refugees, one industry that relies on immigrant labor stayed under the radar: big pharma. According to a 2014 study by researchers at George Mason University, immigrants made up 13 percent of the U.S. population in 2011, but constituted 17 percent of the pharmaceutical industry labor force. That reliance has only increased according to Justin Lowry, a postdoctoral researcher at George Mason's Institute for Immigration Research: An estimate using 2015 data shows that immigrants made up 23 percent of the pharma workforce. Lowry said the industry is “very heavily reliant” on foreign-born workers. And among those who work in research and development — the engine of discovery and innovation for the industry — immigrants made up one-third of the labor force, according to the 2014 report. Foreign-born scientists made up 43 percent of medical and life scientists, the study found. [Trump calls for lower drug prices, fewer regulations in meeting with pharmaceutical executives] “In general, intellectual endeavors in the U.S. -- education, research — they rely on immigrants,” Lowry said. “It’s important to have innovation, and innovation comes from diversity. A difference in perspective allows for a difference in approach.” (George Mason University Institute for Immigration Research) Yet in the run-up to a big meeting Tuesday morning with Trump, the pharmaceutical industry was muted compared with other big businesses responding to the ban. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the trade group that represents the industry and usually speaks on its behalf, said it didn't have a comment about the ban. Neither did Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. And those that did have a response to the ban often struck a neutral tone and focused on its employees. “We are working to fully understand the implications of the Executive Order on our business and our employees,” AstraZeneca said in a statement. “Upholding our steadfast commitment to associates of all nationalities and religions is core to our values as we work to address society's most pressing healthcare challenges,” a Novartis statement said, noting that to date there had been no disruption to Novartis employees as a result of the order. Leaders in the biotech industry, on the other hand, were more vocal. “The travel ban is causing confusion among several of my company's associates and I have been told by other biotech CEOs of similar responses across the industry,” Ron Cohen, a chief executive of Acorda Therapeutics, said in an email. “This is a difficult situation for scientists, doctors and other professionals whom we rely on to help invent and develop new treatments and cures for disease. If we restrict travel excessively, they will go elsewhere and their talents will enrich other countries.” [Judge says Aetna dropped out of some Obamacare markets to help win its merger fight] It's not necessarily surprising that pharmaceutical leaders didn't take a vocal public stand on Trump's policy ahead of such a high-profile meeting. The industry has been hammered by Trump and accused of “getting away with murder” on pricing. The trade group launched a major ad campaign last week aimed at changing its image after a year of blistering congressional hearings and news stories about rising drug prices. The industry has been trying to fend off any government intervention on pricing. After the meeting at the White House, Merck chief executive Kenneth Frazier answered a reporter's question about the ban. “We have employees from around the world; we have to get the best scientists, the best employees around the world, so having access to those employees and having an environment in our companies that stimulates diversity and inclusion is very important to us,” Frazier said. But the George Mason researchers said that the industry's competitive edge going forward may depend in large part on keeping and attracting its immigrant workforce for a reason none of those leaders brought up. Immigrants tend to come from countries that have fast-growing pharmaceutical markets — places where U.S. companies would like to sell drugs. In other words, if those immigrant workers are deterred, they could easily become part of the competition. “Given that the majority of immigrants within the pharmaceutical industry are from the world’s fastest growing pharmaceutical markets, the U.S. may benefit from the continued encouragement of immigration from those regions,” the authors said. “Failing to do so carries the risk that those individuals will use their skills and talents to build the pharmaceutical industries in the very countries that are emerging as the leading competitors to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.” (George Mason University Institute for Immigration Research) More from Wonkblog: To fight their negative image on prices, drug companies launch a major ad campaign that doesn’t mention them A single chart everybody needs to look at before Trump’s big fight over bringing back American jobs  High prices make once-neglected 'orphan' drugs a booming business Why Obamacare’s insurance marketplaces won’t necessarily collapse with a repeal business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address.

The president pointed out that competition in the drug market had dissipated, thanks to sluggish approval prices and an overbearing regulatory system. Trump vowed to lower the costs of prescription drugs in the country by increasing competition. He also said foreign countries should pay a fair share of drug development costs. "We're going to end global freeloading," he said. Trump told reporters that he would oppose roadblocks making it harder for smaller drug companies to compete with larger ones. “I’ll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing a product to a vibrantly competitive market,” he said. “That includes price fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what’s happening.” READ MORE: Trump tells biggest US automakers to bring production back to America Trump has also promised he would soon appoint a new head of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). “We have a fantastic person that I think I’ll be naming fairly soon who’s going to streamline the FDA and you’ll get your products either approved or not approved, but it’ll be a quick process,” he said. “It won’t take 15 years.” Read more Drug makers sued over insulin price-fixing According to Reuters, the pharma execs said after the meeting they were encouraged by Trump's focus on innovation, tax reform and the need for a more value-driven health care system.

MUST WATCH Trump sinks drug stocks 01:29 Story highlights Trump met with eight pharmaceutical company executives at the White House "We have no choice" but to limit regulations, the President said Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump issued a message Tuesday to pharmaceutical company executives akin to one he delivered to auto executives last week: bring your production back to the United States and the Trump administration will lower regulations for you. In a "pharma" meeting in the Oval Office, the President told executives from companies such as Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson that they have done a "terrific job over the years" but that prices for drugs must come down. "So you have to get your companies back here. We have to make products ... We have to get rid of a tremendous number of regulations," Trump said. "I know you have some problems where you cannot even think about opening up new plants. You can't get approval for the plant and then you can't get approval to make the drugs." Dems delay committee vote on Sessions "We have no choice," the President added, sitting at a table surrounded by aides, Vice President Mike Pence and eight pharmaceutical executives. "For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get prices way down, so that's what we're going to be talking about. We're also going to be streamlining the process so that from your standpoint so that when you have a drug you can actually get it approved -- if it works -- instead of waiting for many, many years." Read More Reading from a statement for a portion of the meeting, which was partially closed to the press, the President stressed that drug pricing has been astronomical in the United States -- a talking point that crosses party lines with support from progressive senators such as Bernie Sanders -- and that he wants to accelerate cures and accelerate US Food and Drug Administration drug approvals. The President said that he's been "disturbed" to see terminally ill patients who need a drug that the FDA has yet to approve. JUST WATCHED What auto workers expect from President Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What auto workers expect from President Trump 03:18 Much like his stance on taxing foreign-made cars, Trump said that there will be a trade policy that will "prioritize that foreign countries pay their fair share for US manufactured drugs so our drug companies have greater financial resources to accelerate development of new cures." Reiterating a favorite line of his, Trump said: "It's very unfair what other countries are doing to us," pointing to devaluation. "Look at what China is doing. You look at what Japan has done over the years. They play the money market, they play the devaluation market and we sit there like a bunch of dummies," he said. The President said he plans to announce someone "fantastic" to the FDA soon. Robert Bradway, chairman and CEO of Amgen, said that he shared a desire to eliminate and eradicate disease, noting the company is adding 1,600 jobs. The CEO of Eli Lilly, based in Pence's home state of Indiana, said to the President that "some the policies you've come out and suggested could help us do more ... and tax deregulation, is a thing that could really help us expand." Merck & Co CEO Kenneth Frazier spoke with reporters by the West Wing of the White House after the meeting concluded. "The President is very much focused on how we can actually do better for patients, giving them more choice, helping them to deal with the medical bills that they have in a way that also stimulates innovation," he said. When asked if he's more hopeful for this administration than he was of the last, Frazier said: "I think there is a real opportunity if we actually work on all those things." Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, issued a joint statement shortly after the meeting saying they hope Trump "really" takes on the pharmaceutical industry. The pair said they will introduced measures to lower prescription drug prices, a cornerstone of Sanders' presidential campaign. Part of the proposal would allow Medicare to negotiate with drugmakers for lower prices, according to the news release. Content by LendingTree Rates now at 3.2% APR (15 Yr Fixed). Do you qualify?

(Photo: Gary Cosby Jr., AP) A Senate hearing on reducing regulations became a forum Wednesday for business leaders to criticize President Trump’s executive order suspending travelers from seven countries from entering the U.S. “We’ve sent a message to the world which is very strong that the welcome mat is being pulled away,” Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, told the Senate Commerce Committee. GE, Merck, Allergan, Ford and Microsoft each issued statements supporting diversity and offering legal assistance to workers in the wake of the Jan. 27 order that barred citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country, said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, a member of the committee. “They are worried about their ability to attract new talent going forward,” Schatz said. But the committee chairman, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said Trump was trying to bolster security after inheriting a humanitarian crisis in the Middle East made worse, he said, by President Obama's inaction. "The ability of properly credentialed international visitors to come and go is important to our economy, including the tech sector," Thune said. "Some tech companies may be getting pressured to speak out and I suspect a short period of time will allow the administration to look at security concerns and move past these travel interruptions.” USA TODAY USA TODAY Trump's order, which is being challenged in federal court, blocks arrivals from six of the countries for 90 days and from Syria indefinitely. The administration said its goal was to pause arrivals so that travel security it described as woefully inadequate could be reviewed and tightened. But airports erupted in chaos as immigration officials detained travelers. Protesters descended on airports across the country. "This is not a travel ban, this is a temporary pause that allows us to better review the existing refugee and visa vetting system," John Kelly, secretary of Homeland Security, told reporters Tuesday. "This way we can ensure the system is doing what it is designed to do, which is protect the American people." Schatz asked a vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers why the group hadn’t taken a position on the travel order. “This is the elephant in the room when it comes to America’s business reputation, when it comes to our core values, when it comes to your members, that it’s odd to me that you either haven’t taken a position or don’t yet want to articulate it,” Schatz said. Rosario Palmieri, NAM’s vice president of labor, legal and regulatory policy, said he would get a reply for the senator. Schatz then asked Shapiro whether the order was good for business.’ “No it is not, sir,” Shapiro said. “America’s strategy for years has been to attract the best and the brightest.” 94 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jWA6fo NEVER MISS OUT Tech Be the earliest adopter.

Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 01, 2017 at 12:53 PM, updated February 01, 2017 at 4:08 PM comments WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump, who recently said the drug industry was "getting away with murder," told pharmaceutical executives Tuesday that he wanted them to lower prices and move manufacturing back to the U.S. Trump met at the White House Tuesday with seven executives representing the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, including those from New Jersey-based companies Johnson & Johnson, Celgene Corp. and Merck & Co. "You folks have done a terrific job over the years, but we have to get prices down for a lot of reasons," Trump told the executives. "For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get the prices way down, so that's what we're going to be talking about." Drug firms back birth control opponents The tone was different than Trump's comments at his January press conference when he talked about the power of the drug industry. Companies selling drugs and other health products spent $244 million to lobby last year, more than any other industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group. "Our drug industry has been disastrous," Trump said in January. "They're leaving left and right. They supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent. And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they're getting away with murder." This time, he promised to streamline the process for approving drugs and cut regulations on the industry. "I know you have some problems where you cannot even think about opening up new plants and then you can't get approval for the plant and then you can't get approval to make the drug," Trump said. He also asked the companies to make their products in the U.S. rather than overseas. "We have to get lower prices, we have to get even better innovation and I want you to move your companies back into the United States," he said. "We're going to be lowering taxes, we're going to be getting rid of regulations that are unnecessary." After leaving the White House, Merck chief executive Kenneth C. Frazier called the meeting with Trump a "great conversation" and Celgene executive chairman Robert J. Hugin said, "These changes are going to be great for the country." Hugin was one of the few major backers of Gov. Chris Christie's presidential campaign to follow his lead and support Trump. Hugin, who gave $2,700 to Christie and $250,000 to his aligned America Leads super political action committee, then contributed the maximum $5,400 to Trump's primary and general election campaigns.

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks on Monday, Jan. 30, 2017 before signing an executive order surrounded by small business leaders in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C. (Andrew Harrer / TNS) Anna EdneyBloomberg President Donald Trump told drugmakers at a White House meeting Tuesday they were charging too much and promised to get better bargains for government health programs, in addition to finding ways to get new medicines to market faster. "The pricing has been astronomical," Trump said to chief executives of some of the world's biggest drugmakers, who came to Washington after his criticism of the industry earlier this month sent drug and biotechnology stocks plunging. "You folks have done a very great job over the years but we have to get the prices down." Trump has threatened to have the government negotiate prices directly with the industry on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid, which are some of the world's biggest purchasers of health-care products and services and cover tens of millions of Americans. "Competition is key to lowering drug prices," the president said. At the same time, Trump promised to slash regulations, get new treatments to market faster at the Food and Drug Administration, and increase international competition. "We're going to streamline FDA; we have a fantastic person" that will be announced to lead the agency soon, Trump said. He also promised to cut taxes on business and lure companies back to the U.S. When Trump tweets and stocks fall, puppies win Katie Mettler Before he even took the oath of office, President Donald Trump and his tweets were making the markets move.

Before he even took the oath of office, President Donald Trump and his tweets were making the markets move. Stocks dipped for Boeing when Trump, as president-elect, tweeted about the cost for the company to build Air Force One, and they slumped again for Lockheed Martin when he called the expenses... (Katie Mettler) Investors responded positively to those comments, and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up 1 percent at 10:07 a.m. in New York, while the Standard and Poor's 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology & Life Sciences Index rose 0.8 percent. At the Tuesday meeting was Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America CEO Stephen Ubl, Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier, Eli Lilly & Co. CEO Dave Ricks, Celgene Corp. Chairman Bob Hugin and others. They embraced Trump's calls for lower taxes and fewer regulations. "Some of the policies you've come out and suggested I think can help us do more -- tax, regulations," Lilly's Ricks said at the session. Also at Tuesday's White House meeting were Novartis AG CEO Joe Jimenez, Johnson & Johnson Worldwide Chairman of Pharmaceuticals Joaquin Duato and Amgen Inc. CEO Bob Bradway.

Memoli Whenever President Trump sensed that he was losing Republican support during the 2016 campaign, he often responded with just two words: Supreme Court.

Whenever President Trump sensed that he was losing Republican support during the 2016 campaign, he often responded with just two words: Supreme Court. Perhaps no other cause motivates the Republican coalition as does preserving the balance of the high court. Trump has promised to announce Tuesday... (Michael A. Memoli) Frazier said the industry was ready to work with Trump. "I think all these things come together to create a system that's good for innovation, that's good for jobs" and for patients, he told reporters outside the White House after the meeting. Bradway promised to add 1,600 jobs at Amgen, Sean Spicer, Trump's spokesman, said in a tweet after the meeting. The drugmaker had previously been cutting jobs, after announcing in 2014 that it would eliminate as many as 2,900 positions. The company didn't respond to a request for details about the job additions. At a briefing last week, Trump's press secretary Spicer said that lowering drug prices is going to be one of the key parts of reforming health care. The gathering with drug CEOs came after Trump said on Jan. 12 that the industry was "getting away with murder" and promised to act on drug prices. Since then, drugmakers have turned up their lobbying efforts with Congress as a potentially friendlier force that might counter Trump. Fireworks at the Justice Department: Trump fires acting Attorney General Sally Yates Editorial Board President Donald Trump, the former TV reality star, has never said "You're fired" like this. His decision Monday night to oust acting Attorney General Sally Yates heightens the drama over his deplorable executive action on immigration. Trump's move is petulant and unsettling, especially for Americans... President Donald Trump, the former TV reality star, has never said "You're fired" like this. His decision Monday night to oust acting Attorney General Sally Yates heightens the drama over his deplorable executive action on immigration. Trump's move is petulant and unsettling, especially for Americans... (Editorial Board) They've been meeting with Republican and Democratic members of Congress, including those in leadership, to make their case for more measured proposals than Trump's, according to Ron Cohen, chairman of the board at the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a Washington lobby group for drugmakers. "Bidding" is essentially akin to drug companies' greatest fear: handing Medicare the power to negotiate prices. They've also met with people in the Trump administration, Cohen, chief executive officer of Acorda Therapeutics Inc., said in a telephone interview before the drug CEOs met with Trump. The drug industry is one of Washington's most powerful, and each year spends hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying, in addition to being one of the biggest donors to political campaigns, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. PhRMA, the lobby group, also launched an image makeover Jan. 23 that will feature advertising and public affairs events that focus on the value of its products. Republicans generally have not backed proposals that require more government involvement and instead have aligned themselves with ideas that promote free-market principles. In 2009, even in the face of a Democratic president and Congress, pharmaceutical companies were able to dodge Medicare price negotiation, partly by agreeing to commit $80 billion to help fund provision of the Affordable Care Act. Trump shocked the industry at his Jan. 12 news conference, when he said that "pharma has a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there is very little bidding. We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly and we're going to save billions of dollars." After his remarks, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology & Life Sciences Index both fell by the most in about three months. It's not clear how much support Trump has from key Republicans for the harshest drug price policies, which have typically been opposed by conservatives. "We'll look at the issues. I'm still keeping an open mind," said Rep. Tom Marino of Pennsylvania, a Republican and an early congressional backer of Trump. He said that drug prices will be among the topics in an as-yet-unscheduled hearing of the Judiciary subcommittee on regulatory reform that he chairs. Other Republicans may not be so willing. The new chairman of the largest bloc of House conservatives said last week that he has "concerns" over Trump's stated plans to bargain with pharmaceutical companies over Medicare drug prices. "I would be cautious in affirming that is the best approach to take," said Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina, in a meeting with a group of reporters. The RSC had about 170 members last session -- and its leaders expect to announce their membership number for this session in early March. Trump's own nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, wouldn't commit to bidding last week when asked about the topic at a Senate Finance hearing on his nomination. "We're committed to making certain that drug prices are able to be afforded by individuals," Price told senators at the hearing. The size of the savings negotiation could produce for taxpayers is the subject of fierce debate, ranging from modest to as much as $16 billion a year. Walker indicated he isn't comfortable with Trump being personally involved in specific policy proposals that could become part of a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. "I would have some concerns as far as the commander-in-chief beginning to negotiate all these different aspects of it," Walker said. Bloomberg's Billy House, Jared S. Hopkins and Doni Bloomfield contributed.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Wednesday upgraded Amgen to buy from neutral, a day after President Donald Trump spoke with a host of pharmaceutical company chief executives on drug pricing and the future of the industry. During the meeting, Amgen CEO Robert Bradway told Trump the biotech giant is planning to add 1,600 jobs soon. Bank of America didn't specifically comment on the pharma gathering, but referenced the likelihood for Trump's policies to benefit Amgen. "In light of Trump's proposal on cash repatriation, we believe AMGN could repatriate a significant portion of its $34.8B cash held overseas," equity analyst Ying Huang wrote in a research note. "The potential share buyback, dividend payment and acquisitions associated with the cash repatriation can further boost stock performance, in our view."

Trump brought in the pop quiz: cameras and the press. Time to talk about your company on TV. These guys all did their homework and passed with flying colors. For future CEOs, here are the CliffsNotes on how to pass a White House jobs summit with Trump, who says he will be "the greatest jobs president" of all time. Start with stating: 1) How many employees you have in the United States 2) That you're hiring in America or 3) You have a long history in the United States "We've been in this country for 125 years. We employ about 23,000 Americans," Kenneth Frazier, CEO of Merck (MRK), told Trump, enunciating the "23,000" part. "We have tremendous numbers of high-paying, high skill jobs." "Our global headquarters is up near Boston...[we] employ about 20,000," emphasized Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Novartis (NVS). (Novartis is actually headquartered in Switzerland. The company clarified that the CEO was referring to its research headquarters here) "140 years we've been in Indiana and in Indianapolis, and that's where we still make a lot of our products," David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly (LLY), told Trump. I'm "representing a company that employs directly about 50,000 people in the U.S.," Joaquin Duato, chairman of pharmaceuticals giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), said as cameras clicked. Second, drop in the word "manufacturing." "We're hiring manufacturing jobs as I speak," Ricks of Eli Lilly, stressed to the president. "We have about 13 manufacturing sites here in the U.S.," Jimenez noted at the conference table. Of Johnson & Johnson's 50,000 American employees, "most of them [are] in manufacturing," Duato said. Third, sprinkle in stuff that business leaders really want Trump to do: Cut taxes and regulations. "One of things that can help us is a lower tax rate," Jimenez of Novartis said. "We're just delighted to be here this morning to talk about reducing regulation, lowering taxes," Steve Ubl, CEO of PhRMA, told the president. "Tax and deregulation -- those are things that could really help us expand operations," Ricks concluded. Just remember that no matter what, Trump may talk of things you might not want to hear. "The pricing (of drugs) has been astronomical for our country...we have to get the prices down," Trump said at the start of the meeting. We digress. Back to the CliffsNotes. Fourth, throw in cool buzzwords like "innovation" and "R&D" for research and development. "We're confident about the outlook for innovation in this country," Robert Bradway, CEO of Amgen (AMGN), told Trump. We have "one of the biggest investments in R&D," Duanto said. "The industry invests about $70 billion in R&D in the United States, which is more than any other industry," Ubl of PhRMA added. Fifth: The icing on the cake -- We're bringing jobs back! "I'm proud to say we'll be adding 1,600 jobs at Amgen this year," Bradway noted. "In fact, we're bringing manufacturing back for our cancer drug, you may have heard..." Frazier of Merck said. Trump responded "that's very good," then shook Frazier's hand.

However, this tremendous growth is largely down to higher prices for medicines, a trend that has been criticized by some circles.

At the end of the 1990s, the sector was responsible for 2% of Swiss gross domestic product (GDP). This now stands at around 4%.

Export growth increasingly depends on pharmaceuticals

Feb 1, 2017 - 16:59

Swiss exports hit a record CHF210 billion ($211 billion) last year and the pharmaceutical sector was one of the big drivers. However, this tremendous growth is largely down to higher prices for medicines, a trend that has been criticized by some circles.

While watchmakers, the machine-tool industry and tourism officials continue to struggle, the Swiss pharma industry appears to be leading the way, seemingly unaffected by the strong Swiss franc and global economic turbulence.

Despite a slowdown last year, the 250 pharma businesses that make up the sector in Switzerland boasted record figures, exporting over CHF80 billion worth of drugs and other products – a 15% increase compared to the previous year.

The pharma industry, which has been present in Switzerland for almost 150 years, now represents almost 40% of the total value of all Swiss exports. If combined with the chemicals industry, together they are responsible for almost one out of every two Swiss francs earned abroad.

Switzerland is therefore increasingly dependent on multinationals like Novartis, Roche and Merck Serono, their industrial activities and the jobs they provide.

Today, the sector employs over 40,000 people in Switzerland, or up to 180,000 if you also count indirect jobs, according to a survey by the BAKBasel research institute.


Growth has been spectacular. At the end of the 1990s, the sector was responsible for 2% of Swiss gross domestic product (GDP). This now stands at around 4%.


This growth is explained by stronger demand for medicines from emerging countries, an aging population, more chronic diseases but also much higher prices for certain medicines.


Figures obtained by swissinfo.ch from the Federal Customs Administration show that between 2015 and 2016, the real increase in exports for the chemicals and pharma sectors was actually only 1.8%. The growth in exports can be explained mainly by an average price increase for drugs of 9.5%.


This rise worries some health experts.


“The increase in medicine prices is not only a problem for emerging and developing countries,” said Patrick Durisch, in charge of health issues at the Swiss non-governmental organization, Public Eye. “In Europe and in Switzerland some patients no longer benefit from certain treatments as they are too expensive. In the long run, these higher costs will endanger our social security and health insurance systems.”

The recent attempt by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs to stop the Colombian Health Ministry from declaring Glivec – a Novartis cancer drug – of so-called public interest [allowing health regulators to examine the case and set a new, lower price for the drug], illustrates this situation perfectly,” said Durisch.


However, the pharma industry argues that their high prices, which can attain several thousand dollars for a single treatment, are justified on account of the rising cost of research, and longer production deadlines and procedures to market drugs, as well as competition from generic drugs.

Novartis vs Roche - 2016 figures

In 2016, Novartis sales were $48.52 billion (CHF48.19 billion) and net income was CHF6.7 billion.

At Roche, net sales in 2016 grew 4% in constant currencies to CHF50.6 billion. Net profit was CHF9.7 billion.

Trump and the pharma industry


At a meeting with pharmaceutical executives on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump, urged them to manufacture more of their drugs in the United States and cut prices, while vowing to speed approval of new medicines and ease regulation.


Trump told them the government was paying "astronomical" prices for medicines in its health programmes for older, disabled and poor people.


In attendance were top executives at Merck & Co, Johnson & Celgene, Eli Lilly & Co, Amgen and Novartis, as well as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) lobbying group.

Lower prices


On Wednesday the Swiss government announced that had adopted new rules to control the prices of medicines reimbursed by health insurance schemes.


The government said CHF240 million would be saved over the next three years thanks to cheaper drugs. However, this target is much lower than a similar initiative for the 2012-2014 period, when the Federal Health Office ordered lower prices on 1,500 products thus saving CHF600 million.


The pharma industry successfully challenged the federal authorities’ method of calculation and the periodic re-evaluation of prices was suspended. In the future, this calculation should take account of cost benefits compared to other drugs and not just price comparisons with abroad.  × Related Stories Mixed picture Record Swiss exports despite drooping watch sales Swiss exports rose to record levels last year as the franc stabilised against other currencies.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 01, 2017 11:09am   Comments Share: Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) has managed to turn in some solid revenue gains in the last four reporting periods, as its ad revenues have grown at rates of 57% and above since Q4 2015, according to company reports. Might the social-media juggernaut have done it again in the last quarter? And if so, is that kind of growth sustainable? Investors are slated to find out when FB earnings come out after the market closes today. Then, on docket for Thursday pre-market, Merck (NYSE: MRK) opens the books on its Q4 results, with some analysts keen to hear more about Keytruda and other drugs in its pipeline. What’s Been Driving FB Revenues? There are a lot of moving parts with FB that go beyond the eponymous social-media site, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Oculus, into which some analysts say they want more insight. Other analysts say they’ll be looking for growth in user numbers and what they call “engagement,” or how much time people are devoting to their FB page. But it’s FB’s mobile advertising revenue, which cuts across other units beyond the Facebook site, that has carried the bulk of its top line revenue. In its Q3 release, FB reported that total ad revenues surged 59% on a year-over-year basis, which fed a 166% jump in net income. Mobile ad revenues contributed some 84% of the $6.81 billion in total advertising dollars it collected, according to the company’s financial statements. But on the Q3 conference call, David Wehner, chief financial officer, warned that such high double-digit year-over-year gains in ad revenue might be tough to scale, since Q4 2015 was such a strong quarter. He also cautioned about ad revenue gains into 2017, which he expects will “come down meaningfully” because they were being fueled by what’s called “ad load.” Ad load is the number of ads you see popping up on your Facebook page in between posts. While FB has been priming that pump for many quarters, Wehner has said in the last two conference calls that there is a point of supply-and-demand that will have to slow down considerably. If it doesn’t, he said, Facebook users might see more ads on their pages than posts. He says ad load will be less of a factor in the second half of this year. Still, some analysts are betting that FB could beat Q4 expectations despite those remarks. Digital data researcher eMarketer, for example, is forecasting FB ad revenue will reach $33.76 billion in 2017, nearly double the $17.08 billion in ad revenue it booked in 2015.   What might drive that besides ad load? Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said FB’s next aim is to put video first across all applications. “People are creating and sharing more video, and we think it's pretty clear that video is only going to become more important,” he said on the Q3 conference call. “So that's why we're prioritizing putting video first across our family of apps and taking steps to make it even easier for people to express themselves in richer ways.” On Wall Street, analysts reporting to third parties have a Q4 consensus earnings estimate of $1.34 a share, up from $0.79 per share in the year-ago period, according to the Earnings Analysis tab on the thinkorswim platform from TD Ameritrade. Revenue is projected to jump to $8.47 billion from $5.84 billion a year ago. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 4.6% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. Calls have been active at the weekly 130 and 135 strikes while put activity is noted at the weekly 129 and 125 strikes. The implied volatility sits just above the midpoint at the 55th percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.) Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. MRK’s Drug Pricing Reveal As with its big-pharma competitors, some analysts following MRK say that, beyond the earnings results, they will be interested in the company’s comments on drug pricing and tax policies, two big issues on the industry’s plate. Last week, MRK posted seven years of pricing information to its web site. The upshot, according to a Reuters article, is that, in every year after 2010, MRK’s price increases, over the entire drug portfolio, was more than 9%. Some analysts also say they hope to hear more insight about the meeting between big pharma executives and President Trump on Tuesday. MRK Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier was at the table, and he told reporters afterward that he thought there was “real opportunity” to work on how to give patients better choices, and to help them to deal with their medical bills. As for MRKs drug portfolio in Q4, some analysts say they will be looking for more information on how its cancer drug Keytruda, what many consider its key new revenue growth driver, has performed on patients. Keytruda, which is aimed at helping the immune system attack tumors, lists for about $150,000 per treatment, according to Reuters. On Wall Street, analysts reporting to third parties have a Q4 consensus earnings estimate of $0.88 a share, down from $0.93 in the year-ago period, according to the Earnings Analysis tab on the thinkorswim® platform. Revenue is projected at $10.19 billion, slightly lower than the $10.21 billion reported a year ago. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of just under 2% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. Calls have been active at the weekly 62 and 62.5 strikes while puts have been active at the 60.5 strike. The implied volatility is at the 27th percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.) Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 01, 2017 10:26am   Comments Share: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) unleashed a zinger of an earnings report late Tuesday that could help set the tone today, especially in the info tech sector. Stock futures tipped higher before the open as traders digested the AAPL results and awaited the wrap-up of this week’s Fed meeting. The iPhone maker posted fiscal Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $3.36, compared with Wall Street analysts’ consensus of $3.22. Revenue easily topped estimates, as well. Strong iPhone sales grabbed the headlines and helped boost revenue. AAPL sold more than 78 million iPhones, above Wall Street estimates. Remember, those sales occurred during the holiday shopping quarter, meaning AAPL’s products remained popular as people selected gifts for themselves and others. AAPL’s results also included a full quarter from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which had been on the market only a few weeks in Q4. Before Q1, iPhone sales had been trending down, so perhaps the new models helped revive consumer demand. AAPL shares have climbed to their highest levels since mid-2015 in pre-market trade, rising more than 4%. The earnings action is about halfway over, but far from complete; and this is a big week, with almost 100 of the S&P 500 reporting. This afternoon brings results from Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), with tomorrow morning highlighted by Merck (NYSE: MRK). Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Chipotle (NYSE: CMG) come tomorrow afternoon. Earnings have had their ups and downs so far; let’s face it. Some of the big multinationals seem to be struggling, in part due to the strong dollar. And earnings yesterday from United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) and Under Armour (NYSE: UAA) just plain disappointed. Still, things continue to point mostly in the right direction, with some key companies surpassing expectations. AAPL is the latest among them. The biotech sector roared back Tuesday, posting 3% gains amid optimism that the new Trump administration might light a fire under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Though Trump’s complaints about high drug prices have pressured biotech at times, investors focused on the positive Tuesday when Trump said he wanted to speed up FDA drug reviews. The FDA review process has long been a complaint among biotechs and the pharma industry in general. The strength in biotech led to health sector gains of more than 1.4% Tuesday. Later today, investors will get the latest word on how the Fed views the economic landscape as its two-day meeting ends. Chances of a rate hike appear slim. There’s no press conference, but investors likely will probe the Fed’s statement for any discussion about the inflation and growth picture. This meeting comes amid plenty of policy turbulence in Washington and in the heart of earnings, but it’s never a good idea to forget about the Fed. We’ll see what Yellen and company have to say. And besides earnings and the Fed, there’s no shortage of data today, with auto and truck sales, construction spending, and the ISM Index all on tap. Employment data from ADP this morning showed the private sector adding a robust 246,000 jobs in January, well above expectations. On the technical front, it’s interesting to see how the S&P 500 Index (SPX), despite four-consecutive lower closes, continues to show strength. Each of the last two days, the SPX has rallied back toward the end of the day and posted a close more than 11 points above its intraday low. And on both days, the close has been above key support at the 2275 level. Buying interest seems to come in after the index falls below 2270. We’ll see if that pattern continues to hold. For now, keep an eye on the 2275 level, which still marks support just below the market. Economic Data Mixed So Far; Waiting for Auto Sales Tuesday’s economic numbers were all over the map, with the housing sector continuing to show strength even as manufacturing and consumer confidence failed to achieve Wall Street’s rather lofty aspirations. On the plus side, the S&P Case Shiller Home Price Index rose 5.3% in December, beating analysts’ estimates for about a 5% increase. The housing market still looks pretty hot.  But Chicago PMI at 50.3 came in well below the consensus expectations for 55, and indicated just the smallest signs of growth. Remember, any number above 50 in PMI indicates economic expansion. New orders, which fell below the expansion/contraction line, accounted for much of the weakness. The PMI data, along with last week’s tepid Q4 gross domestic product (GDP) report, could have some economists re-thinking the strength of the economy. Today’s auto and truck sales, ISM index, and construction spending data may provide additional perspective on the broader economic picture. Building Up Speaking of construction spending, it’s been up nine of the last 11 months going into today’s report for December, and November’s 0.9% rise was the best result in some time. The uptick in November was led by increases for both private spending (+1%) and public spending (+0.8%). But Briefing.com’s consensus for December is just 0.2%, the lowest since September. The new administration has promised to emphasize infrastructure going forward, so it could be interesting to see how that affects this particular data point in months to come. Hike! Many Americans probably look forward to sitting in their favorite chair or visiting their local watering hole to take in the big game Sunday. Could the final score affect the markets? Logically, of course not, but it’s fun to look back in history and see how the market performed afterward, even though past isn’t prologue. One theory posits that the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) tends to have a down year when AFC teams win the game. While there’s no science backing this up, the DJIA has fallen 80% of the time in AFC victory years since 1967, according to research firm CFRA.

Over a White House meeting late on Tuesday (31 January) with senior executives from the sector, including the bosses of Eli Lilly, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis and Amgen, Trump said: "US drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country but the pricing has been astronomical; we have to do better. "We have to get even better innovation, and I want you [industry chiefs] to move your companies back to the US." In order to facilitate this, Trump vowed to introduce tax cuts, speed up the approval process of new medicines by the country's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and cut red tape. "We will be lowering taxes big league. We're going to be getting rid of regulations that are unnecessary – big league," the president said. Industry lobby group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which also sent representative to the talks, described the dialogue as "constructive" and "encouraging". "We believe if these policies are enacted, it will translate to up to 350,000 new jobs over the next 10 years as a result of growth in the biopharmaceutical industry," added Stephen Ubl, chief executive of PhRMA. Trump's comments sparked a rally in pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks on Wall Street. Shares in Eli Lilly (+3.12%), Merck (+0.91%), Amgen (+1.46%), Novartis (+2.24%) and Johnson & Johnson (+0.11%) headed higher on Wall Street, after details of the meeting emerged. Nasdaq Biotech Index rose 3% while the S&P 500 healthcare index rose 1.4%.

George Budwell (TMFGBudwell) Feb 1, 2017 at 8:06AM If ultra-high-risk, high-reward biotech stocks are your thing, then Celldex Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CLDX) is probably on your radar right now. This beaten-down biotech stock, after all, could blast northward in a hurry if its experimental triple-negative breast cancer medicine, glembatumumab vedotin, hits the mark in its ongoing pivotal trial.  Image source: Getty Images. Even so, Celldex's upside potential actually pales in comparison to other downtrodden cancer specialists like Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN) and Geron Corp. (NASDAQ:GERN). Let's dig deeper to find out why.   Agenus' paltry market cap is at odds with its broad immuno-oncology pipeline Agenus is a small-cap biotech that's developing both vaccines and biologic drugs aimed at treating cancer. While the recent regulatory filing of its shingles vaccine candidate -- which is being co-developed with GlaxoSmithKline -- is certainly an important value-driver in its own right, the real prize, at least from a commercial standpoint, is undoubtedly the company's broad anti-cancer pipeline composed mostly of checkpoint antibodies.  The backstory is that the breakout successes of Bristol-Myers Squibb's and Merck's checkpoint inhibitors, Opdivo and Keytruda, respectively, have essentially triggered an arms race within the pharma industry over the last few years. As a result, most major biopharmas now have their own checkpoint antibodies in development with the goal of carving out a profitable niche within the high-growth immuno-oncology (I-O) landscape. Agenus, for its part, is rather unique in this regard because it's among the few small-cap companies that decided to dive headfirst into the checkpoint inhibitor space, despite the stiff competition from nearly every big pharma at this point.  The good news is that Agenus' I-O pipeline was compelling enough to attract the interest of both Merck and Incyte, with both of these bigger names agreeing to sign licensing deals with the biotech to develop anti-cancer checkpoint antibodies. Most importantly, though, these collaborations, along with Agenus' own internal efforts, have already led to the successful launch of three Phase 1 trials and a number of pre-clinical studies, inching the company closer to the all-important goal of becoming a cash-flow-positive entity: Image source: Agenus Investor Presentation. Keeping with this theme, Agenus appears to be about three to four years from a possible regulatory filing based on the typical developmental time frame required for checkpoint inhibitors in general. Granted, the market could be near its saturation point by then, but Agenus doesn't exactly need a blockbuster I-O product to create enormous value for its shareholders. After all, the biotech's present market cap of $356 million implies that even a so-called "me too" medicine, or a drug that isn't well-differentiated from its peers in terms of efficacy or safety, would still be a major win for its shareholders. What's most intriguing about checkpoint inhibitors is that they have already proven themselves to be unusually powerful anti-cancer agents, and they have more often than not hit the mark in clinical trials. So this tiny biotech seems to have a better-than-average chance of actually transforming into a full-fledged cancer drugmaker within a few short years, giving it a favorable risk-to-reward profile.    The fate of Geron's first-in-class telomerase inhibitor could soon be clear Geron's stock has basically been in a holding pattern ever since the first internal data reviews of its blood cancer drug, imetelstat, were conducted by the biotech's partner, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), last September.(NYSE:JNJ) The basic story is that Johnson & Johnson, through its biotech subsidiary Janssen, is presently assessing imetelstat's ability to generate disease-modifying responses in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) -- two rare but deadly types of hematological malignancies. Unfortunately, the drug's ongoing trials for these initial indications have yet to produce the kind of breakout results investors and patients were hoping for following the promising pilot studies that initially sparked J&J's interest.  In fact, imetelstat's mid-stage myelofibrosis study appears to be hanging on by a thread at this point after the lower-dose arm failed to produce a compelling efficacy signal, and the higher-dose arm was closed to new patient enrollment thanks to an insufficient number of patients meeting the protocol-defined interim criteria at 12 weeks. While neither J&J nor Geron has provided much in the way of details about imetelstat's ongoing clinical trials, the companies have outlined imetelstat's projected developmental pathway moving forward. The short version is that Janssen is scheduled to perform a second internal data review for both studies in the second quarter of 2017. And this upcoming data review should be the pivotal event that determines whether J&J will sally forth with imetelstat's clinical program or terminate its partnership with Geron altogether. If J&J hits the eject button, then Geron's stock will almost certainly collapse, as the company has no other clinical assets. The bright side is that blood cancer drugs -- even minor ones -- fetch ginormous premiums in buyout scenarios. Moreover, J&J will likely take Geron off the market immediately if imetelstat starts to look like a viable drug candidate, especially after losing its bid to acquire the remaining commercial rights to Imbruvica.  In all, Geron's risk profile is not for the faint of heart, but it could also garner a jaw-dropping premium as J&J's next oncology acquisition -- or, alternatively, generate outstanding gains for investors as a stand-alone cancer specialist, depending on imetelstat's clinical progress.  George Budwell has no position in any stocks mentioned.

UMBC student photographs site of each 2016 Baltimore homicide in 'Stains on the Sidewalk' News Maryland Politics Maryland Politics blog Trump calls drug pricing 'astronomical' and promises changes Donald Trump Andrew Harrer / TNS U.S. President Donald Trump speaks on Monday, Jan. 30, 2017 before signing an executive order surrounded by small business leaders in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks on Monday, Jan. 30, 2017 before signing an executive order surrounded by small business leaders in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C. (Andrew Harrer / TNS) Anna EdneyBloomberg President Donald Trump told drugmakers at a White House meeting Tuesday they were charging too much and promised to get better bargains for government health programs, in addition to finding ways to get new medicines to market faster. "The pricing has been astronomical," Trump said to chief executives of some of the world's biggest drugmakers, who came to Washington after his criticism of the industry earlier this month sent drug and biotechnology stocks plunging. "You folks have done a very great job over the years but we have to get the prices down." Trump has threatened to have the government negotiate prices directly with the industry on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid, which are some of the world's biggest purchasers of health-care products and services and cover tens of millions of Americans. "Competition is key to lowering drug prices," the president said. At the same time, Trump promised to slash regulations, get new treatments to market faster at the Food and Drug Administration, and increase international competition. "We're going to streamline FDA; we have a fantastic person" that will be announced to lead the agency soon, Trump said. He also promised to cut taxes on business and lure companies back to the U.S. When Trump tweets and stocks fall, puppies win Katie Mettler Before he even took the oath of office, President Donald Trump and his tweets were making the markets move.

Before he even took the oath of office, President Donald Trump and his tweets were making the markets move. Stocks dipped for Boeing when Trump, as president-elect, tweeted about the cost for the company to build Air Force One, and they slumped again for Lockheed Martin when he called the expenses... (Katie Mettler) Investors responded positively to those comments, and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up 1 percent at 10:07 a.m. in New York, while the Standard and Poor's 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology & Life Sciences Index rose 0.8 percent. At the Tuesday meeting was Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America CEO Stephen Ubl, Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier, Eli Lilly & Co. CEO Dave Ricks, Celgene Corp. Chairman Bob Hugin and others. They embraced Trump's calls for lower taxes and fewer regulations. "Some of the policies you've come out and suggested I think can help us do more -- tax, regulations," Lilly's Ricks said at the session. Also at Tuesday's White House meeting were Novartis AG CEO Joe Jimenez, Johnson & Johnson Worldwide Chairman of Pharmaceuticals Joaquin Duato and Amgen Inc. CEO Bob Bradway.

Whenever President Trump sensed that he was losing Republican support during the 2016 campaign, he often responded with just two words: Supreme Court. Perhaps no other cause motivates the Republican coalition as does preserving the balance of the high court. Trump has promised to announce Tuesday... (Michael A. Memoli) Frazier said the industry was ready to work with Trump. "I think all these things come together to create a system that's good for innovation, that's good for jobs" and for patients, he told reporters outside the White House after the meeting. Bradway promised to add 1,600 jobs at Amgen, Sean Spicer, Trump's spokesman, said in a tweet after the meeting. The drugmaker had previously been cutting jobs, after announcing in 2014 that it would eliminate as many as 2,900 positions. The company didn't respond to a request for details about the job additions. At a briefing last week, Trump's press secretary Spicer said that lowering drug prices is going to be one of the key parts of reforming health care. The gathering with drug CEOs came after Trump said on Jan. 12 that the industry was "getting away with murder" and promised to act on drug prices. Since then, drugmakers have turned up their lobbying efforts with Congress as a potentially friendlier force that might counter Trump.

His decision Monday night to oust acting Attorney General Sally Yates heightens the drama over his deplorable executive action on immigration. Trump's move is petulant and unsettling, especially for Americans... (Editorial Board) They've been meeting with Republican and Democratic members of Congress, including those in leadership, to make their case for more measured proposals than Trump's, according to Ron Cohen, chairman of the board at the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a Washington lobby group for drugmakers. "Bidding" is essentially akin to drug companies' greatest fear: handing Medicare the power to negotiate prices. They've also met with people in the Trump administration, Cohen, chief executive officer of Acorda Therapeutics Inc., said in a telephone interview before the drug CEOs met with Trump. The drug industry is one of Washington's most powerful, and each year spends hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying, in addition to being one of the biggest donors to political campaigns, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. PhRMA, the lobby group, also launched an image makeover Jan. 23 that will feature advertising and public affairs events that focus on the value of its products. Republicans generally have not backed proposals that require more government involvement and instead have aligned themselves with ideas that promote free-market principles. In 2009, even in the face of a Democratic president and Congress, pharmaceutical companies were able to dodge Medicare price negotiation, partly by agreeing to commit $80 billion to help fund provision of the Affordable Care Act. Trump shocked the industry at his Jan. 12 news conference, when he said that "pharma has a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there is very little bidding. We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly and we're going to save billions of dollars." After his remarks, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology & Life Sciences Index both fell by the most in about three months. It's not clear how much support Trump has from key Republicans for the harshest drug price policies, which have typically been opposed by conservatives. "We'll look at the issues. I'm still keeping an open mind," said Rep. Tom Marino of Pennsylvania, a Republican and an early congressional backer of Trump. He said that drug prices will be among the topics in an as-yet-unscheduled hearing of the Judiciary subcommittee on regulatory reform that he chairs. Other Republicans may not be so willing. The new chairman of the largest bloc of House conservatives said last week that he has "concerns" over Trump's stated plans to bargain with pharmaceutical companies over Medicare drug prices. "I would be cautious in affirming that is the best approach to take," said Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina, in a meeting with a group of reporters. The RSC had about 170 members last session -- and its leaders expect to announce their membership number for this session in early March. Trump's own nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, wouldn't commit to bidding last week when asked about the topic at a Senate Finance hearing on his nomination. "We're committed to making certain that drug prices are able to be afforded by individuals," Price told senators at the hearing. The size of the savings negotiation could produce for taxpayers is the subject of fierce debate, ranging from modest to as much as $16 billion a year. Walker indicated he isn't comfortable with Trump being personally involved in specific policy proposals that could become part of a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. "I would have some concerns as far as the commander-in-chief beginning to negotiate all these different aspects of it," Walker said. Bloomberg's Billy House, Jared S. Hopkins and Doni Bloomfield contributed.

George Budwell (TMFGBudwell) Feb 1, 2017 at 8:06AM If ultra-high-risk, high-reward biotech stocks are your thing, then Celldex Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CLDX) is probably on your radar right now. This beaten-down biotech stock, after all, could blast northward in a hurry if its experimental triple-negative breast cancer medicine, glembatumumab vedotin, hits the mark in its ongoing pivotal trial.  Image source: Getty Images. Even so, Celldex's upside potential actually pales in comparison to other downtrodden cancer specialists like Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN) and Geron Corp. (NASDAQ:GERN). Let's dig deeper to find out why.   Agenus' paltry market cap is at odds with its broad immuno-oncology pipeline Agenus is a small-cap biotech that's developing both vaccines and biologic drugs aimed at treating cancer. While the recent regulatory filing of its shingles vaccine candidate -- which is being co-developed with GlaxoSmithKline -- is certainly an important value-driver in its own right, the real prize, at least from a commercial standpoint, is undoubtedly the company's broad anti-cancer pipeline composed mostly of checkpoint antibodies.  The backstory is that the breakout successes of Bristol-Myers Squibb's and Merck's checkpoint inhibitors, Opdivo and Keytruda, respectively, have essentially triggered an arms race within the pharma industry over the last few years. As a result, most major biopharmas now have their own checkpoint antibodies in development with the goal of carving out a profitable niche within the high-growth immuno-oncology (I-O) landscape. Agenus, for its part, is rather unique in this regard because it's among the few small-cap companies that decided to dive headfirst into the checkpoint inhibitor space, despite the stiff competition from nearly every big pharma at this point.  The good news is that Agenus' I-O pipeline was compelling enough to attract the interest of both Merck and Incyte, with both of these bigger names agreeing to sign licensing deals with the biotech to develop anti-cancer checkpoint antibodies. Most importantly, though, these collaborations, along with Agenus' own internal efforts, have already led to the successful launch of three Phase 1 trials and a number of pre-clinical studies, inching the company closer to the all-important goal of becoming a cash-flow-positive entity: Image source: Agenus Investor Presentation. Keeping with this theme, Agenus appears to be about three to four years from a possible regulatory filing based on the typical developmental time frame required for checkpoint inhibitors in general. Granted, the market could be near its saturation point by then, but Agenus doesn't exactly need a blockbuster I-O product to create enormous value for its shareholders. After all, the biotech's present market cap of $356 million implies that even a so-called "me too" medicine, or a drug that isn't well-differentiated from its peers in terms of efficacy or safety, would still be a major win for its shareholders. What's most intriguing about checkpoint inhibitors is that they have already proven themselves to be unusually powerful anti-cancer agents, and they have more often than not hit the mark in clinical trials. So this tiny biotech seems to have a better-than-average chance of actually transforming into a full-fledged cancer drugmaker within a few short years, giving it a favorable risk-to-reward profile.    The fate of Geron's first-in-class telomerase inhibitor could soon be clear Geron's stock has basically been in a holding pattern ever since the first internal data reviews of its blood cancer drug, imetelstat, were conducted by the biotech's partner, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), last September.(NYSE:JNJ) The basic story is that Johnson & Johnson, through its biotech subsidiary Janssen, is presently assessing imetelstat's ability to generate disease-modifying responses in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) -- two rare but deadly types of hematological malignancies. Unfortunately, the drug's ongoing trials for these initial indications have yet to produce the kind of breakout results investors and patients were hoping for following the promising pilot studies that initially sparked J&J's interest.  In fact, imetelstat's mid-stage myelofibrosis study appears to be hanging on by a thread at this point after the lower-dose arm failed to produce a compelling efficacy signal, and the higher-dose arm was closed to new patient enrollment thanks to an insufficient number of patients meeting the protocol-defined interim criteria at 12 weeks. While neither J&J nor Geron has provided much in the way of details about imetelstat's ongoing clinical trials, the companies have outlined imetelstat's projected developmental pathway moving forward. The short version is that Janssen is scheduled to perform a second internal data review for both studies in the second quarter of 2017. And this upcoming data review should be the pivotal event that determines whether J&J will sally forth with imetelstat's clinical program or terminate its partnership with Geron altogether. If J&J hits the eject button, then Geron's stock will almost certainly collapse, as the company has no other clinical assets. The bright side is that blood cancer drugs -- even minor ones -- fetch ginormous premiums in buyout scenarios. Moreover, J&J will likely take Geron off the market immediately if imetelstat starts to look like a viable drug candidate, especially after losing its bid to acquire the remaining commercial rights to Imbruvica.  In all, Geron's risk profile is not for the faint of heart, but it could also garner a jaw-dropping premium as J&J's next oncology acquisition -- or, alternatively, generate outstanding gains for investors as a stand-alone cancer specialist, depending on imetelstat's clinical progress.  George Budwell has no position in any stocks mentioned.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Trump’s War On Drug Prices Not The Only Concern For Pharma Companies February 1, 2017 7:26am NYSE:PJP ShareTweet From Brad Hoppmann: The news out of Washington keeps flooding out, and specifically news that’s being made straight from the Oval Office. In a meeting this morning with pharmaceutical industry executives, President Trump sent out a few new salvos in what might be described as a new “war on drugs.” This war isn’t about fighting the import of illegal drugs. Rather, it’s all about the pharmaceutical industry coming under fire from the president over the high cost of drug prices. Now, the industry is feeling the heat for where it makes its products, too. “I want you to manufacture in the United States,” President Donald Trump said to the group of pharmaceutical CEOs at the White House. This group included Robert A. Bradway, chairman and CEO of Amgen Inc. (AMGN), Joaquin Duato of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Merck (MRK) CEO Kenneth Frazier. That meeting also came with President Trump’s admonition on costs: “We have to get the prices way down.” Yet there is good news on this new war on drugs. Rather than it being a war waged against pharmaceutical companies, President Trump wants to frame the government as an ally in helping the industry reduce costs. The president has yet to provide any specifics on how his administration would foster renewed drug manufacturing in the U.S. But the most-obvious way to “encourage” it also is likely to cause costs to go up.To offer aid and assistance in this new drug war — or, more precisely, this new war on drug prices — the president said he plans to reduce regulations and taxes to encourage more domestic drug manufacturing. That obvious way is to impose what the president has called “very major” border taxes on companies with operations overseas. This would comport with some Republican congressional proposals designed to increase taxes on imported goods. Taxes on imports would likely only serve to boost the cost of drugs for consumers. But the administration hasn’t worked that out yet. What President Trump has done is appoint two seasoned pharma executives — the aforementioned Frazier of Merck, and Alex Gorsky of Johnson & Johnson — to a 28-member advisory council that’s tasked with expanding manufacturing in the U.S. Though I’m quite sure President Trump would like to engineer a reduction in drug costs as well as an expansion of pharmaceutical manufacturing in the U.S., these two goals will, I suspect, be difficult to achieve. While the pharmaceutical industry tries to work with the administration on reducing drug costs and increasing homegrown manufacturing, the industry has another front to deal with that has nothing to do with politics. That issue is the slew of drugs coming off-patent in 2017. In the case of Merck, the company has four big-selling drugs set to go off-patent in 2017. These include Invanz, Vytorin, Cancidas and Cubicin. Perhaps that helps explain why CEO Frazier is participating actively in ways to help the administration? Pfizer (PFE) is another big pharma firm with several very big drugs going off-patent. Somavert and Relpax are two of the company’s brands that will be off-patent this year. Yet by far the biggest seller is the company’s “little blue pill.” That’s right, Pfizer’s biggest drug, Viagra, is set to lose patent protection in 2017. Israeli generic pharma leader Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) is going to put out a generic version of the erectile dysfunction drug, and that will likely impact Pfizer’s bottom line. While Merck and Pfizer are the two biggest off-patent losers in 2017, they aren’t the only ones. Eli Lilly (LLY) also will suffer the loss of its Strattera, the ADHD treatment that brings in some $700 million per year.Novartis (NVS) will lose Sandostatin LAR while Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) loses Reyatz. Both medications are respective billion-dollar products. So, between patent losses — and the push for lower drug prices and more U.S. production — the pharmaceutical industry faces a lot of unknowns … as well as a lot of challenges … in 2017. Yet if the administration and Congress can make good on tax cuts and incentives for the industry, 2017 just might turn out to be a good year for the sector.

Aneesh Phadnis reports.

The Indian pharma industry fears a tougher US government stance on intellectual property rules after US President Donald Trump asserted that foreign countries must pay a fair share for drug development costs. Trump made the remark and reiterated his call to lower drug prices for American consumers and said he will encourage local manufacturing. Trump, who met senior executives of pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others, said foreign countries have been "freeloading" on the US with price controls that limit what can be charged on their citizens for medicines. According to D G Shah, secretary general of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, Trump's remarks indicate a hardening of stance by US government on intellectual property rights issues. "This was anticipated and I believe the US will put pressure on India to amend its intellectual property rules to allow longer exclusivity for patented products and making generic versions difficult," he said.  According to Shah, prices of patented drugs are lower in Canada, United Kingdom and Australia in comparison to the US. In India, price of patented drugs does not come with government imposed price control. "I believe the US President is targeting the big innovator companies in the US and wants them to manufacture locally," he added. "Innovation costs are borne by companies and not by the US government. There is no mechanism at present how the innovation costs can be recovered from citizens of foreign countries," said Kewal Handa, promoter-director of Salus Lifecare. Trump told the drugmakers that pricing had been "astronomical". "We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid," Trump said at the meeting, citing the nation's government insurance programs for the elderly, the poor and the disabled that together are the largest US purchaser of medications.  Trump also said currency devaluation by other countries had increased drugmakers' outsourcing their production and called on the companies to make more of their products in the US.  He added that foreign countries must pay fair share for drug development costs. "We're going to end global freeloading," Trump said. With inputs from Reuters.

He also said he's close to naming a "fantastic" new chief of the federal agency that regulates pharmaceuticals. (Evan Vucci/The New York Times)   By Katie Thomas The New York Times Feb. 1, 2017   Today’s Business stories Summit Bank of Eugene reports increased annual profit, upcoming stock sale Super Bowl advertisers go big to vie for attention Amazon increasingly wants to be its own delivery service Uber chief quits Trump council amid boycott calls Mexico exports no longer just avocados, tequila More Business »   President Trump promised some of the nation’s top drug company executives in a meeting at the White House on Tuesday that he would slash regulations at the Food and Drug Administration and make it easier for them to manufacture products in the United States. He also described as “fantastic” the person he planned to nominate for commissioner of the FDA, someone he said would streamline the agency and get drug approval decisions faster. “You can’t get approval for the plant, and you can’t get approval for the drug. Other than that, you’re doing fantastic,” Trump said at the meeting, to laughter from top executives of companies such as Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly and Novartis. But even as he struck a cordial tone with them, he said that lowering drug costs would remain a focus and that he would discuss the issue further during the nonpublic portion of the meeting, away from the news media. “The U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the pricing has been astronomical,” Trump said. “We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons.” Battered by public outrage over the rising costs of drugs in recent years, the drug industry has regarded Trump warily in recent weeks. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks rallied after his election as investors bet that Trump would reduce corporate taxes and adopt more industry-friendly policies than his opponent, Hillary Clinton, who had made reducing drug prices a campaign issue. But that optimism gave way to unease after Trump pledged to tackle the drug pricing issue himself, including raising the possibility of allowing Medicare to negotiate the prices of drugs directly, something the industry long has opposed. Just a few weeks ago, Trump singled out the ­pharmaceutical industry for its high prices, ­accusing it of “getting away with murder.” At the meeting Tuesday, Trump again referred to Medicare’s role, saying he would oppose anything that prevented competition, including “price fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what’s happening.” A White House spokesman later clarified that his remarks meant that the president “supports increasing bidding and competition for all drugs in Medicare.” But the president also tried to persuade the ­executives that he would provide them with assistance, saying: “We can save tens of billions of dollars, and you people are going to do great. You’re going to do great.” In comments after the meeting, the drug ­industry leaders said that it had been productive and that they welcomed the ­president’s pledges on cutting regulations and speeding approvals. But drug safety advocates criticized his comments, saying that eliminating agency regulations would mean rolling back consumer protections on products as diverse as drugs, cosmetics, food and dietary supplements. “Trump’s horrifying proposal reflects utter ignorance about the FDA’s essential role in protecting public health and once again demonstrates his commitment to placing corporate profits above protecting the safety of the American people,” said Dr. Michael Carome, director of Public Citizen’s health research group. Carome said many of the regulations had been set up by Congress so they could not easily be removed. “Most of these regulations, to do away with them would require new statutes and new laws to be passed,” he said. Others said the agency already had loosened the approval process for new drugs in recent years, with questionable benefit. “Streamlining drug approvals sounds good, but the agency has already weakened approval standards, and patients are paying the price — hugely expensive drugs that don’t even work,” said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, a Washington, D.C., research group that advocates strong safety and efficacy standards. She recently studied expensive new cancer drugs and found that many did not help patients feel better or live longer. The Trump administration has not said who the finalists to lead the FDA are, but two widely circulated candidates are Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA official with long-standing ties to the pharmaceutical industry, and Jim O’Neill, an associate of billionaire Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who has said he favored allowing drugs to be approved even if their efficacy had not been proved. At the meeting, many of the drug industry leaders were eager to emphasize their long histories in the United States as well as their U.S. manufacturing plants, even though the pharmaceutical industry — like many others — increasingly has moved its production overseas. More than half the finished drug products that are sold in the United States are made here, according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal, but the majority of the raw ingredients used to make those products are manufactured in countries such as China and India. Even Joseph Jimenez, the chief executive of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, emphasized the company’s U.S. ties, pointing out the billions of dollars it spends on research and development and saying, “Our global headquarters is near Boston.” Eric Althoff, a spokesman for Novartis, which is based in Basel, Switzerland, said Jimenez was referring to the company’s research and development headquarters. Jimenez and others supported Trump’s pledge to cut taxes and regulations. “One of the things that can help us is a lower tax rate,” Jimenez said. “Yep, we’ll get it,” Trump replied.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Budget 2017: Budget 2017 is out: Read how it impacts you and India New Delhi: Indian drug makers, who earn almost 50% of their revenues from the American market, are keeping their fingers crossed after US President Donald Trump told multinational drug makers that they were charging "astronomical" prices. At a White House meeting on Tuesday , Trump met senior management representatives from leading multinational pharmaceutical companies including Merck CEO Ken Frazier, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks, Celgene CEO Bob Hugin and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America CEO Stephen Ubl. "You folks have done a very great job over the years but we have to get the prices down," Trump told the CEOs.He has also threatened to have the government directly negotiate prices with the industry in order to get better bargains and steeper international competition to lower prices.Though Indian pharmaceutical industry , supplying lowcost generic medicines worldwide, see Trump's bashing of American Big Pharma industry as an opportunity for the domestic industry here, it is also cautious due to possibility of pricing pressure in their most profitable market. Moreover, Indian companies may also face restrictions and higher import taxes as the US is set to promote indigenous manufacturing. "However, Indian companies are unlikely to be significantly impacted because our prices are already very low and it will be difficult for Ame rican companies to compete with that," said Pankaj Patel, CMD of Cadila Healthcare Indian drug makers say the move by the US President is targeted at the US companies selling drugs at exorbitant prices, while manufacturing them outside the US at much cheaper cost. "Trump wants American companies to make their products in the US or at least pass on cost benefits to consumers. The objective here is to contain healthcare expenditure . So far, he has not talked about generics. Hence, we are not unduly concerned," said D G Shah, secretary general, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance. Though Indian companies are cautious, given a major chunk of their export revenue comes from the US, they also see Trump's advisory as an opportunity for low-cost generic drugs. "If MNCs have to bring their production back to the US, it will be difficult for them to match Indian prices," said a senior executive from another major Indian pharma company . Experts said although domestic companies may not be impacted directly , they can expect pricing pressure to intensify . India contributes around 30% of the overall volume of drugs consumed in US. Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, CMD, Biocon had told TOI: "The Indian generic pharma industry has been addressing the need for affordable pharmaceuticals of the US patients for decades and has enabled the US government to bring down its healthcare spends. In that sense, I believe Indian Pharma is aligned with Trump's vision of containing healthcare costs, and therefore will not be impacted much with his anticipated policy changes. I think he will be focusing on introducing new pricing models that will make expensive innovator drugs more affordable, considering that the generics are priced at almost one-tenth of the branded drugs".

But he mentioned boosting competition and encouraging “bidding wars” as a way to bring down prices. He also suggested he would pressure other countries to pay higher prices for drugs so that "they pay their fair share for U.S.-manufactured drugs." He argued that, "Right now, it's very unfair what other countries are doing to us."The meeting was the latest example of Trump's strategy of personally pressuring companies to keep manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Tags: Advertisement Advertisement Sponsored Content {{title}} {{description}} {{buttonType}} Advertisement Modern Healthcare Enewsletters Sign up for free enewsletters and alerts to receive breaking news and in-depth coverage of healthcare events and trends, as they happen, right to your inbox.

By Carolyn Y. Johnson, Juliet Eilperin and Laurie McGinley Washington Post  February 01, 2017 WASHINGTON — President Trump met with leaders of some of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies Tuesday morning and emphasized the need to lower ‘‘astronomical’’ drug prices, decrease regulations and bring drug manufacturing back into the United States. The tone of the public portion of the meeting was positive, especially given that Trump recently lashed out at the pharmaceutical industry for ‘‘getting away with murder’’ on prices — and threatened to use the government’s bargaining power to force down drug prices. On Tuesday, he mentioned increasing competition and ‘‘bidding wars’’ as a way to bring down prices, but it was unclear if he meant the government should negotiate on behalf of Medicare or what specific policy solutions that could entail. Advertisement ‘‘We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice,’’ Trump said, flanked by chief executives Kenneth Frazier of Merck and Robert Hugin of Celgene. ‘‘For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get the prices way down.’’ ‘‘I’ll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing their product to a vibrantly competitive market,’’ Trump said, to an audience of large, established drug companies. ‘‘But we can increase competition and bidding wars, big time.’’ Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

Sign up for more newsletters here Eli Lilly chief executive David Ricks, who attended the meeting, said in an investor call later in the day that Trump ‘‘did not get into elaborate policy detail in terms of the US pricing environment.’’ ‘‘I think we all understand the concern he’s raising’’ that consumers’ out-of-pocket costs are growing rapidly, Ricks said. He said the pricing discussion focused in part on how drug companies could do a better job of ‘‘getting discounts through to consumers.’’ Drug companies provide discounts on their drugs to companies that negotiate on behalf of insurers, and there is a growing discussion about the extent to which those rebates, granted in secret, trickle back to consumers. Advertisement Trump also focused on the need to speed up drug approvals and for companies to create jobs and manufacture drugs in the United States. Amgen, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, and the lobbying organization, PhRMA, were also present at the meeting, and emphasized their commitment to American manufacturing and jobs. After Joe Jimenez, chief executive of the Swiss pharma giant, Novartis, said that his company employed about 20,000 people in the United States, Trump asked him if he planned to expand — then interjected that he meant within the United States. ‘‘The rest I’m not too interested in,’’ Trump said. Jimenez said that tax reform would be a ‘‘massive help’’ and Trump replied, ‘‘We’ll get it.’’ According to the Department of Commerce, most pharmaceuticals consumed in the United States are made here; only about a quarter of drugs are imported, or about $86 billion in 2015. The top five sources of imports are Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Israel, and India. The industry also exported $47 billion in pharmaceutical products in 2015. Ireland has become a favorable location for pharmaceutical companies to locate in part because of its low corporate tax rate. Company leaders say that changes to the high corporate tax rate could make the United States a more favorable location for manufacturing or expansion. Trump also focused in part on his plans to ease regulations at the Food and Drug Administration to make it quicker to get drugs approved. ‘‘We’re also gonna be streamlining the process, so that, from your standpoint, when you have a drug, you can actually get it approved if it works, instead of waiting for many, many years,’’ Trump said.

Attendees included executives from Celgene, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Amgen, the Associated Press reported. It can take as long as 15 years and millions of dollars to get a new drug approved in the U.S., according to Trump. He said the current 9,000 pages of regulations should be slashed to 100. Also, Trump said patients with terminal illnesses should be allowed to try treatments that are not fully approved, the AP reported. Trump's tone at the meeting was far different than his first press conference as president, when he said drug companies had been "getting away with murder" because the federal government did not make them compete for its business. After the meeting, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier told reporters that the session was "very constructive" and that Trump was "very much focused" on finding ways to give patients more choices, the AP reported. Trump said he will soon identify his pick to head the FDA. Copyright © 2013-2017 HealthDay.

However, this tremendous growth is largely down to higher prices for medicines, a trend that has been criticized by some circles. While watchmakers, the machine-tool industry and tourism officials continue to struggle, the Swiss pharma industry appears to be leading the way, seemingly unaffected by the strong Swiss franc and global economic turbulence. Despite a slowdown last year, the 250 pharma businesses that make up the sector in Switzerland boasted record figures, exporting over CHF80 billion worth of drugs and other products – a 15% increase compared to the previous year. The pharma industry, which has been present in Switzerland for almost 150 years, now represents almost 40% of the total value of all Swiss exports. If combined with the chemicals industry, together they are responsible for almost one out of every two Swiss francs earned abroad. Switzerland is therefore increasingly dependent on multinationals like Novartis, Roche and Merck Serono, their industrial activities and the jobs they provide. Today, the sector employs over 40,000 people in Switzerland, or up to 180,000 if you also count indirect jobs, according to a survey by the BAKBasel research institute. Growth has been spectacular. At the end of the 1990s, the sector was responsible for 2% of Swiss gross domestic product (GDP). This now stands at around 4%. This growth is explained by stronger demand for medicines from emerging countries, an aging population, more chronic diseases but also much higher prices for certain medicines. Figures obtained by swissinfo.ch from the Federal Customs Administration show that between 2015 and 2016, the real increase in exports for the chemicals and pharma sectors was actually only 1.5%. The growth in exports can be explained mainly by an average price increase for drugs of 9.5%. This rise worries some health experts. “The increase in medicine prices is not only a problem for emerging and developing countries,” said Patrick Durisch, in charge of health issues at the Swiss non-governmental organization, Public Eye. “In Europe and in Switzerland some patients no longer benefit from certain treatments as they are too expensive. In the long run, these higher costs will endanger our social security and health insurance systems.” Durisch is critical of the industry’s growing economic influence and regular threats to move jobs abroad, which leave the Swiss authorities’ hands tied when it tries to lower the prices of certain medicines. “Switzerland is both a hostage and accomplice to its pharma industry. The recent attempt by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs to stop the Colombian Health Ministry from declaring Glivec – a Novartis cancer drug – of so-called public interest [allowing health regulators to examine the case and set a new, lower price for the drug], illustrates this situation perfectly,” said Durisch. However, the pharma industry argues that their high prices, which can attain several thousand dollars for a single treatment, are justified on account of the rising cost of research, and longer production deadlines and procedures to market drugs, as well as competition from generic drugs. Novartis vs Roche - 2016 figures In 2016, Novartis sales were $48.52 billion (CHF48.19 billion) and net income was CHF6.7 billion. At Roche, net sales in 2016 grew 4% in constant currencies to CHF50.6 billion. Net profit was CHF9.7 billion. Trump and the pharma industry At a meeting with pharmaceutical executives on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump, urged them to manufacture more of their drugs in the United States and cut prices, while vowing to speed approval of new medicines and ease regulation. Trump told them the government was paying "astronomical" prices for medicines in its health programmes for older, disabled and poor people. In attendance were top executives at Merck & Co, Johnson & Celgene, Eli Lilly & Co, Amgen and Novartis, as well as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) lobbying group. Lower prices On Wednesday the Swiss government announced that had adopted new rules to control the prices of medicines reimbursed by health insurance schemes. The government said CHF240 million would be saved over the next three years thanks to cheaper drugs. However, this target is much lower than a similar initiative for the 2012-2014 period, when the Federal Health Office ordered lower prices on 1,500 products thus saving CHF600 million. The pharma industry successfully challenged the federal authorities’ method of calculation and the periodic re-evaluation of prices was suspended. In the future, this calculation should take account of cost benefits compared to other drugs and not just price comparisons with abroad.

The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 25 points, having risen more than 100 points earlier in the session, with Apple contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 rose less than 0.1 percent, with utilities falling 1.7 percent to lead decliners and health care outperforming. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.5 percent as Apple spiked around 6 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee — the central bank's policy-making arm — kept its benchmark overnight lending rate target at 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent. Ahead of the announcement, market expectations for a rate hike were just 4 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. "That was the expectation and they delivered," said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark. "One thing we're sure is that the Fed is going to telegraph its next move." "With all the talk about growth, ... the Fed will have even more pressure to do so," he said. There was little in the post-meeting communique to indicate when the Fed might resume the rate normalization process. However, officials did take note of a change in mood. "Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late," the committee said in its statement. The language was new, and in the arcane process of discerning where the thinking resides among central bankers, significant. "The market's fear was that the Fed could've been more hawkish; that didn't happen," said Matt Toms, chief investment officer of fixed income and Voya Investment Management. "The one thing that could be viewed as more hawkish — and that's grasping because it was a pretty tame statement — is that the Fed's 2 percent inflation target could be reached in the medium term." The Fed raised rates for just the second time in a decade at its December meeting. The central bank also signaled the possibility of three rate hikes this year. "Donald Trump's executive orders have shaken the Fed and they do not want to increase rates as aggressively as previously thought. The unanimous decision by the Fed has made it clear that March meeting may not have much life," said Naeem Aslam, chief market at Think Markets. Getty Images A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Investors have shifted some of their focus away from the Fed and into the White House, following a sharp rally after President Donald Trump's election on Nov. 8. "We're in a transition period — which I like to call 'The Great Hand-off' — from monetary policy to fiscal policy," said Adam Sarhan, CEO at 50 Park Investments. The stock market's rally was propelled by the prospects of fiscal stimulus, deregulation and corporate tax cuts. Equities ended January on a sour note, as the major indexes closed lower the last two days of the month. That said, they managed to close off their session lows on Monday and Tuesday. "That's typical of a market seeking direction but not looking at a steep pullback," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. In economic news, the latest report from ADP and Moody's showed private companies added 246,000 jobs in January, well above the expected 165,000. January also turned in the best single-month performance since June. Other data released Wednesday included the IHS Markit Manufacturing index's final read for January, which showed the strongest manufacturing production growth for almost two years. The ISM Manufacturing index for January came in at 56, above an expected read of 55. December construction spending fell 0.2 percent, while economist had forecast a gain 0.4 percent. U.S. Treasurys fell broadly but traded off session lows, with the benchmark 10-year note yield holding around 2.475 percent and the two-year note yield near 1.22 percent. The dollar rose about 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies — giving back some of its earlier gains — with the euro near $1.077 and they yen around 113.21. On the earnings front, Dow component Apple reported better-than-expected quarterly results Tuesday after the close, as the firm said it sold more expensive iPhones. However, its future guidance came in at the lower end of expectations. The stock rose more than 5.5 percent in midday trade. "Apple pulling a [strong] quarter is bullish because it shows the consumer, which is a large part of the economy, is in good shape," said 50 Park Investments' Sarhan. Companies reporting before the bell Wednesday included ADP, Johnson Controls and Altria, with all three topping bottom-line expectations, but reporting lighter-than-expected sales. Facebook and MetLife are both scheduled to report Wednesday after the close. Symbol Name Price   Change %Change DJIA --- S&P 500 --- NASDAQ --- The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.85 points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 19,890.94, with Apple the top advancer and Microsoft leading decliners. The S&P 500 rose 0.68 point, or 0.03 percent, to end at 2,279.55, with utilities leading seven sectors lower and health care outperforming. The Nasdaq composite rose 27.86 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 5,642.65. About four stocks declined for every three advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 902.89 million and a composite volume of 3.906 billion at the close. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 11.66. U.S. crude futures for March delivery rose $1.07 to settle at $53.88 per barrel. Gold futures for April delivery fell $3.10 to settle at $1,208.30 per ounce. —CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

The message to the pharmaceutical company executives was similar to one he delivered to the auto executives that met with him last week. He said he would slash regulations and make it easier for them to manufacture products in the United States. President Trump vowed to speed up drug approvals at the Food and Drug Administration while reiterating his pledge to bring down drug costs. The President said, “We’re also going to be streamlining the process so that from your standpoint so that when you have a drug you can actually get it approved if it works, instead of waiting for many, many years.” The President said he plans to name an FDA commissioner who will be “streamlining” the agency. President Trump also said that prices for drugs must come down. He said, “For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get prices way down, so that’s what we’re going to be talking about.” Medicare and Medicaid are some of the world’s biggest purchasers of health-care products and services and cover tens of millions of Americans. He remarked that drugmakers need to face increased competition and bidding and said “I’ll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing a product to a vibrantly competitive market.” Trump also said he plans to work on global trade and tax policy that could benefit U.S. drugmakers. He said trade policy will “prioritize that foreign countries pay their fair share for US manufactured drugs so our drug companies have greater financial resources to accelerate development of new cures.” The White House meeting was attended by executives from Merck, Amgen, Johnson & Johnson, Celgene, Novartis and Eli Lilly, along with PhRMA CEO Stephen Ubl. House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Vice President Mike Pence also attended. The meeting was partially closed to the press. Ubl stated after the meeting that he would work with the Trump administration to advance “market-based reforms.” In a statement, Ubl said, “We discussed many areas of common ground including: advancing stronger trade agreements to level the playing field with countries around the world; reforming our tax code to spur investment and job creation here in the United States; and removing outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow innovation.” Get Analysts' Upgrades and Downgrades Daily - Enter your email address below to receive a concise daily summary of analysts' upgrades, downgrades and new coverage with MarketBeat.com's FREE daily email newsletter.  Comment on this Post Click here to cancel reply.

The Swiss drugmaker is rolling out new treatments such as the cancer immune therapy Tecentriq and wrapping up costly clinical trials for two experimental medicines to soften the blow from competition to its ageing cancer blockbusters. That means profit may rise at the same pace as sales this year, the Basel, Switzerland-based drugmaker said on Wednesday. Severin Schwan on Feb. 1. Photographer: Michele Limina/Bloomberg Chief Executive Officer Severin Schwan is heading into a make-or-break year in which new cancer drugs must show they can pick up the slack for Roche’s older top sellers Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin -- targeted tumor therapies that were revolutionary when they were first approved in the late 1990s and mid-2000s. For rivals Sanofi and AstraZeneca Plc, losing patent protection on crucial drugs has caused profit to decline. “Our industry is about constantly rejuvenating the pipeline,” Schwan said on a conference call on Wednesday. Roche has enough promising new medicines that “we can actually over-compensate for the decline of the mature products with the launch of the new medicines.” Revenue will probably rise by a low to mid-single digit percentage at constant exchange rates this year, the same pace as earnings per share excluding some items, Roche said in a statement. A year ago, it issued the same sales forecast but said core EPS would grow faster. Cautious Company Roche has a tradition of cautious guidance at the start of the year, and it’s setting “achievable targets which we understand could potentially be upgraded later,” Vincent Meunier, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, wrote in a note to clients. “We remain confident in Roche’s ability to deliver.” The stock rose 1.8 percent to 237.10 Swiss francs at 12:16 p.m. in Zurich trading. Roche shares have declined 7.4 percent in the past 12 months including reinvested dividends, worse than the 1.3 percent decline in the Bloomberg index that tracks European pharmaceutical stocks. A measure of profit labeled as core earnings per share, which excludes some expenses, rose to 14.53 francs ($14.66) last year from 13.49 francs a year earlier, falling short of the 14.73 franc average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, Roche also said Wednesday. Schwan pointed to the cancer immune therapy Tecentriq as one of the growth drivers ahead. The company is competing with Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. to develop the best immune therapies, medicines that harness the body’s own cells to fight cancer. Tecentriq won U.S. regulators’ approval in October for second-line lung cancer after being cleared for advanced bladder tumors in May. Sales last year rose to 157 million francs. Revenue from breast tumor therapies Kadcyla and Perjeta, key to maintaining leadership in a market long dominated by Roche’s older treatment Herceptin, rose to 831 million francs and 1.8 billion francs, respectively. Roche raised its dividend to 8.20 francs, less than analysts had expected. Currency fluctuations are to blame for recent changes in the payout, according to Schwan. The company doesn’t plan to sell its diabetes care unit, even though there’s “enormous price pressure” in the industry, Schwan said. “It’s a difficult situation we are going through, but we remain committed to this business.” In the U.S., where the cost of drugs has been criticized by President Donald Trump, the key is to deliver treatments that are game-changers, according to Schwan. “I am absolutely convinced the U.S. remains committed to innovation and remains committed to bringing innovation to patients as fast as possible,” he said. He described himself as “bullish about the U.S. market.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens. The vaccine was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organization (WHO), together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called “ring vaccination” approach – the same method used to eradicate small pox. When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous three weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain “contacts of contacts.” A total of 117 clusters (or “rings”) were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. Initially, rings were randomized to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a three-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine’s efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately, and the trial was also opened to children older than six years. In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so called “herd immunity”). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. In January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided $5 million to the manufacturer of the vaccine, Merck, towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO’s Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure.

This article has already been saved in your Saved Items   Investing.com Articles (168) Comments (3) My Homepage Follow by Eli Wright Right now, the US dollar appears to be recovering from yesterday's Trumponomic pot-shots via comments from the President's new head of the National Trade Council, Peter Navarro, who characterized the euro as 'grossly undervalued' versus the dollar. His comments reflect Trump's conviction that Germany, China and Japan are profiting from their already devalued currencies at the expense of the United States' currency. The greenback slid lower after the comments, down 0.8% yesterday and the Dollar Index fell below 100. The Dollar Index remains below 100 this morning, but could get some help from tonight's FOMC Statement. Though a rate change isn't expected, the quality and tone of forward guidance could provide some fuel for the flagging USD. However, the greenback could lose value if the Fed voices concerns about US economic growth, a possibility after Friday's US GDP disappointment. On today's Economic Calendar ISM manufacturing PMI and ADP nonfarm employment changes are both scheduled. Much like the dollar, global equities are trying to recover after struggling yesterday. Overnight in Asia, the Nikkei rose 0.5% to 19,136. However, the Hang Seng, reopening after the lunar New Year, fell 0.17%, to 23,321. Markets in China remain closed until February 3. In Europe this morning, the FTSE is up 0.67%, to 7,146.50; the DAX is 0.79% higher, at 11,627; and the Stoxx 50 has gained 0.49% to 3,257.50. On Wall Street yesterday, the S&P 500 extended losses for a fourth consecutive day, dipping by 0.09%, to 2,278.87; the Dow fell for a third straight day, down 0.54%, to 19,864.09. The NASDAQ ticked higher 0.02%, to 5,614.79. In pre-market trading, the S&P and Dow are both up nearly 0.2%, while the NASDAQ is up 0.45%. US Treasury yields are up across the board this morning: the 2-year yield is 1.217%; the 10-year yield is 2.474%; and the 30-year yield is 3.076%. Forex The Dollar Index finished yesterday below 100 for the first time in eleven weeks, capping a 2.6% drop last month, the worst January performance for the index in 30 years, As of this writing, it's at at 99.59. USD vs Currency Majors The euro has ticked 0.01% lower, to 1.0796, but the single currency’s prospects are looking brighter. The euro zone economy appears to be keeping pace with the US and unemployment is now at a seven-year low. Euro Zone GDP The pound is 0.48% higher, at 1.2643 after today's UK Manufacturing PMI release indicated a strong start to 2017. The Bank of England’s inflation report and its interest rate decision are expected tomorrow, after which BoE Governor Carney will speak. No change is anticipated. The yen has found support at 112.70. USD/JPY is up 0.41% this morning, at 113.26, after the disappointing manufacturing PMI yesterday evening weakened the Japanese currency. The loonie is down 0.16% to 1.3051 on lower oil prices. That said, yesterday’s MoM GDP report was positive though the Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the rising USD is carrying the Canadian dollar along with it, hampering exports.

A lot of that has to do with regulation, a lot of it has to do with the fact that other countries take advantage of ours with their money and their money supply and devaluation ... Were going to be changing a lot of the rules, he said. The president also said that foreign countries must pay their fair share of the costs for developing new drugs, saying that Were going to end global freeloading. Trump said that very soon he will announce his nominee to head the Food and Drug Administration. Among those present at the meeting were representatives of the largest US pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Celgene and Eli Lilly, as well as the main association in the sector PhRMA. The meeting comes amid a series of encounters organized by Trump with representatives of different business sectors to inform them of his agenda and economic development plans.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg For drugmakers, Tuesday’s meeting with President Donald Trump was a dose of happy pills. Though there’s still worrisome ambiguity on the subject, Trump appeared to back off the worst-case scenario for pharma companies -- the U.S. government won’t be setting drug prices. Drug company executives were also heartened by Trump’s promises of lower taxes, quicker regulatory approval, and help defending them against foreign countries that are able to charge less because American consumers pay more. There was, of course, some medicine to go with the spoonfuls of sugar. Trump insisted that, despite the higher costs, the companies shift manufacturing to the U.S. Trump “could’ve been a lot harsher on them on pricing,” said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli & Co. in Rye, New York. “It was generally good.” Immigration was a subject that at least one participant company said wasn’t discussed at the meeting. A Trump executive order last week temporarily blocked citizens of seven countries from entering the U.S. Like many industries in need of highly skilled workers, pharma employs its share of foreign-born workers. Labor Force Thirteen percent of the U.S. population came from outside the country, compared with 17 percent of the pharmaceutical industry’s labor force, according to 2014 data from the Institute for Immigration Research at George Mason University. Immigrants were even more represented among higher-skilled employees, with 33 percent of the total research-and-development workforce and more than 40 percent of the scientists. Trump recognized that drug pricing was the topic foremost on the drug executives’ minds. And though government-set prices may be off the table, he suggested that Medicare price bidding may still be a possibility. “I’ll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing their product to a vibrantly competitive market,” Trump told them. “That includes price-fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what’s happening. But we can increase competition and bidding wars.” Investors no doubt recalled Trump telling the drug executives on Jan. 12 that they were “getting away with murder” because of high prices, and figured Tuesday’s meeting was an improvement. They pushed the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index 2.8 percent higher, the most since Nov. 9, the day after the election. The U.S. doesn’t directly regulate medicine prices, unlike much of the rest of the globe. Setting the cost is a murky process. List prices are set by drugmakers, rebates are privately negotiated with intermediaries and the out-of-pocket cost that customers pay at the pharmacy varies depending on whether or not they have insurance, and how good it is. Generics Approval Loosening up regulations would be welcomed by the industry, Ian Read, Pfizer Inc.’s chief executive officer, said Tuesday on a conference call announcing earnings. “We’ve been advocating for a long time to speed up the approval of generics and remove the barriers to their approval,” Read said. “That will help with drug prices.” As for shifting manufacturing to the U.S., it may be difficult for an industry that outsources 80 percent of its active ingredients and 40 percent of finished drugs. Most active ingredients are made in India and China, where labor is cheaper. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has found problems with factory workers there deleting data that may call into question the quality of the drug components. The FDA’s workforce in those countries is so small that it hasn’t inspected about one-third of the 3,000 manufacturing plants abroad, according to a Government Accountability Office report released in December. Factory Automation Moving factories to the U.S. is “not going to save money,” said Craig Garthwaite, co-director of the Health Enterprise Management Program at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. Besides, a lot of the industry is automated, and U.S.-based manufacturing is “going to be as automated as it can be.” Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade group also known as PhRMA, said stronger trade agreements and reforming the tax code “will translate to up to 350,000 new jobs over the next 10 years as a result of growth in the biopharmaceutical industry.” Pfizer, Allergan Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics.

Read blamed his absence on Tuesday’s call with analysts during the meeting, though Eli Lilly & Co. CEO Dave Ricks attended the Trump sitdown the same day his company released results. Pfizer and Allergan’s unsuccessfully tried a $160 billion merger that would’ve established its combined headquarters overseas, a maneuver known as an inversion that helps lower corporate tax bills. Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur declined to comment. Among the other participants were Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier; Celgene Corp. Chairman Bob Hugin; Novartis AG CEO Joe Jimenez; Joaquin Duato, Johnson & Johnson’s worldwide chairman of pharmaceuticals; Amgen Inc. CEO Bob Bradway; and Stephen Ubl, PhRMA’s CEO. “This is like an iron fist,” Dan Mendelson, CEO of consulting firm Avalere Health and former associate director for health at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, said of the Trump administration. “No one can dispute that this is front and center for the Trump administration and that they see this as a populist issue, that it will win them points.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Trump also blasted foreign countries, which he said have been "freeloading" on the United States with price controls that limit what their own citizens can be charged for medications. "We have to get the prices down," Trump said. "We have to get the prices way down." "We have to get lower prices, we have to get even better innovation, and I want you to move your companies back to the United States," Trump said. "I want you to manufacture in the United States." Related: What's to Blame for High Drug Costs? Trump also said he wanted to make it easier for pharmaceutical companies to win regulatory approval for their products. "You're going to get your prices either approved, or not approved," the president said. "But it's going to be a quick process. It's not going to take 15 years." The meeting included the CEOs of Merck, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, as well as the head of the trade group PhRMA. In remarks to reporters while flanked by those CEOs, Trump said, "The U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the prices have been astronomical for our country."
