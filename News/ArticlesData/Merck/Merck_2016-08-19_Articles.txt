(Longjumeau, France) to expand Merck’s excipients portfolio. Under the agreement, Merck will be the exclusive, global distributor of the Expansorb® line of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers. The portfolio will include 38 polymers for sustained release of small molecule and selected peptide injectables, allowing customers to optimize and precisely control release kinetics of final drug products. The ability to better control and sustain the release of drugs allows for delivery via reduced numbers of injections with the same therapeutic efficacy, improving patient comfort and compliance. “The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly interested in controlling the release of small molecules and selected peptides delivered via injection,” said Andrew Bulpin, Head of Process Solutions at the life science business of Merck. “The addition of the Expansorb® polymers to our broad portfolio of excipients improves drug developers’ ability to protect molecules with short in vivo half-lives and achieve the desired therapeutic effect while enhancing patient comfort and compliance.” Poly lactic acid (PLA) and poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) polymers are biocompatible and biodegradable synthetic substances that have already been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency with several drug products on the market and many more drug products in clinical development. Expansorb® PLA and PLGA polymers are manufactured under cGMP conditions by PCAS and are expected to be sold under Merck’s industry-leading Emprove® program once rigorous evaluations and certifications are complete. The pharmaceutical manufacturing industry relies on Emprove® products for documentation and regulatory information to facilitate risk assessment workflows and supplier qualification. “PCAS is excited to bring our Expansorb® polymers to Merck and together offer the potential of significant value creation for pharmaceutical customers,” said Didier Combis, Head of Custom Synthesis & Pharma Chemicals, PCAS. “This is an important collaboration, allowing us to broaden access to this powerful technology through Merck’s global network and facilitate development of improved therapeutic solutions for patients.” Nanosphere and microsphere formulations based on PLGA polymers have been studied extensively for use in the delivery of peptides, therapeutic proteins, hormones and antibiotics. Future applications are expected to include the development of targeted drug-containing nanoparticles using site-specific ligands.   About PCAS (Euronext Paris: PCA) PCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for Life Sciences and Innovative Technologies. With 7 percent of its turnover dedicated to R&D and a wide international presence, PCAS is the preferred industrial partner of market-leading major global groups. The company offers a growing range of proprietary products and solutions in leading-edge segments, and also includes two subsidiaries with very strong potential: Protéus in biotechnology and Enersens in high-performance insulation. With a particularly high standard of performance, PCAS achieved net sales of €179,1 million in 2015 and employs more than 900 people in six countries. Source: Merck Group, press release, 2016-07-12.

MALLOZZIAUG. 20, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Christina Zhang, the daughter of Juanlian Sun and Junxiong Zhang of Belle Mead, N.J., was married Aug. 20 to Eric Gar-yee Yeung, a son of Anh Yeung and George Yeung of Fairfax, Va. Bob Dunn, a Universal Life minister and a friend of the couple, officiated at the Museum of the City of New York. The bride, 27, is a health care investment analyst for Jennison Associates, a New York asset management firm. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. Her father retired as a chemist for Merck in Kenilworth, N.J. Her mother is a clinical technician at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset in Somerville, N.J. The groom, 31, is an associate director of business development at Celgene Corporation, the biopharmaceutical company in Summit, N.J., that makes drug therapies for cancer and inflammatory disorders. He graduated from N.Y.U. and received a master's degree in biotechnology from Columbia. His mother is a senior information technology analyst in Washington with the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, better known as Freddie Mac. His father, who worked in Alexandria, Va., retired as a patent examiner for the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The couple met in August 2009 through Ms. Zhang’s brother, Charles, a friend and then-colleague of Mr. Yeung on the health care investment banking team at Citigroup in New York. Ms. Zhang, then a 20-year-old senior studying for a joint bachelor’s degree in economics and nursing at Penn, had also taken an interest in health care investment banking. When she asked her brother if there was anyone else who could talk to her about the industry, he recommended Mr. Yeung. “When Charles asked me if I could meet with his sister, I was like ‘Sure, why not,’” said Mr. Yeung, who was 24 at the time. “I had no problem doing him a favor.” So Mr. Yeung set up an appointment with Ms. Zhang, asking her to meet him at his office before walking to a nearby coffee shop for what both described as an “informational meeting.” But when Ms. Zhang did not arrive on time, Mr. Yeung became angry. “Here I was trying to do this girl a favor, and she was late,” he said. “I wasn’t happy about it.” But his mood changed the moment Ms. Zhang walked through the door and into his life. “She was so gorgeous, she took my breath away,” he said. “I was completely blown away. It was as if I had been struck by a thunderbolt.” They eventually went to their meeting, which lasted five hours. “I thought ‘What a nice guy, taking all this time to help me out,’” said Ms. Zhang, who had no idea that she had swept Mr. Yeung off his feet. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times “I guess I wasn’t struck by that same thunderbolt,” she said, laughing. “I was honestly just looking at Eric as a professional who was trying to help me get a good job after college.” And that is the role Mr. Yeung decided he would play, for as long as he could, anyway. “Even though I was completely enamored by her, I had to remind myself that this was the sister of a friend and colleague,” he said. “I was going to respect the boundaries that had been put in place.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the ensuing weeks, Ms. Zhang took advantage of being back in New York for several school-related recruiting events to meet with Mr. Yeung. “Our conversations started to get a bit more personal, and much more interesting,” she said. “I had never been involved in a serious relationship before, but I started to realize that Eric was someone with whom I had great chemistry.” Three months later, Mr. Yeung had another meeting, this one in a conference room with Ms. Zhang’s brother, where he professed his feelings for Ms. Zhang. “Charles was a little surprised, but I gave him my word that I would always act like a gentleman around his sister,” Mr. Yeung said. Soon after, Ms. Zhang began to make frequent trips from Philadelphia to New York to spend time with Mr. Yeung, and he often returned the favor by visiting her at college. They shared a love of travel by journeying together to places far and near, including a trip to the Patara Elephant Farm in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in the summer of 2014, and to Central Park in December 2015, where Mr. Yeung proposed. “Christina is a very intelligent and very driven person who motivates me every day to be a better person,” Mr. Yeung said. “But what I love most about her is that she has a big heart and is very honest.” “Looking back at it now,” he said, “she’s the one who actually did me the favor.” A version of this article appears in print on August 21, 2016, on page ST14 of the New York edition with the headline: An Appointment Worth the Wait.

Taxpayers funded a lifesaving drug; guess what happened next? Sen. Bernie Sanders 12:06 a.m. EDT August 20, 2016 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE The pharmaceutical industry has become a major health hazard to the American people. Our nation pays — by far — the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. As a result, nearly one in five Americans cannot afford to fill their prescriptions. That is unacceptable. A lifesaving product does no good if patients cannot afford it. A new report from Americans for Tax Fairness explains how a pharmaceutical company, Gilead Sciences, games the system to charge high prices and then shifts the profits offshore to avoid billions in U.S. taxes. Gilead sells Sovaldi, a drug used to treat the hepatitis C virus. It was developed in part with taxpayer funds by a researcher who worked at the Department of Veterans Affairs and founded a small drug company. Gilead bought the company for $11 billion and used government — provided monopoly rights to set the sticker price at $1,000 per pill, or $84,000 for the 12-week course of treatment in 2014. U.S. public and private insurers, taxpayers and patients spent more money on Sovaldi in 2014 than on any other prescription drug, according to a report from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. And yet state Medicaid programs could afford to treat fewer than one in 40 patients with hepatitis C in 2014. If gone untreated, hepatitis C can end in what one nurse-practitioner called “some of the worst deaths I’ve ever seen.” She said, “At the end, you die not knowing who you are, your belly looks 12 months pregnant, you’re malnourished, and you’re bleeding to death.” Patients with hepatitis C are often low-income and a disproportionate number of them are veterans. Gilead’s profits have quintupled since it started selling the drug, from $4 billion in 2013 to $22 billion in 2015. Gilead claims that it earns 2/3 of these profits offshore, but this is impossible because it reports earning 2/3 of its revenue here in the U.S., where it charges higher prices than anywhere else in the world. The company pays an effective tax rate of just 1 percent in the foreign countries where it claims to do business. In 2013, Gilead’s chief financial officer revealed the strategy by announcing the formula for Sovaldi was being transferred to Ireland in order to allow the company’s effective tax rate to “decline over time.” Gilead’s worldwide effective tax rate dropped from 27 percent in 2013 to 16 percent in 2015. So taxpayers helped bankroll the research behind the hepatitis C drug, Gilead charged Americans the highest price in the world for the treatment and now we are getting cheated a third time as Gilead stashes its profits abroad to avoid taxes. Gilead is not the only company taking advantage of our public research funding and tax loopholes. Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Meyers Squibb and many others engage in similar offshore tax dodging to avoid billions in U.S. taxes each year. At what point will Congress have the courage to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and say enough is enough? Congress should address this in several ways. First, in extraordinary circumstances, such as a cure for hepatitis C, federal law allows the government to use patented inventions with or without the permission of the owner as long as they are fairly compensated. Second Congress must repeal the rule allowing our corporations to defer paying taxes on profits they claim to earn offshore. We must also take several other steps to lower drug prices, including instructing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and reducing the barriers to the importation of prescription medication from Canada and other countries. Americans — including veterans, retirees, and children — who suffer from serious, sometimes fatal, illnesses like hepatitis C and cancer need a government that works for them, not just the CEOs of large pharmaceutical companies and the billionaire class.

Login Register Public Release: 19-Aug-2016 Parents more likely to support HPV vax requirements if states include opt-out provisions Parents more likely to support HPV vaccine requirements for school entry if states include opt-out provisions American Association for Cancer Research Share  Print  E-Mail Bottom Line: Parents are more likely to support laws that would make the human papillomavirus vaccine mandatory for school entry if their state offers opt-out provisions, however, the study's lead author cautioned that such opt-out provisions may weaken the effectiveness of the vaccine requirements. Journal in Which the Study was Published: Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. Author: William A. Calo, PhD, JD, a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the University of North Carolina, Gillings School of Global Public Health, and Noel Brewer, PhD, the study's senior author, who is a professor of health behavior at the University of North Carolina and a member of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. Background: The human papillomavirus (HPV) causes most cases of cervical cancer and a large proportion of vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that boys and girls receive the three-dose HPV vaccination beginning at age 11 or 12. However, as of 2014, only 40 percent of girls and 22 percent of boys ages 13 to 17 had completed the HPV vaccine series, according to CDC statistics. Calo said previous research has shown that school-entry requirements have contributed to high uptake rates for vaccinations such as Hepatitis B, Tdap, and MMR. Since 2006, half of U.S. state legislatures have introduced measures to add HPV to the list of required vaccines, however, most measures were rejected, often due to parental disapproval or ethical, political, or legal concerns, Calo said. Presently, only Virginia, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia require the HPV vaccine for school enrollment, and all allow parents to opt out. How the Study Was Conducted and Results: In order to evaluate parental support for making the HPV vaccine mandatory for school entry, Calo, Brewer, and colleagues conducted a web-based survey of 1,501 parents between November 2014 and January 2015. To be eligible for the survey, parents had to have at least one 11- to 17-year-old child living primarily in their household. The survey stated, "Some states are trying to pass laws that would require all 11- and 12-year-olds to get HPV vaccine before they are allowed to start 6th grade." Parents were then asked whether they agreed with the statement, "I think these laws are a good idea." Overall, 21 percent of parents agreed that such laws are a good idea, and 54 percent disagreed. Twenty-five percent of respondents said they neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement; Calo said this group may benefit from public education about HPV vaccination and, as they learn about the benefits of vaccination, be more likely to support school-entry requirements. Respondents who said they disagreed that the laws are a good idea then received this follow-up statement: "It is okay to have these laws only if parents can opt out when they want to." When the opt-out provision was added, 57 percent of respondents agreed that the school-entry requirements are a good idea, and 21 percent disagreed. The study also identified several factors that influenced approval of HPV vaccine requirements. Nearly one-third (32 percent) of respondents felt that the vaccine was being promoted to make money for drug companies and only 40 percent felt that the vaccine was effective in preventing cervical cancer. Calo said changing some of those perceptions would be beneficial for improving HPV vaccination rates and for legislating school-entry requirements. Author Comment: Calo cautioned that opt-out provisions could weaken the overall effectiveness of vaccination if large numbers of families opted out. "Any process for requesting an opt-out should have an educational component and encourage parents to carefully consider their decision," he said. "HPV vaccination saves lives," Calo said. "We have an unprecedented opportunity to prevent thousands of HPV-associated cancers through vaccination and unfortunately, we are missing that opportunity." Brewer noted the findings suggest that states should consider school-entry requirements for HPV vaccination once states have implemented other approaches that have proven successful in raising vaccination rates, such as centralizing vaccination reminders in state health departments, focusing quality-improvement visits to providers on HPV vaccination, and training physicians to use announcements to introduce vaccination. ### Limitations: The authors noted that a limitation of this study is that it asked about hypothetical school-entry requirements, rather than actual laws, and did not describe the scope of opt-out provisions. The researchers said parents' opinions could differ if they were discussing actual legislation, and may vary depending on whether the opt-out provisions were based on medical, religious, or philosophical reasons. Funding & Disclosures: This study was funded by a grant from the Merck Sharp & Dohme Investigator Studies Program. Brewer has received HPV vaccine-related grants from or been on paid advisory boards for Merck Sharp & Dohme and Pfizer. Brewer is also chair of the National HPV Vaccination Roundtable.

AACR membership includes more than 36,000 laboratory, translational, and clinical researchers; population scientists; other health care professionals; and patient advocates residing in 107 countries. The AACR marshals the full spectrum of expertise of the cancer community to accelerate progress in the prevention, biology, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer by annually convening more than 30 conferences and educational workshops, the largest of which is the AACR Annual Meeting with nearly 19,500 attendees. In addition, the AACR publishes eight prestigious, peer-reviewed scientific journals and a magazine for cancer survivors, patients, and their caregivers. The AACR funds meritorious research directly as well as in cooperation with numerous cancer organizations. As the Scientific Partner of Stand Up To Cancer, the AACR provides expert peer review, grants administration, and scientific oversight of team science and individual investigator grants in cancer research that have the potential for near-term patient benefit. The AACR actively communicates with legislators and other policymakers about the value of cancer research and related biomedical science in saving lives from cancer.
