On Friday, they felt the other side of that concentrated bet. The drop in the shares on Friday — the worst in more than 16 years — had as much to do with the failure of Bristol-Myers’s drug Opdivo in a clinical trial for lung cancer as it did with investors’ now-shaken confidence in the New York-based company’s ability to be the breakaway leader in the field. It was also a stark reminder of the risks of drug development. No other large pharmaceutical company has recently focused on one disease area like Bristol-Myers has, in this case by targeting drugs that leverage the immune system to attack tumors. The trial results, which showed that Opdivo failed to do better than chemotherapy at keeping previously untreated patients’ cancer from progressing, have left the door open for competitors like Merck & Co, AstraZeneca PLC and Roche Holding AG. Bristol-Myers shares were down 16 percent to US$63.28 at the close in New York. Merck gained 10 percent to US$63.86. Immunotherapy is a market potentially worth billions of dollars a year — Opdivo is predicted by analysts to bring in US$10.7 billion in 2020, and the immune-system drugs are projected to make up almost half of Bristol-Myers’ sales by that time. Lung cancer is the biggest killer in oncology, according to the American Cancer Society, and the drugs have thus far been largely approved for cancers that affect fewer patients. Bristol-Myers does not have any plans to alter its focus just yet or diversify away from cancer. “It is clear, because of our track record of success, the expectations are high,” chief executive officer Giovanni Caforio said in a telephone interview on Friday. “It does really not change our focus and it does not change the long-term potential of Opdivo; it does not impact our commitment to making immuno-oncology the central pillar of our strategy.” Friday’s results also expose the difference between the development strategies at Bristol-Myers and Merck, which has a competing drug in the same class, called Keytruda. Merck designed its study to exclude patients with lower levels of a key biomarker thought to predict response to the drug. While that meant a smaller market, it meant a higher probability of success — and the trial reported positive results in June. Bristol-Myers’ trial included patients with lower levels of the biomarker. Caforio said Bristol-Myers is still pushing ahead in studying previously untreated patients, but with combination drugs that could help more patients respond to the treatments, rather than just the ones with the highest levels of biomarkers in their tumors. Those results might not be ready until 2018. “Our strategy continues to be the best strategy,” Caforio said. The expectation is “not that every single trial will work, and it’s not about who wins every time one trial is completed,” he said. This story has been viewed 1701 times. Comments will be moderated.

Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, this indication for KEYTRUDA is approved based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. For HNSCC patients, PD-L1 testing is not needed prior to use of KEYTRUDA. The approval is based on data from the KEYNOTE-012 study, which included patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who had disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy or following platinum-containing chemotherapy administered as part of induction, concurrent, or adjuvant therapy and ECOG performance status (PS) of zero or one. The data showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 16 percent (95% ci:11)(95% ci:22), complete response rate of five percent, with responses of six months or longer observed in 82 percent (n=23/28) of the responding patients. ORR and duration of response were similar regardless of human papilloma virus (HPV) status. Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred with KEYTRUDA including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and nephritis. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Female patients of reproductive potential should be advised of the potential hazard to a fetus. For more information regarding immune-mediated adverse reactions and use in pregnancy, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below. “Today’s approval represents a meaningful advance for the oncology community, as well as for our head and neck cancer clinical program,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “Together with prior approvals in the treatment of other tumor types, today’s action by the FDA underscores our tireless commitment to addressing the unmet needs of patients suffering from a broad range of cancers.” KEYNOTE-012 was the first clinical study to investigate the role of a PD-1 inhibitor in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Merck currently has the largest immuno-oncology clinical development program, including multiple registration-enabling studies in head and neck cancer, and is conducting research investigating KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with chemotherapy compared to the current standard of care. “Head and neck cancer is a complex disease that historically has been associated with high recurrence rates and poor long-term outcomes, highlighting the critical need for new treatment options,” said Dr. Tanguy Seiwert, associate director of the Head and Neck Cancer Program and assistant professor of medicine at The University of Chicago. “The approval of KEYTRUDA for previously treated patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is an important step forward in treating this disease.” KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. “Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma presents unique challenges including limited treatment options, especially for patients with recurrent or metastatic disease,” said Holly Boykin, executive director, Head and Neck Cancer Alliance. “We welcome the approval of KEYTRUDA as a new treatment option for people whose lives are impacted by this devastating disease.” Data Supporting the Approval The accelerated FDA approval was based on a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, multi-cohort phase 1b study, KEYNOTE-012, that evaluated safety in 192 patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC and ECOG PS of zero or one; efficacy was evaluated in 174 of these patients who had disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy administered for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC or following platinum-containing chemotherapy administered as part of induction, concurrent, or adjuvant therapy. Patients were enrolled regardless of tumor HPV status (33% were HPV-positive). The median number of prior lines of therapy administered for the treatment of HNSCC was two. Nearly all (95%) of the patients enrolled had prior radiation therapy. Patients received KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) at a dose of 10 mg/kg every two weeks (n=53) or a 200 mg fixed dose every three weeks (n=121) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients without disease progression were treated for up to 24 months. Treatment with KEYTRUDA could be reinitiated for subsequent disease progression and administered for up to one additional year. The primary efficacy outcome measures were ORR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR), and duration of response. Efficacy analysis showed an ORR of 16 percent (95% ci:11)(95% ci:22) with a complete response rate of five percent. The median follow-up time was 8.9 months. Among the 28 responding patients, the median duration of response had not been reached (range 2.4+ to 27.7+ months), with 23 patients having responses of six months or longer. The ORR and duration of response were similar irrespective of dosage regimen (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 200 mg every 3 weeks) or HPV status. In HNSCC, serious adverse reactions occurred in 45 percent of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least two percent of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The incidence of adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, was similar between dosage regimens (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 200 mg every 3 weeks). The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue (46%), decreased appetite (22%), and dyspnea (20%). Adverse reactions in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3-4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism. About KEYTRUDA [®] (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single use vial. KEYTRUDA Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy, at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not yet been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA [®]  (pembrolizumab) Immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging and administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. Hypophysitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. New or worsening hypothyroidism occurred in 28 (14.6%) of 192 patients, including Grade 3 (0.5%) hypothyroidism. Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer anti-hyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. Other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. Severe and life-threatening infusion-related reactions have been reported in 3 (0.1%) of 2117 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17 percent of 192 patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45 percent of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2 percent of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue (46%), decreased appetite (22%), and dyspnea (20%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. Safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA have not been established in pediatric patients.

On Friday, they felt the other side of that concentrated bet. The drop in the shares Friday -- the worst in more than 16 years -- had as much to do with the failure of Bristol-Myers’s drug Opdivo in a clinical trial for lung cancer as it did with investors’ now-shaken confidence in the New York-based company’s ability to be the breakaway leader in the field. It’s also a stark reminder of the risks of drug development. No other large pharmaceutical company has recently focused on one disease area like Bristol-Myers has, in this case by targeting drugs that leverage the immune system to attack tumors. The trial results, which showed that Opdivo failed to do better than chemotherapy at keeping previously untreated patients’ cancer from progressing, have left the door open for competitors like Merck & Co., AstraZeneca Plc and Roche Holding AG. Bristol-Myers shares were down 16 percent to $63.28 at the close in New York. Merck gained 10 percent to $63.86. Massive Market Immunotherapy is a market potentially worth billions of dollars a year -- Opdivo is predicted by analysts to bring in $10.7 billion in 2020, and the immune-system drugs are projected to make up almost half of Bristol-Myers’s sales by that time. Lung cancer is the biggest killer in oncology, according to the American Cancer Society, and the drugs have thus far been largely approved for cancers that affect fewer patients. “Given that we expect lung cancer to be the largest immuno-oncology indication, this is a seismic event in terms of market share implications,” Alex Arfaei, an analysts with BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients about the Opdivo trial results. He has a market perform rating on the shares. Even with the drop, Bristol-Myers is an expensive stock to own. The 11-member Standard & Poor’s 500 Pharmaceuticals Index, which includes Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc., Merck, along with Bristol-Myers, has a price-to-earnings ratio of 24. Before Friday’s drop, Bristol-Myers was trading at a ratio of 36. It’s been more expensive than the rest of the index since 2013. Bristol-Myers doesn’t have any plans to alter its focus just yet or diversify away from cancer. ‘Expectations Are High’ “It is clear, because of our track record of success, the expectations are high,” Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Caforio said in a phone interview Friday. “It does really not change our focus and it does not change the long-term potential of Opdivo; it does not impact our commitment to making immuno-oncology the central pillar of our strategy.” That’s not necessarily the approach everyone would like to see the company take, especially with a highly-valued stock that could have been used for deals. “They could’ve made acquisitions,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. analyst John Boris said in a phone interview. The company has acted slowly even as a falling biotech stock market meant some targets might have been available at a discount, he said. “They should’ve been considering how to diversity that revenue stream.” He has a neutral rating on the stock. Different R&D Strategies Friday’s results also expose the difference between the development strategies at Bristol-Myers and Merck, which has a competing drug in the same class, called Keytruda. Unlike Bristol-Myers, Merck designed its study to exclude patients with lower levels of a key biomarker thought to predict response to the drug. While that meant a smaller market, it meant a higher probability of success -- and the trial reported positive results in June. Bristol-Myers’ trial included patients with lower levels of the biomarker. CEO Caforio said Bristol-Myers is still pushing ahead in studying previously untreated patients, but with combination drugs that could help more patients respond to the treatments, rather than just the ones with the highest levels of biomarkers in their tumors. Those results may not be ready until 2018, however. “Our strategy continues to be the best strategy,” Caforio said. The expectation is “not that every single trial will work, and it’s not about who wins every time one trial is completed.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The amount is the value that investors wiped off the pharmaceutical company on Friday morning after its trial to greatly broaden the use of one of its most promising cancer drugs failed. It was an unnecessarily risky move for Bristol, whose immunotherapy has been outselling Merck’s. The stumble will allow its more cautious rival to clean up. Bristol’s Opdivo and Merck’s Keytruda are shaping up to be two of the biggest blockbusters for the pharmaceutical industry. The drugs have proved to be effective against forms of lung, skin, kidney and other cancers by cutting the brakes on the immune system’s response. In the second quarter, Bristol sold $840 million of Opdivo – almost seven times as much as in the same period last year. Photo Opdivo, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Credit Bristol-Myers Squibb Taking on lung cancer use has provided the most glittering prize. Sales of Opdivo, Keytruda and related drugs for lung cancer will exceed $20 billion in 2022, according to Cowen. The biggest chunk of this will come from previously untreated patients. The way to bring in even more revenue is to show that such drugs work on more forms of cancer and to use these treatments earlier. Merck took a relatively safe path. It proved in June that Keytruda worked in untreated non-small-cell lung cancer patients in whom at least 50 percent of the tumor cells produced a protein called PD-L1. Various trials have shown that the success of Keytruda and Opdivo is highly linked, but not entirely, to having cells that produce this protein. There are not, however, many patients with such a high amount of PD-L1. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times Bristol went for the win. Its drug already sells more than two times as much as Merck’s, and it created a trial to widen this lead, focusing on patients with tumors with just 5 percent or more of cells producing PD-L1. That is a far harder target to hit, but it would also have opened up a lot more patients to treatment. Bristol will probably have to wait until 2018 to hit back at its rival. That is when a trial of Opdivo in combination with another drug for treating lung cancer should report. Earlier trials suggest this is a remarkably effective way to treat the disease. Until then, Merck has a clear path to gain market share – and the $11 billion added to its market value on Friday morning implies shareholders agree. It is an expensive therapy for Bristol’s hubris.

(AAPL) and Tiffany & Co. (TIF) View All Posts Breaking news and a long-term bottom in a fan-favorite stock take the lead on this morning’s Three Big Stock Charts. Just a short time ago, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) announced that the trial of their drug named Opdivo did not meet endpoint survival goals. The news has Bristol-Myers shares gapping lower while Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) shares are surging on increased sales implications of Keytruda due to less competition. From the longer view, Fitbit Inc (NYSE:FIT) shares have gained some traction that’s worth taking a closer look. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY) As mentioned, Bristol-Myers announced that a trial investigating the use of Opdivo did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The results of the news have Bristol-Myers shares trading around $63, almost 16% lower than last nights close. The gap lower will wipe out 12 months of growth for Bristol-Myers, likely sparking a round of intermediate- and long-term selling as the stock will almost instantly shift from a long-term bull market trend to a bearish trend. This move, like any other fast decline, will also create a short-term oversold signal from Bristol-Myers RSI readings. Traders should watch for this to combine with round-numbered support from the $60 price level to potentially grab the stock for a dead cat bounce that could pocket 5% to 10% after this move, or steer clear of the shares as a new technical trend will need to form in reaction to today’s shake-up. Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) The winner of Bristol-Myers’ bad news is Merck & Co whose drug, Keytruda just lost a key competitor in the market. The results in pre-market trading had Merck shares trading 17% higher. The move higher fortifies a long-term transition that had already been in the works for Merck shares after they spent the last three months transitioning into an intermediate-term bullish trend with its 200-day moving average shifting into an ascending pattern. In addition, today’s move will increase the momentum readings for Merck based on its MACD. Like Bristol-Myers, Merck is likely to see some regression from this short-term move as traders will take the opportunity to close out some large profits. However, due to the impact on long-term fundamentals, any overbought selling should be shallow and limited. In other words, this trend is likely to hold and become even stronger as Merck moves into New High territory. Fitbit Inc (FIT) Traders have been looking for an opportunity to make money on Fitbit on every dip since the stock topped out over $50 and it looks like they’ve got their chance now after bottoming at $12.50. Fitbit shares have spent the last three months trying to build a bottom above $12.50, successfully. Now, the most recent earnings report has given the shares a fundamental driver and even some hope that the company may be eyed as an acquisition target. Priceline Group Inc: Don’t Trust the Post-Earnings Rally in PCLN Stock Fitbit shares are a little overbought right now according to their short-term RSI. However, the trendline improvements are suggesting that there is additional upside for the stock. This week, the 20-day moving average is crossing above the 50-day moving average. In-house we refer to this as a “silver cross.” The last occurrence of this pattern was in April ahead of a 20% rally in shares over a one-month period. As of this writing, the Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

 Bristol-Myers drug fails lung cancer study, shares plunge Associated Press Aug. 5, 2016, 4:36 PM 21 facebook linkedin twitter email print FILE - In this June 15 2005 file photo, a sign stands in front of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's headquarters in Lawrence Township, N.J. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s blockbuster cancer treatment Opdivo failed a key study focusing on its use as a lone treatment for lung cancer, prompting a stock plunge, Friday, Aug. 5, 2016. The drug is already approved as a treatment for melanoma, kidney cancer and lung cancer following chemotherapy. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) syndication.ap.org NEW YORK (AP) — A blockbuster cancer treatment failed in a key study as the drug's maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, attempts to extend its usage for lung cancer patients. Shares of the New York company plunged 16 percent Friday, its biggest one-day drop in 14 years. Shares of rival Merck & Co., which makes a rival cancer drug, spiked 10 percent to reach an 18-year high. Bristol's drug, Opdivo, and Merck's drug Keytruda are immunotherapies, which bolster the immune system so that patients can better fight cancer. Both drugs are already approved to treat melanoma and lung cancer, but only after chemotherapy. In June, Merck reported positive results from a key study focusing on Keytruda as a lone treatment for lung cancer. The negative results from Bristol appear to put Merck in the lead for treating cancer patients without resorting to chemotherapy and its drastic side effects. The latest late-stage study for Opdivo involved 541 patients who had received no prior treatment for lung cancer. "We remain committed to improving patient outcomes through our comprehensive development program," said Bristol-Myers CEO Dr. Giovanni Caforio. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. slumped $12.04 to $63.28. ____ This story has been corrected to show that Bristol-Myers Squibb is based in New York, not Princeton, New Jersey.

Meet the Contributors → Merck Surges As Bristol’s Immunotherapy Drug Stumbles in Lung Cancer Ben Fidler August 5th, 2016 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Boston —  Over the past few years, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck have brought to market two rival immunotherapy drugs, so-called checkpoint inhibitors, that have begun to change the way certain cancers are treated. But immunotherapy still has a long way to go, and Bristol provided the latest evidence Friday morning, when its drug, nivolumab (Opdivo), failed a late-stage trial in patients with previously untreated lung cancer. The drug didn’t lead to a statistically significant improvement in what’s known as progression-free survival; it didn’t do a better job than chemotherapy of keeping tumors from spreading. The news sent ripples through the public markets, as Bristol-Myers (NASDSAQ: BMY) shares fell more than 16 percent in early trading, eliminating billions in market value. Rival Merck (NYSE: MRK), on the other hand surged more than 7 percent. Merck’s drug, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), is also being developed for lung cancer patients who have yet to be treated with chemotherapy. “This is a major surprise, possibly the biggest clinical surprise of my career,” wrote ISI Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum in a note to investors on Friday. Indeed, the failure of the trial, which compared nivolumab to platinum-based chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients, is a setback for Bristol, which has rode its immunotherapy franchise—led by nivolumab and an earlier immunotherapy drug, ipilimumab (Yervoy)—to significant success. Since March 2011, when ipilimumab was approved for melanoma, Bristol shares had tripled. Nivolumab has followed and picked up FDA approvals in skin, lung (following chemotherapy), and kidney cancers, as well one form of Hodgkin lymphoma. In the most recent quarter, nivolumab and ipiliumamb generated almost $1.1 billion in sales worldwide. In doing so, nivolumab had separated itself from Merck’s pembrolizumab, which was second to market and banked $314 million worldwide in the most recent quarter. Still, both drugs have been significant not just as revenue producers, but in helping kickstart what’s been a huge investment in cancer immunotherapy. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab—which help the immune system identify tumors—have produced encouraging results so far, but still only work in a fraction of patients. They and other checkpoint inhibitors have become the backbone of a slew of combination trials, through which companies are trying to figure out how to make the non-responders respond, how to make responses last longer, and how to broaden the use of immunotherapy overall. Many questions as to why checkpoint drugs don’t work more frequently remain, and one of them has to do with a certain biomarker. In the trial that failed today, Bristol enrolled patients whose tumors expressed at least some levels of a protein known as PD-L1. PD-L1 levels are seen as a way to predict response to checkpoint drugs like nivolumab and pembrolizumab, but it’s unclear how much is needed to generate a response. “It’s somewhat of a quagmire,” Cancer Research Institute CEO Jill O’Donnell-Tormey told Xconomy in an interview in June. Although there seems to be a trend that more PD-L1 expression may lead to better responses, “some patients don’t show expression of PD-L1 but still respond, and vice versa.” At the time, O’Donnell Tormey pointed specifically to how different companies have evaluated PD-L1 expression differently. Bristol, for example, enrolled patients whose tumors express at least 5 percent PD-L1. Merck enrolled patients whose tumors have at least 50 percent PD-L1 expression. The results have now come back for both companies, and Merck has reaped the rewards for its choice. Nivolumab failed, while Merck disclosed in June that its drug helped lung cancer patients with at least 50 PD-L1 expression live longer, and hold tumors in check longer, than those on chemotherapy in a Phase 3 trial. Lung cancer is the second most common cause of cancer (behind skin cancer) and is the leading cause of cancer related deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. The ACS predicts 224,390 new cases and 158,080 deaths from the disease this year alone. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for 80 to 85 percent of cases, according to the ACS. Schoenebaum estimated in a note that the market for first-line non-small cell lung cancer is more than $12 billion, and that consensus estimates for nivolumab’s peak sales in first-line lung cancer were anywhere from $7 billion to $8 billion before today. Bristol, it’s worth noting, still has another trial ongoing in first-line lung cancer, a study called Checkmate-227 testing nivolulmab in combination with ipilimumab. As Leerink Partners’ Seamus Fernandez wrote in a research note Friday morning, today’s Phase 3 failure “narrows the opportunity for front-line monotherapy substantially, [and] places a heavy reliance” on Checkmate-227.

The stock was down 16 percent to $63.05 at 12:03 p.m. Friday in New York. Shares of Merck & Co., the maker of Opdivo’s main competitor Keytruda, jumped 6.9 percent to $61.83 after rising as much as 8.2 percent, the most since 2009. The drug failure as a first-line treatment is a blow to Bristol-Myers, which has pegged its growth on immune-based therapies such as Opdivo for cancers. Lung cancer is a significant opportunity for these treatments, which have thus far been largely approved for cancers that affect fewer patients. Opdivo is approved in lung cancer, though not as a first-line therapy, a large growth opportunity for cancer drugs. “This is a major surprise -- possibly the biggest clinical surprise of my career,” Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum, who recommends holding Bristol-Myers stock, wrote in a note. “Investors had high expectations for this trial.” The results reflected a risky but potentially lucrative bet by Bristol-Myers, highlighting a difference in strategy with Merck. By designing its study to include patients with lower levels of a key biomarker thought to predict response to the drug, Bristol-Myers was aiming at a far larger market for Opdivo. Merck’s Keytruda trial, meanwhile, focused on a smaller subset with high levels of the biomarker, called PD-L1 -- fewer patients, but a better chance of success. Opdivo didn’t meet its primary goal of lengthening progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, compared with chemotherapy, Bristol-Myers said in a statement. The New York-based company is working on completing an evaluation of the late-stage trial’s results. Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Caforio said the company is now focused on combination therapies, which could potentially create a better outcome for the group of patients that don’t get results on drugs like Opdivo alone. “We have a very broad development program in lung cancer and we are answering a number of very important questions,” Caforio said in a phone interview Friday. “The role of monotherapy might be limited to a very small subset of patients in the first-line setting, which makes our program now ideally suited to address the next question, which is: ‘What is the role of combination therapy?”’ That will come from a study that analysts said would likely read out in 2018.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter In June, Merck said that its related trial of patients with lung cancer had succeeded in lengthening the time it took for their tumors to progress. There was one key difference, though -- Merck’s trial tested Keytruda in patients whose tumors had the PD-L1 biomarker on at least 50 percent of their cancer cells. The patients in Bristol-Myers’ trial had to have the biomarker only on 5 percent or more of their cells. Rivals Gain Shares of other competitors also rose. AstraZeneca Plc, which is behind Bristol-Myers in developing combinations of immune therapies, gained 1.2 percent to 5,215 pence at 4:20 p.m. in London. Roche Holding AG, the maker of Tecentriq, increased 2.2 percent to 251 Swiss francs in Zurich. Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at Leerink Partners LLC who rate Bristol-Myers stock outperform, called the trial’s outcome the “worst case scenario.” In the long term, analysts including Schoenebaum and Tony Butler of Guggenheim Securities say all is not gloom for the drugmaker, and investors are already looking forward to the combination-therapy trial. “It’s a setback for Bristol in the low-expression patients, but I’m not sure it is a long term setback,” said Butler, who recommends buying the stock. “The more important question is around combination therapy. They showed at some recent cancer meetings that combination therapy was incredibly, incredibly strong.” Before Friday, analysts estimated Bristol’s immune therapies Yervoy and Opdivo will contribute more than half of the company’s sales by 2020, and second-quarter results showed their importance: Sales of the drugs contributed to a 46 percent increase in U.S. revenue. Opdivo’s quarterly sales rose more than sixfold to $840 million. Total revenue for the drug last year were $942 million and have been projected to rise to $7.7 billion by 2018.

In addition to Phase 1 studies assessing its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, the NDA submission for MK-1293 includes results of two Phase 3 studies, one conducted in people with type 1 diabetes, and one in people with type 2 diabetes; Lantus [® ] (insulin glargine) [2] , the originator insulin glargine, was the active comparator in both studies. The NDA was filed through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway [3] , which allows the FDA to reference previous findings of safety and efficacy for an already-approved product (Lantus), in addition to reviewing findings from studies of MK-1293. Separately, the Marketing Authorization Application for MK-1293, which Merck submitted to the European Medicines Agency in December 2015, is currently under review.

The volume of the investment is around € 15 million; the location will be decided in the coming weeks. The manufacture of the switchable glass modules is scheduled to begin at the end of 2017. The investment in liquid crystal window technology is an important step as part of the company’s LC 2021 strategic initiative. With this, Merck is pursuing the goal of leveraging its market and technology leadership in liquid crystals beyond their use in displays. In June 2014, Merck acquired Peer+, a Dutch specialist for liquid crystal window technology, with which it had been collaborating closely since 2011. Switchable liquid crystal windows (LCW) can currently achieve two effects: They darken the glass to provide sun protection or they make the glass opaque to provide privacy. They are primarily used in architecture; automotive applications are being developed. To achieve faster market penetration of the new technology, Merck has now additionally set up an independent business field for liquid crystal window technology. Like the liquid crystals business, it is part of the Display Materials business unit within Performance Materials.   Walter Galinat “We see this as a major opportunity to shape the market for liquid crystals in windows. Yet it does not mean that we will be competing with glass and window manufacturers. The LCW modules that we will be manufacturing are in a sense precursor products. Our customers can process them to make smart windows and glass façades,” states Walter Galinat, Member of the Executive Board of Merck and CEO of Performance Materials. There are already first pilot applications for liquid crystal windows: The window façade on the west side of Merck’s modular Innovation Center in Darmstadt has been fitted with the new LC windows for over one year now and is being received very positively. The new OLED production building currently being constructed at the Darmstadt site has also been fitted with LC windows that already provide improved energy and light management.     Transparent and color-neutral shading– automatic or at the touch of a button Liquid crystal window In order to protect against solar radiation, liquid crystal windows allow continuously variable switching from dark to light and vice versa in just seconds, which can be controlled either automatically or manually. Compared with competitive technologies, the materials offered under the licrivision brand name have high color neutrality. The desired color can be customized to suit the setting. In addition, they remain crystal-clear even at a slanted viewing angle. Therefore, smart windows in buildings offer architects the possibility to use a lot of glass and create transparent spatial concepts. At the same time, they contribute significantly to a sustainable building climate control system. Initial measurements have shown energy savings of up to 40%. Light transmission can be varied in a range of up to 70% in the light switching state and at least 5% in the dark switching state. Long-term tests prove the longevity of the materials. They operate perfectly, from the icy cold of a winter’s night to the afternoon heat of a midsummer’s day. They are just as easy to integrate in façades and to clean as conventional windows. For privacy control, the windows allow switching from transparent to opaque, which is suitable for use such as in conference rooms within public buildings or bedrooms in the home environment.   Dedicated production unit for liquid crystal window modules to achieve faster market penetration Production is scheduled to begin at the end of 2017 Focus on sun protection and privacy applications in architecture 600450 www.merckgroup.com 2016-08-05T13:00:00 Merck Invests € 15 million in Liquid Crystal Window Technology glassonweb.com WhatsApp LINKEDIN FACEBOOK TWITTER GOOGLE + PRINT MORE Date: 5 August 2016Source: www.merckgroup.com 0 comments Insert your comment See more news about: Glass Facades Smart Glass Switchable Glass Windows See more from these topics: Doors & Windows Facades, Building Envelopes and Systems Green & Sustainable Building Others also read MORE...

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excluding some costs, rose 29 percent to 1.16 billion euros ($1.29 billion) in the three-month period, boosted by the acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich in November, the Darmstadt, Germany-based drugs and chemicals maker said in a statement on Thursday. That’s higher than the 1.1 billion-euro average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The results may bolster Chief Executive Officer Stefan Oschmann’s efforts to pare the debt accrued from last year’s $17 billion acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich. Sales at the company’s biggest business, its pharmaceuticals unit, have been weighed down by the stronger U.S. dollar and rising competition for its top-selling medicine, Rebif. “We expect interest in the Merck KGaA equity story to continue increasing,” Peter Verdult, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in a note to clients on Thursday. “Merck still offers a relatively attractive valuation, earnings momentum and scope for pipeline appreciation to further improve.” Drought Ending Merck’s shares fell 1.2 percent to 97.07 euros as of 9:11 a.m. in Frankfurt trading. The stock has climbed 9.6 percent this year. The German company raised the range of its forecast for sales this year to 14.9 billion euros to 15.1 billion euros, from an earlier projection of 14.8 billion euros to 15 billion euros. Ebitda before special items will climb to 4.25 billion euros to 4.4 billion euros, instead of the earlier forecast of 4.1 billion euros to 4.3 billion euros. Revenue from the healthcare unit declined by 2.7 percent in the quarter to 1.8 billion euros. But profit climbed by 16 percent to 557 million euros, partly because of the sale of a minority stake held by its venture fund. Merck is looking to a $2 billion-collaboration pact with Pfizer Inc. for developing cancer therapies to start contributing to growth next year, when the first of the treatments is expected to reach patients, ending a 10-year drought in new medicines at the company. Multiple sclerosis drug Rebif, which faces competition from oral treatments, as well as cancer drug Erbitux and fertility treatment Gonal-f continued to account for the biggest share of prescription-drug sales in the most recent quarter. The company’s net income in the second quarter was eroded by a “sharp increase” in variable-compensation costs because of the gains in the stock price, Merck said. Its net debt level declined to 12.5 billion euros from 12.7 billion euros at the end of December.

(NYSE: MRK) from Market Perform to Outperform, boosting his price target by $10, to $72. Bristol said that its CheckMate-026 study in first-line NSCLC had not managed to meet its primary PFS endpoint, and BMO analysts see this as a positive event for Merck’s Keytruda. In fact, they anticipate “seismic commercial market share implications,” given that they expect NSCLC to be the biggest IO indication. Following this development, BMO now argues that Keytruda will probably dominate the first line (1L) NSCLC space, where patients are not only healthier, but also receive more aggressive treatment over a longer period of time. Related Link: Bristol's Opdivo Misses Endpoint In Late-Stage Trial: Merck Rallies Sharply Amid Keytruda Potential The report explained that the most relevant difference with its own KN-042 trial and Bristol’s CM-026 study is that “the primary endpoint for KN-042 is OS (NOT PFS), where there is better data.” Thus, they now see a higher chance of success for KN-042, and have consequently upped their estimates to reflect this potential. The firm now forecast that Merck will see revenue CAGR of 5 percent and EPS growth of at least 14 percent from 2016 to 2020. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

But when it’s time to collate the results, she often shuttles from machine to machine gathering information. “I have to go to each piece of equipment individually to transfer the data or access each device remotely,” says Rieder, a biologist at Philochem, a Swiss biotechnology company. “It would help if all the lab equipment were somehow connected.” There is, as they say, an app for that—and soon there will be many, as pharmaceutical companies, lab-equipment makers, and startups seek to solve the problem. While the technology in machines such as gene sequencers, centrifuges, and bioreactors keeps advancing, individual devices rarely communicate with one another. In many labs, technicians rely on screen shots, pens, and paper to share data, an inefficient process that increases the risk of mistakes. “There’s a lot of manual typing-in,” says Dana Vanderwall, an executive at drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb. Researchers should be able to “focus on doing science and not on the idiosyncrasies of this or that piece of equipment or this or that data format.” “I have to go to each piece of equipment individually to transfer the data or access each device remotely. It would help if all the lab equipment were somehow connected.” —Ulrike Rieder, a Philochem biologist Germany’s Merck KGaA is developing software that automates experiments and predicts when machines are about to run out of chemicals or other materials, then allows one-click ordering of supplies—“the Amazon of life science,” as Merck executive Udit Batra puts it. GlaxoSmithKline, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and more than a dozen other companies are collaborating through the nonprofit Allotrope Foundation to develop common standards for lab data. Proponents say these could one day organize scientific results much as HTML provides a lingua franca for websites, no matter the browser used. Efforts to smooth the research process are hampered by the large number of companies that make lab equipment. They all have their own software, and for complex experiments each machine may need separate instructions. Allotrope is developing standards intended to be device-agnostic, allowing scientists using different equipment to collaborate seamlessly. Equipment manufacturers are working on proprietary systems optimized for devices they sell. Thermo Fisher Scientific offers a web platform for uploading data and analyzing it using a suite of apps, with the ability to monitor experiments remotely from a smartphone. The goal is “driving the inefficiencies of the currently cobbled-together data analysis out of the system,” says Joe Beery, Thermo Fisher’s chief information officer. “The researchers just want the answer.” London startup Synthace seeks to foster communication with what it dubs an operating system for lab equipment. The system, called Antha, lets scientists specify what they’re trying to study, suggests experiments, and controls lab hardware, pausing when necessary to prompt a human to, for example, insert a new plate of liquid samples. The experimental steps and data are recorded in a common format. Synthace has developed “drivers”—not unlike those a computer uses to communicate with printers—for a dozen devices from about 10 manufacturers, including Roche and PerkinElmer. Synthace’s Antha operating system for lab equipment. Eventually, Synthace says, use of Antha could become widespread enough that compatibility with the system will be a selling point for a device, encouraging manufacturers to create drivers themselves. The company in October announced a partnership with Merck (no relation to Merck KGaA), and it’s in negotiations with four other major pharma companies to bring Antha into their labs. Dow Chemical is using Antha to design crop chemicals. “It’s taken me about five years of associating with computer programmers to realize they’ve got much more sophisticated tools” than many scientists, says co-founder Markus Gershater, a biochemist and Synthace’s chief scientific officer. “That’s not a hardware problem—the hardware’s fantastic. It’s a software problem.” —With Doni Bloomfield The bottom line: Equipment makers and startups are racing to streamline scientific research by enabling lab machines to communicate.

Shares of the Princeton, N.J., company plunged 17% when trading opened Friday. Shares of rival Merck & Co., which makes a rival cancer drug, spiked 8% to reach a one-year high. Bristol's drug, Opdivo, and Merck's drug Keytruda are immunotherapies, which bolster the immune system so that patients can better fight cancer. Both drugs are already approved to treat melanoma and lung cancer, but only after chemotherapy. In June, Merck reported positive results from a key study focusing on Keytruda as a lone treatment for lung cancer. The negative results from Bristol appear to put Merck in the lead for treating cancer patients without resorting to chemotherapy and its drastic side effects. The latest late-stage study for Opdivo involved 541 patients who had received no prior treatment for lung cancer. "We remain committed to improving patient outcomes through our comprehensive development program," said Bristol-Myers CEO Dr. Giovanni Caforio. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. slumped $12.82 to $62.50.

Bristol-Myers stock (BMY) ended the day down 16% after the company reported that the drug Opdivo did not achieve its goals for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Merck stock (MRK) rose 10.4% as investors anticipated that the company's rival drug Keytruda could benefit. Bristol-Myers said its clinical trial, referred to as CheckMate -026, was "disappointing." Opdivo is already on the market as a treatment for certain types of melanoma and Hodgkin lymphoma, for example, but Friday's results mean it may not win the Food and Drug Administration's approval for treatment of this type of lung cancer. Researchers had hoped that Opdivo could capitalize on hopes in the medical community that certain types of cancer can be combated by unleashing the body's immune system against the disease. "Bristol-Myers Squibb is proud of all that the company has and aims to accomplish with Opdivo," the company said in a statement. "We are indeed transforming cancer care, and remain committed to bringing the benefit of our medicines to the greatest number of patients across multiple cancers." To be sure, Opdivo remains a significant asset for Bristol-Myers. Second-quarter sales of the drug soared from $122 million a year ago to $840 million this year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Sales rose 17% from the first quarter of 2016 to the second quarter.

 The $75 billion biotech giant Biogen surged on a report of a potential takeover Portia Crowe Aug. 2, 2016, 2:52 PM 9,276 facebook linkedin twitter email print Biogen, the $75 billion biotech giant, surged on Tuesday after a report that it had received takeover interest. The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that Merck and Allergan have each informally expressed interest in doing a deal. The talk of a takeover comes just days after Biogen said that its CEO, George Scangos, would leave the company after six years at its helm. A takeover of Biogen would be the biggest of a biotech company since 2008, and one of the largest takeovers by a drug company on record. RBC's Michael Yee predicted in a note on Tuesday that a takeover could value Biogen at $375 to $475 a share. It was trading around $300 a share before the news broke earlier on Tuesday. Investing.com Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen makes drugs that treat multiple sclerosis and hemophilia, and its main focus overall is on neurological and autoimmune diseases, as well as rare diseases. As Business Insider's Lydia Ramsey reports, Biogen on Monday officially got the rights to sell a promising spinal muscular atrophy drug globally. The drug, nusinersen, succeeded in a late-stage trial, the company said. Drugmakers embarked on a record deal-making spree in 2014 and 2015, as they sought to rebuild drug pipelines as older drugs lost patent protection. Several of the largest biotech takeovers of those years became fiercely competitive as huge drugmakers tapped low-cost debt for the spending. A representative for Allergan said that the company "does not comment on market rumor or speculation." A representative for Merck also declined to comment. Biogen could not immediately be reached for comment.

Mumps outbreak in Long Island likely caused by vaccine-resistant virus; majority of those affected were immunized Saturday, August 06, 2016 by: Isabelle Z. Tags: mumps outbreak, vaccine shedding, MMR vaccine (NaturalNews) Long Beach has been hit with a mumps outbreak that is vaccine-resistant. According to health officials in the Long Island town, almost two dozen individuals are believed to have contracted the virus, with four confirmed cases and at least 14 suspected ones. All of the cases involve people in their 20s, and the outbreak is being attributed to a new vaccine-resistant strain of the virus. In fact, most of those who have contracted mumps in this case have been vaccinated against it. Despite this, officials are actually urging people who have been in contact with those who are infected to get a mumps booster shot! If this strain of the virus is vaccine-resistant, and those who have been vaccinated are getting it anyway, why should people get yet another vaccine? It's also worth noting that none of the people currently affected are seriously ill. The symptoms of mumps tend to be mild, and include swollen cheeks, a headache, body aches and low-grade fever. There is no treatment, and it usually clears up on its own in just a few days. Mumps is, however, highly contagious. It can be transmitted through the transfer of saliva, sneezing or coughing. As beach season continues in full swing, some Long Beach restaurants are even supplying diners with plastic cups as a means of stemming the outbreak. People who have symptoms of the illness are being advised to stay home for five days to avoid spreading it. Controversy over mumps component of MMR vaccine As some Natural News readers may recall, two Merck scientists filed a False Claims Act complaint back in 2010 saying that the Big Pharma firm knowingly falsified mumps vaccine data in order to come up with an efficacy rate of 95 percent. They achieved this by spiking the blood test involved with antibodies taken from animals. This not only allowed them to earn hundreds of millions of dollars from the U.S. government, but also helped them crush the competition and monopolize the vaccine market. The complainants said that Merck never tested the vaccine against actual mumps viruses out in the real world, and alleged that senior management was aware of this and allowed it to happen. That's why it's so important to seek out studies that are free from industry collusion. Mumps outbreaks becoming fairly common among the vaccinated Mumps outbreaks seem to be occurring a lot lately. Earlier this year, for example, the illness broke out at Harvard and a handful of other Boston colleges. More than three quarters of those afflicted had been vaccinated. Dozens of university students in Illinois came down with mumps last year, despite the majority of them having previously been administered two rounds of the MMR vaccine. Do you spot a trend here? It's important to note that not only does the MMR vaccine not actually prevent mumps, but it might actually be responsible for spreading it. That's because the injection contains a weakened version of the live virus, which causes an infection in the body. It can then be "shed" to other people, such as those who have not been vaccinated, or those who have compromised immune systems. That's why it makes absolutely no sense that authorities are urging people who have been exposed to get yet another vaccine. Of course, there are other reasons people might want to avoid the vaccine besides the fact that it doesn't protect against mumps. The MMR vaccine has been linked to a number of harmful effects, including neurological damage, autism, developmental delays, seizure disorders, asthma and autoimmune dysfunction, to name just a few.

Yesterday, they felt the other side of that concentrated bet. The drop in the shares yesterday — the worst in more than 16 years — had as much to do with the failure of Bristol-Myers’s drug Opdivo in a clinical trial for lung cancer as it did with investors’ now-shaken confidence in the New York-based company’s ability to be the breakaway leader in the field. It’s also a stark reminder of the risks of drug development. No other large pharmaceutical company has recently focused on one disease area like Bristol-Myers has, in this case by targeting drugs that leverage the immune system to attack tumours. The trial results, which showed that Opdivo failed to do better than chemotherapy at keeping previously untreated patients’ cancer from progressing, have left the door open for competitors like Merck & Co., AstraZeneca Plc and Roche Holding AG. Bristol-Myers shares were down 16 per cent to US$63.28 (RM255.60) at the close in New York. Merck gained 10 per cent to US$63.86. Massive market Immunotherapy is a market potentially worth billions of dollars a year — Opdivo is predicted by analysts to bring in US$10.7 billion in 2020, and the immune-system drugs are projected to make up almost half of Bristol-Myers’s sales by that time. Lung cancer is the biggest killer in oncology, according to the American Cancer Society, and the drugs have thus far been largely approved for cancers that affect fewer patients. “Given that we expect lung cancer to be the largest immuno-oncology indication, this is a seismic event in terms of market share implications,” Alex Arfaei, an analysts with BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients about the Opdivo trial results. He has a market perform rating on the shares. Even with the drop, Bristol-Myers is an expensive stock to own. The 11-member Standard & Poor’s 500 Pharmaceuticals Index, which includes Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc., Merck, along with Bristol-Myers, has a price-to-earnings ratio of 24. Before yesterday’s drop, Bristol-Myers was trading at a ratio of 36. It’s been more expensive than the rest of the index since 2013. Bristol-Myers doesn’t have any plans to alter its focus just yet or diversify away from cancer. ‘Expectations are high’ “It is clear, because of our track record of success, the expectations are high,” Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Caforio said in a phone interview yesterday. “It does really not change our focus and it does not change the long-term potential of Opdivo; it does not impact our commitment to making immuno-oncology the central pillar of our strategy.” That’s not necessarily the approach everyone would like to see the company take, especially with a highly-valued stock that could have been used for deals. “They could’ve made acquisitions,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. analyst John Boris said in a phone interview. The company has acted slowly even as a falling biotech stock market meant some targets might have been available at a discount, he said. “They should’ve been considering how to diversity that revenue stream.” He has a neutral rating on the stock. Different R&D strategies Yesterday’s results also expose the difference between the development strategies at Bristol-Myers and Merck, which has a competing drug in the same class, called Keytruda. Unlike Bristol-Myers, Merck designed its study to exclude patients with lower levels of a key biomarker thought to predict response to the drug. While that meant a smaller market, it meant a higher probability of success — and the trial reported positive results in June. Bristol-Myers’ trial included patients with lower levels of the biomarker. CEO Caforio said Bristol-Myers is still pushing ahead in studying previously untreated patients, but with combination drugs that could help more patients respond to the treatments, rather than just the ones with the highest levels of biomarkers in their tumours. Those results may not be ready until 2018, however. “Our strategy continues to be the best strategy,” Caforio said. The expectation is “not that every single trial will work, and it’s not about who wins every time one trial is completed.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Merkel ‘not happy’ Trump scrapping Pacific trade deal Malaysia refrains from cutting interest rate as ringgit tumbles Cathay Pacific now accepts ringgit for inflight transactions Automakers seek to cut inventories with Black Friday, holiday promotions Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Ministry no power to act against drug firms China detains 37 people linked to vaccine scandal French court finds pharma firm Servier responsible in deadly drug scandal The top stocks to watch in Asia today (VIDEO) Plant-based ‘plantibodies’ drugs garner attention Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Breaking News Day at a glance Weather Horoscopes Ireland Business World Showbiz #Discover Sport Tech Jobs Property Login Trump presidency Mortgage crisis Nama Syria Christmas Domestic Violence Garda strike TV Licence Jobs news sends US stocks to record highs PreviousNext 06/08/2016 - 09:38:56Back to Business Home US stocks jumped to record highs on Friday after a strong jobs report for the month of July gave investors more confidence that the economy is still growing. Financial and technology stocks soared and investors sold the safe assets they have favoured for most of this year. The Labour Department said US employers added 255,000 jobs in July, far more than investors expected and the second straight month of strong gains after shaky reports this spring. Stocks made their biggest gain in almost a month. Banks traded higher as investors anticipated higher interest rates and bigger profits on mortgages and other loans. The Nasdaq composite closed at a record high as tech stocks continued to climb. Consumer companies also made big gains. Investors sold bonds, precious metals, and phone and utility companies, safe investments that soared earlier this year as investors worried about the health of the economy. "It looks like the economy is improving, it looks like corporate earnings are on the upswing," said Sam Stovall, US equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ. That marks a change from earlier this year, he said, when investors worried the US would fall into a recession and tech companies would suffer as businesses cut spending. But tech stocks have come back to lead the market higher over the last few months. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 191.48 points, or 1%, to 18,543.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 18.62 points, or 0.9%, to 2,182.87. The Nasdaq advanced 54.87 points, or 1.1%, to 5,221.12. The strong jobs report suggests that Britain's vote to leave the European Union in late June did not have much effect on hiring plans for US companies. The unemployment rate remained at 4.9% and hourly pay continued to rise. The hiring spree follows an even larger surge in June and represents a turnaround from weak job growth in the first half of this year, including disappointing job gains in April and May. Banks rose the most, as higher interest rates boost their profits on lending. Bank of America rose 57 cents, or 3.9%, to $15.05 and Citigroup added $1.88, or 4.3%, to $45.72. Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, said the report reassured investors but will not vanquish their fears entirely. "With an election where both candidates are likely to talk about how badly the economy is doing and how disappointing growth has been, investors as a whole are more anxious than the job picture would suggest," she said. The Federal Reserve has been saying for months that it intends to raise interest rates if the economy's strength warrants it. July's report provides more evidence the economy is doing well, boosting the chances that interest rates will go up. But Warne said investor views on the economy and the Fed will keep fluctuating. "When the Fed indicates that they're data dependent, that means investors are going to be data dependent as well," she said. Bond prices fell and the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note jumped to 1.59% from 1.50%. Kraft Heinz, the company behind Oscar Mayer bologna, Jell-O pudding and Velveeta cheese, also traded higher after it reported a larger profit than analysts expected. Its stock picked up $3.25 dollars, or 3.8%, to $88.79. After Bristol-Myers Squibb said one of its cancer drugs failed in a clinical trial, its stock suffered its biggest slump since 2000. Meanwhile rival drugmaker Merck soared by the most in seven years. Bristol-Myers sank $12.04 dollars, or 16%, to $63.28 after saying its drug Opdivo did not halt progression of non-small cell lung cancer in the study. Merck makes a drug called Keytruda that also stimulates patients' immune systems to fight lung cancer. The company, which took in $533m from Keytruda this year, rose $6.02, or 10.4%, to $63.86. Merck was the largest gainer among S&P 500 stocks, and Bristol-Myers Squibb took the largest loss. Security software maker FireEye tumbled after it reported weak sales, cut its forecasts and announced job cuts. Its stock plunged 2.02 dollars, or 12.1%, to $14.73. Rival software firm Symantec disclosed a larger profit and better sales than expected in its fiscal first quarter, and its full-year profit forecast was stronger than expected. Its stock climbed 86 cents, or 4.1%, to $21.89.

Bristol-Myers Squibb got killed on Friday after the pharma powerhouse shocked investors by announcing its best-selling Opdivo — which has proved to be effective against skin, kidney and other cancers — had failed in a lung cancer trial. Its stock fell 16 percent to close at $63.28, causing more than $20 billion in shareholder value to evaporate in a single day. “This is a significant negative surprise for Bristol-Myers given the consensus expectation was for trial success,” Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in an update. Before Friday, Opdivo held such promise in the hot new field of immunotherapy that the May issue of Pharmaceutical Executive Magazine designated it “Brand of the Year.” Opdivo also excited such stock pickers as Jim Cramer, who last month praised Bristol-Myers for its “amazing oncology franchises.” And in March, after the stock climbed 30 percent from its 52-week low, he touted it on his “Mad Money” show: “Even at $66, I remain a solid buyer.” The stock continued its climb into the $70 range before a study of 541 cancer patients determined Opdivo was no better than chemotherapy in slowing the progression of advanced lung cancer. Cancer is second only to heart disease as a cause of death, according to the Centers for Disease Control. And lung cancer ranks as the leading cause of cancer death, taking more lives each year than colon, breast and prostate cancers combined, according to the American Cancer Society. Opdivo and a competing Merck drug, Keytruda, were approved as melanoma treatments in 2014. Bristol-Myers’ entry had a faster start than Merck’s, achieving second-quarter sales of $840 million and $314 million, respectively. But in vying to become a first-line lung-cancer treatment — authorized for patients new to therapy — Opdivo aimed for the entire market. In contrast, Keytruda targeted only those patients rich with tumor-produced proteins that, theoretically, gave both drugs a better chance of success. The inability of Opdivo to treat even protein-rich patients was the biggest surprise of the late-stage trial, especially since Keytruda successfully reached its “endpoints” two months ago in a narrower trial. “Merck will now likely enjoy the benefit of the only immunotherapy to be approved in first-line cancer and will enjoy this exclusivity for at least 12 months,” Merrill Lynch reported. Keytruda’s new lead on $13 billion in annual sales previously predicted for Opdivo sent Merck’s shares up 10 percent Friday to close at $63.86. And its gain of $16.7 billion — coupled with the Bristol-Myers’ loss of $20.1 billion — produced a single-day swing of nearly $37 billion between the two competitors.

By EmmaCourt Reporter Expectations were running high for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s cancer drug Opdivo as the company took on late-stage clinical trials for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, a market with blockbuster potential and one that several rival drug manufacturers also had their eye on. So when the company BMY, -0.34%  reported the trial’s failure before the opening bell on Friday, the news sent its stock plummeting as much as 19% in premarket trades. At the same time, shares of rival Merck & Co. MRK, -0.73% jumped 6.8%, and shares of AstraZeneca AZN, -0.23%  climbed 2.2%. Those two pharmaceutical companies are developing competing lung-cancer drugs. The failure “is a MAJOR SURPRISE — possibly the biggest clinical surprise of my career,” wrote longtime pharma analyst Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Read: Failed lung-cancer drug trial sends Bristol Myers stock plunging and Merck’s shares up Opdivo got top billing last week when Bristol-Myers reported its second-quarter earnings, with the blockbuster drug — already approved for four types of cancer — driving an increase in global revenues. Opdivo and Merck’s Keytruda both aim to treat non-small-cell lung cancer before chemotherapy is used, allowing for a much larger patient population. That market is likely worth more than $12 billion in total, of which Opdivo was expected to capture $7 billion to $8 billion by 2021, Schoenebaum said. But compared with Keytruda, which recently reported positive trial results, Bristol-Myers took a much more “aggressive” strategy with Opdivo, gearing it toward a larger variety of patients, said Brad Loncar, chief executive officer of Loncar Investments, which offers a cancer immunotherapy ETF CNCR, -1.34% . “Their strategy of going for as wide a patient population as possible worked very well in other stages” — until now, said Loncar, whose ETF holds shares in both Bristol-Myers and Merck.

So-called “combination therapies” have been hotly anticipated by investors in this treatment area, Schoenebaum said, so the impact of this trial’s failure “may turn out to be short-lived.” Related: Four high-quality biotech companies trading like risky startups Opdivo is “active” for first-line lung cancer, “just not as good as hoped,” not beating the effects of chemotherapy, said Leerink analysts in a Friday note. Their evaluation of Merck’s Keytruda treatment compared with Opdivo show “the products appear to perform very similarly overall,” separate from the patient population in the trials. Bristol-Myers did not expand upon potential reasons for the trial’s failure. It did, however, eliminate factors such as enrollment anomalies and the size, length and statistical analysis in conversations with Schoenebaum, he said. “I actually think they deserve credit for trying to help as many patients as possible,” Loncar said. “Sometimes it just doesn’t work out.” More from MarketWatch Opinion Journal: The New Trump Democrats Donald Trump and Mitt Romney Make Move to Reconcile No Official White House Roles for Trump's Children Related Topics U.S. Stocks Markets Investing MarketWatch Partner Center We Want to Hear from You Join the conversation Comment Luxury Real Estate Billionaire Ron Burkle is buyer behind Bob Hope’s iconic Palm Springs mansion View More Donald Trump Insight and analysis on a Donald Trump presidency View More Real Estate News Melania Trump may be right: Moving in middle of school year could mess up kids View More Investing Opinion: A 12-step plan to strengthen your portfolio after Trump's victory View More MarketWatch Site Index Topics Help Feedback Newsroom Roster Media Archive Premium Products Mobile Company Company Info Code of Conduct Corrections Advertising Media Kit Advertise Locally Reprints & Licensing Broker Center Your Ad Choices Dow Jones Network WSJ.com Barron's Online BigCharts Virtual Stock Exchange Financial News Online WSJ.com Small Business realtor.com Mansion Global Back to Top Copyright ©2016 MarketWatch, Inc.

NEW YORK — Stocks jumped to record highs Friday after a strong jobs report for the month of July gave investors more confidence that the economy is still growing. Financial and technology stocks soared and investors sold the safe assets they have favored this year. The Labor Department said employers added 255,000 jobs in July, far more than investors expected and the second straight month of strong gains after shaky reports this spring. Stocks made their biggest gain in nearly a month. Banks traded higher as investors anticipated higher interest rates and bigger profits on mortgages and other loans. The Nasdaq composite closed at a record high as tech stocks continued to climb. Consumer companies also made big gains. Investors sold bonds, precious metals, and phone and utility companies, safe investments that soared this year as investors worried about the health of the economy. “It looks like the economy is improving. It looks like corporate earnings are on the upswing,” said Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ. That marks a change from earlier this year, he said, when investors worried the United States would fall into a recession and tech companies would suffer as businesses cut spending. But tech stocks have come back to lead the market higher in the past few months. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 191.48 points, or 1 percent, to 18,543.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 18.62 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,182.87. The Nasdaq advanced 54.87 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,221.12. The strong jobs report suggests that Britain's vote to leave the European Union in late June didn't have much effect on hiring plans for U.S. companies. The unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent and hourly pay continued to rise. The hiring spree follows an even larger surge in June and represents a turnaround from weak job growth in the first half of this year, including disappointing job gains in April and May. Banks rose the most, as higher interest rates boost their profits on lending. Bank of America rose 57 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $15.05 and Citigroup added $1.88, or 4.3 percent, to $45.72. Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, said the report reassured investors but won't vanquish their fears entirely. “With an election where both candidates are likely to talk about how badly the economy is doing and how disappointing growth has been, investors as a whole are more anxious than the job picture would suggest,” she said. The Federal Reserve has been saying for months that it intends to raise interest rates if the economy's strength warrants it. July's report provides more evidence the economy is doing well, boosting the chances that interest rates will go up. But Warne said investor views on the economy and the Fed will keep fluctuating. “When the Fed indicates that they're data dependent, that means investors are going to be data dependent as well,” she said. Bond prices fell and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note jumped to 1.59 percent from 1.50 percent. Kraft Heinz, the company behind Oscar Mayer bologna, Jell-O pudding and Velveeta cheese, also traded higher after it reported a larger profit than analysts expected. Its stock picked up $3.25, or 3.8 percent, to $88.79. After Bristol-Myers Squibb said one of its cancer drugs failed in a clinical trial, its stock suffered its biggest slump since 2000. Meanwhile rival drugmaker Merck soared by the most in seven years. Bristol-Myers sank $12.04, or 16 percent, to $63.28 after saying its drug Opdivo did not halt progression of non-small cell lung cancer in the study. Merck makes a drug called Keytruda that also stimulates patients' immune systems to fight lung cancer. The company, which took in $533 million from Keytruda this year, rose $6.02, or 10.4 percent, to $63.86. Merck was the largest gainer among S&P 500 stocks, and Bristol-Myers Squibb took the largest loss. Security software maker FireEye tumbled after it reported weak sales, cut its forecasts and announced job cuts. Its stock plunged $2.02, or 12.1 percent, to $14.73. Rival software firm Symantec disclosed a larger profit and better sales than expected in its fiscal first quarter, and its full-year profit forecast was stronger than expected. Its stock climbed 86 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $21.89. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 13 cents to $41.89 per barrel in New York while Brent crude, used to price international oils, dipped 2 cents to $44.27 a barrel in London. The price of gold fell $23, or 1.7 percent, to $1,344.40 an ounce, its biggest loss since May. Silver fell 63 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $19.82 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.15 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline held steady at $1.38 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.32 a gallon. Natural gas fell 6 cents to $2.77 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar rose to 101.75 yen from 101.17 yen and the euro fell to $1.1091 from $1.1127. European stocks also advanced. France's CAC-40 rose 1.5 percent and the DAX in Germany advanced 1.4 percent. London's FTSE 100 was 0.8 percent higher. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.2 percent and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was little changed. In South Korea, the Kospi rose 0.9 percent.

That’s how much value investors wiped off the pharma firm on Friday morning after its trial to greatly broaden the use of one of its most promising cancer drugs failed. It was an unnecessarily risky move for Bristol, whose immunotherapy has been outselling Merck’s. The stumble will allow its more cautious rival to clean up. Bristol’s Opdivo and Merck’s Keytruda are shaping up to be the biggest blockbusters ever for the pharma industry. The drugs have proven to be effective against forms of lung, skin, kidney and other cancers by cutting the brakes on the immune system’s response. In the second quarter, Bristol sold $840 million of Opdivo – almost seven times as much as the same period last year. Taking on tobacco has provided the most glittering prize. Sales of Opdivo, Keytruda and related drugs for lung cancer will exceed $20 billion in 2022 according to Cowen. The biggest chunk of this will come from previously untreated patients. The key to bringing in even more revenue stems from showing such drugs work on more forms of cancer and using these treatments earlier. Merck took a relatively safe path. It proved in June that Keytruda worked in untreated non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumors had at least 50 percent of cells producing a protein called PD-L1. Various trials have shown that the success of Keytruda and Opdivo is highly linked, but not entirely, to having cells that produce this protein. There aren’t, though, too many patients with such a high amount of PD-L1. Bristol went for the kill. Its drug already sells over two times as much as Merck’s, and it designed a trial to widen this lead, targeting patients with tumors with just 5 percent or more of cells producing PD-L1. That’s a far harder target to hit, but would also have opened up a lot more patients to treatment. Bristol will now probably have to wait until 2018 to hit back at its rival. That’s when a trial of Opdivo in combination with another drug for treating lung cancer should report. Earlier trials suggest this is a remarkably effective way to treat the disease. Until then, Merck has a clear path to gain market share – and the $11 billion added to its market value Friday morning implies shareholders agree. It’s a pricey therapy for Bristol’s hubris.

The Company had $139.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2016, compared to $196.1 million at December 31, 2015. The net loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $29.0 million, or $0.75 per basic and diluted share, compared to $23.6 million, or $0.80 per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of 2015. Recent Progress During the quarter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established December 15, 2016 as the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for its review of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for HEPLISAV-B', the company's investigational vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults 18 years of age and older. In August, the FDA informed the Company that its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) is scheduled to discuss HEPLISAV-B at its meeting on November 16, 2016. The FDA has indicated it will communicate questions for the VRBPAC to address closer in time to the meeting date. Preparations for launch of HEPLISAV-B are continuing, including pre-commercial activities, manufacturing of launch inventory and continued infrastructure spending related to implementation of commercial development and information technology systems and capabilities and related increases in headcount. In June, we reported additional details from the HBV-23 pivotal Phase 3 HEPLISAV-B trial at the 76th Annual Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association (ADA). We presented encouraging additional data from Part 1 of the Phase 1/2 study evaluating our lead immunotherapy product candidate, SD-101, in lymphoma patients in April at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. Recently our collaborator, Merck, initiated a Phase 1 study of SD-101 in combination with its immunomodulator MK-1966 in cancer patients. Financials Total revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $2.6 million compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2015. Revenue primarily reflects research and development revenues from our collaboration with AstraZeneca. Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2016 were $22.8 million compared to $19.7 for the same period in 2015. This $3.1 million increase was primarily due to an increase in employee headcount and regulatory and manufacturing activities in preparation for the anticipated commercial launch of HEPLISAV-B, partially offset by a reduction in outside services expense associated with the completion of HBV-23 in the fourth quarter of 2015. General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2016 were $9.2 million compared to $5.1 for the same period in 2015. This $4.1 million increase reflects expenses related to preparation for the commercial launch of HEPLISAV-B including additional headcount, information technology systems and infrastructure to support commercial development. The net loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $29.0 million, or $0.75 per basic and diluted share, compared to $23.6 million, or $0.80 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2015. About Dynavax Dynavax, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, uses TLR biology to discover and develop novel vaccines and therapeutics in the areas of infectious and inflammatory diseases and oncology.

The Company had $139.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2016, compared to $196.1 million at December 31, 2015. The net loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $29.0 million, or $0.75 per basic and diluted share, compared to $23.6 million, or $0.80 per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of 2015. Recent Progress During the quarter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established December 15, 2016 as the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for its review of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for HEPLISAV-B™, the company's investigational vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults 18 years of age and older. In August, the FDA informed the Company that its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) is scheduled to discuss HEPLISAV-B at its meeting on November 16, 2016. The FDA has indicated it will communicate questions for the VRBPAC to address closer in time to the meeting date. Preparations for launch of HEPLISAV-B are continuing, including pre-commercial activities, manufacturing of launch inventory and continued infrastructure spending related to implementation of commercial development and information technology systems and capabilities and related increases in headcount. In June, we reported additional details from the HBV-23 pivotal Phase 3 HEPLISAV-B trial at the 76th Annual Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association (ADA). We presented encouraging additional data from Part 1 of the Phase 1/2 study evaluating our lead immunotherapy product candidate, SD-101, in lymphoma patients in April at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. Recently our collaborator, Merck, initiated a Phase 1 study of SD-101 in combination with its immunomodulator MK-1966 in cancer patients. Financials Total revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $2.6 million compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2015. Revenue primarily reflects research and development revenues from our collaboration with AstraZeneca. Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2016 were $22.8 million compared to $19.7 for the same period in 2015. This $3.1 million increase was primarily due to an increase in employee headcount and regulatory and manufacturing activities in preparation for the anticipated commercial launch of HEPLISAV-B, partially offset by a reduction in outside services expense associated with the completion of HBV-23 in the fourth quarter of 2015. General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2016 were $9.2 million compared to $5.1 for the same period in 2015. This $4.1 million increase reflects expenses related to preparation for the commercial launch of HEPLISAV-B including additional headcount, information technology systems and infrastructure to support commercial development. The net loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $29.0 million, or $0.75 per basic and diluted share, compared to $23.6 million, or $0.80 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2015. About Dynavax Dynavax, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, uses TLR biology to discover and develop novel vaccines and therapeutics in the areas of infectious and inflammatory diseases and oncology.

Financial and technology stocks soared and investors sold the safe assets they have favoured for most of this year. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments The Labour Department said US employers added 255,000 jobs in July, far more than investors expected and the second straight month of strong gains after shaky reports this spring. Stocks made their biggest gain in almost a month. Banks traded higher as investors anticipated higher interest rates and bigger profits on mortgages and other loans. The Nasdaq composite closed at a record high as tech stocks continued to climb. Consumer companies also made big gains. Investors sold bonds, precious metals, and phone and utility companies, safe investments that soared earlier this year as investors worried about the health of the economy. "It looks like the economy is improving, it looks like corporate earnings are on the upswing," said Sam Stovall, US equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ. That marks a change from earlier this year, he said, when investors worried the US would fall into a recession and tech companies would suffer as businesses cut spending. But tech stocks have come back to lead the market higher over the last few months. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 191.48 points, or 1%, to 18,543.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 18.62 points, or 0.9%, to 2,182.87. The Nasdaq advanced 54.87 points, or 1.1%, to 5,221.12. The strong jobs report suggests that Britain's vote to leave the European Union in late June did not have much effect on hiring plans for US companies. The unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent and hourly pay continued to rise. The hiring spree follows an even larger surge in June and represents a turnaround from weak job growth in the first half of this year, including disappointing job gains in April and May. Banks rose the most, as higher interest rates boost their profits on lending. Bank of America rose 57 cents, or 3.9 percent, to 15.05 US dollars and Citigroup added 1.88 dollars, or 4.3%, to 45.72 dollars. Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, said the report reassured investors but will not vanquish their fears entirely. "With an election where both candidates are likely to talk about how badly the economy is doing and how disappointing growth has been, investors as a whole are more anxious than the job picture would suggest," she said. The Federal Reserve has been saying for months that it intends to raise interest rates if the economy's strength warrants it. July's report provides more evidence the economy is doing well, boosting the chances that interest rates will go up. But Warne said investor views on the economy and the Fed will keep fluctuating. "When the Fed indicates that they're data dependent, that means investors are going to be data dependent as well," she said. Bond prices fell and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note jumped to 1.59% from 1.50%. Kraft Heinz, the company behind Oscar Mayer bologna, Jell-O pudding and Velveeta cheese, also traded higher after it reported a larger profit than analysts expected. Its stock picked up 3.25 dollars, or 3.8 percent, to 88.79 dollars. After Bristol-Myers Squibb said one of its cancer drugs failed in a clinical trial, its stock suffered its biggest slump since 2000. Meanwhile rival drugmaker Merck soared by the most in seven years. Bristol-Myers sank 12.04 dollars, or 16%, to 63.28 dollars after saying its drug Opdivo did not halt progression of non-small cell lung cancer in the study. Merck makes a drug called Keytruda that also stimulates patients' immune systems to fight lung cancer. The company, which took in 533 million dollars from Keytruda this year, rose 6.02 dollars, or 10.4%, to 63.86 dollars. Merck was the largest gainer among S&P 500 stocks, and Bristol-Myers Squibb took the largest loss. Security software maker FireEye tumbled after it reported weak sales, cut its forecasts and announced job cuts. Its stock plunged 2.02 dollars, or 12.1%, to 14.73 dollars. Rival software firm Symantec disclosed a larger profit and better sales than expected in its fiscal first quarter, and its full-year profit forecast was stronger than expected. Its stock climbed 86 cents, or 4.1%, to 21.89 dollars. Benchmark U S crude slid 13 cents to 41.89 dollars per barrel in New York while Brent crude, used to price international oils, dipped two cents to 44.27 dollars a barrel in London. The price of gold fell 23 dollars, or 1.7%, to 1,344.40 dollars an ounce, its biggest loss since May. Silver fell 63 cents, or 3.1%, to 19.82 dollars an ounce. Copper lost two cents to 2.15 dollars a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale petrol held steady at 1.38 dollars a gallon. Heating oil lost one cent to 1.32 dollars a gallon. Natural gas fell six cents to 2.77 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar rose to 101.75 yen from 101.17 yen and the euro fell to 1.1091 from 1.1127 dollars. European stocks also advanced. France's CAC-40 rose 1.5% and the Dax in Germany advanced 1.4%. London's FTSE 100 was 0.8% higher. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.2% and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was little changed. In South Korea, the Kospi rose 0.9%.

Fox Business1:49 UP NEXT (Bloomberg) -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. slumped the most in 14 years after saying its drug Opdivo failed in a lung cancer trial that would have been the basis for widely expanding use of the treatment. Popular Searches Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 67.07 -8.92 -11.74% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.94 -0.86 -0.77% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 775.05 -10.28 -1.31% Urban Outfitters Inc URBN ▼ 35.48 -3.54 -9.06% The stock was down 16 percent to $63.05 at 12:03 p.m. Friday in New York. Shares of Merck & Co., the maker of Opdivo’s main competitor Keytruda, jumped 6.9 percent to $61.83 after rising as much as 8.2 percent, the most since 2009. The drug failure as a first-line treatment is a blow to Bristol-Myers, which has pegged its growth on immune-based therapies such as Opdivo for cancers. Lung cancer is a significant opportunity for these treatments, which have thus far been largely approved for cancers that affect fewer patients. Opdivo is approved in lung cancer, though not as a first-line therapy, a large growth opportunity for cancer drugs. “This is a major surprise -- possibly the biggest clinical surprise of my career,” Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum, who recommends holding Bristol-Myers stock, wrote in a note. “Investors had high expectations for this trial.” The results reflected a risky but potentially lucrative bet by Bristol-Myers, highlighting a difference in strategy with Merck. By designing its study to include patients with lower levels of a key biomarker thought to predict response to the drug, Bristol-Myers was aiming at a far larger market for Opdivo. Merck’s Keytruda trial, meanwhile, focused on a smaller subset with high levels of the biomarker, called PD-L1 -- fewer patients, but a better chance of success. Opdivo didn’t meet its primary goal of lengthening progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, compared with chemotherapy, Bristol-Myers said in a statement. The New York-based company is working on completing an evaluation of the late-stage trial’s results. Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Caforio said the company is now focused on combination therapies, which could potentially create a better outcome for the group of patients that don’t get results on drugs like Opdivo alone. “We have a very broad development program in lung cancer and we are answering a number of very important questions,” Caforio said in a phone interview Friday. “The role of monotherapy might be limited to a very small subset of patients in the first-line setting, which makes our program now ideally suited to address the next question, which is: ‘What is the role of combination therapy?”’ That will come from a study that analysts said would likely read out in 2018. In June, Merck said that its related trial of patients with lung cancer had succeeded in lengthening the time it took for their tumors to progress. There was one key difference, though -- Merck’s trial tested Keytruda in patients whose tumors had the PD-L1 biomarker on at least 50 percent of their cancer cells. The patients in Bristol-Myers’ trial had to have the biomarker only on 5 percent or more of their cells. Rivals Gain Shares of other competitors also rose. AstraZeneca Plc, which is behind Bristol-Myers in developing combinations of immune therapies, gained 1.2 percent to 5,215 pence at 4:20 p.m. in London. Roche Holding AG, the maker of Tecentriq, increased 2.2 percent to 251 Swiss francs in Zurich. Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at Leerink Partners LLC who rate Bristol-Myers stock outperform, called the trial’s outcome the “worst case scenario.” In the long term, analysts including Schoenebaum and Tony Butler of Guggenheim Securities say all is not gloom for the drugmaker, and investors are already looking forward to the combination-therapy trial. “It’s a setback for Bristol in the low-expression patients, but I’m not sure it is a long term setback,” said Butler, who recommends buying the stock. “The more important question is around combination therapy. They showed at some recent cancer meetings that combination therapy was incredibly, incredibly strong.” Before Friday, analysts estimated Bristol’s immune therapies Yervoy and Opdivo will contribute more than half of the company’s sales by 2020, and second-quarter results showed their importance: Sales of the drugs contributed to a 46 percent increase in U.S. revenue. Opdivo’s quarterly sales rose more than sixfold to $840 million. Total revenue for the drug last year were $942 million and have been projected to rise to $7.7 billion by 2018. --With assistance from Ketaki Gokhale and Jared S.

By Doug G. Ware   |   Aug. 5, 2016 at 4:36 PM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo NEW YORK, Aug. 5 (UPI) -- A better-than-expected jobs report for July from the U.S. Department of Labor sent two stock indices into record territory on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed nearly 200 points by Friday afternoon (to close at 18,543.53), nudging the index into positive ground for the week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached record highs Friday at 2,182.86 and 5,221.12, respectively. It was the Nasdaq's first record high since July 2015. The biggest gainers Friday for the Dow were pharmaceutical giant Merck and investment house Goldman Sachs, CNBC reported. RECOMMENDEDThursday: Tesla posts nearly $300 million loss in second quarter The momentum on Wall Street Friday was carried by a positive jobs report for July, which saw about 255,000 created for the month -- far above the 180,000-190,000 range analysts expected -- and the unemployment rate under 5 percent. "American businesses have created a total of 15 million jobs since February 2010," U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a statement Friday. "This month's report confirms that the Great Recession is indeed in the nation's rear-view mirror." Perez also noted the importance of the 2016 presidential election in the maintenance of economic growth, as well as other issues consumers view as highly significant. "With fewer than 200 days left in this administration, we remain as committed as ever to ensuring that the prosperity we've created in the last eight years is sustained and broadly shared," he said. U.S. Department of Labor/Facebook "We must raise the federal minimum wage so that no one who works full-time in America lives in poverty. We must expand access to paid leave so that people don't have to choose between the job they need and the family they love. We must continue to invest in our most precious natural resource -- our human capital -- so that everyone gets the skills and training they need to compete." Gold futures fell, the value of the U.S. dollar rose, and American government bonds pulled back Friday. "After three weeks of stocks not doing much ... this is the catalyst for stocks to continue higher," Edward Jones analyst Kate Warne said. "I think it puts to bed fears of a faltering economy." RELATEDJuly 27: Despite recent U.S. economic growth, cautious Fed leaves interest rates alone Stocks have also generally benefited from the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision last week to leave interest rates alone and still unchanged for 2016. "Today, the good news is actually good news" analyst Jeff Carbone said, noting that uncertainty surrounding Britain's exit from the European Union will likely be the biggest factor in the Fed's deciding whether to raise rates before the end of the year. "Just seven years since the auto industry was on life support, auto sales remain near record highs," Perez added. "We have seen 74 consecutive weeks of initial unemployment claims at or below 300,000. The last time we saw a streak like that was December 1973." Friday marked the second straight month that U.S. markets received a substantial boost from better-than-expected Labor statistics, after a lackluster jobs report for May dinged indices.

That increasingly means less reliance on antibiotics for animals. So the new research center, built and operated by Elanco LLC, a unit Eli Lilly and Co., is focused exclusively on developing vaccines as alternatives. It’s all part of a broader effort by the drug industry to join forces with the medical establishment to reduce use of antibiotics, as resistant superbugs become more prevalent in hospitals, nursing homes and other public spaces. Weaning animals from antibiotics in favor of vaccines has become central to that effort. Farm animals are fed about 80 percent of the antibiotics in the U.S., which make their way into the human body. “We see a world where there is less need for shared-use antibiotics,” said Elanco President Jeff Simmons. “There are going to be more alternatives than ever before.” Scientists say there is an intimate link between the health of the planet’s livestock and the human population. An estimated 700,000 people die annually from drug-resistant infections, with millions more falling sick. The prevalent use of antibiotics in animals plays a role in those deaths because they allow super-bugs to flourish.   January deadline Farmers and ranchers aren’t eager to give up antibiotics because the drugs are cheap and easy to administer. But change is coming as voluntary Food and Drug Administration rules become mandatory in January. Those include prohibiting labels that claim antibiotic use promotes growth and requiring veterinarians to administer most of the drugs. Vets also will oversee drugs that are currently bought over the counter. The deadline has prompted the $30 billion animal-health and drug industry to embark on a campaign to educate agribusiness and farmers that vaccines can do just as credible a job protecting animals. “The companies see that change is going to have to come,” said Laura Rogers, deputy director of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at George Washington University in Washington. Washington summit A 2015 study estimated the global animal-vaccine market will be worth $7.2 billion by 2020, up from $5.5 billion in 2010. Already, about one-third of the industry’s revenue is from vaccines, according to company and industry officials. A summit in Washington, D.C., planned for September will gather drugmakers, government officials and nonprofit groups to discuss antibiotic resistance. Elanco plans to unveil several new vaccines this year and will invest two-thirds of the budget for its food-animal unit in alternatives to antibiotics; vaccines will help the unit outpace the industry’s annual growth rate of 4 percent to 5 percent. The company expects European approval to market Clynav, a DNA vaccine for north Atlantic salmon to fight pancreas diseases. The company is also working on a new vaccine for bovine respiratory disease, said Aaron Schact, Elanco’s research and development chief. Elanco has plenty of company. At New Jersey-based Zoetis Inc., vaccines accounted for almost half the company’s product approvals last year. It received a license in 2013 for Fostera PCV MH, which helps control porcine circovirus and enzootic pneumonia. This year, regulators granted the company a conditional license for its vaccine to help prevent disease caused by avian influenza H5N1 in chickens. Intestinal Infections Merck Animal Health, also in New Jersey, last year introduced Porcilis Ileitis, a vaccine for bacterial intestinal infections in pigs. And the Merck & Co. units COCCIVAC-B52 vaccine prevents intestinal disease in chickens. Last year, Merck acquired Harrisvaccines Inc., an Iowa-based biotech company that develops vaccines. “The future of our company is heavily grounded in vaccine development,” said Rick Sibbel, a veterinarian who runs the company’s technical services for cattle, poultry and swine. Experts stress vaccines alone won’t resolve antimicrobial resistance problems. Vaccines can’t replace all antibiotics since they effectively treat some diseases but not all. For example, calves transported in groups can develop shipping-fever pneumonia that may require antibiotics. There is no similarly effective vaccine because the cause of the illness isn’t clear, said David Wallinga, a physician with the National Resources Defense Council. That helps explain why chains like McDonald’s Corp. and Perdue Farms Inc. vow to switch to antibiotic-free poultry but aren’t making similar commitments with their beef or pork. Cattle and pigs also have longer life spans than chickens and change owners more frequently, making antibiotics a more sure bet in eradicating such illnesses as pneumonia and mastitis, a common inflammatory disease. “Animals are still going to get sick,” said Gail Hansen, a veterinarian who has consulted for animal-health companies and public agencies. “What the drug companies are looking at is vaccines that are basically cheaper to give to the animals en masse than to treat them if and when they get sick.” Email Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Recent Articles by Bloomberg News Shippers FedEx, UPS expect another record-setting holiday season Department stores change tactics as more sales go online Lilly’s Alzheimer’s disease drug fails in final-stage trial Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

By EmmaCourt Reporter Expectations were running high for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s cancer drug Opdivo as the company took on late-stage clinical trials for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, a market with blockbuster potential and one that several rival drug manufacturers also had their eye on. So when the company BMY, -0.32%  reported the trial’s failure before the opening bell on Friday, the news sent its stock plummeting as much as 19% in premarket trades. At the same time, shares of rival Merck & Co. MRK, -0.75% jumped 6.8%, and shares of AstraZeneca AZN, -0.25%  climbed 2.2%. Those two pharmaceutical companies are developing competing lung-cancer drugs. The failure “is a MAJOR SURPRISE — possibly the biggest clinical surprise of my career,” wrote longtime pharma analyst Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Read: Failed lung-cancer drug trial sends Bristol Myers stock plunging and Merck’s shares up Opdivo got top billing last week when Bristol-Myers reported its second-quarter earnings, with the blockbuster drug — already approved for four types of cancer — driving an increase in global revenues. Opdivo and Merck’s Keytruda both aim to treat non-small-cell lung cancer before chemotherapy is used, allowing for a much larger patient population. That market is likely worth more than $12 billion in total, of which Opdivo was expected to capture $7 billion to $8 billion by 2021, Schoenebaum said. But compared with Keytruda, which recently reported positive trial results, Bristol-Myers took a much more “aggressive” strategy with Opdivo, gearing it toward a larger variety of patients, said Brad Loncar, chief executive officer of Loncar Investments, which offers a cancer immunotherapy ETF CNCR, -1.34% . “Their strategy of going for as wide a patient population as possible worked very well in other stages” — until now, said Loncar, whose ETF holds shares in both Bristol-Myers and Merck. Read more: The simple reason President Obama can’t cure cancer He and others said that there’s still a path forward for Bristol-Myers, since trials of the drug in combination with others are currently ongoing. So-called “combination therapies” have been hotly anticipated by investors in this treatment area, Schoenebaum said, so the impact of this trial’s failure “may turn out to be short-lived.” Related: Four high-quality biotech companies trading like risky startups Opdivo is “active” for first-line lung cancer, “just not as good as hoped,” not beating the effects of chemotherapy, said Leerink analysts in a Friday note. Their evaluation of Merck’s Keytruda treatment compared with Opdivo show “the products appear to perform very similarly overall,” separate from the patient population in the trials. Bristol-Myers did not expand upon potential reasons for the trial’s failure. It did, however, eliminate factors such as enrollment anomalies and the size, length and statistical analysis in conversations with Schoenebaum, he said. “I actually think they deserve credit for trying to help as many patients as possible,” Loncar said. “Sometimes it just doesn’t work out.” More from MarketWatch The Task of Securing President-Elect Donald Trump Opinion Journal: Gen.

(NYSE: BMY) took a nosedive in Friday’s session following an update in its late-stage Checkmate trial. Unfortunately the results did not reach the primary endpoint, and shareholders are consequently suffering. However, Bristol-Myer’s failure was a big win for Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK) as shares climbed to close out the week. Early on Friday, Bristol-Myers announced that CheckMate -026, a trial investigating the use of Opdivo (nivolumab) as monotherapy, did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The company will complete a full evaluation of the CheckMate -026 data and work with investigators on the future presentation of the results. Overall, this is a huge blow to Bristol-Myers, while it is especially good for Merck, which has a competing drug that recently succeeded in its trial. Merck’s drug Keytruda also recently won the approval of the European Commission for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Giovanni Caforio, M.D., CEO of Bristol-Myers, commented: Opdivo has become a foundational treatment that is transforming cancer care across multiple tumor types. While we are disappointed CheckMate -026 did not meet its primary endpoint in this broad patient population, we remain committed to improving patient outcomes through our comprehensive development program, including the ongoing Phase 3 CheckMate -227 study exploring the potential of the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy for PD-L1 positive patients, and Opdivo plus Yervoy, or Opdivo plus chemotherapy in PD-L1 negative patients. Shares of Bristol-Myers were last seen down 17% at $62.42, with a consensus analyst price target of $77.50 and a 52-week trading range of $51.82 to $77.12. Merck traded up more than 7% at $62.10. The consensus price target is $62.15, and the 52-week range is $45.69 to $62.61.

From the press release: Opdivo has become a foundational treatment that is transforming cancer care across multiple tumor types. While we are disappointed CheckMate -026 did not meet its primary endpoint in this broad patient population, we remain committed to improving patient outcomes through our comprehensive development program, including the ongoing Phase 3 CheckMate -227 study exploring the potential of the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy for PD-L1 positive patients, and Opdivo plus Yervoy, or Opdivo plus chemotherapy in PD-L1 negative patients. Competitor Merck is surging on the news, up nearly 8%. Merck makes a competitor drug to BMY’s called Keytruda, so the company stands to benefit greatly from Opdivo’s failure. Opdivo is already used to treat other forms of cancer, but this latest study had hoped to prove effectiveness specifically in lung cancer. Opdivo generated $840 million in sales in Q2 alone for BMY, so a lot of potential money was riding on this lung cancer study. In response to the news, analysts at SunTrust reportedly cut their rating on Bristol-Myers to Neutral. Investors can expect many other firms to follow suit with downgrades, price target cuts, and lower earnings estimates. BMY shares fell $13.02 (-17.29%) to $62.30 in Friday morning trading. The stock is now down about 9% on the year, compared with a 6.7% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index.

REUTERS/Phil Noble By Ben Hirschler | LONDON LONDON AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shares hit a record high on Friday, breaching for the first time the 55 pounds a share level offered by Pfizer (PFE.N) in 2014 during the U.S. group's abortive $100 billion attempt to buy the drugmaker. The British firm's stock has been on a roll recently, helped by a falling pound and speculation that Switzerland's Novartis (NOVN.S) might be next to launch a bid. However, the shares were lifted to a high of 55.05 pounds by the misfortunes of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N). The failure of Bristol's immunotherapy drug Opdivo to slow disease progression in previously untreated patients with lung cancer as hoped was seen by investors as good news for rivals Merck & Co (MRK.N) and AstraZeneca. Analysts at Leerink, Jefferies and Deutsche Bank said the negative result with Opdivo increased the potential market opportunity for AstraZeneca's keenly watched combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab. Crucial clinical trial results with durvalumab, both on its own and in combination with tremelimumab, are due next year. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot believes AstraZeneca can become a major player in cancer drugs that bolster the immune system. And its ability to carve out billions of dollars in potential sales hinges not only on the effectiveness of its own products but on the competitive profile of rivals. Cancer is currently the hottest area of research across the drugs industry and some analysts believe this could make AstraZeneca a takeover target once again, with speculation turning last week to Novartis as a bidder.

Meet the Contributors → Biotech Roundup: Biogen Rumors, Theranos, Electro-Drugs & More Ben Fidler August 5th, 2016 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  Biogen was once again all over the biotech newswire this week. First came a positive surprise; data that could set the stage for the first-ever drug approved for spinal muscular atrophy, a rare and debilitating muscle disease. Then came the rumor mill: Companies may or may not be approaching Biogen about a sale, and Biogen may or may not be fielding offers. Just as many M&A rumors flame out as lead to deals, of course, but the news was enough to give Biogen’s stock price a big bump, and ignite chatter about what a sale of one of biotech’s heavyweights would mean, particularly for the Boston area. That story and plenty more—including a bevy of gene therapy news, the latest on the Zika virus, and a long-awaited presentation from an embattled CEO—below: —Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes spoke at a conference for laboratory scientists this week in Philadelphia. She was widely expected to divulge data for the first time regarding her company’s Edison blood-testing system, whose failures have led to recalls, a two-year ban for Holmes from operating a clinical lab, and worries about patient safety. Instead, Holmes promoted a new system, MiniLab, in development. Holmes claimed it would be able to produce multiple test results from a single blood sample without shipping blood to a lab. After the talk, she refused to discuss Edison, saying she would answer questions “about the past in an appropriate forum” in the future. —Holmes mentioned that one test to be available via MiniLab is for Zika virus infection, and that Theranos has asked the FDA for approval. Zika, meanwhile, has spread to Miami, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued a travel warning for the city’s Wynwood neighborhood. The FDA approved a Zika test from Siemens on an emergency basis. —GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) said it would team with Verily Life Sciences to form Galvani Bioelectronics, with the two sides committing $715 million. The aim is to build implants the size of a grain of rice that treat disease by reading and altering a patient’s nerve signals. Verily is the biotech group at Google’s parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: [[ticker:GOOG:]]). —The fallout from the announced departure of Biogen CEO George Scangos was swift. The Wall Street Journal reported that Cambridge, MA-based Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) has drawn interest from the likes of Merck (NYSE: MRK) and Allergan (NYSE: AGN) as a possible takeover target. CNBC subsequently reported that Allergan isn’t interested, and Reuters followed with a report that Biogen doesn’t want to sell, but the rumors have surfaced at a time when Biogen is in significant flux. In addition to Scangos, several top executives have left over the past year. The rumors boosted Biogen’s sinking stock price nearly 10 percent. —Biogen got a boost in clinical trials as well. The company and Carlsbad, CA, partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: IONS) stopped a Phase 3 trial of spinal muscular atrophy drug nusinersen early because it was clearly helping improve the motor function of patients compared to a placebo. As a result, Biogen will buy the rights to nusinersen and prepare to ask regulators for marketing approval. SMA has no approved treatments. —Drug price news: While drug-purchasing agent CVS Health said it would bar several high-priced products from its menu of choices, including the leading prostate cancer treatment enzalutamide (Xtandi), it emerged that GSK is pricing gene therapy Strimvelis at $665,000 for a single dose, as STAT reports. Strimvelis is a treatment for severe combined immune deficiency, commonly known as “bubble boy” disease. —Gene therapy news: After investing in Bamboo Therapeutics and its Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment earlier this year, Pfizer bought the Chapel Hill, NC-based biotech  outright on Monday for $150 million up front, with potentially another $495 million later. Bamboo was formed by UNC School of Medicine gene therapy pioneer Jude Samulski. His Chatham Therapeutics was acquired by Baxter International in 2014. —Speaking of Samulski, Shire (NASDAQ: SHPG), of Dublin and Lexington, MA, scrapped BAX 335, a gene therapy for hemophilia B that Shire inherited by acquiring Baxalta. BAX 335, which originated at Samulski’s Chatham, was once the most advanced hemophilia gene therapy in clinical testing. — Cambridge-based Avrobio raised $25 million from Atlas Venture, Clarus, and SV Life Science. Along with Bluebird Bio (NASDAQ:BLUE) and U.K. startup Orchard Therapeutics, Avrobio is one of the few companies advancing an “ex vivo” gene therapy approach, which involves harvesting a patient’s own stem cells outside the body. —Editas Medicine (NASDAQ:EDIT) of Cambridge has licensed CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing work from Massachusetts General Hospital that aims to make more precise cuts in the targeted DNA. Published in January, the technology comes from the lab of Keith Joung, who is an Editas cofounder. —Meanwhile, scientists from San Diego-based Synthetic Genomics and the J. Craig Venter Institute said they have created a yeast-based method that uses CRISPR-Cas9 to edit bacterial genomes. —Myriad Genetics (NASDAQ: [[ticker:[[MYGN]]) of Salt Lake City will pay $225 million upfront to acquire Assurex Health, a Mason, OH-based maker of genetic tests to evaluate a patient’s suitability for psychiatric medicines. Myriad could pay $185 million more in milestones. —Seattle Genetics (NASDAQ: [[ticker:[[SGEN]]) and its partner Takeda Pharmaceutical said they would seek FDA approval next year for brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, based on positive Phase 3 results. Adcetris is already approved for Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. —Immunotherapy news: Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (NASDAQ: BMY) immunotherapy drug nivolumab (Opdivo) failed a Phase 3 trial in previously untreated patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Shares of Bristol immediately fell 16 percent on the news, while shares of Merck—whose rival drug, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), is also being developed for untreated lung cancer patients—surged more than 11 percent…Menlo Park, CA-based Adicet Bio struck a five-year deal with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN) to make “off the shelf” T cell treatments for various cancers. Regeneron is paying $25 million upfront. Adicet raised $51 million earlier this year…Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) of Thousand Oaks, CA, is paying $40 million immediately for rights to ADXS-NEO, a preclinical cancer treatment from Princeton, NJ-based Advaxis (NASDAQ: ADXS). Amgen will also buy $25 million in Advaxis stock…The FDA says Adaptimmune (NASDAQ: ADAP) must answer more questions before it begins a key trial of its T cell treatment for liposarcoma, a cancer that grows in the connective tissues. —Shares of Sangamo Biosciences (NASDAQ: SGMO) sank about 30 percent due to “delays in multiple…gene editing programs and concerns about management execution capability,” wrote Jefferies analyst Gena Wang in a note to investors. In an earnings release Wednesday, for instance, Sangamo said the first trial for its treatment for the rare disease Mucopolysaccharidosis type I has been delayed until next year. —Hearing loss startup Decibel Therapeutics became the first Boston-area biotech to open a headquarters in the Fenway neighborhood. The Boston Globe has more here. —Momenta Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: MNTA) stopped a mid-stage pancreatic cancer drug necuparanib early because it didn’t show “a sufficient level of efficacy.” Shares fell about 5 percent.

Bristol-Myers' shares were down 20 percent at $60.00 in premarket trading. Shares of Merck & Co, which makes rival drug Keytruda, were up 11 percent at $64.60. The trial was testing Opdivo against chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Opdivo, first approved in late 2014, is already approved for use in NSCLC patients who have failed prior therapy, as well as forms of melanoma, kidney cancer and blood cancer.

Johnson August 4 Follow @carolynyjohnson Jacob Levitt, who suffers from periodic paralysis, takes karate in June in New York. He and his father, who were both pharmaceutical executives, had sought to have an old glaucoma drug approved for use to treat Levitt’s rare disease. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post) Three decades ago, Congress listened to the plight of Americans sick with diseases so rare many people had never heard of them. They were victims of a pharmaceutical market failure — “orphans” ignored by drug companies because, the thinking went, tiny groups of patients would lead to trifling sales. To make the business viable, Congress — pushed by patients and a popular television show that highlighted rare diseases — passed the Orphan Drug Act. The 1983 law offered drug companies attractive tax credits and monopolies to develop treatments for rare diseases, radically transforming the pipeline of orphan drugs. Now, rare diseases are no longer a neglected niche of the pharmaceutical business; they are a tantalizing moneymaking opportunity. More than 400 treatments have been approved since the law passed. Last year, nearly half of all novel drugs approved were treatments for orphan diseases. But critics and some medical experts are concerned that the Orphan Drug Act may have backfired. Pharmaceutical companies can reap huge profits because of the most important perk offered by the law: a period of market exclusivity that prevents competition for seven years. That has paved the way for drug prices so high that a single year of treatment can cost more than a car or even a house. Since the act passed, the median launch price of orphan drugs for chronic use has doubled every five years, according to an analysis presented in May by a team of Massachusetts researchers. In one way, this is a straightforward success story: Patients with rare and often devastating diseases have the attention of drug companies and a growing trove of treatments. Despite the drugs’ high list prices, patients generally are not on the hook for the full amount, thanks to insurance, secret rebates and assistance programs underwritten by drug companies. As the rare-disease drug business has expanded, though, the high prices could drive up insurance costs for everyone. Spending on orphan drugs is growing twice as fast as the overall drug market, according to the market research firm Evaluate. For example, the orphan drug Soliris has an average annual cost of up to $488,000 per patient for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria — one of two ultra-rare diseases for which it is approved. It netted $2.59 billion in sales last year. Rituxan, an orphan cancer drug sometimes called “vitamin R” because it has become an important treatment for so many diseases, had worldwide sales of more than $7 billion last year. “We’re seeing the Orphan Drug Act used in ways that we never anticipated when the law was adopted,” said former congressman Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who was the principal author of the bill and now works at his son’s lobbying and communications firm, Waxman Strategies. “In the way people use the word ‘orphan status,’ it’s almost becoming a synonym for a monopoly price. Sounds like it’s good to be an orphan.” Birth of a new market That wasn’t always true. In the late 1970s, Abbey Meyers was a young mother from Connecticut who had finally found relief. Her son, David, was taking an experimental drug for Tourette’s syndrome, a rare disease that causes motor and vocal tics. The treatment worked. But when the drug failed the main trial for a common illness, the drugmaker stopped supplying it. After testifying at a congressional hearing, Meyers was invited to speak with drug executives. “You have grandchildren — what if it was one of your grandchildren?” Meyers recalled pleading. The problem gained national attention when the popular medical drama “Quincy, M.E.” aired an episode on Tourette’s and actor Jack Klugman, who played the medical examiner at the center of the show, testified before Congress. As written, the law sought to fix a clear market failure: “Because so few individuals are affected by any one rare disease or condition, a pharmaceutical company which develops an orphan drug may reasonably expect . . . to incur a financial loss.” “It gave them the realistic chance of making a profit,” said Meyers, who would go on to found an advocacy group, the National Organization for Rare Disorders. “It was not going to be a great big profit. . . . It was only going to be reasonable profit, because the market was very small.” [Jack Klugman’s secret, lifesaving legacy] For drugs treating diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, the law provides tax credits for half the cost of clinical development, seven years free from competition, and waived fees. The debate over profits began not long after the law was adopted. Congress passed an amendment that would have increased competition and revoked exclusivity if the drug’s target population grew to more than 200,000, but President George H.W. Bush refused to sign it into law. Two years later, a proposed amendment would have terminated the exclusivity early if a drug reached $200 million in annual sales. Henri Termeer, then the chief executive of the Massachusetts biotechnology company Genzyme, appeared before Congress to argue against the cap, which was never passed, and defend a $300,000-a-year treatment for a rare metabolic disorder called Gaucher disease. In his testimony, Termeer said the cost of the treatment, Ceredase, would naturally drop “in the affordability range” — without a change to the law — because the dose could be reduced over time. That never happened. Lower doses did not control the disease as hoped, and the next generation of the drug, called Cerezyme, became a blockbuster, hitting a billion dollars in annual revenue. There are now five drugs for Gaucher disease, which has been diagnosed in 10,000 people worldwide. Two are made by Genzyme and are both priced around $310,000 a year. David Meeker, the current head of Sanofi Genzyme, said that the Orphan Drug Act is an important law but that the proof of profitability has been crucial in establishing the industry. “It suddenly created a business model that said you can go after these incredibly rare diseases and survive,” Meeker said. Not every drug is a success, but the appeal of the niche is clear. In 2014, the average annual cost per patient for the 100 top-selling orphan drugs in the United States was nearly $112,000, compared with $23,000 for non-orphans, according to an Evaluate report. And orphan drugs are generally cheaper to develop. The largest, most expensive clinical trials for orphan drugs cost about a quarter as much as those for non-orphan drugs, after the tax credits are factored in, according to the report. Old drugs become orphans Nowhere are the strange economics of drug pricing more difficult to understand than when a drug invented decades earlier is granted orphan status — and an orphan price. Last summer, an old glaucoma drug was reborn as an orphan for a disease called periodic paralysis. Its list price was $50 a bottle in 2002, according to Truven Health Analytics. In 2015, it was relaunched by Taro Pharmaceutical Industries with a new brand name, Keveyis, and a new price: $13,650 a bottle. The relaunch of the drug was first envisioned by a family with unusual connections to periodic paralysis and the pharmaceutical industry. Jacob Levitt, a member of that family, experienced his first attack of paralysis at a karate lesson when he was 12, three decades ago. Jacob sat down on the floor, and when he tried to stand up, he couldn’t. A neighbor slung the boy over his shoulder and drove him home. His father, Barrie Levitt, a physician and then-chairman of Taro, drew blood and raced to his Manhattan medical office in the middle of the night to run tests. By the next day, Jacob Levitt’s scary illness had a name: periodic paralysis, an ultra-rare disorder that causes temporary bouts of immobility and muscle weakness. Patients can wake up paralyzed and go through their days feeling as if they are wearing lead shoes and a 50-pound backpack. Jacob Levitt began taking an old glaucoma treatment that is sometimes used off-label to manage periodic paralysis. It worked, and he was able to continue practicing karate and went on to become a doctor and a vice president at Taro. In the early 2000s, a similar glaucoma drug called Daranide was discontinued by Merck, leaving many periodic-paralysis patients without their best option for controlling their disease. The Levitts wondered whether Taro could help launch it as a generic drug that could be used off-label, like Jacob’s medication. Taro bought Daranide from Merck for less than half a million dollars in 2008, according to the Levitts. Two years later, Taro filed for orphan status. Then in 2010, after a contentious corporate and legal battle, the Levitts were forced out of Taro and the company was taken over by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, the Indian drugmaking giant. Under the new leadership, Taro got orphan approval in 2015 and priced the drug at more than 270 times its last price. Credit Suisse analysts estimated the drug could bring in $100 million per year for Taro, with a “blue sky” scenario of up to $600 million. In May, however, the company changed its plan and announced the drug would be given away free. Taro said it had made less than $1 million selling Keveyis and spent millions on patient support services, medical education and promoting disease awareness. Experts who track the industry said that the sudden reversal on price is an uncommon move. But it is not uncommon for companies to recycle old drugs as orphans and stamp them with a price hike. For example, a decades-old pregnancy drug received orphan approval in 2011 as a treatment to lower the risk of preterm birth. The drug was previously available from compounding pharmacies for $20, but the list price for the approved drug, Makena, rose to more than $1,400 a dose — although it was halved after public backlash. After receiving orphan designation as an infantile spasm treatment, H.P. Acthar Gel increased in price by more than $20,000 a vial in 2007, though it had been used since the 1950s. Today, its list price is $34,034, not including discounts. In February, dozens of physicians signed a letter in the journal Muscle and Nerve, highlighting concerns about the future price of a treatment for a rare autoimmune disease that had been around for decades, though never approved — now at risk of a hike. “What is particularly troublesome to us is a ‘loophole’ in the Orphan Drug Act that allows companies to receive FDA market exclusivity . . . for older, existing drugs,” the physicians wrote. Popularity of orphan drugs The high prices of orphan drugs have been detached from the law’s original rationale — that incentives are necessary for companies to recoup the costs of research and development of treatments with tiny markets. Today, some pharmaceutical companies use the word “orphan” to justify a drug’s high price, whether or not that drug is protected by the law’s exclusivity. The market has come to expect high prices for any drug that treats very few patients, and the system lacks any real mechanism to counter the price increases. In a slide deck released to a Senate committee last year, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International outlined its reasoning for a price hike for Syprine, a three-decade-old rare-disease drug that ultimately went from $652 for 100 capsules to $21,267 over a five-year period. The slide explains the reason for the price hike: “Progressive pricing actions to bring in line with comparable Orphan products.” Former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli, who became notorious for hiking the price of an old drug called Daraprim that is used to fight an exceedingly rare infection, called the drug an orphan even though it is not protected by the law. “This drug is priced similarly to other drugs for rare disease, and I think most physicians understand that,” Shkreli told The Washington Post last year. Orphan drugs are isolated from many of the typical pressures that bring down prices. Insurance companies often have so few rare-disease patients on their books that even a very high-priced drug gets little attention. And pharmaceutical companies fund assistance programs that ensure patients do not forgo a treatment because of its price. Drug companies argue that any change to incentives could lead the industry to abandon orphans once more. Patients and their advocates worry about that — but also see how the new market for orphan drugs gives companies virtually unlimited pricing power. In 1979, Joseph Jankovic, a physician at the Baylor College of Medicine, began treating the uncontrollable movements of Huntington’s disease, called chorea, by importing tetrabenazine, a drug not approved in the United States. For years, his efforts to interest a drug company in tetrabenazine were fruitless. The medicine cost about $200 for a 180-pill bottle. Prestwick Pharmaceuticals got U.S. orphan approval for the drug in 2008. The brand-name version, Xenazine, now sold by Lundbeck, carries a list price of $10,622 for a 112-pill bottle. “Obviously, I’m concerned about the cost of the drug, but more importantly, I’m concerned about what is the out-of-pocket cost to the patient,” Jankovic said. Cheaper generic versions entered last year after the drug’s exclusivity expired. But now a chemically altered form of the drug that breaks down slower is being developed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries as an orphan. “On one hand, I’m encouraged by the data we just published showing that the drug is very effective in reducing chorea, with minimal side effects,” Jankovic said. “On the other hand, I’m concerned that once the drug is approved, it’s going to be perhaps even more expensive.” business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

The US Department of Labor report showed that nonfarm payrolls rose by 255,000 last month, far outpacing expectations for a gain of 180,000. While the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.9 percent, it held below the 5 percent mark associated with full employment. The S&P 500 ended at 2,182.87, its eighth closing high of the year, powered by a 1.9 percent gain in financials, which would be primed for a profit boost should the US Federal Reserve raise interest rates. JPMorgan Chase shares gained 2.7 percent to US$66.30 and the financial index closed at its highest level of the year. “This is a flat out strong report; there don’t appear to be any holes whatsoever,” said Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. “But we need to temper enthusiasm, with two straight positive payroll reports everyone is going to shift to the other side of the boat — first the boat was sinking and now everyone is going to think the boat is going to take off,” he said. Employment numbers were weak in April and May, and a surprisingly strong reading in June left investors unsure of the state of the economy. The June employment number was revised to 292,000 from 287,000. The Fed may still wait for GDP growth to improve and inflation to move closer to its 2 percent target before pulling the trigger on an interest rate hike. The probability of a hike doubled to 18 percent for next month after the jobs report and rose to about 46 percent for December, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.04 percent to 18,543.53; the S&P 500 gained 0.86 percent to 2,182.87; and the NASDAQ Composite added 1.06 percent to 5,221.12. The NASDAQ surpassed a record set in July last year. For the week, the Dow rose 0.6 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent and the NASDAQ advanced 1.1 percent. Bristol-Myers plunged 16 percent after its lung cancer drug failed in a late-stage study, while Merck, which makes a rival drug, rose 10.4 percent. Bristol-Myers was the biggest drag on the S&P 500, while Merck gave the benchmark index its biggest boost. Kraft Heinz, the company behind Oscar Mayer bologna, Jell-O pudding and Velveeta cheese, also traded higher after it reported a larger profit than analysts expected. Its stock rose 3.8 percent. Security software maker FireEye tumbled 12.1 percent after it reported weak sales, cut its forecasts and announced job cuts. Rival software firm Symantec disclosed a larger profit and better sales than expected in its fiscal first quarter, and its full-year profit forecast was stronger than expected. Its stock climbed 4.1 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.64-to-1 ratio; on NASDAQ, a 2.57-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 6.77 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, compared with the 6.58 billion daily average over the past 20 sessions. Additional reporting by AP This story has been viewed 1769 times.

The FDA has never been able to piece together what, if any, drug-manufacturing data were on that memory stick. But its removal became one of a long list of significant deviations that...

Stock markets were modestly higher Friday, Aug. 5, 2016 in the run-up to monthly U.S. jobs data that could go a long way to determining whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this year. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) By MARLEY JAY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS NEW YORK — U.S. stocks jumped to record highs Friday after a strong jobs report for the month of July gave investors more confidence that the economy is still growing. Financial and technology stocks soared and investors sold the safe assets they have favored for most of this year. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 255,000 jobs in July, far more than investors expected and the second straight month of strong gains after shaky reports this spring. Stocks made their biggest gain in almost a month. Banks traded higher as investors anticipated higher interest rates and bigger profits on mortgages and other loans. The Nasdaq composite closed at a record high as tech stocks continued to climb. Consumer companies also made big gains. Investors sold bonds, precious metals, and phone and utility companies, safe investments that soared earlier this year as investors worried about the health of the economy. “It looks like the economy is improving, it looks like corporate earnings are on the upswing,” said Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ. That marks a change from earlier this year, he said, when investors worried the U.S. would fall into a recession and tech companies would suffer as businesses cut spending. But tech stocks have come back to lead the market higher over the last few months. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 191.48 points, or 1 percent, to 18,543.53. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index climbed 18.62 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,182.87. The Nasdaq advanced 54.87 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,221.12. The strong jobs report suggests that Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in late June didn’t have much effect on hiring plans for U.S. companies. The unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent and hourly pay continued to rise. The hiring spree follows an even larger surge in June and represents a turnaround from weak job growth in the first half of this year, including disappointing job gains in April and May. Banks rose the most, as higher interest rates boost their profits on lending. Bank of America rose 57 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $15.05 and Citigroup added $1.88, or 4.3 percent, to $45.72. Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, said the report reassured investors but won’t vanquish their fears entirely. “With an election where both candidates are likely to talk about how badly the economy is doing and how disappointing growth has been, investors as a whole are more anxious than the job picture would suggest,” she said. The Federal Reserve has been saying for months that it intends to raise interest rates if the economy’s strength warrants it. July’s report provides more evidence the economy is doing well, boosting the chances that interest rates will go up. But Warne said investor views on the economy and the Fed will keep fluctuating. “When the Fed indicates that they’re data dependent, that means investors are going to be data dependent as well,” she said. Bond prices fell and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note jumped to 1.59 percent from 1.50 percent. Kraft Heinz, the company behind Oscar Mayer bologna, Jell-O pudding and Velveeta cheese, also traded higher after it reported a larger profit than analysts expected. Its stock picked up $3.25, or 3.8 percent, to $88.79. After Bristol-Myers Squibb said one of its cancer drugs failed in a clinical trial, its stock suffered its biggest slump since 2000. Meanwhile rival drugmaker Merck soared by the most in seven years. Bristol-Myers sank $12.04, or 16 percent, to $63.28 after saying its drug Opdivo did not halt progression of non-small cell lung cancer in the study. Merck makes a drug called Keytruda that also stimulates patients’ immune systems to fight lung cancer. The company, which took in $533 million from Keytruda this year, rose $6.02, or 10.4 percent, to $63.86. Merck was the largest gainer among S&P 500 stocks, and Bristol-Myers Squibb took the largest loss. Security software maker FireEye tumbled after it reported weak sales, cut its forecasts and announced job cuts. Its stock plunged $2.02, or 12.1 percent, to $14.73. Rival software firm Symantec disclosed a larger profit and better sales than expected in its fiscal first quarter, and its full-year profit forecast was stronger than expected. Its stock climbed 86 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $21.89.

Finance Search Thu, Nov 24, 2016, 4:35 AM AEDT - Australia Markets open in 5 hrs 25 mins US stocks end at records after strong jobs reportBy John Biers | AFP – Fri, Aug 5, 2016 9:42 PM AEST Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Eurozone investors said they were also concerned about a drop both in Germany exports and imports, a sign of the powerhouse economy slipping A strong US jobs report lifted Wall Street stocks to fresh records Friday and helped propel European equities higher. Both the broad-based S&P 500 and the tech-rich Nasdaq finished at all-time highs after the Labor Department reported a big gain in jobs in July and upgraded employment estimates for the prior two months. Each of the major US indices rose about one percent including the Dow, which ended only 12 points away from a record of its own. "The US economy may not be going gangbusters but it remains the best equity alternative of any worldwide index," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. "The most important takeaway from a better jobs report is an indication of a continued grind higher in the US economy." Meanwhile, the London stock market rose 0.8 percent to above 6,800 for the first time in 14 months, as European equities built on earlier gains seen after the Bank of England Thursday announced an interest rate cut and surprise stimulus in response to the British vote to leave the European Union. Paris and Frankfurt both rose about 1.5 percent. The Labor Department said the US economy added 255,000 jobs in July, easily topping the analyst forecast for an increase of 185,000 payrolls. It also reported growth in hourly wages, a weak point in some earlier reports that have shown employment growth. The strong report helped markets shrug off some lackluster US data of late, including a report a week ago that estimated second-quarter growth at just 1.2 percent. "This was good economic data, replete with strong and relatively broad-based job growth, higher wage growth and an increase in the average workweek," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare. "The economy does appear to be stable and on a slightly more upwards trajectory," said David Levy, portfolio manager at Republic Wealth Advisors. - Dollar rises - The jobs report also boosts the odds of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase this year, but probably not before December, analysts said. That expectation accentuated movements in the foreign exchange market following the British monetary stimulus, boosting the dollar at the expense of the euro and the pound. "Hotter than expected wage growth was really the icing on the cake of the very strong data, which has pushed up the odds of the Fed raising lending rates in the months ahead," said Omer Esiner of Commonwealth Foreign Exchange. Banking shares rallied on expectations of higher US interest rates. JPMorgan Chase gained 2.7 percent, Bank of American 3.9 percent and Citigroup 4.3 percent.

(REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks surged to fresh records on Friday (Aug 5) after a much stronger-than-expected July jobs report suggested the economy is healthier than previously thought. The broad-based S&P 500 rose 18.62 points (0.86 per cent) to 2,182.87, about four points above its prior all-time high set last month. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite also set a record, up 54.87 points (1.06 per cent) at 5,221.12, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 191.48 points (1.04 per cent) to 18,543.53, only 12 points from its record. The Labor Department said the economy added 255,000 jobs in July, easily topping the analyst forecast for an increase of 185,000 payrolls. The department also upwardly revised the employment figures for May and June and said hourly wages rose in July. "The US economy may not be going gangbusters but it remains the best equity alternative of any worldwide index," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. "The most important takeaway from a better jobs report is an indication of a continued grind higher in the US economy." The jobs report also boosts the odds of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase this year, but probably not before December, analysts said. Banking shares rallied on expectations of higher US interest rates. JPMorgan Chase gained 2.7 per cent, Bank of American 3.9 per cent and Citigroup 4.3 per cent. Technology shares were also generally higher, with Dow members Apple and IBM climbing 1.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively. Airlines also rose, with Delta Air Lines winning 3.1 per cent and United Continental 5.5 per cent. Bristol-Myers Squibb plunged 16.0 per cent after announcing that a clinical trial of its Opdivo drug to treat lung cancer failed. The news boosted Dow member Merck, which has a competing drug, pushing shares up a hefty 10.4 per cent. Online travel company Priceline surged 4.0 per cent after reporting that second-quarter net income rose 12.3 per cent to US$580.6 million following a 19 per cent rise in overall bookings to US$17.9 billion. Kraft Heinz jumped 3.8 per cent after reporting second-quarter net income of US$770 million, compared with a loss of US$344 million in the year-ago period. - AFP/ec Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

(AP Photo/Koji Sasahara) NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. stocks are jumping Friday morning as a strong July jobs report gave investors more confidence that the economy is still growing. The Labor Department said employers added 255,000 jobs, far more than experts expected. Bank stocks rose on the prospect of higher interest rates and consumer companies rose as investors hope consumers will have more money to spend. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average surged 160 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,511 as of 11:42 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 17 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,181. The Nasdaq composite gained 57 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,223. The Dow and the S&P 500 are now higher for the week, while the Nasdaq extended its gains. Investors sold traditionally safe stocks like utilities and phone companies and the prices of gold and silver fell. JOBS RELIEF: The strong jobs report follows an even larger gain in June. It suggests that Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in late June didn’t have much effect on hiring plans. The brisk pace of hiring represents a turnaround from weak job growth in the first half of this year, including disappointing job gains in April and May. The Labor Department said the unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent and hourly pay continued to rise. It’s up 2.6 percent over the last 12 months, matching the fastest pace since the recession. EYES ON THE FED: The Federal Reserve has been saying for months that it intends to raise interest rates if the economy’s strength warrants it. July’s report provides more evidence the economy is doing well, boosting the chances of a rate. Banks rose the most Friday morning, as higher interest rates boost their profits on lending. Bank of America rose 55 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $15.03 and Citigroup added $1.40, or 3.2 percent, to $45.25. CONSUMER COMPANIES CLIMB: Priceline posted a bigger profit than expected and its stock rose $67.36, or 5 percent, to $1,427.35. That was the biggest gain among consumer companies, but Priceline was far from alone. Home Depot also added $1.37, or 1 percent, to $137.42 and Nike gained 98 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $55.78. FUNKY CHICKEN: Tex-Mex food chain El Pollo Loco jumped 97 cents, or 7.4 percent, to $14.05 after its results were stronger than analysts expected. A TASTE FOR KRAFT: Kraft Heinz, also traded higher after it reported a larger profit than analysts expected. Its stock picked up $4.19, or 4.9 percent, to $89.73. BONDS: Bond prices fell and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.56 percent from 1.50 percent. SECURITY: Security software maker FireEye tumbled after it reported weak sales, cut its estimates for billings and revenue, and said it will eliminate 300 to 400 jobs to reduce costs. Its stock plunged $2.09, or 12.5 percent, to $14.66. Security software rival Symantec disclosed a larger profit and better sales than expected in its fiscal first quarter, and its full-year profit forecast was stronger than expected. Its stock climbed $1.15, or 5.5 percent, to $22.18. LUNG CANCER TREATMENTS: Bristol-Myers Squibb stock sank $12.80, or 17 percent, to $62.52 after the company said its drug Opdivo did not halt progression of non-small cell lung cancer in a clinical study. Opdivo is used to treat several types of cancer and Bristol-Myers brought in $1.5 billion in revenue from the drug in the first half of this year, but is running more studies in the hope of winning new marketing approvals. The failure boosted companies that are making similar drugs that also use patients’ immune systems to fight lung cancer. Merck, which took in $533 million from its drug Keytruda this year, rose $4, or 6.9 percent, to $61.84. AstraZeneca, which is also studying a lung cancer drug regimen, added 37 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $34.67. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude slid 61 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $41.32 per barrel in New York while Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 61 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $43.68 a barrel in London. METALS: Gold skidded $22.80, or 1.7 percent, to $1,344.60 an ounce. Silver fell 65 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $19.79 an ounce. Copper dipped 1 cent to $2.16 a pound. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.83 yen from 101.17 yen and the euro fell to $1.1078 from $1.1127. OVERSEAS: France’s CAC-40 rose 1.5 percent and the DAX in Germany advanced 1.3 percent. London’s FTSE 100 was 0.8 percent higher. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.2 percent and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 was little changed. In South Korea, the Kospi rose 0.9 percent.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 6 August 2016 | MYT 12:50 AM Strong jobs data lifts S&P to record intraday high (Update 1) At 10:59 am ET (Friday), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 151.38 points, or 0.82%, at 18,503.43. The EPA photo shows traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the start of the trading session on Friday. NEW YORK: US stocks surged on Friday, with the S&P 500 touching a record intraday high after a second straight month of robust labour market data boosted optimism about the economy. The US Labour Department report showed that nonfarm payrolls rose by 255,000 in July, far exceeding estimates of 180,000. While unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.9%, it stayed below the 5% mark associated with full employment. Average hourly wages rose by 8 cents. The S&P 500 touched 2,180.78, its ninth record intraday high since July. “(The data) cements the view that the economy is improving despite the recent negative news from GDP,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York. The data also suggests that the April and May jobs data was an aberration and that June was more consistent with what is going on in the economy, he said. The June employment number was revised up to 292,000 from 287,000. However, inflation running below the Fed’s 2% target and weaker-than-expected GDP growth amid global uncertainty could deter the central bank from pulling the trigger in the near term. The chances of a rate hike doubled to 18% for September after the jobs report and rose to 40% from 29.4% for December, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Those numbers, however, do not rise significantly even until July next year. “I’m not sure this (jobs data) is enough to move the needle in either direction for the Fed,” said Curt Long, chief economist at National Association Of Federal Credit Unions in Washington. At 10:59 am ET (1459 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 151.38 points, or 0.82%, at 18,503.43. The S&P 500 index was up 15.55 points, or 0.72%, at 2,179.8. The Nasdaq Composite was up 55.06 points, or 1.07%, at 5,221.30. Seven of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by a 1.52% surge in the financials index. The sector was trading at its highest level since the start of the year. Banks, which stand to gain if the Fed raises rates, were among the biggest drivers of the S&P. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup rose about 3%. Bristol-Myers plunged 17% after its lung cancer drug failed in a late-stage study, while Merck, which makes a rival drug, rose 6%. Bristol-Myers was the biggest drag on the S&P, while Merck gave the index its biggest boost. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,016 to 802. On the Nasdaq, 1,895 issues rose and 718 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 25 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 87 new highs and 17 new lows. - Reuters You May Be Interested Poorer countries still lagging in Internet use: report Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Viral video will crash your iPhone M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex Property Related advertisement Latest News Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Mercury Industries to sell off auto refinish firm Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy Most Viewed in Business Fraud in Felda Global Ventures M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Malakoff seeks RM785mil compensation from EPCC contractors of Tg Bin plant Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy Bank Negara keeps OPR unchanged at 3% Bumi Armada posts nearly RM97m net losses in Q3 Ringgit opens easier on weak sentiment Mercury Industries to sell off auto refinish firm With US$3b port, Malacca eyes slice of shipping giant Singapore's pie IGB third-quarter pre-tax profit surges 149% advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

In awe of the building when they were growing up, they were drawn by what their young eyes saw as an attractive and imposing structure. Leticia Trevio used to imagine herself living in the two-story building. Local historians cannot pin down construction dates, but Leopoldo Trevio said he has been told it was built anywhere from the mid- to late-1800s. Used at one time or another as a cantina, barbershop, pool hall and brothel, it is now home to the Trevios arts and decorations store. They bought the building in July 2001 and the following month began its rehabilitation. Supporters of historic preservation, they wanted to emphasize the buildings character and used as many older, historical products as possible. The idea is to recycle whatever you have to use, and whatever new should be made to look old, Leopoldo Trevio said. Some of the items needed for the project, such as electrical and plumbing materials, were hard to find in Rio Grande City. But many of the items used in the rehabilitation came from within Starr County. I am very excited they undertook that project because it is a start for the revitalization of the downtown area, said Mauro E. Villarreal, coordinator of the Rio Grande Citys Main Street project, which is under the Texas Historical Commission in Austin and promotes downtown redevelopment. Mr. and Mrs. Trevio are very, very talented. It is a good thing they decided to purchase a building downtown, renovate it and restore something that is historic to the Rio Grande City area, he said. The Trevios said people who visit the store often ask where they might find an old, unused building so they can take on their own revitalization efforts. We see the interest we have generated, Leopoldo Trevio said. For the Trevios, the renovation became a living history lesson filled with color and texture. Part of the first floor had five layers of carpet, which were removed to reveal a 1950s green, blue and white tile floor. The floor is in its original condition and is used in the craft shop. Some of the first floor walls were covered in paneling, which the Trevios removed. They discovered seven bullet holes from a gun battle that once took place in the building. The holes remain, surrounded now by a hand-painted mural done by Leticia Trevio depicting a country trail laced with flowers and grass. Behind the paneling they also discovered interior window arches. Leticia Trevio used windows given to her by her aunt, Ignacia Gutierrez, to install under the arches. The buildings past as a brothel has given way to tamer pursuits. Originally, people could shift a portion of the paneling and walk down a narrow hallway to a section of rooms where prostitutes and customers got together. Leopoldo Trevio tore down that wall and built a new section, which serves as his work and storage area. Rebuilt with new lumber, the room holds items he makes and sells at the craft store, like wood cabinets, birdhouses, crosses and recreations of local buildings. He has also stored some of the doors used in the brothel rooms. Splashed in red paint across the doors are the words women and men. Leticia Trevios work area, accessed by walking through an original doorframe, contains a faded pink hanging cabinet dating back to the 1920s. A chandelier from nearby Fort Ringgold hangs in the center of the room. A ground floor wall next to the staircase had to be completely redone because of deterioration, so the Trevios built one of wood from the Florence J. Scott House in Rio Grande City. Scott was one of the first teachers in Starr County. They removed carpeting from the staircase and replaced some of the wood that was deteriorating. Wood, cast iron and metal plates were used to stabilize the railings. On the second floor, they found an even more daunting task, given the weak floor and a lack of electricity. We came up with a flashlight, Leticia Trevio said. Blocks covering the upstairs windows were removed and replaced with new frames and glass. The original cotton ceiling cover was removed and replaced with a new white covering. It took two weeks to staple into place. My fingers were hurting real bad, Leopoldo Trevio said. They decided to keep the buildings original second-floor color scheme gray, peach, light green and light blue as well as sections of the original linoleum flooring found in the three upstairs rooms. The flooring is in patterns of brown, gold, rose, red and green. Eventual plans for the second floor include a local art gallery and a city information center, Leopoldo Trevio said. More modern handiwork is apparent on the buildings exterior. The Trevios installed Saltillo tile in the outdoor patio and cantina. An enclosed toilet and sink were built in an enclosed area of the courtyard along with a fountain and decorative stones. A new outdoor back wall was installed. I redesigned the wall to where he (Leopoldo) could have his saws away from everything, Leticia Trevio said. But there is an element of the old, as well. In the center of the courtyard sits an old, large pot that once belonged to Jesus Guerra, Leopoldo Trevios great-grandfather, who lived on San Roman Ranch in Starr County.

The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street. (Richard Drew / Associated Press) Associated Press Privacy Policy U.S. stocks jumped to record highs Friday, making their biggest gain in almost a month, after a strong jobs report for July gave investors more confidence that the economy is still growing. Financial and technology stocks soared and investors sold the safer assets they have favored for most of this year. Banks traded higher as investors anticipated higher interest rates and bigger profits on mortgages and other loans. The Nasdaq composite closed at a record high as tech stocks continued to climb. Consumer companies also made big gains. Investors sold bonds, precious metals and shares of phone and utility companies, traditionally safer investments that soared earlier this year as investors worried about the health of the economy. “It looks like the economy is improving. It looks like corporate earnings are on the upswing,” said Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ. That marks a change from earlier this year, he said, when investors worried the U.S. would fall into a recession and tech companies would suffer as businesses cut spending. But tech stocks have come back to lead the market higher over the last few months. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 191.48 points, or 1%, to 18,543.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 18.62 points, or 0.9%, to 2,182.87. The Nasdaq advanced 54.87 points, or 1.1%, to 5,221.12. The strong jobs report suggests that Britain's vote to leave the European Union in late June didn't have much effect on hiring plans for U.S. companies. The unemployment rate remained at 4.9% and hourly pay continued to rise. The hiring spree follows an even larger surge in June and represents a turnaround from weak job growth in the first half of this year, including disappointing job gains in April and May. Five things we learned from the surprisingly strong July jobs report Jim Puzzanghera The second straight month of surprisingly strong job growth shows the labor market has regained its health after a springtime stumble, and economists welcomed the news after recent signs of weakness in the broader U.S. economy. Private- and public-sector employers added 255,000 net new jobs in...

Bank of America rose 57 cents, or 3.9%, to $15.05 and Citigroup climbed $1.88, or 4.3%, to $45.72. Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, said the report reassured investors but won't vanquish their fears entirely. “With an election where both candidates are likely to talk about how badly the economy is doing and how disappointing growth has been, investors as a whole are more anxious than the job picture would suggest,” she said. The Federal Reserve has been saying for months that it intends to raise interest rates if the economy's strength warrants it. July's report provides more evidence the economy is doing well, boosting the chances that interest rates will go up. But Warne said investor views on the economy and the Fed will keep fluctuating. “When the Fed indicates that they're data dependent, that means investors are going to be data dependent as well,” she said. Bond prices fell and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note jumped to 1.59% from 1.50%. Kraft Heinz, the company behind Oscar Mayer, Jell-O and Velveeta, rose 3.8% to $88.79 after it reported a larger profit than analysts expected. After Bristol-Myers Squibb said one of its cancer drugs failed in a clinical trial, its stock suffered its biggest slump since 2000. Meanwhile, rival drugmaker Merck soared by the most in seven years. Bristol-Myers sank 16% to $63.28 after saying its drug Opdivo did not halt progression of non-small cell lung cancer in the study. Merck, which makes a drug called Keytruda that also stimulates patients' immune systems to fight lung cancer, rose 10.4% to $63.86. Merck was the largest gainer among S&P 500 stocks, and Bristol-Myers Squibb took the largest loss. FireEye tumbled 12.1% to $14.73 after the Milpitas, Calif., maker of security software reported weak sales, cut its forecasts and said it will eliminate up to 400 jobs. Rival security software firm Symantec climbed 4.1% to $21.89 after the Mountain View, Calif., company disclosed better-than-expected results and gave a strong full-year profit forecast. El Pollo Loco Holdings rose 2.8% to $13.45 after the Tex-Mex food chain, based in Costa Mesa, posted stronger results than analysts expected. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 13 cents to $41.89 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 2 cents to $44.27 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline held steady at $1.38 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.32 a gallon. Natural gas fell 6 cents to $2.77 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $23, or 1.7%, to $1,344.40 an ounce, its biggest loss since May. Silver fell 63 cents, or 3.1%, to $19.82 an ounce. Copper fell 2 cents to $2.15 a pound. The dollar rose to 101.75 yen from 101.17 yen and the euro fell to $1.1091 from $1.1127. France's CAC-40 rose 1.5% and the DAX in Germany advanced 1.4%. London's FTSE 100 was up 0.8%. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.2% and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was little changed.

 US stocks jump as strong jobs report calms investors Marley Jay, Associated Press Aug. 5, 2016, 6:29 PM 26 facebook linkedin twitter email print FILE - In this Oct. 2, 2014 file photo, people pass a Wall Street subway stop, in New York's Financial District. Stock markets were modestly higher Friday, Aug. 5, 2016 in the run-up to monthly U.S. jobs data that could go a long way to determining whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this year. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) syndication.ap.org NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks jumped to record highs Friday after a strong jobs report for the month of July gave investors more confidence that the economy is still growing. Financial and technology stocks soared and investors sold the safe assets they have favored for most of this year. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 255,000 jobs in July, far more than investors expected and the second straight month of strong gains after shaky reports this spring. Stocks made their biggest gain in almost a month. Banks traded higher as investors anticipated higher interest rates and bigger profits on mortgages and other loans.

The broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.9 percent to 2,182.87, about four points above its prior all-time high set last month. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite also set a record, up 1.1 percent at 5,221.12, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.0 percent to 18,543.53, only 12 points from its record. The Labor Department said the economy added 255,000 jobs in July, easily topping the analyst forecast for an increase of 185,000 payrolls. The department also upwardly revised the employment figures for May and June and said hourly wages rose in July. "The US economy may not be going gangbusters but it remains the best equity alternative of any worldwide index," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. "The most important takeaway from a better jobs report is an indication of a continued grind higher in the US economy." The jobs report also boosts the odds of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase this year, but probably not before December, analysts said. Banking shares rallied on expectations of higher US interest rates. JPMorgan Chase gained 2.7 percent, Bank of American 3.9 percent and Citigroup 4.3 percent. Technology shares were also generally higher, with Dow members Apple and IBM climbing 1.5 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. Airlines also rose, with Delta Air Lines winning 3.1 percent and United Continental 5.5 percent. Bristol-Myers Squibb plunged 16.0 percent after announcing that a clinical trial of its Opdivo drug to treat lung cancer failed. The news boosted Dow member Merck, which has a competing drug, pushing shares up a hefty 10.4 percent. Online travel company Priceline surged 4.0 percent after reporting that second-quarter net income rose 12.3 percent to $580.6 million following a 19 percent rise in overall bookings to $17.9 billion. Kraft Heinz jumped 3.8 percent after reporting second-quarter net income of $770 million, compared with a loss of $344 million in the year-ago period.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 5 August 2016 | MYT 10:13 PM Wall Street rises after strong jobs data At 9:42am ET (Friday), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 135.31 points, or 0.74%, at 18,487.36.- AFP pic NEW YORK: Wall Street opened higher on Friday as robust labour market data boosted optimism about the strength of the US economy. The report by the US Labour Department showed that nonfarm payrolls rose by 255,000 in July. Economists had expected a rise of 180,000. The report also showed that the unemployment rate was flat at 4.9%, staying below the 5% mark associated with full employment. Average hourly wages rose by 8 cents. “(The data) cements the view that the economy is improving despite the recent negative news from GDP,” said Aaron Kohli, interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York. The data suggests that the April and May jobs data was an aberration and that June was more consistent with what is going on in the economy, he said. The June employment number was revised up to 292,000 from 287,000. However, inflation running below the Fed’s 2% target and weaker-than-expected GDP growth amid global uncertainty could deter the central bank from pulling the trigger in the near term. The chances of a rate hike doubled to 18% in September after the jobs report, and rose to 36.8% from 29.4% in December. Those numbers do not rise significantly even until July next year, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. “I’m not sure this is enough to move the needle in either direction for the Fed,” said Curt Long, chief economist at National Association Of Federal Credit Unions in Washington. At 9:42am ET (1342 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 135.31 points, or 0.74%, at 18,487.36. The S&P 500 was up 11.67 points, or 0.54%, at 2,175.92. The Nasdaq Composite was up 34.94 points, or 0.68%, at 5,201.18. Seven of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by a 0.89% rise in financials. Shares of banks including JPMorgan, Bank of America  and Citigroup, which stand to gain if the Fed raises rates, rose between 2% and 3%. Bristol-Myers plunged 16.3% after its lung cancer drug failed in a late-stage study, while Merck, which makes a rival drug, soared 6%. Bristol-Myers was the biggest drag on the S&P, while Merck gave the index its biggest boost. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,902 to 752.  On the Nasdaq, 1,594 issues rose and 694 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 16 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 49 new highs and eight new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks You May Be Interested AirAsia X earnings slightly below forecast, says CIMB Research Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read High-profile French police site among terrorist suspects' targets -sources M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex Property Related advertisement Latest News Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Mercury Industries to sell off auto refinish firm Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy Most Viewed in Business Fraud in Felda Global Ventures M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Malakoff seeks RM785mil compensation from EPCC contractors of Tg Bin plant Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy Bank Negara keeps OPR unchanged at 3% Bumi Armada posts nearly RM97m net losses in Q3 Ringgit opens easier on weak sentiment Mercury Industries to sell off auto refinish firm With US$3b port, Malacca eyes slice of shipping giant Singapore's pie IGB third-quarter pre-tax profit surges 149% advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

 Bristol-Myers shares bombed after it failed a key study — and its biggest rival is surging Lydia Ramsey Aug. 5, 2016, 2:52 PM 8,491 facebook linkedin twitter email print Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb were hit hard Friday after news that its blockbuster cancer drug failed a key clinical trial. The drug, called Opdivo, is one of a new set of drugs called immunotherapy. The drug targets the programmed cell death 1 (or PD-1) receptor to essentially take the "foot off the brake pedal" in the immune system, so that the immune system can go after the cancer cells. The trial was for patients with previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer, a common form of lung cancer. The trial "was designed to answer the question of the benefit of Opdivo monotherapy in a broad patient population. Unfortunately, this trial did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ≥ 5%," BMS said in a statement. BMS was down as much as 17% Friday morning, erasing nearly $21 billion in market value. Google Finance Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger said in a note that he had downgraded BMS to equal-weight on the news. "We had assumed Bristol would continue to one-up competitors via smarter and broader immuno-oncology drug development. We are significantly lowering our Opdivo revenue projections and EPS," he said in a note. Opdivo, which has already been approved to treat other forms of cancer, has been a big hit for BMS, bringing in $840 million in second-quarter sales alone. In comparison, its main anti-PD-1 immunotherapy competition, Keytruda, made by Merck, made $314 million in sales the same quarter. However, in June, Keytruda succeeded in its trial, which was designed a bit differently, treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer who hadn't received any prior treatments. Merck was up 6% Friday morning on the news of BMS's trial.

Shares of Bristol-Myers' competitors who have their own versions of the cancer therapy rose on the news. Bristol-Myers' shares ended the day down nearly 16 percent, while shares of Merck surged more than 10 percent. Bristol-Myers' drug Opdivo, which is already approved to treat some types of cancer, before Friday was seen as a treatment that could significantly boost the company's growth. In the study known as CheckMate -026, the company was trying to see if Opvido would be successful in treating "a broad patient population" of people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, which accounts for the vast share of lung cancers. Up to 200,000 people in the United States are annually diagnosed with non-small lung cancer, which is often fatal. Bristol-Myers CEO Giovanni Caforio said in a release that he was "disappointed" with the result but management remains "committed to improving patient outcomes through our comprehensive development program." Caforio also pointed to another ongoing trial, called CheckMate -227, of Opdivo in combination with the therapy Yervoy, as well as Obdivo combined with chemotherapy. "We believe that combination therapy may provide an important opportunity to address the needs of every patient with first-line lung cancer," the company said. Opdivo had sales of $840 million in the recently ended quarter, which was $718 million more than in the same quarter in 2015. Dr. Mark Schoenebaum, a biotech and pharmaceuticals analyst at Evercore ISI, in a note called the Opdvio trial results "a major surprise — possibly the biggest clinical surprise of my career." "Investors had high expectations for this trial." Schoenebaum wrote, noting that there was a consensus view that Opdivo would have sales for all kinds of treatments of around $12 billion by 2021, "with perhaps" $7 billion to $8 billion of that coming from the drug being used to treat non-small cell lung cancers either by itself, or in conjunction with other therapies." If the 17-percent drop is sustained Friday, it would represent the second-biggest daily percentage loss for Bristol-Myers shares, and lop off $21 billion in market cap. The company's stock fell by 22.4 percent on April 19, 2000, when Bristol-Myers withdrew an application for a hypertension treatment from the federal Food and Drug Administration after the agency expressed safety concerns about the drug. As of intraday trade, shares were more than 8 percent lower for the year so far. Shares of Dow component Merck, which offers a competing drug called Keytruda, surged more than 6 percent in morning trade after the news about Opdivo. Analysts have said Keytruda — which recently met its target in its own late-stage study — could dramatically increase Merck's sales over the next decade. "Both of them have had good trials in the past. Now one of the trials for the drugs shows it might not be as effective," said Jonathan Wexler, chief sales officer at BioShares. AstraZeneca, which also offers a competing drug, saw its shares rise more than 1 percent in morning trade. He said the stock reaction was an "extremely significant move" and the news will be watched for impact to balance sheets. "This is an extraordinarily fortunate outcome for Merck's Keytruda," said BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei. "This is a seismic event in terms of market share implications." In a statement, a Merck spokeswoman declined to comment on Bristol-Myers' study. "We cannot comment on their findings as the full results have not yet been disclosed," she told CNBC in a statement. Bristol-Myers shares were downgraded to "neutral" from "buy" by SunTrust Robinson Humphrey on the news, with the firm saying it was lowering its price target for the stock from $86 per share to $68. Jefferies likewise revised its outlook on the company, saying, "We see Bristol-Myers down $7-$10/share in this scenario." But Jefferies also said, "The CheckMate -227 study for Opdivo/Yervoy presents another shot on goal." Damien Conover, equity analyst at Morningstar, went farther that that. He said that Bristol-Myers will be set back for one to two years, but is bullish on its potential in the immuno-oncology market. "We still think Opdivo gets the lion's share of the market but ... right now immuno-oncology drugs [have] a lot less side effects, and for some patients [they were] remarkably effective," Conover. "Going forward, I think you need more combination assets to treat those sort of folks, but I don't think this really changes the outlook for immuno-oncology drugs. We still have strong conviction in these drugs."

Prior to the news release, Bristol-Myers was halted. Upon resumption, shares plunged 18.36 percent. "Opdivo has become a foundational treatment that is transforming cancer care across multiple tumor types," said CEO Giovanni Caforio. "While we are disappointed CheckMate -026 did not meet its primary endpoint in this broad patient population, we remain committed to improving patient outcomes through our comprehensive development program, including the ongoing Phase 3 CheckMate -227 study exploring the potential of the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy for PD-L1 positive patients, and Opdivo plus Yervoy, or Opdivo plus chemotherapy in PD-L1 negative patients."

By Crystal Kim Biography August 2, 2016 Portfolio managers Scott St. John and Michael Reckmeyer run a fund that’s expected to offer a smooth ride. Their $8.2 billion Hartford Balanced Income fund (ticker: HBLAX) splits its assets between stocks and bonds, a mix that should provide a cushion when stocks tank, but not fly quite so high in bull markets. So far this year, however, it has returned 9.7%, not only beating the 6.6% return of its stock/bond competitors (as measured by the Morningstar Moderate Target Risk Index) but also the Standard & Poor’s 500’s 7.1%....

The companys latest report states that as well as the rapidly expanding prevalence population in South-East Asia, market growth will be driven by the increased uptake of recently approved and emerging branded T2DM therapeutics, in favour of lower-cost generic products. Aswini Nath, analyst for GBI Research, explains: Unmet needs relating to patient convenience and ease of use will be addressed significantly during the forecast period. Higher levels of innovation are apparent in the early stage pipeline, which may lead to considerable improvements beyond the existing range of products, in terms of safety and efficacy in the long-term. In terms of recently approved therapeutics, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors and SGLT-2 inhibitors have already achieved strong market uptake and are all expected to increase their market shares during the forecast period. In comparison with many previously marketed therapies, these new products provide improved weight control and lowered hypoglycaemia risk, Aswini added. In terms of late-stage pipeline products with the potential to change the treatment paradigm, six candidates stand out as offering superior safety, efficacy and patient compliance. These are Novo Nordisks NN-9535 (semaglutide subcutaneous formulation) and OG-217SC (semaglutide oral formulation) and Eli Lillys Trulicity (dulaglutide), which are GLP-1 receptor agonists, Mercks ertugliflozin and Theracos's bexagliflozin, which are SGLT-2 inhibitors, and Mercks omarigliptin, which is a DPP-4 inhibitor. Of these products, GBI Research believes that OG-217SC, being a first-to-market oral formulation in the GLP-1 agonist class of drug, has the most potential to change the treatment paradigm owing to its improved administration route compared with other drugs in the same class. However, Nath adds: Although increased uptake of branded drugs is expected, metformin  a low-cost generic drug  will maintain its pivotal role in the T2DM treatment algorithm in South-East Asia. Owing to its well-characterised safety and efficacy profiles, wide availability and low cost, metformin will continue to be prescribed as the first-line pharmacotherapy and also remain the favoured option for use.

Close share panel Image copyright Reuters (Closed): Wall Street markets closed up after figures showed stronger than expected growth in the labour market. The S&P 500 index climbed 18.62 points, or 0.86%, to 2,182.87, beating an all-time high record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 191.48 (1.04%) to 18,543.53, while the Nasdaq was up 54.87 (1.06%) to 5,221.12. The US economy added 255,000 jobs last month and figures for May and June were also revised upwards. The figures add to speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by the end of the year. "The most important takeaway from a better jobs report is an indication of a continued grind higher in the US economy," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. Shares in banks, which are expected to gain from any rise in interest rates, were higher. Goldman Sachs climbed 2.6% and JP Morgan Chase rose 2.7%. Shares in Bristol-Myers Squibb sank 16% after the company said its Opdivo cancer treatment had failed in a key study. In contrast, shares in Merck, which makes a rival treatment, saw its shares jump 10% to $63.86. On the Nasdaq, shares in Google's parent company, Alphabet climbed 1.2%, while Apple stock jumped 1.5%.
