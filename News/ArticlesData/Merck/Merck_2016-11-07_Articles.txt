Adults are as likely as children to die from diseases that they can be immunized. For example, vaccination can prevent about 50% of deaths from pneumococcal disease and 80% of deaths from influenza-related complications in the elderly. Adult vaccines continue to be one of the growing segment for pharmaceutical companies. The driving factors for adult vaccines growth are an increasing acceptance of adult vaccines and the public health focus on flu prevention, as well as introductions of new vaccines. The vaccines industry also faces hindrances such as vaccine safety, shortages and delays, vaccine development time line as well as entry barriers for new manufacturers. Adult Vaccines Market - Disease Wise Analysis The influenza vaccines capture maximum share of the total adult vaccines market. It is the most popular and accepted vaccination amongst adults. The hepatitis vaccines account for second highest share of the total adult vaccines market in 2015. The HPV/cervical cancer vaccines and pneumococcal vaccines captures the third and fourth highest share of the adult vaccines market respectively in 2015. While vaccines for zoster shingles and DTP are also gaining ground in adult vaccines market landscape. Adult Vaccines Market - Company Analysis Note: Novartis divested its non-influenza vaccine business to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and CSL acquired Novartis influenza vaccines business. In 2010, GSK was the leader in the adult vaccines market but it lost the leadership position to Merck. Sanofi Pasteur stands at the second position in the adult vaccines market landscape. GSK slipped to third position in the global adult vaccines market in 2014. While Pfizer stands at the fourth spot in the adult vaccines market landscape. Adult Vaccines Market - Disease Wise Company Sales Analysis GSK generates maximum adult vaccines sales from Hepatitis and DTP vaccines, while Sanofi Pasteur remains focused on maintaining its leadership in the influenza vaccines market. The cervical cancer and zoster shingles vaccines contributes maximum share of the total Merck adult vaccines sales. Novartis main source of adult vaccines sales revenue is the influenza vaccines. In 2011, Sanofi Pasteur replaced GSK and became the dominant player in the influenza vaccines landscape, while in the cervical cancer vaccines market, Merck is at the forefront and is expected to maintain its dominancy over a longer period of time. GSK is the clear leader in hepatitis vaccines market. Adult Vaccines Market - Regional Distribution On a regional basis, the United States comprises the single largest market for adult vaccines being closely followed by Europe. Japan's adult vaccines market share is expected to remain flat during the forecasting period, while China's adult vaccines market is likely to show continuous growth. South America and India are competing closely with each other to grab maximum share of the adult vaccines market pie. This is the 2nd edition report on Adult Vaccines Market by iGATE RESEARCH.

City says MSD watchdog wastes money Dan Horn , dhorn@enquirer.com 5:18 p.m. EST November 7, 2016 Buy Photo Metropolitan Sewer District headquarters in Cincinnati. (Photo: Enquirer file)Buy Photo The monitor team that's supposed to save money at the Metropolitan Sewer District is actually wasting it, Cincinnati officials said Monday. City Councilman Charlie Winburn led the charge against Hamilton County's monitoring team with a council hearing that featured MSD Director Gerald Checco complaining about the team and budget numbers showing the team has spent more than $4 million in each of the past two years. "Something stinks here and it isn't good," Winburn said. County officials, who oversee MSD's budget, say Winburn's numbers stink and his case against the monitoring team is weak. They say the team has saved far more money than it has cost and its budget is far less than the city claims. "There they go again," County Commissioner Chris Monzel said of city officials. "The monitor has been responsible for saving the ratepayers millions of dollars." The spat is the latest between the city, which runs MSD, and the county, which sets its budget, over how best to run the sewer district, which is managing a court-ordered, $3.2 billion sewer reconstruction project. Buy Photo Hamilton County Commissioner Chris Monzel  (Photo: Enquirer file) The disagreement shows just how far apart the city and county are these days when it comes to running the agency. Winburn and Checco said the monitor team spent $4.6 million last year and $4 million this year, but county officials say those numbers are bogus. The monitor team, led by Dave Meyer, says it actually spent $1.4 million and $1.2 million in those years. County Budget Director John Bruggen said the rest of the money cited by the city appears to include all county expenses related to MSD, including staff costs, legal expenses and other items. Bruggen said the $4.6 million figure for last year may be inflated because it includes almost three-fourths of the county's bills for the previous year, as well as all of 2015. Bruggen said that's because MSD didn't pay the county for those 2014 expenses and had to play catch-up in 2015. The bickering over the monitor comes months after articles in The Enquirer revealed poor oversight and millions of dollars in questionable contracts at MSD. City officials say they've fixed the agency's problems and don't need the county monitor team, which is made up of county employees and private contractors. Buy Photo Cincinnati City Councilman Charlie Winburn  (Photo: Enquirer file) Winburn, who is friends with some MSD contractors whose work has been challenged in recent months, has been a frequent critic of the monitor team. Checco has complained that the monitor team interferes with MSD operations and isn't accountable for its spending. But Monzel and county commissioners, who approve the monitor team's budget, say the team provides valuable oversight that routinely saves ratepayers money. Sewer rates have climbed from an average of about $250 a year to almost $1,000 in the past decade, largely because of the massive reconstruction project. The agreement that created MSD's unusual structure expires in 2018. City and county officials now are negotiating in federal court for a new agreement. 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2faTMww TOP VIDEOS Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Lakota East's Horter wins state cross country 2:58 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Division I volleyball regional semifinals 1:46 More Stories Woman used disabled mother's workers' comp for drugs Nov. 14, 2016, 4:32 p.m. Portune: Dems will set county budget Nov. 14, 2016, 4:53 p.m. DuBose family: 'Sam, we are fighting for you' Nov. 14, 2016, 3:21 p.m. Justice demands quick retrial for Tensing Nov. 14, 2016, 3:53 p.m.

According to the detail issued to the media, both companies also agreed on long-term agreements whereby the business in Pakistan will have access to Merck healthcare and life science portfolios, ensuring continued supply of its products to its patients and customers. “We are convinced that Martin Dow will be a great partner who will ensure sustainable long-term growth of the Pakistan business,” Simon Sturge, chief operating officer of Merck’s healthcare business said. He added that the divestiture was due to strategic reasons. The Marker family, the founder of the business, will remain a shareholder along with Martin Dow and together, they will uphold the values and ethics that have been the hallmark for Merck’s valued employees, patients and other stakeholders. Under the new owners, Merck Pakistan will continue to operate as a separate legal entity, with the same employees. No operations will be shutdown and there will be no job termination as a result of this transaction, as Martin Dow is committed to continuing and growing the existing business. Martin Dow has also agreed on a two-year job guarantee for all permanent and contract employees. In addition, Merck will pay its employees a welcome bonus at closing. “We intend to build Merck’s outstanding record in Pakistan further and protect employees rights in the same manner as has been prevalent all these years in Merck,” Jawed Akhai, Chairman of Martin Dow said. “I am sure all employees and other stakeholders will take pride in the fact that they will now be an integral part of the country’s fastest growing pharmaceutical group.” SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Web Desk TAGS Martin Dow Merck pharmaceutical company NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Latest News Wasim Akram mother’s residence robbed Web Desk - November 14, 2016 Japanese researchers discovers diabetics treatment November 14, 2016 Pakistan vs New Zealand Test to go ahead after earthquake November 14, 2016 Australia vs South Africa 2nd Test Day 3 full highlights November 14, 2016 Watch how Pakistan Army kills Indian soldiers at LoC November 14, 2016 What time is the Supermoon 2016 in US?

Print Share All News Consumer Pharma New Drugs Pipeline Clinical Trials FDA Alerts Conatus Initiates Phase 2b ENCORE-PH Clinical Trial of Emricasan in Patients with NASH Cirrhosis Tweet SAN DIEGO, Nov. 03, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:CNAT) today announced the initiation of ENCORE-PH (PH for Portal Hypertension), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating emricasan, the company's first-in-class, orally-active pan-caspase inhibitor, in approximately 240 patients with compensated or early decompensated liver cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and severe portal hypertension confirmed by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) of ≥12 mmHg at baseline. This trial is designed to evaluate dosing, efficacy and safety of emricasan in NASH cirrhosis as an integral part of the company's initial registration strategy. Top-line results from the ENCORE-PH clinical trial are expected in 2018. The ENCORE-PH clinical trial is expected to be conducted at approximately 90 U.S. and EU clinical sites. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 5 mg of emricasan, 25 mg of emricasan, 50 mg of emricasan, or placebo twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the mean change from baseline in HVPG at 24 weeks for each dosing group compared with the placebo group. Key secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability, dose response, and percentage of patients achieving at least a 20% reduction in HVPG. Additional key endpoints include initial or subsequent decompensation events, changes from baseline in Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child-Pugh scores, and health-related quality of life. Select sites will also investigate whether emricasan improves liver stiffness as measured by Fibroscan® transient elastography and liver metabolic function using the BreathID® Methacetin Breath Test at screening and at Week 24. "ENCORE-PH is a key component of our clinical strategy designed to support an initial registration of emricasan in NASH cirrhosis," said Conatus co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer Steven J. Mento, Ph.D. "Portal hypertension, a major consequence of advancing liver cirrhosis, is a driving factor in clinical outcomes such as ascites and variceal hemorrhage, as well as liver failure and death. The primary endpoint, HVPG, has been identified as a validated surrogate endpoint potentially suitable for registration. Results released last year from our open label pilot Portal Hypertension clinical trial and results from preclinical studies have demonstrated emricasan's ability to reduce HVPG rapidly and significantly through both intrahepatic and extrahepatic mechanisms. We believe that chronic administration of emricasan, which would be supported by the longer treatment duration being evaluated in ENCORE-PH, will lead to additional benefits for cirrhosis patients." ENCORE-PH is one of the parallel EmricasaN, a Caspase inhibitOR, for Evaluation (ENCORE) clinical trials designed to evaluate emricasan treatment in chronic liver disease of different etiologies and disease stages. The ENCORE clinical trials are designed to provide clinically relevant efficacy, dosing, and safety data to support the initial registration of emricasan for chronic administration in patients with NASH cirrhosis and potentially support future label expansion. Results from the combined ENCORE clinical trials are expected to support the design of Phase 3 efficacy and safety trials and, depending on the strength of the efficacy and safety data, may warrant earlier discussions with regulatory agencies regarding potential accelerated approval. The ENCORE-NF clinical trial, in patients with NASH fibrosis, was initiated in January 2016. Conatus expects to initiate the remainder of the ENCORE clinical trials on a staggered basis through the first half of 2017 and expects top-line results from the ENCORE clinical trials to be available periodically beginning in the first half of 2018. About Emricasan Clinical Development To date, emricasan has been studied in over 650 subjects in sixteen clinical trials across a broad range of liver disease etiologies and stages of progression. In multiple clinical trials, emricasan has demonstrated statistically significant, rapid and sustained reductions in elevated levels of key biomarkers of inflammation and apoptosis that are implicated in the severity and progression of liver disease. Recent emricasan clinical trial results have demonstrated emricasan's ability to provide statistically significant improvements in clinically important validated surrogate endpoints of portal hypertension and liver function across a variety of etiologies in the subgroups of liver cirrhosis patients with highest medical need. The company also is evaluating emricasan's potential longer-term effects on liver structure in its ongoing Phase 2b ENCORE-NF clinical trial and its ongoing Phase 2b POLT-HCV-SVR clinical trial in post-orthotopic liver transplant (POLT) recipients who have reestablished liver fibrosis or cirrhosis post-transplant as a result of recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and who have successfully achieved a sustained viral response (SVR) following antiviral therapy. About Conatus Pharmaceuticals Conatus is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of novel medicines to treat liver disease. Conatus is developing its lead compound, emricasan, for the treatment of patients with chronic liver disease. Emricasan is a first-in-class, orally active pan-caspase inhibitor designed to reduce the activity of enzymes that mediate inflammation and apoptosis. Conatus believes that by reducing the activity of these enzymes, emricasan has the potential to interrupt the disease progression across the spectrum of liver disease.

Instead, it's a dead heat. And the bruising fight over the measure that could directly affect 5 million Californians, and possibly millions more, turned even nastier this week with a scathing series of social media ads targeting pharmaceutical company CEOs. Major pharmaceutical companies have been pouring massive amounts of money — $109 million and counting — into California to urge voters to say "No" to Prop 61, which if passed Tuesday would largely bar state agencies that cover about 5 million people for paying any more for prescription drugs than what the federal Veterans Affairs Department pays. Source: Yes on Prop 61 Prop 61 advertisement for lower drug prices. The VA often pays the lowest prices for drugs in the nation, being able to negotiate what it pays for medications, often at a steep discount compared to other government agencies and Medicare. The big funding support pharma has given the "No" campaign reflects both the huge amount that California state agencies spend on medications annually — around $4 billion — and concerns drug companies have that other states might follow suit with drug-price control initiatives of their own in the event that Prop 61 passes. "They're running scared," said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the main backer of Prop 61, also known as "the California Drug Price Relief Act." "Their own internal polls got them nervous," said Weinstein, whose "Yes" campaign's message refers to "greedy drug companies" that are "overcharging California's taxpayers and consumers by billions of dollars each year for life-saving medicines, putting profits over people." But the "No on 61" campaign, which in addition to pharma companies includes patient advocates, doctors, veterans' groups, labor unions and other AIDS activists, warns that the measure could have negative unintended consequences that would include higher drug costs for many people, and decreased access to some medications. Several drug companies, Merck, Pfizer and Amgen, released identically worded statements to CNBC on Monday they have "serious concerns about this poorly-written measure because of the negative impact it will have on Californians," adding that, "We are part of a broad and growing coalition of organizations." Pharma's contributions — which include more than $9 million apiece from Merck, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson — combined with the $16 million or so spent by "Yes" advocates led by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation have made Prop 61 the most expensive ballot measure ever in California, and possibly the most expensive in U.S. history, according to the politics site Ballotpedia. Despite the huge spending edge by the "No" side, which fueled an onslaught of television ads, a recent Field Poll found voters split evenly — 47 percent to 47 percent — on the measure. The expensive and contentious campaigning over Prop 61, which has drawn enthusiastic support from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, got personal on Sunday. The "Yes" campaign released a series of 15-second YouTube ads showing CEOs of pharma companies on "Wanted" posters, saying they were being sought "for gouging the American public & taxpayers with killer drug prices." One such ad, featuring J&J CEO Alex Gorsky, noted that his salary last year was $23.8 million, and said the company in 2013 paid $2.2 billion "to settle criminal charges of illegally promoting the improper use of its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal for use by elderly patients despite studies that showed the drug increases risk of stroke and diabetes." The ad ends with the message "Vote Yes on Prop 61." J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz told CNBC, "As we have learned through the 2016 election campaign, personal attacks do not serve the interests of the American public or foster a balanced discussion on the substantive issues facing the nation." Kathy Fairbanks, spokeswoman for the "No on 61" campaign, said of the ads, "All the antics from 'Yes on 61' are an attempt by them to take attention away from their flawed measure." "When voters look into the facts, we believe they'll see this measure is bad for California," Fairbanks said. The "Yes on 61" campaign argues that Prop 61 would exploit the state's "bulk-purchasing power to secure lower prices for prescription drugs, saving taxpayers billions of dollars." "And it will be an important blow against the monopoly pricing power of profit-driven arrogance of the pharmaceutical industry," according to the campaign's website. But the "No on 61" campaign spokeswoman said the "Yes" campaign is "talking in a lot of generalities," and is misleading voters about the impact of the proposition if passed. Fairbanks said the ballot measure would only cover "12 percent of Californians, who are in certain health-care programs." Prop 61 would not change how Medicare, job-based health plans, or Obamacare plans pay for their drugs. The "No" campaign argues that Prop 61 could actually lead to higher drug costs for many people, including veterans. If the drug companies' prices for a large chunk of Californians was pegged to the Veterans Affairs prices, that argument goes, then the companies would have less incentive to give the VA a sharply discounted price. The campaign also said that Prop 61 "would invalidate many drug discount agreements the state has negotiated with pharmaceutical companies," which would increase state prescription costs by tens of millions of dollars each year. The California Medical Association, which represents doctors in California, opposes the measure because of that claim, and also because the group said the cancellation of drug purchasing contracts the state already has with pharma companies "would remove many drugs from the Medi-Cal list of pre-approved medicines — creating a new prior authorization hurdle for patients and their physicians." Medi-Cal, which is exempt from Prop 61, is the state's Medicaid program. Fairbanks said another problem with Prop 61 is its linkage of prices paid by state agencies to the VA's price, which is not public information, and it is not clear if the state could compel disclosure. An analysis released in June by the state's huge pension and health benefits agency for retirees, CalPers, voiced many of the same concerns raised by the "No" campaign. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation's chief, Weinstein, said the "No" campaign has "been so fulsome in their lying that it confused people" about the issue. Weinstein said "there's nothing in Prop 61 that would raise prices for anybody." "What they're saying is their obscene profits are inviolate," Weinstein said, arguing that there is nothing in the ballot measure that compels drug companies to demand higher prices for consumers to offset the lower profit margin obtained from selling to customers covered by Prop 61.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Aralez Reports Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results -Provides Improved 2016 Full Year Guidance- MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, Nov. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARLZ) (TSX: ARZ) (“Aralez” or the “Company“) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016. The Company also highlighted certain corporate and commercial updates. All figures are in U.S. dollars. Corporate Updates: On October 31, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of the U.S. rights to Toprol-XL® (metoprolol succinate) and its Authorized Generic (AG) from AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca). AstraZeneca recorded U.S. net revenues from Toprol-XL and its AG of $91 million in 2014, $89 million in 2015 and $53 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. The transaction is expected to be immediately EBITDA accretive and to move profitability forward to 2017, in each case on an adjusted EBITDA basis. On October 3, 2016, the Company announced the commencement of the commercialization and availability of once-daily YOSPRALA™ (aspirin and omeprazole), the only prescription fixed-dose combination of aspirin, an anti-platelet agent, and omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, in the U.S. YOSPRALA is being promoted by 110 high quality, experienced sales representatives in the U.S. On September 15, 2016, the Company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved YOSPRALA for patients who require aspirin for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and who are at risk of developing aspirin associated gastric ulcers. Please refer to the Prescribing Information for important safety information regarding YOSPRALA at www.YOSPRALA.com. On September 6, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of the U.S. and Canadian rights to ZONTIVITY® (vorapaxar) from Merck & Co., Inc., known as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada. ZONTIVITY is the first and only approved therapy shown to inhibit the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), the primary receptor for thrombin, which is considered to be the most potent activator of platelets. In the U.S., ZONTIVITY is indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of heart attack (myocardial infarction) or in patients with narrowing of leg arteries, called peripheral arterial disease, and should be used in combination with daily aspirin and/or clopidogrel according to their indications or standard of care. Please refer to the Prescribing Information for important safety information regarding ZONTIVITY at http://www.merck.com/product /usa/pi_circulars/z/zontivity/zontivity_pi.pdf. “We continue to make excellent progress in delivering against the expectations that we outlined upon the formation of Aralez in the early part of this year,” said Adrian Adams, Chief Executive Officer of Aralez. “We have strengthened our anchor position in cardiovascular disease with the approval and launch of YOSPRALA and leveraged our competitive platform by executing on our growth strategy of diversifying our product offerings and revenue stream with the acquisitions of ZONTIVITY, Toprol-XL and its Authorized Generic. This has been achieved while maintaining a sound financial position through disciplined decision making and we are delighted to be in a position to improve our 2016 financial guidance by increasing our expected revenues and decreasing our projected spending.” Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results On February 5, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Tribute Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (“Tribute”) (the “Tribute Acquisition”). The accompanying financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes the operations of Tribute from the date of the Tribute Acquisition through September 30, 2016. On September 6, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of the U.S. and Canadian rights to ZONTIVITY. The accompanying financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes the results of ZONTIVITY from the date of its acquisition through September 30, 2016. The financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflects only the results of the Company’s predecessor company, POZEN Inc. (Pozen).  Total net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $13.6 million compared to $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net product revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $8.1 million, consisting entirely of revenues from products acquired through the Tribute Acquisition. Other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $5.5 million, primarily comprised of VIMOVO® royalties, compared to $5.8 million for the prior year comparable period. Royalty revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 include a decrease in U.S. net sales of VIMOVO primarily due to lower net pricing recorded by our commercialization partner, Horizon Pharma USA, Inc., partially offset by an increase in the royalty rate received from our ex-U.S. commercialization partner, AstraZeneca, on net sales outside of the U.S. from 6% to 10% commencing in 2016. GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $25.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by increased commercialization costs incurred in the U.S., predominantly related to the launch of YOSPRALA in October 2016, costs to support the build out of the Aralez global corporate structure, continued operational expenses in Canada, product acquisition-related expenses and higher share based compensation expenses. The increase in expenses was partially offset by a decrease in transaction fees compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $2.0 million compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Non-GAAP SG&A expenses, which represent our ongoing cash-based operating expenses and exclude transaction fees, severance and retention, product acquisition-related expenses and share-based compensation expense, were $20.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in non-GAAP SG&A expenses is primarily driven by commercialization costs incurred principally related to YOSPRALA, expenses incurred to support the build out of the Aralez global corporate structure and continued operational expenses in Canada. Non-GAAP R&D expenses, which exclude severance and retention and share-based compensation expense, were $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The GAAP net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $20.6 million, or $0.32 loss per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to a net loss of $8.1 million, or $0.25 loss per share on a fully diluted basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Balance Sheet As of September 30, 2016, approximately 65.4 million of the Company’s common shares were issued and outstanding and the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $56.5 million, after paying $25 million to acquire ZONTIVITY. On October 31, 2016, the Company drew down $25 million under its existing credit facility with Deerfield Management to replenish the $25 million upfront cash payment previously made in connection with the ZONTIVITY acquisition and drew down an additional $175 million to finance the upfront cash closing payment for the acquisition of Toprol-XL and its Authorized Generic. The lenders under the Company’s credit facility have also agreed to provide Aralez access to up to an additional $250 million in capital to fund future mutually agreeable transactions. 2016 Financial Guidance Aralez’s estimates are based on projected results of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2016 and reflect management’s current beliefs about, among other things, prescription trends, competition, pricing levels, inventory levels, and the anticipated timing of future events. The Company’s updated 2016 guidance on non-GAAP SG&A expenses and non-GAAP R&D expenses includes, among other things, YOSPRALA launch costs, taking into account the hiring of a total of approximately 110 sales professionals (inclusive of the 25 sales professionals hired to initially market Fibricor®), costs incurred in connection with receiving FDA approval of YOSPRALA, and the costs to build the necessary infrastructure in the U.S. and Ireland. It excludes share-based compensation expense and certain discrete costs, including merger and product acquisition-related expenses. The Company’s updated 2016 guidance on net revenues includes revenues from Tribute from February 6, 2016 through December 31, 2016, revenues from ZONTIVITY from September 6, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and revenues from Toprol-XL from October 31, 2016 through December 31, 2016. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” below.    For the year ending December 31, 2016, assuming, among other things, foreign currency exchange rates remain at or near current levels, the Company currently expects: 2016 net revenue guidance to increase to a range of $54 million to $62 million; 2016 non-GAAP SG&A expense guidance to decrease to a range of $78 million to $86 million; and 2016 non-GAAP R&D expense guidance to decrease to a range of $8 million to $10 million. See the table below for a comparison of the Company’s previous 2016 guidance to the updated 2016 guidance: Measure Original 2016 Guidance Updated 2016 Guidance Net Revenues $48 million to $58 million $54 million to $62 million Non-GAAP SG&A Expenses $85 million to $100 million $78 million to $86 million Non-GAAP R&D Expenses $8 million to $12 million $8 million to $10 million Third Quarter Results Webcast Aralez will host a webcast this morning, November 7, 2016 at 11:00 a.m. ET to present third quarter 2016 results.

More information about Aralez can be found at www.aralez.com. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company has presented certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP SG&A expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).  Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense and financing costs, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and gains or losses related to warrants, restructuring costs, retention costs, transaction costs including costs to evaluate, execute and integrate acquisitions, including acquired in-process R&D, interest income, the impact of changes in foreign currency rates, asset impairment charges, income tax adjustments, losses or gains on extinguishment or modification of debt and the impact of a sale or disposition of a business or product, including discontinued operations. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful for investors, taken in conjunction with GAAP financial statements, because it provides greater transparency regarding the Company’s operating performance by excluding (i) non-cash expenses that are substantially dependent on changes in the market price of our common shares, and (ii) discrete items, such as merger and acquisition-related costs, including transaction fees, and severance and retention expenses, that may not be consistently recurring. Management uses these measures, among other factors, to assess and analyze operational results and to make financial and operational decisions. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of the Company’s operating results as reported under GAAP, not as a substitute for GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this press release. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This press release includes certain statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the successful execution of our commercialization strategy for YOSPRALA, that the acquisition of Toprol-XL and its AG is expected to be immediately EBITDA accretive and to move profitability forward to 2017, in each case on an adjusted EBITDA basis, continuing to make excellent progress in delivering against the expectations outlined upon our formation, our strengthened anchor position in cardiovascular disease with the approval and launch of YOSPRALA, leveraging our competitive platform by executing on our growth strategy of diversifying our product offerings and revenue stream with the acquisitions of ZONTIVITY, Toprol-XL and its AG, maintaining a sound financial position through disciplined decision making, access to up to an additional $250 million in capital from Deerfield Management to fund future mutually agreeable acquisitions, our ability to successfully identify, execute and consummate business or product opportunities, acquisitions, prospective products or to obtain product approvals, the outlook for the Company’s future business and financial performance, including our improved 2016 guidance on non-GAAP SG&A expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses and net revenues, our strategies, plans, objectives, goals, prospects, future performance or results of current and anticipated products,  and other statements that are not historical facts, and such statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “likely,” “potential,” “continue” or the negative or similar words, variations of these words or other comparable words or phrases, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. You should be aware that the forward-looking statements included herein represent management’s current judgment and expectations, and are based on current estimates and assumptions made by management in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that it believes are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, but there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will prove to be correct and, as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions could prove to be incorrect. Accordingly, actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements or future events or developments could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Material factors or assumptions that were applied in providing updated financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2016, including with respect to the statements that Aralez’s net revenues are expected to be in the range of $54 million to $62 million, non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $78 million to $86 million and non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $8 million to $10 million, include, but are not limited to, (i) successfully integrating Tribute, ZONTIVITY and Toprol-XL and its AG, and the continued financially disciplined build-up of our organization, (ii) the exclusion of any impact from additional potential strategic business transactions, such as mergers, acquisitions, divestures, or financings that may be consummated, (iii) the successful launch of YOSPRALA in 4Q 2016, (iv) revenue from acquisition date to year end consistent with historical performance for both ZONTIVITY and Toprol-XL and its AG, (v) our ability to source and qualify suppliers for our drugs, including for YOSPRALA, (vi) our ability to mitigate regulatory risks and uncertainties that may otherwise negatively impact our expectations regarding our products and product candidates, (vi) future performance of our commercialization partners being in line with our expectations and the impact such performance is anticipated to have being consistent with our expectations with respect to our revenue projections, particularly royalties earned on sales of VIMOVO, (vii) currency rates remaining at or near current levels for the remainder of fiscal 2016, and (viii) prescription trends, competition, pricing levels, inventory, and the anticipated timing of future product launches and events remaining in line with management’s current beliefs. Readers are cautioned that actual future operating results and economic performance of the Company, including with respect to our net revenues, non-GAAP SG&A expenses and non-GAAP R&D expenses for the year ending December 31, 2016, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, those described below, and could differ materially from what is currently expected as set out in this press release. Our operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and any one or any combination of these risks and uncertainties could also affect whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct and could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements or future events or developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, our inability to build, acquire or contract with a sales force of sufficient scale for the commercialization of our products in a timely and cost-effective manner; our failure to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates; competition, including increased generic competition; costs and delays in the development and/or approval of our product candidates, including as a result of the need to conduct additional studies or due to issues with third-party API or finished product manufacturers, or the failure to obtain such approval of our product candidates for all expected indications, including as a result of changes in regulatory standards or the regulatory environment during the development period of any of our product candidates; with respect to certain products, dependence on reimbursement from third-party payors and the possibility of a failure to obtain coverage or reduction in the extent of reimbursement; the inability to maintain or enter into, and the risks resulting from our dependence upon, collaboration or contractual arrangements necessary for the development, manufacture, commercialization, marketing, sales and distribution of any products, including our dependence on AstraZeneca and Horizon Pharma USA, Inc. for the sales and marketing of VIMOVO, our dependence on Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc. for the manufacture of YOSPRALA, our dependence on Schering-Plough (Ireland) Company for the supply of ZONTIVITY and our dependence on AstraZeneca for the manufacture and supply of Toprol-XL and its AG; our ability to protect our intellectual property and defend our patents; regulatory obligations and oversight; failure to successfully identify, execute, integrate, maintain and realize expected benefits from new acquisitions, such as the acquisitions of Tribute, ZONTIVITY and Toprol-XL and its AG; fluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies, including the Canadian dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, and other world currencies; changes in government regulations, including tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities and regulations regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products; risks related to our financing; general adverse economic, market and business conditions; and those risks detailed from time-to-time under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and reports and Canadian securities law filings, including in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, which will be available on EDGAR at www.sec.gov, on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, and on the Company’s website at www.aralez.com, and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the SEC and applicable securities regulatory authorities in Canada.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Aralez Reports Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results -Completed Acquisitions of ZONTIVITY®; Toprol-XL® and its Authorized Generic- -Received U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approval and Launched YOSPRALA™- -Provides Improved 2016 Full Year Guidance- MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, Nov. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARLZ) (TSX: ARZ) (“Aralez” or the “Company“) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016. The Company also highlighted certain corporate and commercial updates. All figures are in U.S. dollars. Corporate Updates: On October 31, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of the U.S. rights to Toprol-XL® (metoprolol succinate) and its Authorized Generic (AG) from AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca). AstraZeneca recorded U.S. net revenues from Toprol-XL and its AG of $91 million in 2014, $89 million in 2015 and $53 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. The transaction is expected to be immediately EBITDA accretive and to move profitability forward to 2017, in each case on an adjusted EBITDA basis. On October 3, 2016, the Company announced the commencement of the commercialization and availability of once-daily YOSPRALA™ (aspirin and omeprazole), the only prescription fixed-dose combination of aspirin, an anti-platelet agent, and omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, in the U.S. YOSPRALA is being promoted by 110 high quality, experienced sales representatives in the U.S. On September 15, 2016, the Company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved YOSPRALA for patients who require aspirin for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and who are at risk of developing aspirin associated gastric ulcers. Please refer to the Prescribing Information for important safety information regarding YOSPRALA at www.YOSPRALA.com. On September 6, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of the U.S. and Canadian rights to ZONTIVITY® (vorapaxar) from Merck & Co., Inc., known as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada. ZONTIVITY is the first and only approved therapy shown to inhibit the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), the primary receptor for thrombin, which is considered to be the most potent activator of platelets. In the U.S., ZONTIVITY is indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of heart attack (myocardial infarction) or in patients with narrowing of leg arteries, called peripheral arterial disease, and should be used in combination with daily aspirin and/or clopidogrel according to their indications or standard of care. Please refer to the Prescribing Information for important safety information regarding ZONTIVITY at http://www.merck.com/product /usa/pi_circulars/z/zontivity/zontivity_pi.pdf. “We continue to make excellent progress in delivering against the expectations that we outlined upon the formation of Aralez in the early part of this year,” said Adrian Adams, Chief Executive Officer of Aralez. “We have strengthened our anchor position in cardiovascular disease with the approval and launch of YOSPRALA and leveraged our competitive platform by executing on our growth strategy of diversifying our product offerings and revenue stream with the acquisitions of ZONTIVITY, Toprol-XL and its Authorized Generic. This has been achieved while maintaining a sound financial position through disciplined decision making and we are delighted to be in a position to improve our 2016 financial guidance by increasing our expected revenues and decreasing our projected spending.” Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results On February 5, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Tribute Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (“Tribute”) (the “Tribute Acquisition”). The accompanying financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes the operations of Tribute from the date of the Tribute Acquisition through September 30, 2016. On September 6, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of the U.S. and Canadian rights to ZONTIVITY. The accompanying financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes the results of ZONTIVITY from the date of its acquisition through September 30, 2016. The financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflects only the results of the Company’s predecessor company, POZEN Inc. (Pozen).  Total net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $13.6 million compared to $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net product revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $8.1 million, consisting entirely of revenues from products acquired through the Tribute Acquisition. Other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $5.5 million, primarily comprised of VIMOVO® royalties, compared to $5.8 million for the prior year comparable period. Royalty revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 include a decrease in U.S. net sales of VIMOVO primarily due to lower net pricing recorded by our commercialization partner, Horizon Pharma USA, Inc., partially offset by an increase in the royalty rate received from our ex-U.S. commercialization partner, AstraZeneca, on net sales outside of the U.S. from 6% to 10% commencing in 2016. GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $25.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by increased commercialization costs incurred in the U.S., predominantly related to the launch of YOSPRALA in October 2016, costs to support the build out of the Aralez global corporate structure, continued operational expenses in Canada, product acquisition-related expenses and higher share based compensation expenses. The increase in expenses was partially offset by a decrease in transaction fees compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $2.0 million compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Non-GAAP SG&A expenses, which represent our ongoing cash-based operating expenses and exclude transaction fees, severance and retention, product acquisition-related expenses and share-based compensation expense, were $20.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in non-GAAP SG&A expenses is primarily driven by commercialization costs incurred principally related to YOSPRALA, expenses incurred to support the build out of the Aralez global corporate structure and continued operational expenses in Canada. Non-GAAP R&D expenses, which exclude severance and retention and share-based compensation expense, were $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The GAAP net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $20.6 million, or $0.32 loss per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to a net loss of $8.1 million, or $0.25 loss per share on a fully diluted basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Balance Sheet As of September 30, 2016, approximately 65.4 million of the Company’s common shares were issued and outstanding and the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $56.5 million, after paying $25 million to acquire ZONTIVITY. On October 31, 2016, the Company drew down $25 million under its existing credit facility with Deerfield Management to replenish the $25 million upfront cash payment previously made in connection with the ZONTIVITY acquisition and drew down an additional $175 million to finance the upfront cash closing payment for the acquisition of Toprol-XL and its Authorized Generic. The lenders under the Company’s credit facility have also agreed to provide Aralez access to up to an additional $250 million in capital to fund future mutually agreeable transactions. 2016 Financial Guidance Aralez’s estimates are based on projected results of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2016 and reflect management’s current beliefs about, among other things, prescription trends, competition, pricing levels, inventory levels, and the anticipated timing of future events. The Company’s updated 2016 guidance on non-GAAP SG&A expenses and non-GAAP R&D expenses includes, among other things, YOSPRALA launch costs, taking into account the hiring of a total of approximately 110 sales professionals (inclusive of the 25 sales professionals hired to initially market Fibricor®), costs incurred in connection with receiving FDA approval of YOSPRALA, and the costs to build the necessary infrastructure in the U.S. and Ireland. It excludes share-based compensation expense and certain discrete costs, including merger and product acquisition-related expenses. The Company’s updated 2016 guidance on net revenues includes revenues from Tribute from February 6, 2016 through December 31, 2016, revenues from ZONTIVITY from September 6, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and revenues from Toprol-XL from October 31, 2016 through December 31, 2016. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” below.    For the year ending December 31, 2016, assuming, among other things, foreign currency exchange rates remain at or near current levels, the Company currently expects: 2016 net revenue guidance to increase to a range of $54 million to $62 million; 2016 non-GAAP SG&A expense guidance to decrease to a range of $78 million to $86 million; and 2016 non-GAAP R&D expense guidance to decrease to a range of $8 million to $10 million. See the table below for a comparison of the Company’s previous 2016 guidance to the updated 2016 guidance: Measure Original 2016 Guidance Updated 2016 Guidance Net Revenues $48 million to $58 million $54 million to $62 million Non-GAAP SG&A Expenses $85 million to $100 million $78 million to $86 million Non-GAAP R&D Expenses $8 million to $12 million $8 million to $10 million Third Quarter Results Webcast Aralez will host a webcast this morning, November 7, 2016 at 11:00 a.m. ET to present third quarter 2016 results.

More information about Aralez can be found at www.aralez.com. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company has presented certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP SG&A expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses and Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).  Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense and financing costs, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and gains or losses related to warrants, restructuring costs, retention costs, transaction costs including costs to evaluate, execute and integrate acquisitions, including acquired in-process R&D, interest income, the impact of changes in foreign currency rates, asset impairment charges, income tax adjustments, losses or gains on extinguishment or modification of debt and the impact of a sale or disposition of a business or product, including discontinued operations. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful for investors, taken in conjunction with GAAP financial statements, because it provides greater transparency regarding the Company’s operating performance by excluding (i) non-cash expenses that are substantially dependent on changes in the market price of our common shares, and (ii) discrete items, such as merger and acquisition-related costs, including transaction fees, and severance and retention expenses, that may not be consistently recurring. Management uses these measures, among other factors, to assess and analyze operational results and to make financial and operational decisions. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of the Company’s operating results as reported under GAAP, not as a substitute for GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this press release. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This press release includes certain statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the successful execution of our commercialization strategy for YOSPRALA, that the acquisition of Toprol-XL and its AG is expected to be immediately EBITDA accretive and to move profitability forward to 2017, in each case on an adjusted EBITDA basis, continuing to make excellent progress in delivering against the expectations outlined upon our formation, our strengthened anchor position in cardiovascular disease with the approval and launch of YOSPRALA, leveraging our competitive platform by executing on our growth strategy of diversifying our product offerings and revenue stream with the acquisitions of ZONTIVITY, Toprol-XL and its AG, maintaining a sound financial position through disciplined decision making, access to up to an additional $250 million in capital from Deerfield Management to fund future mutually agreeable acquisitions, our ability to successfully identify, execute and consummate business or product opportunities, acquisitions, prospective products or to obtain product approvals, the outlook for the Company’s future business and financial performance, including our improved 2016 guidance on non-GAAP SG&A expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses and net revenues, our strategies, plans, objectives, goals, prospects, future performance or results of current and anticipated products,  and other statements that are not historical facts, and such statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “likely,” “potential,” “continue” or the negative or similar words, variations of these words or other comparable words or phrases, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. You should be aware that the forward-looking statements included herein represent management’s current judgment and expectations, and are based on current estimates and assumptions made by management in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that it believes are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, but there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will prove to be correct and, as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions could prove to be incorrect. Accordingly, actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements or future events or developments could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Material factors or assumptions that were applied in providing updated financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2016, including with respect to the statements that Aralez’s net revenues are expected to be in the range of $54 million to $62 million, non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $78 million to $86 million and non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $8 million to $10 million, include, but are not limited to, (i) successfully integrating Tribute, ZONTIVITY and Toprol-XL and its AG, and the continued financially disciplined build-up of our organization, (ii) the exclusion of any impact from additional potential strategic business transactions, such as mergers, acquisitions, divestures, or financings that may be consummated, (iii) the successful launch of YOSPRALA in 4Q 2016, (iv) revenue from acquisition date to year end consistent with historical performance for both ZONTIVITY and Toprol-XL and its AG, (v) our ability to source and qualify suppliers for our drugs, including for YOSPRALA, (vi) our ability to mitigate regulatory risks and uncertainties that may otherwise negatively impact our expectations regarding our products and product candidates, (vi) future performance of our commercialization partners being in line with our expectations and the impact such performance is anticipated to have being consistent with our expectations with respect to our revenue projections, particularly royalties earned on sales of VIMOVO, (vii) currency rates remaining at or near current levels for the remainder of fiscal 2016, and (viii) prescription trends, competition, pricing levels, inventory, and the anticipated timing of future product launches and events remaining in line with management’s current beliefs. Readers are cautioned that actual future operating results and economic performance of the Company, including with respect to our net revenues, non-GAAP SG&A expenses and non-GAAP R&D expenses for the year ending December 31, 2016, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, those described below, and could differ materially from what is currently expected as set out in this press release. Our operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and any one or any combination of these risks and uncertainties could also affect whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct and could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements or future events or developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, our inability to build, acquire or contract with a sales force of sufficient scale for the commercialization of our products in a timely and cost-effective manner; our failure to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates; competition, including increased generic competition; costs and delays in the development and/or approval of our product candidates, including as a result of the need to conduct additional studies or due to issues with third-party API or finished product manufacturers, or the failure to obtain such approval of our product candidates for all expected indications, including as a result of changes in regulatory standards or the regulatory environment during the development period of any of our product candidates; with respect to certain products, dependence on reimbursement from third-party payors and the possibility of a failure to obtain coverage or reduction in the extent of reimbursement; the inability to maintain or enter into, and the risks resulting from our dependence upon, collaboration or contractual arrangements necessary for the development, manufacture, commercialization, marketing, sales and distribution of any products, including our dependence on AstraZeneca and Horizon Pharma USA, Inc. for the sales and marketing of VIMOVO, our dependence on Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc. for the manufacture of YOSPRALA, our dependence on Schering-Plough (Ireland) Company for the supply of ZONTIVITY and our dependence on AstraZeneca for the manufacture and supply of Toprol-XL and its AG; our ability to protect our intellectual property and defend our patents; regulatory obligations and oversight; failure to successfully identify, execute, integrate, maintain and realize expected benefits from new acquisitions, such as the acquisitions of Tribute, ZONTIVITY and Toprol-XL and its AG; fluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies, including the Canadian dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, and other world currencies; changes in government regulations, including tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities and regulations regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products; risks related to our financing; general adverse economic, market and business conditions; and those risks detailed from time-to-time under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and reports and Canadian securities law filings, including in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, which will be available on EDGAR at www.sec.gov, on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, and on the Company’s website at www.aralez.com, and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the SEC and applicable securities regulatory authorities in Canada.

The aim of this new research team is to develop novel approaches to exploit cellular DNA damage and repair mechanisms which occur during radiation and radiochemotherapa. The group will be headed by Dr Balca Mardin, who joined the BioMed X Innovation Center from the European Molecular Biology Laboratories (EMBL). Based on Dr Mardins extensive track record in studying cellular mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements and the impact of DNA damage and repair on genome instability during tumourigenesis, the group will focus on identifying mechanisms of synthetic lethality in cancer to increase therapeutic efficacy and reduce the side-effects of cancer treatments. 'We are excited to extend our collaboration with Merck in the field of oncology,' said Christian Tidona, founder and Managing Director of BioMed X. 'A total of nine research groups from five pharma sponsors in only 3 years clearly reflects the strong reputation we have built in biomedical innovation.' In 2013, Merck and BioMed X started a research collaboration to explore new avenues for cancer treatment. Other research teams at BioMed X sponsored by Merck focus on cancer metabolism and the immunosuppressive environment of tumours.

Big Pharma will tell you that their high drug prices are necessary for the research and development of new drugs. That is far from the truth. In actuality, data shows that pharmaceutical’s obscenely high prices are used mostly for sales and marketing. Accordingly, statistics show that most pharmaceutical companies spend much less for research and development than they do for marketing and sales. A 2013 accounting included a report on spending by Johnson and Johnson (USA), Novartis (CH), Pfizer (USA), Glaxosmithkline (GB), Merck, Sanofi, Roche, AstraZeneca, Lilly and Abbvie among the Big Pharma companies. For example, 9 out of 10 spent less on R and D than they did on sales and marketing, some far less. The biggest gulf between the two spending categories belonged to Johnson and Johnson which spent $17.5 billion for sales and marketing and $8.2 billion for research and development, well over twice as much, which meant that R and D accounted for only 32% of the total.  The remaining nine spent from 40.4% to 50.8% on R and D of a combined R and D and sales and marketing costs, from Novartis to Roche, respectively. Overall, $98.3 billion was spent on sales and marketing and 65.9 billion on R and D, making a total of $164.1 billion for the two categories. Another survey of fifteen representatives of Big Pharma show the same trend in 2014, and, in fact, their emphasis is veering from finding innovative cures to that of a consumer goods company – building brands and creating needs for these brands to make profits. There is a reason that pharmaceuticals, like many monolithic corporations, is poorly regulated and monitored by government agencies.  Pharma’s needs a small lobbying investment each year ($229 million in 2014) to assure that politicians deliver. Thus Pharma is totally free to charge what the market will bear, which means it comes out of our pockets in the form of co-pays, premiums, and bloated tax spending by government for drugs. That extra money for Pharma means less is available for other human needs, like anti-poverty programs and education. The only example of healthcare negotiating drug prices is the Veterans Administration (VA). Otherwise, pharmaceutics have their way with us. In 2014 Big Pharma spent 1.7 times more on sales and marketing (S and M) than on R and D. S and M includes a whole array of promotional tools: detailing, meetings, mailings, samples to doctors, journal and web ads, direct-to-consumer ads, medical education (cozy seminars with drug dispensers like doctors) and grants to health advocacy organizations. With this line-up it’s easy to see why R and D falls far behind in expenses, especially considering the competitive focus on promoting sales over new drugs. Our familiarity with one category of S and M is TV advertising for prescription drugs that will probably surpass $6 billion in 2016, this to build a consumer following and bolster sales. It follows that manufactured demand through advertising leads to higher prices as well. A Youtube video provides rather humorous outtakes from commercials featuring maladies and side effects we have seen ourselves with the deluge of pill-pushing on TV ads. As the video clip winds to a close, it adds to the banal and comical content by making up imaginary maladies and totally ludicrous side effects, side effects we might conjure up ourselves with equally frivolous friends. But seeing the humor does not change the power or the intent of Big Pharma. Selling drugs and making a huge profit is the number one goal, so much so that when sales of drugs flag for one illness, they invent new illnesses for the same drug. Unfortunately, the huge prices they charge have real victims. For example, NBC News told the story of Lauren Baumann, a healthy single mom who at age 26 discovered she had leukemia.  She learned that Gleevec was a medicine that would help her live. Having a full time job and health insurance, the once-a-day pill sold by Novartis would save her without endless expenses – so she thought. Even with insurance, she found, her co-pay for the drug amounted to $24,000 per year.  Such price obscenities, of course, are promoted by Big Pharma with its focus of pushing up demand in a market they totally control. Patent life for drugs is 20 years, after the drug is identified as viable in clinical trials. No one else can make or sell the medication for those 20 years. Big Parma can extend the patent period by negotiating with generic drug manufacturers, allegedly, paying them not to release their generic version. They can also find a new indication for it, giving it another life cycle as a brand name drug selling at full price for another use. If you followed drug commercials for years, you would see that Pharma finds it profitable to create new illnesses to treat with existing drugs. Eli Lilly’s example is Prozac which treated depression. In the US, annual sales the first year were $350 million and peaked at $2.6 billion a year. Then sales representative pushed doctors to prescribe Prozac for other “off label” uses like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),  post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), or social anxiety disorder. Before Prozac, PMDD was not even known as a disorder. With Prozac’s generic version, fluoxetine, other disorders have been added through the years like bulimia, post-partum depression, pathological laughter or crying. And we can add to that premature ejaculation because Prozac impedes sexual function. Ads selling illnesses and drugs do tend to give many viewers a sense of unease regarding their well-being.  Many critics, including conscientious doctors, feel that thousands, if not millions, are taking drugs they don’t need. This would suggest that over $100 billion now spent for sales and marketing only adds to the angst of average Americans’ lives. But for patients who need the drugs for survival, Big Pharma adds financial distress with their extremely high prices, which forces a choice between buying life-saving drugs and paying for necessities like food and shelter. For many Americans, it is a heartless choice that feckless politicians force too many of them to make. James Hoover is a recently retired systems engineer.

Competitor Adapt Pharma, which makes the only FDA-approved naloxone nasal spray, was quick to issue a press release that its Narcan device wasn't affected. (CNN) Merck's BACE1 inhibitor verubecestat showed early signs that it can cut production of beta amyloid in a phase I trial published in Science Translational Medicine. The drug is currently being evaluated in two phase III studies. In more BACE inhibitor news, Alzforum has coverage of the Kloster Seeon meeting in Germany. New emails divulge further details as to just how upset some FDA officials were by Janet Woodcock's decision to approve the Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug eteplirsen (Exondys 51). The loudest criticisms came from Office of Drug Evaluation director Ellis Unger, followed by Acting Chief Scientist Luciana Borio. (STAT News) And The Pink Sheet reports that eteplirsen sponsor Sarepta claimed "dire" financial pressures while pleading with the FDA for quick approval, even as it was telling investors something else entirely. The National Academies has issued a brief report on the first workshop it held since the FDA asked it for advice on how to address opioid overuse while considering the need for pain control. Biogen's nusinirsen for spinal muscular atrophy met its primary endpoint in an interim analysis of a phase III trial, the company said. The company has filed for marketing approval of the drug with both U.S. and European regulators.

All three awards, totaling around $195 million, were handed down in state court in St. Louis, Missouri, with the same judge presiding. Women or their families have filed 2,500 similar claims, the vast majority in the same court, which is one of several in the United States that attracts consumer lawsuits. The plaintiffs claim studies show J&J’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products, when used in the vaginal area, increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The company counters that larger, more comprehensive studies show no such link. In a court filing in August, J&J argued the case should be dismissed because plaintiffs’ lawyers tainted the St. Louis jury pool. The company said the other side spent almost $10 million on national and local television commercials in the previous year, with a disproportionate share of them running in St. Louis. The women’s lawyers have denied J&J’s claim. The company also contended that, because most of them are not from St. Louis and the New Jersey-based company has no strong ties to the area, the cases should not have been heard there. The judge rejected both arguments. John Beisner, one of the top lawyers representing J&J, said the company plans to make the same arguments to the Missouri Court of Appeals. If the St. Louis court is found not to have jurisdiction, the cases would have to be refiled elsewhere. Beisner compared the St. Louis verdicts to a favorable ruling in September from a state court judge in New Jersey. That judge, who is presiding over some 200 talc cases, disqualified the plaintiffs’ experts on the grounds that their scientific testimony was too speculative. In the same decision, he dismissed the first two cases set for trial and the ruling is being appealed. J&J unsuccessfully tried to block the testimony of the experts in St. Louis on similar grounds. The company will make the same challenge on appeal, Beisner said. Last week’s $70 million verdict followed Missouri jury awards of $72 million in February and $55 million in May. The first big talc verdict in February was won by the family of Jacqueline Fox, who died in October 2015. Their lawyers said she used J&J Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder daily for 35 years for genital hygiene before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013. Jere Beasley, whose firm has filed hundreds of talc cases, including the three Missouri wins and two New Jersey dismissals, said the verdicts should prompt J&J to make a deal. “If I were representing them, I would say, folks, we need to sit down and regroup and start trying to settle these cases,” he said. LARGE VERDICTS Large verdicts are relatively common in major product liability cases, and they are often reduced or overturned on appeal. One lawsuit against Merck & Co. over its recalled painkiller Vioxx produced a $253 million verdict in 2005, which was thrown out three years later. Merck eventually settled most Vioxx cases for $4.85 billion in 2007. Shareholders in J&J, which had sales of $70 billion last year, have so far shrugged off the three talc verdicts, the first of the cases to go to trial. But if the trend continues, liability could mount. The company has not reported setting aside any litigation reserve to deal with talc cases, as it has with previous claims over antipsychotic drug Rispardal and recalled hip implants. J&J no longer sells Shower to Shower, which was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2012. Though not a major seller on its own, Baby Powder is a recognized symbol of J&J’s baby care line, which brought in $2 billion in revenue in 2015. Some legal experts said it made sense for J&J to fight on. “Ordinarily I would say three verdicts like that would prompt you to think about settlement,” said University of Georgia Law School professor Elizabeth Burch, who researches product liability cases, but she said J&J’s case is somewhat different. A settlement would not necessarily cap J&J’s liability, Burch said, because its talc products are still on the market, unlike companies whose products have been recalled. Howard Erichson, a professor at Fordham School of Law, said the company also had valid concerns about the impact of a settlement on its position in the market. “This is not Vioxx. This is not asbestos,” Erichson said. “This is a case where the company wants to defend its brand, and is not going to be anxious to announce a big settlement that appears to concede that the product is harmful.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon LONDON — Frustrated by the high price of antiviral drugs, thousands of patients from London to Moscow to Sydney are turning to a new wave of online “buyers clubs” to get cheap generic medicines to cure hepatitis C and protect against HIV infection. While regulators warn that buying drugs online is risky, scientific data presented at a recent medical conference suggest that treatment arranged through buyers clubs can be just as effective as that obtained through conventional channels. Will Nutland, who supports a drug-buying network in London and takes Indian-made generic drugs that are not available through the health service to prevent HIV infection, thinks the latest research will build confidence in such schemes. “This new data shows that so far we’ve got it right,” the HIV activist said. “It gives us a boost in confidence in the types of drugs that are available online.” The buyers clubs’ websites act as middlemen by providing details of trusted online pharmacies and drug manufacturers, exploiting a loophole in World Trade Organization patent rules that allows small-scale imports of medicines for personal use. Like Ron Woodroof, the 1980s AIDS patient in the movie Dallas Buyers Club, the sponsors of today’s drug clubs aim to help patients who can’t get the drugs they want through local health care systems by bringing in medicines from abroad. It gives us a boost in confidence in the types of drugs that are available online But while Woodroof had to smuggle drugs in bulk across the Mexican border, users of modern-day clubs can, in many countries, tap orders into their computers quite legally. Savings can be huge. A month’s generic supply of the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) HIV drugs emtricitabine and tenofovir costs about £45 pounds (US$56) online in Britain, around a tenth of Gilead Sciences Inc.’s branded version Truvada. An Indian-made course of treatment for the liver-destroying disease hepatitis C, meanwhile, can be had for around £1,000 against a list price for branded drugs of around £35,000. Gilead is also a leading producer of patented hepatitis C drugs, along with Merck & Co. Inc. and AbbVie Inc. “Resorting to a buyers club is clearly not conventional medicine, but it is something some people have been brave enough to try and it seems to be working,” said Andrew Hill of London’s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Data presented at the Oct. 23-26 HIV Glasgow conference showed generic drugs bought via buyers clubs in Australia, Britain, Russia and South-East Asia by a total of 900 patients delivered hepatitis C cure rates of around 95 per cent. That is similar to outcomes in clinical trials using the original brands. Related Can embattled Valeant Pharmaceuticals ‘drive the wolf from the door?’ Concordia International shares plummet to record low after drugmaker suspends forecast This is why Canada has the second-highest medication costs in the world Another piece of research involving more than 200 gay men in London taking generic PrEP bought through a buyers club found that their drugs, mostly made by India’s Cipla, were both safe and effective at preventing HIV infection. Such observational studies do not have the rigour of full-scale clinical trials but they do provide reassurance. “What this sort of data does is give doctors and patients some faith that this isn’t an act of complete lunacy that is going to cause patient harm,” said James Freeman, a Tasmanian doctor behind a hepatitis C drug-buying club. For Freeman and other critics of the pharmaceuticals industry, the advent of today’s buyers clubs is just the latest chapter in an ongoing war over drug prices, with parallels to the battle over getting cheap HIV drugs into Africa. In the 1990s, HIV drugs costing more than US$10,000 per patient a year were simply out of reach for millions of people in the developing world. Today, thanks to cheap generics, the cost for the poor has been slashed to around US$100. Still, there are obstacles. In a number of European countries, including Germany, medicines cannot be sent in the post, prompting some people to collect supplies from friends in countries like Britain where it is permitted. HIV rates among gay men are not going down, despite all our interventions, including promoting condom us Some online pharmacies demand a doctor’s prescription to fulfill an order, although many do not, and people using buyers clubs still require blood tests to ensure the drugs they are on are working properly, without serious side effects. The need for those laboratory tests is controversial, since it costs money to test people taking medicines that were not prescribed by the official health care system in the first place. But Nneka Nwokolo, who presented the data on PrEP in Glasgow, believes it makes sense, given the proven efficacy of PrEP in several clinical trials. She works at a National Health Service (NHS) sexual health clinic in London’s Soho neighbourhood that has been offering blood tests for generic PrEP users since February. “HIV rates among gay men are not going down, despite all our interventions, including promoting condom use. But we know PrEP works and it has been shown to make a significant difference to HIV acquisition,” she said. Clinical trials have shown PrEP cuts the risk of catching the virus during sex by more than 90 per cent. Across Europe and around the world access to PrEP remains patchy. In Britain, routine use is stalled by a funding row, as well as doubts over cost-effectiveness, based on the high price of branded Truvada. It’s an absolute scandal that the prices are so high … Access to hepatitis C drugs faces similar budget constraints in many countries, given the high cost of brand-name products. Gilead’s Sovaldi initially cost US$1,000 a pill in the United States, although competition has since pushed prices down. Gilead said in a statement that it worked “to ensure broad access to its medicines through dialogue and efforts with payers and other stakeholders, including governments.” But HIV activist Nutland, who is also a research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, believes drugmakers must do more to make their products affordable. “It’s an absolute scandal that the prices are so high that even wealthy national services are saying they cannot afford the costs of these drugs.” Thomson Reuters Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

Meet the Contributors → Forecast Update: CA’s Prop. 61 Now A Toss-Up, New Poll Shows Alex Lash November 7th, 2016 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy San Francisco —  Xconomy reported Thursday that support for Proposition 61, the California initiative to rein in drug prices, had slipped in a recent poll to a slim 51 percent majority, with 24 percent opposed and 25 percent undecided. Since then, a new state poll from a different pollster has put Prop. 61’s chances at a toss-up: 47 percent for, 47 percent against, and a much smaller 6 percent undecided. The initiative has attracted $109 million from opponents, as of last week. The top ten, from Merck and Pfizer ($9.4 million each) to GlaxoSmithKline ($4.5 million), are all drug companies, and their advertising campaign is having an impact. Supporters have pitched in $17 million, mainly from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles and the California Nurses Association. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders is holding last-minute rallies and lending his face and voice to ad campaigns to drum up support with an anti-pharma message he used frequently in his run for the Democratic presidential nomination. If voters say yes, Prop. 61 would require state healthcare entities to pay drug prices equal to or less than those paid by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which are generally considered some of the lowest, if not the lowest, in the country. Those California entities spent $4.2 billion on prescription drugs in the fiscal 2014-15 year. The measure would lead to “significant savings,” according to proponents. The state’s legislative analyst office has not backed up those claims, saying instead that the fiscal impact was unclear for two main reasons. First, the prices negotiated by the VA are secret. They start with a discounted price list, but can go down from there. It’s assumed the VA gets even more discounts, but it’s not transparent. Second, there’s no telling what the drug companies will do if Prop. 61 passes. Opponents have hinted at unintended consequences, and executives have sounded alarms in recent weeks. In the new Field Poll released November 4, support for Prop. 61 was divided starkly by party lines. Registered Democrats were for it 60 percent, against it 33 percent, with 7 percent undecided. Registered Republicans were for it 25 percent, against it 72 percent, and 3 percent undecided. The survey took place in the last week of October.

(Gilles Mingasson/AP Images for AIDS Healthcare Fondation) Share Written by Oliver Staley Obsession US Election November 07, 2016 One of the election season’s most fiercely fought campaigns is over a California ballot initiative that promises to control drug prices, but would affect only a fraction of the state. Yet it’s making the drug industry very nervous. Proposition 61 requires California state agencies to pay no more for drugs than the price paid by the US Department of Veteran Affairs, which, by law, receives a 24% discount on drugs, and can negotiate even lower prices. While the cost savings could be significant, most Californians don’t receive drugs from the agencies covered, which include universities, state prisons, and some parts of the state’s low-income insurance program, Medi-Cal. Depending on whose numbers you believe, the number of people covered ranges from 4.4 million to 7 million, in a state with about 40 million residents. Despite the relatively small impact, the drug industry has been working furiously to defeat the referendum, raising $109 million as of Nov. 2, according to Ballotpedia, a website which tracks such things. Merck & Co., Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer each contributed at least $9.3 million to the campaign, while dozens of other companies also have chipped in. Combined with the $16.9 million spent by advocates—mostly the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which runs a chain of clinics—it’s the most costly ballot initiative in US history. Opponents say the fixing of drug costs in one place will just push them up elsewhere, and could wind up making drugs more expensive for most Californians, while limiting choices for the covered agencies. Supporters, who include US senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, say it will make drugs more affordable for at least some in the state, and deal a blow to an industry that profits while many Americans struggle to afford prescription drugs. The initiative’s impact outside California— its “reverberations,” as Sanders puts it— is why the drug industry is determined to beat the ballot initiative. Pharma companies, never popular, are in the crosshairs of politicians now more than ever. Accusations of price gouging by Martin Shkreli’s Turing Pharmaceutical and Mylan, maker of the EpiPen, have made the industry vulnerable to new regulations to cap price increases. Drug makers fear price controls from a Clinton presidency—shares fall when she criticizes the industry. Even Trump says he supports importing drugs from overseas to lower prices. Prop 61 would give other states encouragement to pass similar initiatives, said Michael Yee, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “We believe (Prop 61) creates a slippery slope,” Yee wrote in a note to investors. Initial polls showed Prop 61 supporters with a significant advantage, but the polls have tightened substantially in the closing weeks—no doubt due to the flood of campaign ads over the state’s airwaves— and they are now deadlocked at about 47% both in favor and opposed. A win may change the national conversation over drug prices. A loss will be a strong reminder of the power of the pharmaceutical lobby.

Nov 07, 2016, 06:00 ET Share this article JERUSALEM, November 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Intec Pharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: NTEC) (TASE: INTP), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing drugs based on its proprietary Accordion Pill platform technology, announces that the protocol for the Accordance Study, the company's global Phase III clinical trial of the Accordion Pill Carbidopa/Levodopa (AP-CD/LD) as a treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms in advanced PD patients, has been amended to reflect input from key opinion leaders and biostatisticians specializing in PD. The protocol amendment reduces the study's sample size from 460 patients to 328 patients, but does not alter the objectives, endpoints or statistical power (90%) of the global Phase III clinical trial. The amendment was submitted to and reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Agency had no comments to these proposed changes. The Accordance study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel, active-controlled Phase III trial in the United States, Europe and Israel. The study is now expected to enroll approximately 328 participants across the two original arms: AP-CD/LD or Sinemet® IR, an immediate release carbidopa levodopa medication that is currently on the market. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is change from baseline to end of treatment in the percentage of daily "Off time" during waking hours. Karl Kieburtz, M.D., President of Clintrex, consultant to the Company and Professor in the Department of Neurology at the University of Rochester and formerly Chair of the FDA Peripheral and Central Nervous System Advisory Committee commented:  "The amended protocol's sample size estimation uses a predicted standard deviation that is based on recent evidence from similar Parkinson's disease clinical trials. Using this estimated standard deviation and the same predicted difference between the active intervention and control, we achieve a substantial savings in sample size, without altering the objectives, endpoints or statistical power of the Accordance Study."  Zeev Weiss, Chief Executive Officer of Intec Pharma, said:  "Levodopa is the most effective and widely used treatment for Parkinson's disease symptoms. However, reports indicate that up to 50% of patients show onset of motor fluctuations within two years of starting conventional Levodopa therapy.  We believe that our AP-CD/LD, currently being tested in Phase III, holds huge potential in addressing a major unmet need for many Parkinson's disease patients - to improve duration and consistency of symptom relief provided by Levodopa.  We are excited to continue to advance our Phase III Accordance Study with this protocol amendment as it enables a significant reduction in sample size without altering the study's original objectives, endpoints and statistical power of 90% or eventual outcomes. We believe that the reduction in sample size should shorten study completion timelines and reduce overall costs, and we expect to complete patient enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2017. We are committed to providing a replacement Levodopa treatment to advanced Parkinson's disease patients that experience "Off times" for hours during a typical waking day. Our goal is to improve the current treatment of this very prevalent and severe neurodegenerative disease."   Sinemet® is a registered trademark of Merck & Co., Inc.

Clinton's likelihood of winning increased slightly after FBI director James Comey told Congress that a review of new evidence didn't uncover any wrongdoing by her. The benchmark DAX is currently up 149 points or 1.45 percent at 10,408 in opening deals after declining 0.7 percent on Friday. Banks are rallying, with Commerzbank up 2.3 percent and Deutsche Bank rising 2.5 percent. Drug maker Merck KgaA is climbing 1.5 percent after it entered into a collaboration agreement with Japan's Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd that allows each party to use the other party's OLED material-related patents in certain areas. Bayer is gaining 0.7 percent after saying it had applied for extended marketing authorization of its oral multi-kinase inhibitor Regorafenib in the U.S., Japan and Europe. MorphoSys shares are up half a percent. The biotechnology firm confirmed its 2016 guidance for Group revenues after reporting a consolidated loss of 31.6 million euros in the first nine months of the year. Volkswagen shares are marginally lower as German prosecutors widened an inquiry into the company's emissions scandal to include its Chairman. In economic releases, figures from Destatis showed that German factory orders contracted unexpectedly in September largely due to a fall in domestic demand. Factory orders fell 0.6 percent from August, when it grew by revised 0.9 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America More Commentary -Global Flat Lead Tipped For South Korea Shares Stocks Close Mixed Following Lackluster Session - U.S. Commentary Stocks Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Pare Early Gains After Crude Oil Prices Turn Lower Major Averages Turning In Mixed Performance In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Show A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Wall Street Set To Open Mixed European Shares Rally As Investors Ponder Trump's Policies FTSE 100 Rallies As Pound Drifts Lower CAC 40 Rebounds Amid Bets On Trump Presidency; AXA Shares Up 2% DAX Rallies On Optimism About Trump's Presidency Asian Shares Mostly Lower, Nikkei Bucks Trend On Weaker Yen European Shares Seen Up Despite Weak Asian Cues Indian Markets Closed For Public Holiday Asian Markets Mostly Lower <<Previous        129 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out ADAP Surges As FDA Lifts Clinical Hold, OCUL Catches Eyes, RegeneRx On The Rise ARWR's Hepatitis B Drug On Clinical Hold, GMED Disappoints, A First For MYL AdvancePierre Foods Appoints Christopher Sliva As President ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Engie 9-month EBITDA Declines - Quick Facts AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Pfizer : IBRANCE Approved In Europe To Treat HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Google Rejects EU Antitrust Charges Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Facebook Taking Aim At LinkedIn Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Rio Tinto Suspends Unit CEO Alan Davies Amid Guinea Payments Investigation Alstom Turns To Profit In H1; Sales, Orders Up; Backs 2020 View - Quick Facts Kuka Group Q3 Profit Surges; Lowers FY16 Sales Outlook - Quick Facts HeidelbergCement Q3 Profit Down;says Confident To Exceed €400 Mln Synergy Target Osram Licht Q4 Profit Declines; Sees Growth In 2017 - Quick Facts Heidelberg Reports Positive Net Result In Q2; Affirms Fiscal Year Targets Carlsberg Q3 Revenues Decline; But Lifts FY16 Profit Outlook - Quick Facts E.ON 9-month Loss Narrows; Confirms 2016 Profit Outlook Munich Re Lifts FY View, Q3 Profit Rises - Quick Facts Swiss Life 9-month Fee Income Rises; Premiums Down; On Track For FY16 Targets Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

All three awards, totaling around $195 million, were handed down in state court in St. Louis, Missouri, with the same judge presiding. Women or their families have filed 2,500 similar claims, the vast majority in the same court, which is one of several in the United States that attracts consumer lawsuits. The plaintiffs claim studies show J&J's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products, when used in the vaginal area, increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The company counters that larger, more comprehensive studies show no such link. In a court filing in August, J&J argued the case should be dismissed because plaintiffs’ lawyers tainted the St. Louis jury pool. The company said the other side spent almost $10 million on national and local television commercials in the previous year, with a disproportionate share of them running in St. Louis. The women's lawyers have denied J&J's claim. The company also contended that, because most of them are not from St. Louis and the New Jersey-based company has no strong ties to the area, the cases should not have been heard there. The judge rejected both arguments. John Beisner, one of the top lawyers representing J&J, said the company plans to make the same arguments to the Missouri Court of Appeals. If the St. Louis court is found not to have jurisdiction, the cases would have to be refiled elsewhere. Beisner compared the St. Louis verdicts to a favorable ruling in September from a state court judge in New Jersey. That judge, who is presiding over some 200 talc cases, disqualified the plaintiffs' experts on the grounds that their scientific testimony was too speculative. In the same decision, he dismissed the first two cases set for trial and the ruling is being appealed. J&J unsuccessfully tried to block the testimony of the experts in St. Louis on similar grounds. The company will make the same challenge on appeal, Beisner said. Last week's $70 million verdict followed Missouri jury awards of $72 million in February and $55 million in May. The first big talc verdict in February was won by the family of Jacqueline Fox, who died in October 2015. Their lawyers said she used J&J Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder daily for 35 years for genital hygiene before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013. Jere Beasley, whose firm has filed hundreds of talc cases, including the three Missouri wins and two New Jersey dismissals, said the verdicts should prompt J&J to make a deal. "If I were representing them, I would say, folks, we need to sit down and regroup and start trying to settle these cases," he said. LARGE VERDICTS Large verdicts are relatively common in major product liability cases, and they are often reduced or overturned on appeal. One lawsuit against Merck & Co over its recalled painkiller Vioxx produced a $253 million verdict in 2005, which was thrown out three years later. Merck eventually settled most Vioxx cases for $4.85 billion in 2007. Shareholders in J&J, which had sales of $70 billion last year, have so far shrugged off the three talc verdicts, the first of the cases to go to trial. But if the trend continues, liability could mount. The company has not reported setting aside any litigation reserve to deal with talc cases, as it has with previous claims over antipsychotic drug Rispardal and recalled hip implants. J&J no longer sells Shower to Shower, which was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2012. Though not a major seller on its own, Baby Powder is a recognized symbol of J&J’s baby care line, which brought in $2 billion in revenue in 2015. Some legal experts said it made sense for J&J to fight on. "Ordinarily I would say three verdicts like that would prompt you to think about settlement," said University of Georgia Law School professor Elizabeth Burch, who researches product liability cases, but she said J&J's case is somewhat different. A settlement would not necessarily cap J&J's liability, Burch said, because its talc products are still on the market, unlike companies whose products have been recalled. Howard Erichson, a professor at Fordham School of Law, said the company also had valid concerns about the impact of a settlement on its position in the market. "This is not Vioxx. This is not asbestos," Erichson said. "This is a case where the company wants to defend its brand, and is not going to be anxious to announce a big settlement that appears to concede that the product is harmful.

If the St. Louis court is found not to have jurisdiction, the cases would have to be refiled elsewhere. Beisner compared the St. Louis verdicts to a favorable ruling in September from a state court judge in New Jersey. That judge, who is presiding over some 200 talc cases, disqualified the plaintiffs' experts on the grounds that their scientific testimony was too speculative. In the same decision, he dismissed the first two cases set for trial and the ruling is being appealed. J&J unsuccessfully tried to block the testimony of the experts in St. Louis on similar grounds. The company will make the same challenge on appeal, Beisner said. Last week's $70 million verdict followed Missouri jury awards of $72 million in February and $55 million in May. The first big talc verdict in February was won by the family of Jacqueline Fox, who died in October 2015. Their lawyers said she used J&J Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder daily for 35 years for genital hygiene before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013. Jere Beasley, whose firm has filed hundreds of talc cases, including the three Missouri wins and two New Jersey dismissals, said the verdicts should prompt J&J to make a deal. "If I were representing them, I would say, folks, we need to sit down and regroup and start trying to settle these cases," he said. LARGE VERDICTS Large verdicts are relatively common in major product liability cases, and they are often reduced or overturned on appeal. One lawsuit against Merck & Co over its recalled painkiller Vioxx produced a $253 million verdict in 2005, which was thrown out three years later. Merck eventually settled most Vioxx cases for $4.85 billion in 2007. Shareholders in J&J, which had sales of $70 billion last year, have so far shrugged off the three talc verdicts, the first of the cases to go to trial. But if the trend continues, liability could mount. The company has not reported setting aside any litigation reserve to deal with talc cases, as it has with previous claims over antipsychotic drug Rispardal and recalled hip implants. J&J no longer sells Shower to Shower, which was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2012. Though not a major seller on its own, Baby Powder is a recognized symbol of J&J’s baby care line, which brought in $2 billion in revenue in 2015. Some legal experts said it made sense for J&J to fight on. "Ordinarily I would say three verdicts like that would prompt you to think about settlement," said University of Georgia Law School professor Elizabeth Burch, who researches product liability cases, but she said J&J's case is somewhat different. A settlement would not necessarily cap J&J's liability, Burch said, because its talc products are still on the market, unlike companies whose products have been recalled. Howard Erichson, a professor at Fordham School of Law, said the company also had valid concerns about the impact of a settlement on its position in the market. "This is not Vioxx. This is not asbestos," Erichson said. "This is a case where the company wants to defend its brand, and is not going to be anxious to announce a big settlement that appears to concede that the product is harmful.

After $195 million in talc verdicts, J&J strives to change court Reuters 11/6/2016 By Brendan Pierson © REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/Illustration/File Photo A bottle of Johnson's Baby Powder is seen in a photo illustration taken in New York After a $67.5 million jury verdict against Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on Oct. 27 marked its third straight trial defeat in an onslaught of lawsuits claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer, the company is hoping to reverse the trend by having the cases heard in a different court. Quotes in the article Johnson & Johnson JNJ ▼ 116.60 -1.87 -1.58% Merck & Co Inc MRK ▼ 63.53 -0.42 -0.66% Merck KGaA MKGAF ▼ 102.25 -0.22 -0.21% Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc VRX ▼ 17.55 -0.45 -2.50% All three awards, totaling around $195 million, were handed down in state court in St. Louis, Missouri, with the same judge presiding. Women or their families have filed 2,500 similar claims, the vast majority in the same court, which is one of several in the United States that attracts consumer lawsuits. The plaintiffs claim studies show J&J's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products, when used in the vaginal area, increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The company counters that larger, more comprehensive studies show no such link. In a court filing in August, J&J argued the case should be dismissed because plaintiffs’ lawyers tainted the St. Louis jury pool. The company said the other side spent almost $10 million on national and local television commercials in the previous year, with a disproportionate share of them running in St. Louis. The women's lawyers have denied J&J's claim. The company also contended that, because most of them are not from St. Louis and the New Jersey-based company has no strong ties to the area, the cases should not have been heard there.

Johnson November 8 Follow @carolynyjohnson The ballot initiative drawing the most spending on the November ballot would not affect the average Californian, but drug companies have a major stake and are spending heavily to defeat it. (Alicia Chang/AP) The pharmaceutical industry will be closely watching a different tight election race today — a California drug price referendum that has drawn $109 million in opposition funding and could have ripple effects beyond the state if it passes. The ballot initiative, Proposition 61, seeks to piggyback on the prescription drug discounts enjoyed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, requiring most state-funded health insurance programs to pay no more for drugs than VA. The ballot measure affects only drug coverage for a fraction of Californians, who account for about $3.8 billion in drug spending. But its merits and potential unintended consequences have been fiercely debated because of the possibility that the measure could be replicated in other states or trigger more efforts to control drug prices. Proposition 61 has been the most searched state measure in the past day, according to Google. Pharmaceutical companies have bankrolled a large part of the opposition campaign, and they've outspent supporters mightily, raising about six times as much money. But recent polling on the measure revealed that voters are sharply divided. The rhetoric is high on both sides, and there are many uncertainties about the potential effects of the legislation — including the basic question of how much money it would actually save, if any — and how it would be implemented. [Bernie Sanders wants to know why this cancer drug costs nearly $200,000 a year] Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) has supported the measure, calling it a “chance to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry's greed and spark a national movement” in an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times. Meanwhile, drugmakers are fighting it “tooth and nail,” Eli Lilly chief executive John Lechleiter said in an earnings call in October. “It's not only bad legislation, it's bad for your health,” Lechleiter said. “And we're trying to impress that on the voters.” Beyond drug companies, a large coalition of organizations opposes the legislation, as well as many newspaper editorial boards. VA is entitled to a rebate of at least 24 percent off the average manufacturer price and is insulated against price increases that outpace inflation. A brief analysis published in the British Medical Journal  last month examined the possible cost savings, if the measure passed, for one of the state-funded health programs, Medi-Cal fee-for-service, which spent roughly $1.8 billion on drugs in 2014. Harvard Medical School researchers studied the top 200 drugs used in the program. A third of those drugs would be cheaper if VA price were applied, and they estimated that getting VA price applied to those drugs could save about $100 to $125 million in 2014. But the authors also noted that the long-term effects of the legislation were unclear since the pharmaceutical industry could respond by raising prices on VA and others. The state's Legislative Analyst's Office, a nonpartisan agency that provides fiscal advice to the legislature, concluded in an analysis that the measure could generate an “unknown” amount of savings that could range from “relatively little effect to significant annual savings.” The effect of the measure was deemed uncertain because of implementation challenges and the possibility that drugmakers would raise other prices in response. [Why treating diabetes keeps getting more expensive] The initiative would apply to only a relatively small portion of California's population — about 5 million people — but it's being closely watched because of California's position as a leader in policy reform. “If every other state followed California's example, we’re talking about a substantially bigger potential impact, and then the other issue is . . . could you extend this logic to Medicare, another public payer,” said Thomas Hwang, a researcher at Harvard Medical School. “So the fear of a precedent is one way to contextualize” it. In recent earnings calls, drug companies have called out the legislation. Merck chief executive Kenneth Frazier said, “We're very active in opposing it.” Joaquin Duato, executive vice president of Johnson & Johnson, said it would create “access barriers” for patients. Pfizer's chief executive, Ian Read, said it was “basically untenable.” “It's asking for an industry that has given noncommercial prices to the veterans for a very good reason — they are a special part of our society, and we've given noncommercial prices to that part of society. To take that and extend it to the rest of government is not a workable economic model,” Read said. Campaigning in support of the initiative took a turn for the rancorous this week, with the release of a social media ad campaign featuring pharmaceutical executives' faces on “Wanted” posters. This ad in support of California ballot initiative Proposition 61 depicts Pfizer CEO Ian Read as a criminal.

Finance Search Tue, Nov 15, 2016, 10:47 AM AEDT - Australia Markets close in 5 hrs 13 mins J&J; wants cases heard in another courtAAP – Tue, Nov 8, 2016 10:01 AM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print After a $US67.5 million ($A88 million) jury verdict against Johnson & Johnson on October 27 marked its third straight trial defeat in an onslaught of lawsuits claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer, the company is hoping to reverse the trend by having the cases heard in a different court. All three awards, totalling around $US195 million, were handed down in state court in St Louis, Missouri, with the same judge presiding. Women or their families have filed 2,500 similar claims, the vast majority in the same court, which is one of several in the United States that attracts consumer lawsuits. The plaintiffs claim studies show J&J's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products, when used in the vaginal area, increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The company counters that larger, more comprehensive studies show no such link. In a court filing in August, J&J argued the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs' lawyers tainted the St Louis jury pool. The company said the other side spent almost $US10 million on national and local television commercials the previous year, with a disproportionate share of them running in St Louis. The women's lawyers deny J&J's claim. The company also contended that, because most of them are not from St Louis and the New Jersey-based company has no strong ties to the area, the cases should not have been heard there. The judge rejected both arguments. John Beisner, one of the top lawyers representing J&J, said the company plans to make the same arguments to the Missouri Court of Appeals. If the St Louis court is found not to have jurisdiction, the cases would have to be refiled elsewhere. Beisner compared the St Louis verdicts to a favourable ruling in September from a state court judge in New Jersey. That judge, who is presiding over some 200 talc cases, disqualified the plaintiffs' experts on the grounds that their scientific testimony was too speculative. In the same decision, he dismissed the first two cases set for trial and the ruling is being appealed. J&J unsuccessfully tried to block the testimony of the experts in St Louis on similar grounds. The company will make the same challenge on appeal, Beisner said. The first big talc verdict in February was won by the family of Jacqueline Fox, who died in October 2015. Their lawyers said she used J&J Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder daily for 35 years for genital hygiene before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013. Jere Beasley, whose firm has filed hundreds of talc cases, including the three Missouri wins and two New Jersey dismissals, said the verdicts should prompt J&J to make a deal. "If I were representing them, I would say, folks, we need to sit down and regroup and start trying to settle these cases," he said. Large verdicts are relatively common in major product liability cases, and they are often reduced or overturned on appeal. One lawsuit against Merck & Co over its recalled painkiller Vioxx produced a $US253 million verdict in 2005, which was thrown out three years later. Merck eventually settled most Vioxx cases for $US4.85 billion in 2007. Shareholders in J&J, which had sales of $US70 billion last year, have so far shrugged off the three talc verdicts, the first of the cases to go to trial. But if the trend continues, liability could mount. The company has not reported setting aside any litigation reserve to deal with talc cases, as it has with previous claims over antipsychotic drug Rispardal and recalled hip implants. J&J no longer sells Shower to Shower, which was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2012. Though not a major seller on its own, Baby Powder is a recognised symbol of J&J's baby care line, which brought in $US2 billion in revenue in 2015. Some legal experts said it made sense for J&J to fight on. "Ordinarily, I would say three verdicts like that would prompt you to think about settlement," said University of Georgia Law School professor Elizabeth Burch,. She said J&J's case was somewhat different. A settlement would not necessarily cap J&J's liability, Burch said, because its talc products are still on the market, unlike companies whose products have been recalled. Howard Erichson, a professor at Fordham School of Law, said the company also had valid concerns about the impact of a settlement on its position in the market. "This is not Vioxx. This is not asbestos," Erichson said. "This is a case where the company wants to defend its brand, and is not going to be anxious to announce a big settlement that appears to concede that the product is harmful." @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Sydney Airport gets new COOAAP Sydney Airport has appointed chief financial officer Hugh Wehby as the new chief operating officer from January … Trump to roll back Obama energy policiesAAP SEC Chair says to step down before term endsAFP German travel site trivago files for IPO in USAFP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7566 +0.0011 +0.14% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6046 +0.0002 +0.03% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.7039 +0.0008 +0.11% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Budget Rent a Car Salim Mehajer Travel insurance Pasquale Barbaro Online car insurance quote Julian Assange Free iTunes download NZ earthquake Currency Converter Stephen Bannon Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Doctors have found a disturbing downside to some powerful new drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer: In rare cases, they may cause potentially fatal heart damage, especially when used together. “The problem is, no one has this on their radar,” so patients are not routinely checked for it, said Dr. Javid Moslehi, head of a Vanderbilt University clinic specializing in heart risks from cancer therapies. He led a report Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine describing two patients who died of heart trouble two weeks after receiving their first doses of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, for the deadly skin cancer melanoma. Two similar drugs also are on the market, and the study leaders believe they might pose heart risks, too. “My sense is that this is a class effect, not limited to one drug,” Moslehi said. The risks do not negate the huge benefits of these relatively new types of drugs, doctors stress. Called checkpoint inhibitors, they have transformed treatment of several types of cancer by helping the immune system see and attack tumours. In rare cases, the immune system seems to attack not only the tumour but also the heart and other muscles, causing dangerous inflammation and heart rhythm problems. Patients need to be told of the risks, monitored closely and treated quickly with medicines to quell the immune response if trouble develops. Besides melanoma, the Opdivo-Yervoy combination is used to treat some lung cancers, though at different doses. Other checkpoint inhibitors include Genentech’s Tecentriq, for bladder cancer, and Merck & Co.’s Keytruda, which former President Jimmy Carter received for melanoma that spread to his brain. Many more are in testing. There have been occasional, previous reports of heart troubles with these drugs. After the two recent deaths, doctors asked Bristol-Myers to check patient safety records on Opdivo and Yervoy. As of April, 18 cases of serious heart inflammation were found among 20,594 patients receiving either or both drugs, a rate of 0.09 per cent. It was more severe and more common among people on both drugs, affecting 0.27 per cent of those patients. Bristol-Myers scientists helped write the journal report, and some other authors consult for the company. Studies have shown that the drug combination gives a stronger anti-cancer effect than either drug alone, but “we’ve known this is a double-edged sword” because of the risk of over-stimulating the immune system, said Dr. Jeffrey Sosman of Northwestern University in Chicago, who treated the two patients who died. “The big question is, is there enough advantage to using the combination, which is much more toxic, than a single drug,” he said. That’s a larger question facing the cancer field, not just with immune therapies. Some of the newer gene-targeting drugs also have produced major side effects when used in combination. Yet many doctors believe that combos may be the best way to get cancer to go into remission and stay there longer, by shutting down multiple pathways the tumour employs at once. Dr. Michael Atkins, deputy director of the Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes the heart problems with checkpoint inhibitors will turn out to be treatable in most patients. “It just gives us a moment of pause,” said Atkins, who led a study that included one of the two patients who died. “This is a rare event … but it’s a particularly serious one.” Original source article: Some immune-boosting cancer drugs may pose rare heart risks       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article         More on This Story   Diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, mother of two beats the odds with targeted therapy For a 6-year-old with cancer, a future staked on the promise of immunotherapy Cancer and Chemotherapy Cancer (Malignancy, Tumours) Cutting Your Cancer Risk   Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *   Previous Next     Some new immune-boosting cancer drugs are now believed to carry a risk of heart complications.       E-mail this Gallery Print this Gallery Share this Gallery         Photo Galleries »   Leonard Cohen Photos: Leonard Cohen honoured...

Stock Plummeted 44.7% in October A wider-than-expected loss overshadowed some positive news. Cory Renauer (TMFang4apples) Nov 7, 2016 at 9:42AM Image source: Getty Images. What happened Shares of tiny immunotherapy developer Agenus Inc. (NASDAQ:AGEN) tumbled 44.7% in October, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. A larger-than-expected loss in its third-quarter earnings report overshadowed news that its partner, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), submitted an application for the two companies' partnered shingles vaccine. AGEN data by YCharts So what  Agenus Inc.'s third-quarter loss spiked 209% over the previous year period to $40.8 million, catching analysts off guard. No investors want to see their company's loss widen, but the results aren't nearly as ugly as they appear to be on the surface. Non-cash expenses, stemming mostly from existing asset value adjustments, increased by $22.7 million in the third quarter compared with the same period last year. As the term "non-cash" suggests, this sort of expense has more to do with accounting protocol than it does the core of the business.  What didn't help Agenus' stock price last month was a case of election-season jitters for the overall biotech space. The industry-tracking iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF sank 11.5% last month. Even news of an on-schedule application submission from GlaxoSmithKline for a shingles vaccine Agenus is partnered on wasn't enough to perk up the latter company's stock with the sector-wide dark cloud overhead.  Now what If Glaxo's Shingrix earns a widely expected approval, Agenus is entitled to at least 10 years of royalties from sales expected to reach about $1 billion annually at its peak. If approved, Shingrix will challenge Merck & Co.'s Zostavax, which generated $749 million in sales last year. The two vaccines haven't been tested head-to-head, but Shingrix showed some impressive results in studies supporting its application that could quite feasibly help it gain traction in the commercial setting. During the third quarter, Agenus also noted a $4.9 million increase in expenses related to advancing its clinical-stage pipeline. The biotech has a cancer vaccine in mid-stage clinical development, and a GITR agonist in early-stage clinical studies. Expenses related to these programs are split between Agenus and its partner Incyte.  Agenus is also advancing a CTLA-4 antagonist through early-stage clinical studies with intentions of combining it with an anti-PD1 drug, which will probably be Keytruda through an existing collaboration with Merck. Yervoy from Bristol-Myers Squibb is another CTLA-4 antagonist, which recently earned approval for treatment in combination with anti-PD1 Opdivo for treatment of advanced skin cancer. Bristol's combo provides a yardstick to measure success for a potential combination study with Agenus' candidate of the same class. With so many irons in the fire, and a market cap of around $345 million at recent prices, my hunch is that Agenus is seeing some overblown pessimism.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Money News | Mon Nov 7, 2016 | 10:38am IST ANALYSIS - After $195 million in talc verdicts, J&J strives to change court Products made by Johnson & Johnson for sale on a store shelf in Westminster, Colorado April 14, 2009. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/Files By Brendan Pierson After a $67.5 million jury verdict against Johnson & Johnson on October 27 marked its third straight trial defeat in an onslaught of lawsuits claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer, the company is hoping to reverse the trend by having the cases heard in a different court. All three awards, totaling around $195 million, were handed down in state court in St. Louis, Missouri, with the same judge presiding. Women or their families have filed 2,500 similar claims, the vast majority in the same court, which is one of several in the United States that attracts consumer lawsuits. The plaintiffs claim studies show J&J's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products, when used in the vaginal area, increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The company counters that larger, more comprehensive studies show no such link. In a court filing in August, J&J argued the case should be dismissed because plaintiffs’ lawyers tainted the St. Louis jury pool. The company said the other side spent almost $10 million on national and local television commercials in the previous year, with a disproportionate share of them running in St. Louis. The women's lawyers have denied J&J's claim. The company also contended that, because most of them are not from St. Louis and the New Jersey-based company has no strong ties to the area, the cases should not have been heard there. The judge rejected both arguments. John Beisner, one of the top lawyers representing J&J, said the company plans to make the same arguments to the Missouri Court of Appeals. If the St. Louis court is found not to have jurisdiction, the cases would have to be refiled elsewhere. Beisner compared the St. Louis verdicts to a favorable ruling in September from a state court judge in New Jersey. That judge, who is presiding over some 200 talc cases, disqualified the plaintiffs' experts on the grounds that their scientific testimony was too speculative. In the same decision, he dismissed the first two cases set for trial and the ruling is being appealed. J&J unsuccessfully tried to block the testimony of the experts in St. Louis on similar grounds. The company will make the same challenge on appeal, Beisner said. Last week's $70 million verdict followed Missouri jury awards of $72 million in February and $55 million in May. The first big talc verdict in February was won by the family of Jacqueline Fox, who died in October 2015. Their lawyers said she used J&J Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder daily for 35 years for genital hygiene before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013. Jere Beasley, whose firm has filed hundreds of talc cases, including the three Missouri wins and two New Jersey dismissals, said the verdicts should prompt J&J to make a deal. "If I were representing them, I would say, folks, we need to sit down and regroup and start trying to settle these cases," he said. LARGE VERDICTS Large verdicts are relatively common in major product liability cases, and they are often reduced or overturned on appeal. One lawsuit against Merck & Co over its recalled painkiller Vioxx produced a $253 million verdict in 2005, which was thrown out three years later. Merck eventually settled most Vioxx cases for $4.85 billion in 2007. Shareholders in J&J, which had sales of $70 billion last year, have so far shrugged off the three talc verdicts, the first of the cases to go to trial. But if the trend continues, liability could mount. The company has not reported setting aside any litigation reserve to deal with talc cases, as it has with previous claims over antipsychotic drug Rispardal and recalled hip implants. J&J no longer sells Shower to Shower, which was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2012. Though not a major seller on its own, Baby Powder is a recognized symbol of J&J’s baby care line, which brought in $2 billion in revenue in 2015. Some legal experts said it made sense for J&J to fight on. "Ordinarily I would say three verdicts like that would prompt you to think about settlement," said University of Georgia Law School professor Elizabeth Burch, who researches product liability cases, but she said J&J's case is somewhat different. A settlement would not necessarily cap J&J's liability, Burch said, because its talc products are still on the market, unlike companies whose products have been recalled. Howard Erichson, a professor at Fordham School of Law, said the company also had valid concerns about the impact of a settlement on its position in the market. "This is not Vioxx. This is not asbestos," Erichson said. "This is a case where the company wants to defend its brand, and is not going to be anxious to announce a big settlement that appears to concede that the product is harmful.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:40 AM, November 7, 2016 After a $67.5 million jury verdict against Johnson & Johnson <JNJ.N> on Oct. 27 marked its third straight trial defeat in an onslaught of lawsuits claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer, the company is hoping to reverse the trend by having the cases heard in a different court. All three awards, totaling around $195 million, were handed down in state court in St. Louis, Missouri, with the same judge presiding. Women or their families have filed 2,500 similar claims, the vast majority in the same court, which is one of several in the United States that attracts consumer lawsuits. The plaintiffs claim studies show J&J's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products, when used in the vaginal area, increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The company counters that larger, more comprehensive studies show no such link. In a court filing in August, J&J argued the case should be dismissed because plaintiffs’ lawyers tainted the St. Louis jury pool.

Chicago, IL (PRWEB) November 07, 2016 The Lymphoma Research Foundation (LRF) – the nation’s largest non-profit organization devoted exclusively to funding innovative lymphoma research and serving the lymphoma community through a comprehensive series of education programs, outreach initiatives and patient services – held its North American Educational Forum on Lymphoma from October 28-30, 2016, at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago, Illinois. This two-and-a-half-day program represented the most comprehensive lymphoma-specific educational conference in North America, providing critical information on treatment options, patient support issues, clinical trials and the latest advances in lymphoma research to people with lymphoma and their loved ones. More than 400 patients, caregivers, and their loved ones registered for the 2016 Educational Forum, which was held in Chicago for the first time to provide education and support to lymphoma patients throughout the Midwest, and around the country, from some of the world’s leading lymphoma experts. This year’s Educational Forum was co-chaired by LRF’s Scientific Advisory Board Chair-elect Thomas M. Habermann, MD, Professor of Medicine at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine at Rochester and LRF Scientific Advisory Board member Sonali M. Smith, MD, Associate Professor, Section of Hematology / Oncology, Director of the Lymphoma Program at the University of Chicago Medicine. “As a Chicago lymphoma thriver, I understand first-hand how important it is for the Lymphoma Research Foundation to host its annual North American Educational Forum on Lymphoma here in the Windy City,” said Michael Werner, Chair of the Lymphoma Research Foundation’s Board of Directors. “The Educational Forum provides a unique opportunity to learn about lymphoma and its treatment from some of the world’s leading experts in the disease, ask questions about your specific type of lymphoma and meet others who have the same type of lymphoma as you. This program can be life-changing for so many and I am grateful that the Foundation was able to bring this unique educational opportunity to Chicago this year. Given the promise of the research discussed that this year’s Ed Forum, I believe that we can functionally cure most types of lymphoma within the next decade if we adequately fund our brilliant scientists.” The 2016 North American Educational Forum on Lymphoma included disease-specific breakout sessions, expert panel presentations, treatment updates, and unique networking opportunities to those affected by lymphoma at no cost. “Reaching all those impacted by a lymphoma diagnosis is a priority of the Lymphoma Research Foundation,” said Meghan Gutierrez, LRF Chief Executive Officer. “As incidence rates of lymphoma continue to rise in the Midwest, it is important for the Lymphoma Research Foundation to expand its reach with the National Educational Forum on Lymphoma – the largest program of its type in the United States – to the lymphoma community, providing access to the latest information on lymphoma treatment options and clinical research.” This year’s North American Educational Forum on Lymphoma was supported by unrestricted educational grants from National Presenting Supporter Genentech | Biogen, National Platinum Supporter Celgene, National Gold Supporters AbbVie, Gilead Sciences, Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company, Janssen Biotech, Inc., and Teva Pharmaceuticals, National Silver Supporters Bayer, Seattle Genetics and Takeda Oncology, and National Bronze Supporters Adaptive Biotechnologies, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Idera Pharmaceuticals, Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Juno Therapeutics, Kite Pharmaceuticals, Merck and Novartis.
