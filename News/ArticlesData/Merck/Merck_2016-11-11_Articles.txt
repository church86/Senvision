Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Story highlights The fines stem from both a criminal and a civil case The company promoted Vioxx for rheumatoid arthritis before it had approval Vioxx was not approved for that use until April 2002 Washington (CNN)Pharmaceutical giant Merck will plead guilty to charges related to illegal promotional activity for the painkiller Vioxx and pay fines and settlement costs totaling nearly a billion dollars, the Justice Department announced Tuesday. Justice officials said Merck, Sharp and Dohme Corp. has agreed to the massive settlement to resolve criminal charges and civil claims stemming from its promotion and marketing of Vioxx. The drug was withdrawn from the marketplace in September 2004. Under the agreement, Merck will plead to a misdemeanor charge for the illegal promotion and pay a $321 million criminal fine. The firm also agreed to a civil settlement under which it will pay $628 million to resolve allegations of off-label marketing and false statements about the cardiovascular safety of Vioxx. The federal government will receive $426 million from the civil settlement and the remaining $202 million will be distributed to the participating Medicaid states, the Justice Department said. Read More "When a pharmaceutical company ignores FDA rules aimed at keeping our medicines safe and effective, that company undermines the ability of health care providers to make the best medical decisions on behalf of their patients," Assistant Attorney General Tony West said. The FDA approved Vioxx for three medical purposes in 1999 but did not approve its use against rheumatoid arthritis until April 2002. The government says that for nearly three years in the interim, Merck promoted Vioxx for rheumatoid arthritis. An FDA warning letter was sent to Merck in 2001 for making the claims. Officials say that while this is not a record settlement, the $950 million agreement places it among the top five on record. Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

Infectious diseases and women health and empowering women in research will be the focus of the 2nd UNESCO-Merck Africa Research Summit – MARS 2016 to be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from November 28-29, 2016. The UNESCO – MARS 2016 will be inaugurated by Getchaw Engida, deputy director-general, UNESCO; Yifru Berhane, minister for Health, Ethiopia, and Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, chairman of the executive board and family board of E. Merck KG. UNESCO – MARS 2016 will bring together more than 200 researchers from more than 35 African countries to discuss the generation, sharing and dissemination of research data and to prepare for the road ahead in developing Africa as an international hub for research excellence and scientific innovation. UNESCO – MARS 2016 has attracted 15 African ministers of Health; Education; Science and Technology and Gender & Social Development to participate in two ministerial high level panels on: “defining interventions to advance research capacity and empower women in research to improve women health in Africa” and “research and policy making gap in Africa – challenges and opportunities – Africa as a new international hub for research excellence and scientific information,” emphasized Rasha Kelej, chief social officer, Merck Healthcare. “The theme of the Summit Infectious diseases and women health is informed by the fact that for many infectious diseases, women are at higher risk and have a more severe course of illness than men for many reasons including biological differences, social inequities, and restrictive cultural norms. Therefore, efforts to recognize and reduce health disparities among women have particular relevance for global health,” Kelej emphasised. “The Summit will focus on the relation between infectious diseases and cancer in women, untreated infectious diseases and the high prevalence of infertility in Africa,” Kelej added. It will also aim to identify the scientific research priorities for evolving health needs to address infectious diseases such as; Malaria, Schistosomiasis and Zika in relation to women heath. On the second day of UNESCO – MARS 2016, Merck on-line research community blog will be launched to enable young researchers to exchange experience and knowledge with their peers and with established researchers in Africa and beyond. Of the 200 researchers attending the Summit 60 percent are women. This is contributing to one of the main objectives of the UNESCO-MARS which is; empowering women who in research. “In addition, the UNESCO – MARS 2016  will launch for the first time the ‘Best African Woman Research Awards’ to recognize the outstanding contribution of African women researchers and scientists with the aim of promoting women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics),” Rasha Kelej said. During the Summit, Young African Researchers who have submitted outstanding abstracts will be recognised. The first three young African Researchers will be eligible for a number of research awards, while a further research awards will be dedicated for the ‘Best African Women Researchers’. This year’s Summit has attracted 15 African Ministers of Health; Education; Science and Technology; Gender and Social Development to participate in two ministerial high level panels.

The second UNESCO – MARS Summit is a unique opportunity for Africa’s young and talented scientists to share their research output and findings with the top echelon of scientists from Africa and abroad. It is also an opportunity for networking and career development. The Summit will present a platform where young scientists will be able to discuss the enabling environment for better research among others. During the 2015 Summit, several participants were recognized and awarded for excellence in research, in which, two scientists were awarded six-month fellowships in Merck’s Biotechnology R&D hub in Germany. The first award of a six month fellowship at the Merck R&D hub was granted to Benard Kulohoma, Kenya and Rebecca Chukwuanukwu, Nigeria. Both of them have actively contributed towards the preparation of the 2nd UNESCO – MARS 2016. The first UNESCO-Merck Africa Research Summit 2015 was successfully organized and held in Geneva, Switzerland in October 2015 with the focus on emergent infectious diseases such as Ebola.

Here is what two of our regulator healthcare contributors had to say. George Budwell (TMFGBudwell) Nov 11, 2016 at 8:02AM Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) undoubtedly deserves its place among the pantheon of top big pharma stocks with its nearly $40 billion in annual sales. However, the drugmaker has yet to put the so-called patent cliff in the rearview mirror, with top-selling medicines Remicade, Cubicin, and Zetia all set to lose patent protection over the next year or so. With this looming headwind in mind, we asked two of our regular healthcare contributors why investors should buy -- or avoid -- this blue chip stock right now. Here's what they had to say. Image source: Getty Images Buy this big pharma stock for the dividend, stay for the long-term growth George Budwell: Although Merck's top line is forecast to come in flat next year, there are several solid reasons to stay patient with this big pharma stock. Merck's Keytruda, after all, recently won a critical battle with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) star immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo. Digging into the details reveals that the FDA approved Keytruda on Oct. 24 as a first-line treatment for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with high PD-L1 expression. And, as an added bonus, the agency also expanded the drug's label in the second-line metastatic NSCLC setting to include patients whose tumors express PD-L1 at 1% with disease progression during or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. As a reminder, the pivotal trial assessing competitor Opdivo's effectiveness in the front-line setting for NSCLC missed the mark, paving the way for Keytruda to dominate this high-value indication going forward. Perhaps equally important, though, Keytruda is now expected to steal a significant chunk of the second-line setting away from Bristol's drug, as oncologists become more familiar with Keytruda due to its approval in the front-line arena, combined with its less restrictive labeling for this indication. Taken together, these two positive regulatory developments are expected to add around $2.5 billion to Keytruda's peak sales.  Looking ahead, Merck is attempting to push Keytruda into rarefied air in terms of commercial potential with over 200 studies currently underway across more than 30 different tumor types. Keytruda's peak sales could reach an astronomical $15 billion within the next decade, making it one of the best-selling drugs of all time.  Beyond Keytruda, Merck sports a vast pipeline of immuno-oncology drugs that should widen its footprint in this ultrahigh-growth market. Now, of course, there will be clinical and regulatory setbacks along the way. But I'm willing to go out on a limb and say that Merck will be able to overcome these forthcoming patent headwinds to return to growth no later than 2018. Until then, investors can enjoy the drugmaker's healthy dividend yield of 3.13%.  Impending losses to offset Cory Renauer: Merck & Co. may have a multibillion-dollar blockbuster on its hands, but I'm not sure Keytruda alone can offset losses to incoming competition for some of the company's best-selling products. Brand Name Q3 2016 Sales Percentage of Total Q3 2016 Sales Main Patent Expirations Remicade $311 Million 3% Feb. 2015 (EU) Cubicin $320 Million 3% 2016 Zostavax $190 Million 1.8% 2016 Zetia $671 Million 6.4% 2017 Januvia/Janumet $1.55 Billion 14.7% 2022 Data source: Merck & Co. financial statements. Table by author. Patents in U.S. Region, except Remicade. Last February the company lost exclusivity for Remicade in the EU, where it has a license to sell Johnson & Johnson's popular anti-inflammatory injection. Merck's annual Remicade revenue peaked at $2.37 billion in 2014, but biosimilar competition is steadily eating into sales of the key product. Additional versions of Remicade have started a slow but steady race to the bottom. In 2015 Merck shelled out $9.5 billion to acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals for rights to Cubicin and other antibiotics. Unfortunately, its attempt to block generic competition in the courts didn't work out. In the U.S., sales of the antibiotic have already started falling, along with sales for its shingles vaccine, Zostavax. Sales of Merck's big cholesterol buster, Zetia, are still on the rise, but will probably reverse course soon. The patent expires next April, and a previous legal settlement should allow India's Glenmark Pharmaceuticals to begin selling a generic version this December. Diabetes drug Januvia isn't facing a loss of exclusivity, but growth of Merck's best-selling product has ground to a halt worldwide and started sliding in the U.S., based on year-to-date sales. I expect Januvia losses to accelerate as the aging DPP-4 drug loses ground to increasingly popular GLP-1 agonists, such as Eli Lilly's Trulicity, and SLGT2 inhibitors like Invokana from Johnson & Johnson. With products responsible for roughly 29% of total sales under threat, achieving growth in the years ahead won't be easy for Merck. At about 17 times forward earnings, Merck shares aren't terribly expensive, but I think you can find better bargains in the healthcare sector. Cory Renauer owns shares of Johnson and Johnson.

How to Invest in Health Care in a Trump Presidency U.S. News & World Report - Money 4 days ago Matt Whittaker © (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) US President-elect Donald Trump (C) and his wife Melania walk at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on November 10, 2016. Stocks of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies got a boost Wednesday as investors expressed relief for President-elect Donald Trump, who is expected to less aggressively pursue price controls for drug makers than Democrat Hillary Clinton. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.70 +0.99 +0.94% Bank of America Corporation BAC ▼ 19.88 -0.21 -1.02% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 58.91 +0.79 +1.36% General Electric Co GE ▼ 30.33 -0.19 -0.61% However, publicly traded hospital companies took hits over investor concerns about the potential fate of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, which brought them a new wave of customers. Until Trump's health care policies become clear, investors should take a wait-and-see approach before taking actions in the broad sector, investing experts say. [See: 10 Ways to Invest in Pharmaceuticals With ETFs.] Despite an overnight selloff in global markets as it became clear that Trump would win, sparking uncertainty, U.S. equities markets on moved higher after the election. The impact on health care stocks is not just coming from the results of the presidential election, says Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer with Bryn Mawr Trust. Cecilia notes that Republicans maintained control of Congress, and a proposition in California that would have capped prices paid by most state-funded health insurance programs was defeated. He says if that measure had passed in California, similar measures would have found their way into other states. Big pharmaceutical names are substantially higher on the strength of Trump's victory. Pfizer (ticker: PFE) is up 10.2 percent this week, while Merck & Co. (MRK) rallied 8.2 percent. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology exchange-traded fund (IBB) rose nearly 11 percent. Both Clinton and Trump talked about measures aimed at controlling high prices for drugs during a year that saw debate over Mylan's (MYL) price increases on EpiPen injectors for allergic reactions and Turing Pharmaceuticals announced a price hike on an HIV/AIDS drug. John Conlon chief equity strategist at People's United Bank, says a Clinton presidency would have had a more severe impact on drug makers' pricing power and revenue. Health care stocks had been under pressure from worry about what would be the mechanism for price control, Conlon says. Meanwhile, hospitals did not fare so well. HCA Holdings (HCA) fell nearly 10 percent this week; Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC) was down nearly 27 percent and Community Health Systems (CYH) shed 18 percent. The selloff in hospitals comes amid fears that Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress will repeal at least parts of the Affordable Care Act and leave hospitals with fewer customers, says Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist with Brown Brothers Harriman. Trump said repeatedly during the campaign he would seek to repeal Obamacare. Investors were repositioning portfolios on Wednesday, Clemons says. But retail investors should wait and see, he says. "In this kind of environment of heightened uncertainty, investors should take a long-term view," Clemons says. Clemons also notes that this surprise election result is similar to Britain's recent decision to leave the European Union, which was also a stunner, in that there will be a period of unknowns. "What we're embarking on now is a process," he says. While political policies do matter for a company's stock price, they matter less when it comes to underlying fundamentals, he says. For example, the need for what large market capitalized pharmaceutical companies produce is not going away as the developed world ages, becomes more wealthy and tends to spend more on quality of life, Clemons says. "There's a natural increase in the underlying fundamental demand for health care," he says. Also, if a company is based in multiple locations, it may be able to weather political changes in one area, he says. Clemons compares short-term market rebalancing to breaking waves, but the longer-term fundamentals are like the tide. Big pharma companies as well as smaller health care firms that can reduce prices based on efficiencies, rather than blunt political pricing pressure, will be more attractive under a Trump presidency, Clemons says. Cecilia recommends letting the dust settle before investing in biotech and pharma, but he is positive on the sector over the longer term. Shorter term catalysts for entry could include statements by Trump or his administration on pharmaceutical pricing, perhaps his Cabinet selections and who ends up holding important chairmanships in the Senate, Cecilia says. And Conlon is generally bullish on this portion of the health care sector. "It's a very attractive area," he says.

However, Transparency Market Research observes that the leading players are expected to lose their share in the overall market as patents for several drugs are poised to expire in the coming years. The top five players in the market are GlaxoSmithKline Plc., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Astra Zeneca, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Merck & Co., Inc. "The companies will focus on building their pipelines and developing effective and result-oriented medicines to meet the unmet demands of the patients across the globe," states the lead author of the research report. Download PDF Brochure of Research Report -http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=16751 Asia Pacific to Lead Global Market due to Phenomenal Unmet Medical Needs According to the research report, the global pulmonary drugs market is expected to be worth US$ 28,082.1 mn by the end of 2024 as compared to US$ 48,039.7 mn in 2015. Analysts calculate that the global market will plummet at a CAGR of -6.3% during the forecast period of 2016 and 2024. The market will thrive as the demand for combination drugs is anticipated to remain on the rise during the forecast period. The report estimates that the combination drugs segment will reach a valuation of US$5,217.5 mn by the end of 2024. On the other hand, in terms of geography, Asia Pacific will emerge as the leading region in the global market due to a huge pool of unmet medical demands. By the end of 2024, the Asia Pacific pulmonary drugs market is estimated to account for a share of 23.1% in the global market. High Prevalence of Respiratory Disorders due to Smoking Improves Uptake of Pulmonary Drugs Despite the projected decline, the demand for pulmonary drugs will continue to build as the population is reeling under the high prevalence of chronic respiratory disorders. The Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS) states that the about 200 million meet their fatal end due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and about 235 million due to asthma. These statistics have been the primary growth drivers for the overall pulmonary drugs market in the past few years. The rising number of smokers across the globe have also triggered the demand for pulmonary drugs as they are usually at the receiving end of respiratory disorders. The World Health Organization states that consumption of tobacco leads to six million deaths every year while 600, 000 are exposed to second-hand smoke, which is known to cause asthma. Thus the changes in lifestyle are anticipated to play a crucial role in the development of global market. The global pulmonary drugs market is also benefitting from the increasing disposable incomes and the rising awareness about treating pulmonary ailments. The increasing investments made in research and development of pulmonary drug delivery systems have also favored market growth in recent times. The growing pool of unmet demands due to population explosion in several developing countries and the entry of innovative and effective drugs in the market is also anticipated to boost the uptake of these drugs in the coming few years. Get Discounts on Report Purchase:http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=D&rep_id=16751 Availability of Counterfeit Drugs Hampers Market Growth Analysts anticipate that the negative growth of the global pulmonary drugs market will be attributable to the patent cliffs in the coming years that will hamper the revenues of several leading players. This issue will be further addled by the entry of generic drugs in the global market. The strict regulatory process of getting these drugs approved from various authorities is also expected to dampen the spirit of the market during the forecast period. Furthermore, the wide availability of counterfeit drugs is also acting a significant impediment to the overall market. The review is based on Transparency Market Research's research report, titled "Pulmonary Drugs Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 - 2024."

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    CNBC's Jim Cramer said President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies are "extraordinary" rocket fuel to the surging stock market. Financial, construction and energy stocks have rallied in response to the Republican's victory. As a result, Cramer is now bullish on drug and health stocks. "This expansion in the banks not just because of regulation, but it's also because of interest rates going higher, but it's also because people feel loan growth is going to be better, people feel lower taxes [are coming]," Cramer said on CNBC. "When that group [of financial stocks] leads, that's a freight train," he said. "What I'm seeing ... is a pile-on on what [were] considered to be, I think, the worst stocks in the world if Hillary Clinton were elected president," Cramer said. Meanwhile, "the biggest impact of this shocking election is probably on the healthcare group,” he said on CNBC. The prospect of Clinton winning the White House had weighed on drug stocks, especially after she tweeted about cracking down on pharmaceutical price gouging in September 2015. But Cramer explains that Republicans seek limited regulation and free markets. Cramer doesn't expect them to crack down on drug pricing because it would stifle innovation. Cramer also expects Republicans to attempt to repeal Obamacare, which could hurt many healthcare plays, but he thinks the Democrats in the Senate will filibuster. Cramer warned that not all companies are worth owning, as some are engaged in a price war with competitors, such as the wholesale drug distributors. "For the segments of the health care sector that don't have price wars, I think we need to get a lot more positive because these stocks have more room to run," Cramer said. Cramer said savvy investors already know to avoid Valeant. He recommended Merck as one of the best to own, as well as Pfizer, Celgene, Allergan and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Cramer isn't alone in his enthusiasm for Trump's potential Veteran financial guru Larry Kudlow, who served as the Trump campaign's senior economic adviser, tells Newsmax TV that Trump will live up to his campaign vows to restore prosperity to all Americans and the nation we all love. "Donald Trump has a very strong economic growth message which is going to be great for the economy and for profits and for businesses large and small," Kudlow said Wednesday to Steve Malzberg on "America Talks Live." Kudlow, a Newsmax Finance Insider and CNBC senior contributor, said the billionaire real-estate tycoon was successful because he understands the dissatisfaction of "ordinary middle-class folk." "With Mr. Trump you're going to have across the board tax cuts, you're going to end Obamacare, which is a prosperity killer and a healthcare killer, you're going to take the handcuffs off of energy, you're going to wall back all these regulations and you're going to stop the government from taking over the economy. That's a powerful message," Kudlow said. Trump "understood that they were angry and that the establishment in Washington and elsewhere was not delivering. He understood that they wanted change and he understood that they wanted to drain the swamp, get rid of the corruption, stop the corporate cronyism," Kudlow said. "He understood that instinctively and he knew that people were not willing to give up the American dream … I think it was effective and I think he hit it exactly right. He just understood the American people in a way that no other political figure has understood it." Trump's proposed policies such as tax cuts, higher fiscal spending and simplifying regulation are likely to benefit sectors such as banks and industrials. Trump has sided with leading conservatives in calling for the repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act largely opposed by banks. "The Trump campaign did say it would repeal Dodd-Frank. Rates are higher and the yield curve is steeper. Those are all good things for the banks," Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia, told Reuters.  But the possibility of Trump slapping punitive tariffs on exports from some countries such as China has unnerved some investors. "The markets are adjusting to a new reality and are giving Trump the benefit of doubt," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of Sarhan Capital. "He does have some problems with immigration and with social issues, but his economic policies, at least in the short-term, are perceived to be stimulative and net good for the economy and that's why stocks are rallying."

low survival rates drive search for new treatments Faced with persistently low survival rates, KOLs are calling for new approaches to treat late-stage colorectal cancer (CRC).

Which new therapies do KOLs expect to help most? Deeper understanding required: Some KOLs believe that better physical and molecular classification of CRC, combined with increased use of biomarkers, may have more of an impact than new medicines. Outlook unclear for anti-VEGFs and EGFR inhibitors: KOLs are split on whether these backbone therapies will see continued widespread use as front-line and later line treatments respectively. What will determine their positions in the treatment algorithm? KOLs enthusiastic about PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors: Although some note that immunotherapies like Keytruda and Tecentriq are most effective in a small subset of patients. How are they likely to be used? New combinations on the horizon: While chemotherapy-backed combinations are widely used in CRC, some KOLs believe targeted therapy combinations may prove more effective for many patients. Hunger for alternative treatments: KOLs are upbeat about novel mechanisms of action—but not all of them. Which pipeline therapies are they most excited about? Which ones are they most sceptical of? Mixed feelings about biosimilar bevacizumab: With at least six Avastin biosimilars on the way, KOLs are cautiously optimistic. What are their concerns, and what will biosimilars have to show to achieve widespread uptake? Cost concerns are mounting: KOLs anticipate that new CRC treatments will come with a high price tag. How will that affect treatment and regulatory decisions?

Some say novel therapies are the key. Others argue that a deeper understanding of the disease may have more of an impact by enabling personalised treatments. Find out how the treatment algorithm is likely to evolve over the next five years in KOL Insight: Colorectal Cancer. You'll get 12 North American and European KOLs' candid thoughts on 6 recently marketed CRC treatments and 13 more currently in the pipeline. Discover how PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and other new therapies are likely to be used, how they'll affect current mainstays such as anti-VEGF therapies and EGFR inhibitors, and which new combination therapies show the most promise. Download sample pages "I think the lesson we have learnt in colon cancer is that if we want to push the survival number up and up and up, we have to think of ways of combining different strategies."

Plus 8 more - download the full list now > Top Takeaways Unmet need is the #1 concern: Many CRC subtypes have a poor prognosis. Which patient population represents the greatest unmet need? Which new therapies do KOLs expect to help most? Deeper understanding required: Some KOLs believe that better physical and molecular classification of CRC, combined with increased use of biomarkers, may have more of an impact than new medicines. Outlook unclear for anti-VEGFs and EGFR inhibitors: KOLs are split on whether these backbone therapies will see continued widespread use as front-line and later line treatments respectively. What will determine their positions in the treatment algorithm? KOLs enthusiastic about PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors: Although some note that immunotherapies like Keytruda and Tecentriq are most effective in a small subset of patients. How are they likely to be used? New combinations on the horizon: While chemotherapy-backed combinations are widely used in CRC, some KOLs believe targeted therapy combinations may prove more effective for many patients. Hunger for alternative treatments: KOLs are upbeat about novel mechanisms of action—but not all of them. Which pipeline therapies are they most excited about? Which ones are they most sceptical of? Mixed feelings about biosimilar bevacizumab: With at least six Avastin biosimilars on the way, KOLs are cautiously optimistic. What are their concerns, and what will biosimilars have to show to achieve widespread uptake? Cost concerns are mounting: KOLs anticipate that new CRC treatments will come with a high price tag. How will that affect treatment and regulatory decisions?

Photo credit: Anthony Albright/Creative Commons Drugmakers told the FDA that allowing them to share off-label information with payers would be a critical first step in redefining off-label regulations. The FDA held a two-day public hearing this week to gather information about off-label communications, after a series of lawsuits were decided in favor of the pharmaceutical industry. At the hearing, industry stakeholders agreed with concerns over supplying information not vetted by the FDA to consumers, who may not understand the limitations of the data, and doctors, who may not have the time in their busy days to determine what information is misleading. This leaves payers as a likely starting point for sharing off-label information. See also: Will drugmakers get what they're looking for at this week's FDA off-label hearing? Payers “play such a gatekeeping role with respect to patients,” said Kellie Combs, an attorney for Ropes & Gray, who testified at the hearing on behalf of the Medical Information Working Group. “There's a real interest in getting information to payers as soon as possible.” As prescribing decisions are increasingly made by health systems and formulary committees — rather than physicians — allowing drugmakers to communicate with payers about data outside of the product's label is critical, and payers' sophisticated understanding of clinical data makes them low-hanging fruit, said Michael Labson, ‎a partner at law firm Covington & Burling, and a representative of PhRMA. In addition, certain types of data, like demonstrating a drug's use in subpopulations and sharing pharmacoeconomic data, are examples of information that do not meet the FDA's criteria but are still valuable to payers, said Dr. Sandra Milligan, SVP of global regulatory affairs and clinical safety at Merck. “Truthful, competent and reliable evidence should be a part of the dialogue with healthcare decision makers,” she added. FDA officials asked a number of questions about what a regulatory framework for allowing off-label communications to payers would look like, after pharmaceutical executives brought up the need to speak with payers ahead of a drug's FDA approval and also about data that is not included on a drug's approved label. See also: 5 questions raised at the FDA's off-label hearing Coleen Klasmeier, a partner at Sidley Austin, who also represents the Medical Information Working Group, argued that there would be a benefit to payers if drugmakers were allowed to share off-label information with them. She said the lack of current regulatory guidelines on this issue “undermines the ability for payers to receive high quality information” and that the “FDA has not addressed payers communications in a meaningful way.” The agency will now consider whether to issue new guidance. FDA spokesperson Sarah Peddicord said in an email that the FDA insteads “to provide new guidance as needed after the meeting.” Share this content: facebook twitter linkedin google Comments Print Similar Articles Will drugmakers get what they're looking for at this week's FDA off-label hearing?

About Xencor’s XmAb® Bispecific Technology As opposed to traditional monoclonal antibodies that target and bind to a single antigen, bispecific antibodies are designed to elicit multiple biological effects that require simultaneous binding to two different antigen targets. Xencor’s XmAb bispecific Fc domain technology is designed to maintain full-length antibody properties in a bispecific antibody, potentially enabling favorable in vivo half-life and simplified manufacturing. Efforts at bispecific antibody design are typically frustrated by poor molecular stability, difficulties in production and short in vivo half-life. Xencor has engineered a series of Fc domain variants that spontaneously form stable, heterodimeric bispecific antibodies and that can be made and purified with standard antibody production methods. These bispecific Fc domains are used to generate a broad array of novel drug candidates in a range of molecule formats. About Xencor, Inc. Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer. Currently, 10 candidates engineered with Xencor’s XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners. Xencor’s internal programs include: XmAb5871 in Phase 2 development for the treatment of IgG4-Related Disease, and also for the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; XmAb7195 in Phase 1 development for the treatment of asthma and allergic diseases; XmAb14045 in Phase 1 development for acute myeloid leukemia; and XmAb13676 for B-cell malignancies and XmAb18087 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors, both in pre-clinical development. Xencor’s XmAb antibody engineering technology enables small changes to the structure of monoclonal antibodies resulting in new mechanisms of therapeutic action.  Xencor partners include Novartis, Amgen, MorphoSys, Merck, CSL/Janssen, Alexion, Novo Nordisk and Boehringer Ingelheim.

Bone marrow transplant procedure is recommended to treat severe stages of leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, multiple myeloma, aplastic and sickle cell anemia, thalassemia etc. As per transplant activity report 2009-2013 from the Center for International Bone and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), of a total of 88,063 bone marrow transplant procedures performed in the U.S., over 57% procedures were autologous bone marrow transplant procedures. The report covers the global bone marrow transplant market performance in terms of volume (procedural count) and revenue contribution. The report includes key trends, drivers, restraints, and opportunities influencing the growth of the global bone marrow transplant market over the forecast period. Impact analysis of key growth drivers and restraints, based on the weighted average model, are included to provide clients with crystal clear decision-making insights. The global bone marrow transplant market growth is mainly driven by factors such as growing prevalence of blood cancers across the globe, expansion of bone marrow transplant registry, growing investment in logistic services, and improvement in survival rate after treatment. Substantially high cost of treatment, lack of reimbursement policies in developing regions, and low availability of bone marrow donors are some factors hampering the growth of the global bone marrow transplant market. Based on procedure type, the bone marrow transplant market is segmented into autologous bone marrow transplant and allogeneic bone marrow transplant segments. By volume, the autologous bone marrow transplant segment accounted for the major proportion of the overall market share in 2014 and is expected to remain the dominant segment in terms of volume during the forecast period. By disease indication, the global bone marrow transplant market is classified as leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, aplastic anemia, solid tumors, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and others. The leukemia segment is expected to dominate the market, accounting for a maximum share of the overall market by 2021 end; whereas, revenue from the thalassemia segment is projected to expand at the highest CAGR of 8.9% during the forecast period. On the basis of the end user, the global bone marrow transplant market is segmented into hospitals, multispecialty clinics, and ambulatory surgical centers (ASC). The hospital end user segment is expected to continue to be dominant, reaching a value of US$ 9,607.4 Mn by 2021 end.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Fc Protein and Glycoengineered Antibodies Market (2nd Edition), 2016 – 2026 LONDON, Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — INTRODUCTION Developed through introduction of modifications in monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody based therapeutics are gaining increased attention from both large and small pharmaceutical companies. The Y-arm of the antibody is known as Fab, comprising a constant and a variable domain from each light and heavy chain. The variable domain (Fv) within the Fab region is responsible for target specificity and binding affinity whereas the base of the antibody, known as the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region, is responsible for interaction with immune cells. Modifications made in the Fc region can alter its effector functions. The key changes made in the Fc domain to improve the effector functions include glycoengineering, protein engineering or isotype chimerism. This can result in improvement in the ADCC activity, CDC activity, ADCP activity and half-life of the molecule. The concept of engineered antibodies is widely being used for development for biobetters/biosimilars, addressing the drawbacks of their ancestor drug candidates. Several players have developed and made available their proprietary technologies for production of such engineered antibodies. This has encouraged and opened an opportunity for a large amount of licensing activity in this domain, building a strong collaborative network of small and big pharmaceutical companies. Currently, two drugs, namely Gazyva® and POTELIGEO®, are commercially available. A number of molecules are being tested primarily for oncological indications; in addition, a limited set of molecules are also being developed for non-oncological indications such as asthma, COPD, neuromyelitis optica, ulcerative colitis and hemolytic disease in the newborn. Such initiatives suggest that the overall market is likely to hold a strong potential in the coming years. SCOPE OF THE REPORT The “Fc Protein and Glycoengineered Antibodies Market (2nd Edition), 2016-2026” report was commissioned to examine the various aspects of engineering an antibody to develop novel drugs for addressing several oncology and non-oncological disorders. This market has steadily evolved over the last few years. The report examines several elements of developing these next generation antibodies, such as the technologies used for their production, site of engineering in an antibody and a robust landscape in the form of clinical / preclinical pipeline. For the purposes of this report, engineered antibodies are defined as antibodies that have been modified in their Fc region. The two types of modification considered include: – Fc Glycoengineering (referred to as ‘Glycoengineering’ in the report) – Fc Protein engineering As pharmaceutical companies continue to initiate and expand their research programs in this area, one of the key objectives outlined for this report was to understand the future potential of the market. This was done by analyzing: – The Fc protein and glycoengineered antibody pipeline in terms of phase of development, type of therapy (monotherapy or combination therapy) and target indications. – Technologies established by various players for development of engineered antibody therapeutics including the key mechanism involved, licencing activity, advantages and the molecules being developed using the technology. – Partnerships that have taken place in the recent past covering technology licensing, product development and commercialization agreements, clinical trial collaborations, product license agreements, acquisitions and other relevant agreements. – Inherent threats to growth in the short and long term. – The likely adoption of the Fc protein and glycoengineered antibodies by understanding the competition posed by the current treatment plans and the expected growth rate over the coming few years.
