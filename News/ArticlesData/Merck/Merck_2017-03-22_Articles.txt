UCF has set a goal to raise $100 million to help fund the school. Gabrielle RussonContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy UCF wants to raise $100 million over the next 20 years so it can invest more in itself and rely less on state taxpayer money and tuition, the university’s top finance official said. The school is in the early phases of developing a plan to generate more money by possibly increasing online class enrollment, finding new corporate sponsors, capitalizing on patents and considering other ideas that could help pay for such things as updated science labs and other needs, UCF chief financial officer William Merck said. For us to really ramp up our game and do some really special things, we need to find ways to supplement what we get from state funding with dollars from other sources,” Merck said. “We have a lot of goals and a lot of aspirations.” The $100 million target developed as officials approved the school’s long-term strategic plan last year. In the wake of the financial crisis, more public institutions are diversifying their revenue, said David Bass, a senior director of research at a Washington-based nonprofit called the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. “They’re in the vanguard of a larger national trend,” Bass said of the University of Central Florida. “They have a reputation for being an entrepreneurial institution. This makes perfect sense in that regard.” UCF’s desire to become more self-sustaining comes as state lawmakers clash on higher education spending. Senate President Joe Negron, R-Stuart, has pledged to make higher education a priority this year by proposing a $1 billion increase in state funding for it. But a House committee this month scrutinized public universities and their foundations for what they called wasteful spending. And the House is considering ideas that would scale back spending on universities. A plan outlined by Higher Education Appropriations Chairman Larry Ahern, R-Seminole, would reduce spending by at least $80 million and perhaps more. University officials are also mindful of potential problems with raising money from nontraditional sources. “New revenue may bring about a clash with existing culture within academe,” warned a draft report on the proposal. “There has long been an aversion to being profit-driven, influenced by corporate interests, or being seen as ‘business’ oriented.” Merck said it was important to protect the independence of research and education in the classroom as the school looks for corporate sponsors and other new revenue. “We will be careful whose money we take and what purpose that money is intended for,” Merck said. Last year, the university said it was among the top 20 public schools in the country for the number of U.S. patents secured. Perhaps those innovators could help UCF raise more money, officials said. “Getting a patent, that just locks an idea in,” Merck said. “Now are there opportunities to commercialize those patents at a faster rate than what we’re doing now? … I don’t know. Those are the kind of things we want to dig into right now.” Another possibility could be growing online enrollment to attract more international students, the chief financial officer said. UCF also could pursue more sponsorships. The school has decided against renewing a contract with a third-party vendor for securing sponsors for UCF athletics. With that work done in-house now, the university could find more opportunities for sponsorships in other areas too, including the emerging downtown Orlando campus, said Merck and Kaye-Alese Green, his project coordinator. There were even smaller ideas, such as a company sponsoring T-shirts, for instance, for intramural sports. That could give the recreation department more money to increase programs at a time when student fees have remained flat. The school would need $100 million to create a “meaningful impact” in an annual budget that tops nearly $2 billion, Merck said. He added donations raised by the UCF Foundation and grants would not count toward the goal. UCF is seeking to raise $2.5 million in the first year and reach $35 million by the halfway mark of the 20-year plan, according to a draft report. “We can’t do this overnight,” he said as the school determines this year how to track the new money and when the proposal will officially start. “It’s going to take time to ramp up.” News Service of Florida contributed to this report. grusson@orlandosentinel.com, @gabriellerusson, or 407-420-5470 State lawmakers question UCF foundation spending » Caption 'Vampire cult' killer back in Lake County for resentencing Howard Scott Anderson, who is serving life in prison for his involvement in the 1996 vampire cult killings in Eustis, was transported to Lake County this week for court proceedings that could lead to a lighter sentence.

In a 3-0 decision, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said the plaintiffs may proceed to trial on their failure-to-warn claims, and a lower court judge erred in finding the claims pre-empted by federal law. Merck said it is reviewing its options, and that a judge, not a jury, should decide the pre-emption question. It also said it remains "confident" in Fosamax's safety and effectiveness. David Frederick, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fosamax, whose chemical name is alendronate sodium, has been prescribed to treat or prevent bone loss in post-menopausal women since 1995. But the plaintiffs claimed to suffer atypical femur fractures from long-term use, and said Merck knew about the risk for more than a decade before adding it to the Fosamax warning label in January 2011. The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based company changed the label four months after an outside task force hired by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a report associating Fosamax with the fractures. In March 2014, U.S. District Judge Joel Pisano in Trenton, New Jersey, dismissed all claims by plaintiffs injured before Sept. 14, 2010, the date of the task force report, leaving only about 20 active cases. The judge, who retired from the bench in 2015, cited a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision that state law-based failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted when there was "clear evidence" that the FDA would not have approved a warning that plaintiffs requested. Writing for the appeals court, however, Circuit Judge Julio Fuentes found enough evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the FDA would have approved "a properly-worded warning" about Fosamax, "or at the very least, to conclude that the odds of FDA rejection were less than highly probable." Fuentes said a jury could also find that some doctors would not have prescribed Fosamax had Merck discussed the risk of fractures on a warning label. Merck's annual sales of Fosamax regularly topped US$3 billion before the company lost patent exclusivity in 2008. Fosamax is now available as a generic. Sales of Fosamax totaled US$284 million last year, down from US$3.05 billion in 2007. In afternoon trading, Merck shares were down 0.8 percent at US$63.43. The case is In re: Fosamax (Alendronate Sodium) Products Liability Litigation, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-1900.

Mortality rates from rotavirus infection are highest in that part of the world. An oral vaccine against rotavirus protected healthy infants in Africa against the disease better than placebo, results from a phase III trial showed. In both per-protocol and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, vaccine efficacy of three doses of BRV-PV, a heat-stable, live, oral bovine rotavirus pentavalent vaccine, in the intervention group was 66.7% (95% CI 49.9-79.9) and 69.1% (95% CI 55.0-78.7) respectively, reported Sheila Isanaka, ScD, of Epicentre, in Paris, and colleagues. Epicentre is a non-profit organization created by doctors from Médicins san Frontières. There also were no significant safety concerns observed with the vaccine, with the rate of serious adverse events slightly lower in the intervention group compared with the placebo group (8.3% versus 9.1%), the authors wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. BRV-PV was developed by the Serum Institute of India as an alternative to the two live, oral attenuated vaccines against rotavirus (Rotarix and RotaTeq), the authors explained. They noted that rotavirus is especially challenging in sub-Saharan Africa, which has has the highest rate of death linked to the disease, and that current supply and storage capabilities make refrigeration of the vaccine difficult. An accompanying editorial by Mathruam Santosham, MD, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and Duncan Steele, PhD, of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, stated that having vaccines available from several manufacturers will help to increase global supply. "Despite this modest efficacy [of BRV-PV], the absolute public health benefits of vaccination are large, given the tremendous disease burden," they wrote. "Increased availability of low-cost, programatically suitable vaccines in abundant supply will be key to achieving this goal." Isanaka 's group conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial in the African country of Niger. The ITT analysis was comprised of 4,092 infants, who underwent randomization, and received at least one dose of the vaccine. Of those, 1,780 infants in the vaccine group and 1,728 infants in the placebo group received either the complete three-dose series or placebo at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Overall, there were 31 cases of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (a score of ≥11 on the 20-point Vesikari clinical scoring system) beginning 28 days after dose three in the vaccine group compared with 87 in the placebo group (2.14 cases versus 6.44 cases per 100 person-years). The authors estimated the vaccine prevented 4.30 (95% CI 2.75-5.85) episodes of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis per 100 person-years. They also said that vaccine efficacy estimates were lower than trials of other rotavirus vaccines on other continents, such as Europe and Latin America, but that was consistent with studies comparing other vaccines to diseases in other regions. They hypothesized about the reasons for these lower efficacy estimates, including that the oral polio vaccine is co-administered at the same time, which can reduce rotavirus antibody levels. "[Other] considerations have included the epidemiologic features of rotavirus infection ... (e.g., earlier age at first infection among children in Africa) ... host characteristics (e.g., poor nutritional status and differences in the gut microbiome) ... and interference from maternal antibodies in breast milk," the authors wrote. Examining adverse events, they found no significant between group differences in risk, with a slightly higher portion of the vaccine group reporting adverse events compared with the control group (68.7% versus 67.2%). There was also no significant difference in the number of deaths (27 deaths in the vaccine group versus 22 in the placebo group). The authors noted that the most common causes of death were infections and infestations (37 infants). While there were no confirmed cases of intussusception, the authors said that the study was "not powered to detect an increase of rare events." Study limitations included that BRV-PV was not consistently given concomitantly with the oral polio vaccine, and that the Vesikari score may have been underestimated, as it is designed for settings with high parental literacy. The authors noted that 33 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are either using or plan to introduce rotavirus vaccines, and "BRV-PV does not require refrigeration and has reasonably efficacy with respect to morbidity and mortality." They added that while there were no safety concerns with this trial, "larger scale-surveillance" may be needed in order to establish safety. This study was supported by Médicins san Frontières Operational Center in Geneva and the Kavli Foundation. Isanaka disclosed no relevant financial relationships. One co-author disclosed grant support from Epicentre, Merck, and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Santosham disclosed no relevant financial relationships. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has supported development of multiple rotavirus vaccine candidates with Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech, Shantha Biotechnics, GSK Biologicals, and Merck.

Valley Cottage, NY, March 22, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Animal breeding remains to be one of the most fundamental agricultural activities facilitating the growth of food & beverage industry in the Middle East. Milk and meat are some of the common raw materials derived from animal husbandry activities carried out in the MEA region. Future Market Insights recently published its research report on the veterinary vaccines market in the Middle East, which stated that – rising demand for food security in the Middle East, collaborative manufacturing measures witnessed among foodmakers and suppliers, and the absence of appropriate health tracking facilities for animals are factoring the growth in demand for veterinary vaccines. Future Market Insights projects that the MEA veterinary vaccines market, which is presently valued at US$ 267.3 million, will soar below average to reach US$ 422.9 million value by 2026-end and register a moderate CAGR of 4.7%. The report estimates that lack of resources for collection of samples, questionable potency of vaccines, and absence of harmonised vaccination procedures are limiting the supply and production of veterinary vaccines in the MEA region. Furthermore, ineffectiveness of veterinary vaccines in curing virulent animal diseases indicates shortcomings on epidemiological knowledge faced by MEA’s virology research institutes. Highest Veterinary Vaccine Sales recorded in Jordan A regional analysis of the veterinary vaccines market in the Middle East identified Jordan as the most lucrative country for sales of veterinary serums. By the end of 2026, Jordan’s veterinary vaccine market is expected to dominate the MEA region by reaching value of US$ 88 million. The demand for veterinary vaccines will be equally higher in Turkey, while Sudan will witness moderate growth in terms of revenues. Meanwhile, countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Egypt will witness revenue growth at more than 4% CAGR throughout the forecast period. Request For Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-ma-3086 Based in Jordan, JOVAC is being recognised as one of the leading manufacturers of veterinary vaccines in the Middle East. The veterinary vaccines market in MEA region is also witnessing fervent involvement of European companies such as Bioveta, Inc., Merial, Bayer Healthcare AG, and Ceva. Other key players in the MEA veterinary vaccines market include, Intervac Pvt. Ltd., Zoetis, Elanco, and Merck & Co, Inc. Surging Demand for Food & Mouth Disease Vaccination Prevalence of oral and digestion-related disorders among animals is shaping up the growth in demand for veterinary vaccines across the Middle East. More than 25% of veterinary vaccines revenues amassed from the MEA region during the projection period will be accounted by food and mouth diseases. New Castle disease has also been observed as prominent indicator for administering veterinary vaccines in this region. Moreover, outbreak of Avian influenza in the MEA region is anticipated to attribute more than US$ 80 million revenues by 2026-end. Send An Enquiry@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/askus/rep-ma-3086 In the report, titled “Veterinary Vaccines Market: Middle East Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment, 2016-2026,” the demand for attenuated live vaccines is predicted to remain high throughout the forecast period. Inactivated vaccines will also gain traction, while revenues garnered from sales of recombinant vaccines, DNA vaccines and toxoid vaccines will grow at a sluggish CAGR. Almost three-fourth of gross revenues amassed from sales of veterinary vaccines in the Middle East will continue to be used for treatment of livestock animals. And, these vaccines are likely to enter the market through veterinary clinics and private veterinary pharmacies. Distribution of veterinary vaccines in the Middle East will also be carried out by hospitals, revenues from which are estimated to surpass US$ 100 million by the end of 2026.
