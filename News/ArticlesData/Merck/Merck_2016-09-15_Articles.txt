(NYSE: MRK) flagship CUBICIN, on September 15, 2016. The CUBICIN (Daptomycin for injection) will be available in the version of 500 mg per vial.

Get all of our free blog coverage and more by clicking on the link below: http://www.activewallst.com/registration-3/?symbol=TEVA http://www.activewallst.com/registration-3/?symbol=MRK Breaking down Daptomycin Daptomycin for injection is an antibacterial drug and is also known as CUBICIN, a flagship Merck product. It finds its application among adults and is used for the treatment of several complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI). Secreted from the susceptible isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, it is indicated in adults for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (bacteremia), inclusive of right-sided infective endocarditis, caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates. Daptomycin possesses a distinct mechanism of action where it disrupts the multiple aspects of bacterial cell membrane function. It inserts into the cell membrane, where it then aggregates. Ultimately, the aggregation alters the curvature of the membrane, leading to hole creation which facilitate leak of ions. As a result, rapid depolarization takes place which results in loss of membrane potential leading to the bacterial cell death. According to the IMS data, as of July 2016, Daptomycin for injection garnered annual sales of approximately $1.2 billion in the US. The generic drug harbinger Teva Pharmaceutical is an Israel-based, multinational pharmaceutical company. Although it ventures in several active pharmaceutical ingredients and proprietary pharmaceuticals, Teva primarily specializes in generic drugs and is the world leader in the sector with $9.5 billion earnings last year. With the launch of this generic injectable drug, Teva aims at strengthening its stance in the pharmaceutical industry while maintaining its status as the biggest generic drug company. The generic drug industry has viewed another announcement from the Israeli drug maker. On September 9, 2016, Teva Pharmaceuticals stated that it aims to win US approval by late 2017 or early 2018 for its version of Mylan’s N.V.’s EpiPen device for treating severe allergic reactions. The price of EpiPen has soared from $100 to more than $600 since, Mylan acquired it in 2007. Mylan’s EpiPen holds 94% of about $1.3 billion of epinephrine pen market share, owing to the absence of strong competitors. Hence, Teva aims to beat out a chunk of the share with its own copycat version of the drug. Wall Street’s analysts have predicted that Teva’s product, if priced cheaper than EpiPen and approved, could eat up the branded product’s market.&nbsp; Stock Performance Teva Pharma’s stock is trading slightly down by 0.10%, closing Thursday’s session at $51.90 on volume of 3.53 million shares. Shares of the company have gained 0.05% in the last three months. The company’s shares have a PE ratio of 34.65 and a dividend yield of 2.62%. Merck’s share price finished yesterday’s trading session at $62.38, climbing 1.68%. A total volume of 9.02 million shares exchanged hands. The stock has advanced 9.28% and 22.94% in the last three months and past six months, respectively. Furthermore, since the start of the year, shares of the company have gained 20.99%. The stock is trading at a PE ratio of 34.16 and a dividend yield of 2.95%.&nbsp; Active Wall Street: Active Wall Street (AWS) produces regular sponsored and non-sponsored reports, articles, stock market blogs, and popular investment newsletters covering equities listed on NYSE and NASDAQ and micro-cap stocks.

These projects once again highlight the leading-edge research being conducted by GMSI teams aimed at treating MS, repairing damage caused by the disease and finding new discoveries that could one day aid in preventing it." The GMSI was launched in October 2012 with the aim of improving the understanding of multiple sclerosis (MS) for the ultimate benefit of those living with the disease. Previous recipients have studied molecular markers of MS, novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and analysis techniques to detect and monitor the disease, and methods to reduce and repair nerve damage caused by inflammation in patients with MS. The awards symposium was chaired by Professor David Bates, Emeritus Professor of Clinical Neurology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, UK, and a member of the GMSI Scientific Committee. During the symposium, Merck also announced the call for proposals for the 2017 GMSI. Up to EUR1,000,000 will be awarded to fund innovative research in MS, in topics that could include:     - MS pathogenesis     - Prediction of MS subtypes     - Predictive markers of treatment response     - Potential new treatments for MS     - Innovative patient support programmes, mobile health devices or patient-reported outcomes More information about the GMSI can be found online at: http://www.grantformultiplesclerosisinnovation.org.

LATEST MEDICAL NEWS Meeting Coverage Second Chance for Cladribine? More safety data, growing risk tolerance may signal opportunity MedpageToday savesaved by Kristina Fiore Kristina Fiore Associate Editor, MedPage Today September 15, 2016 LONDON -- Data from a pair of extension trials have bolstered the long-term safety and efficacy of oral cladribine for relapsing multiple sclerosis, researchers reported here. In an extension phase of the CLARITY trial, reductions in annualized relapse rates (ARR) were maintained, while patients who switched from placebo had reduced relapse rates (0.26 to 0.10, P<0.0001), Gavin Giovannoni, MBBCh, PhD, of Queen Mary University of London, reported at the ECTRIMS meeting here. And in an extension phase of the ORACLE-MS trial of patients with a first demyelinating event, those who ultimately went on to develop MS and started taking interferon had lower relapse rates if they'd been given cladribine in the initial trial instead of placebo (0.14 for 3.5 mg/kg and 0.24 for 5.25 mg/kg versus 0.42), Giancarlo Comi, MD, of Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, reported here. The findings are part of a large package that Merck KGaA, the company's German manufacturing unit, will use to try to have the drug approved in Europe for relapsing-remitting MS, following a rejection by EU regulators in 2010. It submitted a marketing authorization package with the EMA on July 18. The FDA denied approval of cladribine for MS in March 2011, and the company halted its development program in June 2011. Merck KGaA did not respond to a MedPage Today inquiry as to whether it also planned to file an NDA with the FDA. While regulators were initially concerned about an increase in malignancies with the drug, several other agents with comparable adverse event profiles have been approved since that time -- and the company is reassured that additional analyses show few safety concerns and an appropriate risk-benefit ratio. "In our field over the last 5 or 6 years, there's been approval of other, more powerful medications, so this is now in the context where we have, for instance, alemtuzumab with its risks that patients are willing to take on," said Stephen Krieger, MD, of Mount Sinai, who was not involved in the study. "We have a more nuanced understanding of Tysabri and PML and that risk that people are willing to take on." "It's a somewhat different climate in terms of what risk-benefit ratio is acceptable for a medication thought to have high efficacy," Krieger said. Cladribine is a chemotherapeutic agent that targets white blood cells and is used to treat certain blood cancers. Merck developed a pill formula for treating MS. At ECTRIMS, there were two oral presentations and more than a half a dozen posters on the drug, which included data from CLARITY and ORACLE-MS and their respective extensions, as well as from the phase II ONWARD study which looked at the drug as an add-on to interferon. Giovannoni reported data from the 2-year extension phase of the CLARITY trial, in which patients initially on placebo were switched to 3.5 mg/kg cladribine, while those on the drug were re-randomized to either 3.5 mg/kg or to placebo. He reported no significant differences in ARR during the extension phase compared with the initial phase, except for a reduction among those who switched from placebo (from 0.26 to 0.10, P<0.0001). The proportion of patients who were relapse-free was similar in both groups at greater than 70%, but it improved for those who switched from placebo to 3.5 mg/kg of the drug (58% versus 79.6%, P<0.0001). Giovannoni said the findings demonstrate the durable efficacy of cladribine, adding that there were no benefits of additional cladribine treatment. In the ORACLE-MS study, cladribine reduced conversion to MS compared with placebo (38% versus 14% for 3.5 mg and 16% for 5.25 mg), and the extension phase enabled the 109 patients who converted to MS to be treated with interferon (25 on cladribine 3.5 mg/kg; 24 on 5.25 mg/kg; 60 on placebo). In an exploratory analysis for the open-label period, they found that annualized relapse rates were lower among those originally treated with cladribine compared with those who got placebo at enrollment: 3.5 mg/kg: 0.14 (95% CI 0.00-0.27) 5.25 mg/kg: 0.24 (95% CI 0.07-0.40) Placebo: 0.42 (95% CI 0.28-0.56) However, Comi cautioned that few patients completed the full 2 years of the extension phase: 7 in the placebo group, 2 in the 3.5-mg group, and 6 in the 5.25 mg group. In a separate poster that focused on assessing safety data from CLARITY and ORACLE-MS and their respective extensions, as well as the PREMIERE registry, researchers found that rates of lymphopenia were higher for those on the 3.5 mg dose of the drug than placebo (8.8 versus 1.16 per 100 person-years). The analysis also showed that herpes zoster was reported more frequently in patients who had Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia. And the rate of neoplasms, both malignant and benign, was similar but numerically slightly higher for the 3.5-mg drug group than the placebo group (1.14 and 1.01), the researchers said, adding that there was "no clustering of malignancies with a common etiology, and no hematological malignancies commonly associated with immunosuppression." Should the drug be approved, the question remains as to where it fits into the current treatment landscape. Krieger noted that it may also be more likely to be adopted in Europe, which has historically been more tolerant of induction therapy -- compared to the U.S., in which escalation therapy is typically preferred. "Europeans have always historically used more potent immune-suppressing medications for MS: alemtuzumab for 20 years, mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, rituximab off-label," he said. "They are more comfortable with that approach to MS than doctors in the U.S." The studies were supported by Merck KGaA. Comi and Giovannoni disclosed financial relationships with several MS drugmakers. 2016-09-15T11:30:00-0400 Primary Source ECTRIMS Source Reference: Comi G, et al "Cladribine tablets in the ORACLE-MS study open-label maintenance period: Analysis of efficacy in patients after conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis" ECTRIMS 2016; Abstract 70.

The latest results of the ZOE-50 trial - published in the New England Journal of Medicine - suggest that Shingrix (HZ/su) maintains a high level of efficacy in a group that does not respond so well to Merck & Co's Zostavax, the only approved shingles vaccine on the market. Armed with the new data, GSK has confirmed it will press ahead with regulatory applications before the end of the year, setting it on course for possible approvals in 2017. If it can get the long-term efficacy data on the label that could give it a marketing edge over Zostavax, and a chance to quickly capture market share for Merck's drug. Zostavax was a $750m product for Merck last year, but started to see sales fall back marginally after benefiting from a major direct-to-consumer (DTC) ad campaign in the US in 2014 and as a result of reimbursement barriers in some markets. Shingles is an extremely painful infection caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV), the same one that causes chickenpox. While the immune system can generally shake off the symptoms of chickenpox, the virus lies dormant and can reawaken if a person becomes immune-suppressed to cause painful skin lesions. It is increasingly common with advancing age. In some cases it leads to painkiller-resistant pain (post-herpetic neuralgia) that does not resolve after the skin lesions have healed and can last for years. In the latest analysis Shingrix was also shown to reduce the risk of PHN by 89% in people aged 70 or more. "This is the first time that such high efficacy has been demonstrated in a vaccine candidate for older people," said Dr Emmanuel Hanon, senior vice president for vaccines R&D at GSK. If approved, Shingrix could become "an important tool for the prevention of shingles and the pain associated with it, which would significantly impact the health and quality of life of so many people," he added. GSK's vaccine is based on a protein called gE found on VZV, while Zostavaz is a live, attenuated form of the virus. Analysts have suggested it could become a $1bn product for GSK, which has said it is among several late-stage candidates that are predicted to add £6bn in revenues by 2020. An editorial accompanying the NEJM article notes that shingles develops in around 500,000 people aged over 60 in the US each year, and preventing this in older people "should be a public health priority".

The findings, from the phase III CLARITY and CLARITY EXTENSION trials and from the open-label maintenance period of the phase III ORACLE-MS study, demonstrated durable efficacy of Cladribine Tablets in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) along with a well-characterized safety profile. CLARITY and CLARITY EXTENSION studies confirmed that 20 days of oral dosing over two years was effective in reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing disability progression for up to four years. "The results presented this week show that the clinical benefits of Cladribine Tablets can be maintained in most patients for an additional two years without the need for redosing," said Dr. Giancarlo Comi, Professor of Neurology, Chairman of the Department of Neurology, and Director of the Institute of Experimental Neurology, at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan and a lead investigator in the studies. "Although multiple therapies are available for patients with MS, there is still a large unmet need within this patient community, including for therapies that offer lasting benefits." In one oral presentation, data from the two-year phase III CLARITY trial and its two-year extension study (CLARITY EXTENSION) showed that patients with relapsing MS who received placebo in CLARITY and were switched to Cladribine Tablets in CLARITY EXTENSION had significantly reduced annualised relapse rates (ARR) (0.26 vs. 0.10, P<0.0001) and were significantly more likely to be relapse free (58.0 percent vs. 79.6 percent, P<0.0001) at the end of the extension phase. ARR were maintained for patients who received Cladribine Tablets for two years in CLARITY and were then switched to placebo for two years in the extension phase. The second oral presentation reported data from the open-label maintenance period of the phase III ORACLE-MS study. ORACLE-MS showed that, for patients with a first demyelinating event, treatment with Cladribine Tablets significantly reduced the risk of progression to clinically definite MS compared with placebo. For the open-label portion of the study, patients who converted to clinically definite MS during the initial treatment period were switched to Rebif(R) therapy. The new data presented at ECTRIMS show that patients who had received Cladribine Tablets in the initial treatment phase had lower ARR over the maintenance period (median time on Rebif = 56.0 weeks) compared with those who had received placebo in the initial treatment phase [0.14 for Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (n=25), 0.24 for Cladribine Tablets 5.25 mg/kg (n=24) and 0.42 for placebo (n=60)]. "Cladribine Tablets has a unique oral dosing schedule, with just two short treatment courses administered orally in years one and two. Together with more than 10,000 patient years of safety data and phase III efficacy data, these findings of lasting reductions in relapse rates support our belief that, if approved, Cladribine Tablets may serve as an important new advance for patients with relapsing-remitting MS," said Luciano Rossetti, Head of Global R&D for the Biopharma business of Merck. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) of the investigational product Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. About Cladribine Tablets   Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Rebif(R)  Rebif(R) (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif(R) in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ss is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif(R), which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif(R) has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif(R) can be administrated with the RebiSmart(R) electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose(R) single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide(TM). Rebif(R) can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II(R) or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif(R) in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif(R) has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif(R) should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif(R) with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif(R) (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS. RebiSmart(R), an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif(R), is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

The findings, from the phase III CLARITY and CLARITY EXTENSION trials and from the open-label maintenance period of the phase III ORACLE-MS study, demonstrated durable efficacy of Cladribine Tablets in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) along with a well-characterized safety profile. CLARITY and CLARITY EXTENSION studies confirmed that 20 days of oral dosing over two years was effective in reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing disability progression for up to four years. "The results presented this week show that the clinical benefits of Cladribine Tablets can be maintained in most patients for an additional two years without the need for redosing," said Dr. Giancarlo Comi, Professor of Neurology, Chairman of the Department of Neurology, and Director of the Institute of Experimental Neurology, at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan and a lead investigator in the studies. "Although multiple therapies are available for patients with MS, there is still a large unmet need within this patient community, including for therapies that offer lasting benefits." In one oral presentation, data from the two-year phase III CLARITY trial and its two-year extension study (CLARITY EXTENSION) showed that patients with relapsing MS who received placebo in CLARITY and were switched to Cladribine Tablets in CLARITY EXTENSION had significantly reduced annualised relapse rates (ARR) (0.26 vs. 0.10, P<0.0001) and were significantly more likely to be relapse free (58.0 percent vs. 79.6 percent, P<0.0001) at the end of the extension phase. ARR were maintained for patients who received Cladribine Tablets for two years in CLARITY and were then switched to placebo for two years in the extension phase. The second oral presentation reported data from the open-label maintenance period of the phase III ORACLE-MS study. ORACLE-MS showed that, for patients with a first demyelinating event, treatment with Cladribine Tablets significantly reduced the risk of progression to clinically definite MS compared with placebo. For the open-label portion of the study, patients who converted to clinically definite MS during the initial treatment period were switched to Rebif® therapy. The new data presented at ECTRIMS show that patients who had received Cladribine Tablets in the initial treatment phase had lower ARR over the maintenance period (median time on Rebif = 56.0 weeks) compared with those who had received placebo in the initial treatment phase [0.14 for Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (n=25), 0.24 for Cladribine Tablets 5.25 mg/kg (n=24) and 0.42 for placebo (n=60)]. "Cladribine Tablets has a unique oral dosing schedule, with just two short treatment courses administered orally in years one and two. Together with more than 10,000 patient years of safety data and phase III efficacy data, these findings of lasting reductions in relapse rates support our belief that, if approved, Cladribine Tablets may serve as an important new advance for patients with relapsing-remitting MS," said Luciano Rossetti, Head of Global R&D for the Biopharma business of Merck. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) of the investigational product Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Rebif® Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide(TM). Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS. RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

Now, the hard work begins to make the combination a success. Bayer-Monsanto follows agrichemical deals between Dow Chemical Co. and DuPont, as well as ChemChina-Syngenta AG. Completion of the merger would leave three companies with more than 75 percent of the global market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg -- a level of concentration sure to set off alarm bells with regulators. The combination also faces a public backlash in Germany over concerns about Monsanto’s genetically modified seeds and weedkiller -- both abhorred in Bayer’s home country. In a sign of how protracted the regulatory review of the new seed and crop-chemical giant will be, the companies said they will seek approval in 30 jurisdictions around the world -- including the U.S., European Union, Canada and Brazil -- and don’t expect to complete the deal until the end of 2017. Monsanto shares closed 20 percent below the offer price on Wednesday over concerns from investors that the deal might not succeed. German companies have a checkered history with mega acquisitions abroad, including Daimler AG’s ill-fated purchase of Chrysler in 1998 for $43 billion -- a stand-out symbol for failed ventures overseas. Another reminder of the difficulties such deals face came just this week when Linde AG’s talks to merge with U.S. rival Praxair Ltd. fell apart over squabbling about the role of the German company’s Munich home base following a combination. Still, mid-tier companies in the country have been forging ahead with foreign acquisitions that garner less attention. ZF Friedrichshafen AG has done so well with the $12.9 billion purchase of U.S. parts supplier TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. last year that it’s already on the hunt for new targets. ZF is currently bidding to buy Sweden’s Haldex AB. And Bayer has proven itself as one of the most aggressive acquirers among German companies. In addition to the gutsy Monsanto bid, it won fierce bidding wars to buy rival Schering AG, creating the country’s largest drugmaker in 2006, and Merck & Co.’s consumer unit in 2014. Here are five other deals that Bayer and Monsanto might want to study as they move forward. Deutsche Telekom AG-VoiceStream Wireless Corp. (2000 - $50.5 billion): Deutsche Telekom AG store Photographer: Ralph Orlowski/Bloomberg This deal at the dawn of the new millennium gave the German telephone company a splashy entry into the U.S. wireless market. But it also came with headaches, as mobile phone improvements were taking off and competition between carriers was fierce. Deutsche Telekom has only recently begun to turn around what became T-Mobile USA Inc. after a sale to Sprint Corp. was blocked by regulators. Daimler AG-Chrysler Corp. (1998 - $43 billion): Daimler Mercedes-Benz badges Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg Considered one of the most disastrous deals in corporate history, there was a huge culture clash between the German manufacturer of the luxury Mercedes Benz brand and the U.S. maker of mass market cars like the Chrysler Sebring that led to this merger’s downfall. After nine years spent trying to make things work, the automakers’ marriage broke down: Daimler sold Chrysler to Cerberus Capital Management in 2007 for just $7.4 billion. HeidelbergCement AG-Hanson Ltd. (2007 - $18 billion): HeidelbergCement operations Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg This deal was the largest in the building materials industry that year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One looming problem that might not have been on HeidelbergCement’s radar when it bought its U.K. competitor: the housing market was about to crash under the weight of subprime mortgages, leading to a slump in construction projects and stripping the company of its investment-grade credit rating. HeidelbergCement didn’t return to major deal-making until 2015, when it agreed to buy Italcementi SpA for 3.7 billion euros ($4.2 billion.) Merck KGaA-Sigma-AldrichCorp. ($16 billion): Merck KGaA laboratory Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg A happier story: Family-controlled Merck continued a tradition of acquisitions with the purchase of the U.S. firm to expand in chemicals used in research labs and pharmaceutical manufacturing, as well as reducing its dependence on drug development. The German company last month reported second-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates, buoyed by the acquisition of the pharmaceutical equipment maker. Before that it successfully acquired and integrated Millipore Corp., a supplier of drug development equipment for biotechnology companies in 2010, and AZ Electronic Materials SA in 2013 to strengthen its specialty chemicals to the electronics industry. Linde AG-BOC (2006 - $15.6 billion): Linde gas tanks Photographer: Guido Krzikowski/Bloomberg Linde’s takeover of its larger British rival in manufacturing industrial gases is used as the case study for successful acquisitions in MBA programs. The unsolicited bid in 2006 vaulted the German company to the world’s biggest maker of industrial gasses from No. 5, in what CEO Wolfgang Reitzle called "a perfect match" at the time. Reitzle, now Linde’s chairman, has faced a very different scenario this week following the collapse of the Praxair talks, which had gotten underway in earnest in August. Following the announcement Monday that the potential deal had fallen apart, Chief Financial Officer Georg Denoke was ousted and Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Buechele said he wouldn’t seek to extend his contract beyond April. Linde could revisit a merger with Praxair down the road because the strategic rationale remains intact, people familiar with the matter have said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(NYSE: JNJ) recently joined with a private-equity firm to invest that "measly" sum in AnTolRx Inc., an early-stage biotech that uses targeted nanoparticles to treat a range of illnesses, including autoimmune diseases and diabetes. Perhaps because the deal is so small, it went completely unnoticed on Wall Street. And that's fine with us, because at Strategic Tech Investor we crush the market by getting out in front of the Street. More to the point, this seemingly small investment speaks volumes about a key tech investing trend that most so-called "analysts" have largely ignored. I'm talking what I call "Biotech's Quiet Comeback." Fact is, four main catalysts have driven this sector upward by 16% in recent weeks. Today, I'm going to reveal these four major catalysts. And I'll show you the single best way to play this silent but lucrative trend… Don't Tell Anyone About This… Let's put the biotech sector's huge recent gains into some perspective. Since the market hit its post-Brexit bottom on June 27, the bellwether Dow Jones U.S. Biotechnology Index has gained roughly 16%. That's more than double the returns we've seen from the overall market. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index has increased by just 7% during the period. Biotech's rebound comes after the sector sold off for several reasons last year, falling 31% from late July 2015 through February 2016. But since then, I have seen four factors at play that account for the sector's quick turnaround. Take a look… Biotech's Quiet Comeback Catalyst No. 1: Drug Breakthroughs Whether it's the kind of early-stage investment that Johnson & Johnson just made in AnTolRx or late-stage drug pipeline news, the sector is set up to profit from a series of breakthroughs. Take the case of Keytruda from Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK). This drug could turn the tide against cancer by altering how our immune system responds to cancer cells. On Sept. 6, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it will consider approving the drug as a first-line defense against lung cancer. That came just a few months after the agency approved it as a second-line defense. Don't Miss: This is your ticket to bigger and better returns… and it won't cost you a penny. What are you waiting for? Read more…  Plus, Sanofi SA (NYSE ADR: SNY) just announced a new diabetes breakthrough in partnership with small-cap Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: LXRX). That news sent shares of Lexicon up 17% – and shares of Sanofi will surely benefit over time as its sales forces peddle this impressive new drug. A steady supply of new compounds is one of the reasons global drug sales have risen for at least 15 straight years, from $390 billion in 2001 to more than $1 trillion today, according to Statista. And with so many baby boomers heading into old age, that figure may reach $2 trillion by the end of the next decade. Biotech's Quiet Comeback Catalyst No. 2: M&A Join the conversation.

Werner Antweiler, associate professor in the UBC Sauder School of Business and international trade policy chair, shares his thoughts on the megamerger that has the potential to reshape the world’s food supply. Will Bayer succeed or can this deal still falter? Corporate mergers are not for the faint of heart. A takeover requires chutzpah and single-mindedness—the willingness to disrupt chains of commands in the acquired business, split units, move units, eject underperforming units, and unify the corporate culture. That is why hostile takeovers tend to perform better: the acquiring firm bites down hard on a nut, chews, swallows, and digests. Friendly takeovers run the risk of drifting into conglomerative indifference. What is missing in the Bayer-Monsanto deal is the compelling vision of a clear goal that can only be achieved jointly. If Bayer CEO Werner Baumann wants to succeed, he needs to execute his strategy with aplomb and deliver a compelling vision of how the merged entity will transform the future of farming around the globe. To his advantage, Baumann knows Bayer better than some of his CEO predecessors. As a company insider for nearly 20 years with plenty of international experience, he understands the strengths and weaknesses of Bayer like few others. At the helm only since May, this father of four children just got himself a new kid—an unruly but gifted teenager with a reputation of being a bully. Good parenting will be required. Why did Bayer target Monsanto? Bayer has been on a course of re-organization for more than a decade. In 2005, it spun off its basic chemical division into a new company, Lanxess. That allowed Bayer to focus more on its core business of health care, nutrition, and materials. Last year, Bayer further consolidated its operations by spinning off its materials science division into Covestro. While divesting some units, it strengthened others. In 2014, Bayer bought Merck’s consumer health business in the U.S. Acquiring Monsanto continues Bayer’s repositioning. What made Monsanto particularly appealing to Bayer is its deep and complementary research and development capability and patent pipeline in crop science. Combining crop traits (Monsanto’s strength) with crop protection (Bayer’s strength) makes a lot of business sense. Even more enticing to Bayer is Monsanto’s digital farming platform. The next generation of farming will require customizing solutions to local circumstances. Monsanto was seen as “evil” by many activists—will Bayer be “Mr. Nice Guy”? Genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), including crops, are controversial. On one side, GMO crops promise higher productivity to farmers and a more secure food supply for a growing population. On the other hand, unknown long-term consequences of using GMOs have prompted calls by activists to ban them altogether, or at least label them. Monsanto developed a negative image because its marketing tended to be arrogant, and its sales tactics tended to be aggressive. As a result, Monsanto became the target of much protest, ridicule and even hatred. Bayer’s takeover of Monsanto may provide a fresh start if it fixes Monsanto’s deficiencies in corporate culture. Based in GMO-hostile Europe, Bayer has a good track record for engaging stakeholders and critics. Bayer has been around for more than 150 years and knows a few things about corporate social responsibility that Monsanto doesn’t. For the merger to succeed, Bayer CEO Baumann needs to avoid the mistakes that Daimler CEO Jürgen Schrempp made in 2005. In order to make the new Bayer “Mr. Nice Guy” in the market place, Baumann needs to be “Mr. Bad Guy” in the executive suites in St. Louis, Mo., where Monsanto is headquartered. Even though Monsanto will probably disappear as a brand name, this itself will not be enough to restore trust. Will the size of the new Bayer stifle competition? Bayer and Monsanto have quite different corporate profiles by segment and region. While Bayer’s North American revenue only makes up a quarter of its total, Monsanto’s revenue is 82 per cent based in the Americas. Bayer’s core segments are fungicides, herbicides and insecticides, while Monsanto’s are seeds for corn, soybeans, and vegetables. The two companies complement each other, but the combination of their operations will not itself lead to market dominance either regionally or in particular market segments. What is more worrying for competition is that the Bayer-Monsanto deal is part of a recent wave of mergers in the crop science industry that leaves only a handful of companies competing in major market segments. In the U.S., Bayer-Monsanto and Dupont-Dow will control three-quarters of the market for corn seeds. Bayer-Monsanto will control a third of the world’s herbicides market, Adama-Syngenta another quarter and Dupont-Dow another fifth. These three companies will also control two-thirds of the global insecticides markets. Lack of competition is bad news for farmers. Click here for a full-length version of this interview.

Cruising through the channels I came across Larry King, sporting his trademark suspenders, interviewing a guest on a program called Larry King Special Report. I knew Larry had left CNN and was hosting a couple of interview shows on the RT (Russia Today) and Hulu cable channels, but I don’t get these, so what was I watching? It soon became apparent that this was not a legitimate interview show, but rather an “infomercial.” King was shilling for a dietary supplement, Omega XL, going on about how it provides miraculous joint pain relief. His “guest” was Dr. Sharon McQuillan, waxing poetic about how she recommends Omega XL to all her patients to “help protect their hearts, preserve their heart and vascular health.” Larry, who has a history of heart disease, asked McQuillan how Omega XL can reduce the risk of heart attacks. She answered that “30 years of studies have shown the benefits of omega 3s.” That is true, but totally misleading since none of those studies used this product! Some studies have indeed shown that eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids may lower the risk of death from heart attack. And trials with supplements containing DHA and EPA, the two major omega-3 fats found in fish, have suggested a benefit for people who have previously suffered a heart attack. For example, in a placebo-controlled trial, patients taking an omega-3 supplement were 6 per cent less likely to suffer a decline in heart function as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) than those taking a placebo. That’s not a very significant difference. And they were taking four grams a day! Omega XL contains 6.3 mg of EPA and 4.9 mg of DHA, roughly 1/400th the dose that showed a minor benefit in the study! In other words, there is no basis to suggest that the EPA and DHA in this supplement can help protect the heart. Contrary to the image projected by the “interview,” Omega XL is not a DHA/EPA supplement. It is an extract of the “green-lipped mussel” found in New Zealand and is a complex mix of many compounds. There is some evidence for an anti-inflammatory effect, and for possible benefit in arthritis and perhaps even in asthma. But McQuillan’s enthusiastic recommendation for protecting the heart is not supported by evidence. As is revealed in the credits after the show, McQuillan, who is a GP specializing in “integrative, regenerative and aesthetic medicine,” was paid for her appearance. Of course Larry King is not the only celebrity who has lent his or her name to promoting a product. In fact, back in 2000 when Larry was still on CNN, he featured Olympic champions Dorothy Hamill and Bruce Jenner as guests. Larry King Live was certainly not an “infomercial,” it was one of the most respected and most watched interview shows on TV. Both guests were there to talk about the painkilling drug Vioxx. “My doctor prescribed Vioxx for me, and it’s as if I’ve been given a new life,” Hamill told King. “It’s just, it’s been amazing. I feel 20 years younger.” Jenner, still Bruce at the time, had won the decathlon at the 1976 Montreal Olympics but subsequently had knee surgeries and shoulder problems that had left pain that resolved with Vioxx. Both athletes were paid by Merck, the drug’s manufacturer, something that was made clear on the program. Neither Jenner nor Hamill could have known at the time that Merck was already investigating an apparent increase in heart attacks among people taking Vioxx. Four years later the drug would be recalled for that very reason, precipitating some 35,000 lawsuits and payments of over $4 billion by Merck to the plaintiffs. Were there people who were prompted by Hamill and Jenner’s appearance to ask their doctors to prescribe Vioxx? Presumably. Did some suffer adverse consequences? Who knows? But a supposedly objective interview show is no place for paid celebrity product endorsers. There is also the thorny question of television ads for prescription drugs featuring celebrities. Legendary golfer Arnold Palmer and basketball star Chris Bosh have had health problems that required treatment with an anticoagulant and in a TV ad they sing the praises of Xarelto (rivaroxaban), an effective oral “blood thinner.” Although this is a prescription drug, and the side effects and risks are outlined, the ad still indirectly suggests taking medical advice from a celebrity who has no relevant expertise. Kim Kardashian West, who is famous for being famous, promotes Diclegis, a morning sickness relief pill for pregnant women. While the drug is effective, Kim’s lighthearted tome on Instagram, “OMG have you heard about this?” prompted the FDA to censure her for not including risk information or limitations for the use of the drug, something she subsequently corrected. Was there any damage done? Who knows? Wayne Gretzky is the most prolific scorer in hockey history and as classy an athlete as they come. Did he really need to get involved with Myo-T12, a body building supplement that claims to inhibit the action of myostatin, a protein that signals muscles to stop growing? While there is some interesting science behind this fertilized egg yolk powder, there are no studies demonstrating that it can safely and effectively build muscle. However, the Great One’s one-year deal with the manufacturer did bulk up his bank account by $150,000, a sum I suspect he does not need. He is rich enough. Talking about rich, recall the lyrics from If I were a Rich Man from Fiddler on the Roof: “And it won’t make one bit of difference if I answer right or wrong, when you’re rich they think you really know.” That seems to embody the philosophy of advertisers who hire celebrities. But no matter how rich you are, you can’t buy knowledge. joe.schwarcz@mcgill.ca Joe Schwarcz is director of McGill University’s Office for Science & Society (mcgill.ca/oss).

Now, the hard work begins to make the combination a success. Bayer-Monsanto follows agrichemical deals between Dow Chemical and DuPont, as well as ChemChina-Syngenta. Completion of the merger would leave three companies with more than 75 percent of the global market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg -- a level of concentration sure to set off alarm bells with regulators. The combination also faces a public backlash in Germany over concerns about Monsanto's genetically modified seeds and weedkiller -- both abhorred in Bayer's home country. VIDEOS TOP JOBS In a sign of how protracted the regulatory review of the new seed and crop-chemical giant will be, the companies said they will seek approval in 30 jurisdictions around the world -- including the U.S., European Union, Canada and Brazil -- and don't expect to complete the deal until the end of 2017. Monsanto shares closed 20 percent below the offer price on Wednesday over concerns from investors that the deal might not succeed. German companies have a checkered history with mega acquisitions abroad, including Daimler's ill-fated purchase of Chrysler in 1998 for $43 billion -- a stand-out symbol for failed ventures overseas. Another reminder of the difficulties such deals face came just this week when Linde's talks to merge with U.S. rival Praxair fell apart over squabbling about the role of the German company's Munich home base following a combination. Still, mid-tier companies in the country have been forging ahead with foreign acquisitions that garner less attention. ZF Friedrichshafen has done so well with the $12.9 billion purchase of U.S. parts supplier TRW Automotive Holdings last year that it's already on the hunt for new targets. ZF is currently bidding to buy Sweden's Haldex. And Bayer has proven itself as one of the most aggressive acquirers among German companies. In addition to the gutsy Monsanto bid, it won fierce bidding wars to buy rival Schering AG, creating the country's largest drugmaker in 2006, and Merck & Co.'s consumer unit in 2014. Here are five other deals that Bayer and Monsanto might want to study as they move forward. - Deutsche Telekom-VoiceStream Wireless Corp. (2000 - $50.5 billion): This deal at the dawn of the new millennium gave the German telephone company a splashy entry into the U.S. wireless market. But it also came with headaches, as mobile phone improvements were taking off and competition between carriers was fierce. Deutsche Telekom has only recently begun to turn around what became T-Mobile USA Inc. after a sale to Sprint Corp. was blocked by regulators. - Daimler-Chrysler Corp. (1998 - $43 billion): Considered one of the most disastrous deals in corporate history, there was a huge culture clash between the German manufacturer of the luxury Mercedes Benz brand and the U.S. maker of mass market cars like the Chrysler Sebring that led to this merger's downfall. After nine years spent trying to make things work, the automakers' marriage broke down: Daimler sold Chrysler to Cerberus Capital Management in 2007 for just $7.4 billion. - HeidelbergCement-Hanson Ltd. (2007 - $18 billion): This deal was the largest in the building materials industry that year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One looming problem that might not have been on HeidelbergCement's radar when it bought its U.K. competitor: the housing market was about to crash under the weight of subprime mortgages, leading to a slump in construction projects and stripping the company of its investment-grade credit rating. HeidelbergCement didn't return to major deal-making until 2015, when it agreed to buy Italcementi for 3.7 billion euros ($4.2 billion.) - Merck KGaA-Sigma-AldrichCorp. ($16 billion): A happier story: Family-controlled Merck continued a tradition of acquisitions with the purchase of the U.S. firm to expand in chemicals used in research labs and pharmaceutical manufacturing, as well as reducing its dependence on drug development. The German company last month reported second-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates, buoyed by the acquisition of the pharmaceutical equipment maker. Before that it successfully acquired and integrated Millipore Corp., a supplier of drug development equipment for biotechnology companies in 2010, and AZ Electronic Materials SA in 2013 to strengthen its specialty chemicals to the electronics industry. » Next page...

My dad will start Keytruda regimen on Friday, $15,000 per infusion, once every three weeks indefinitely.” The high cost of pharmaceuticals had hit home! Her 61-year-old father, Jim McCallister, who lives in Spartanburg, S.C., had been diagnosed with a melanoma discovered during a routine skin exam a few weeks earlier. It had spread to his lungs. Doctors recommended the drug, which uses the body’s immune system to attack cancer cells and has showed promise in treating aggressive melanomas. McCallister’s employer-provided insurance is paying for most of his treatment, and the family is looking into Merck’s co-pay program. In the meantime, McCallister faces several thousand dollars of out-of-pocket costs. McCallister may be lucky cost-wise. But the fact remains: Somebody is paying for the high cost of Keytruda and other new drugs coming on the market. Sausser said her dad asked if insurance would cover the drug. “The doctor told him they would find some way.” That’s the nub of the dilemma. For many like McCallister, there may be help, often from the drug companies themselves in the form of patient assistance plans. Remember drug company AstraZeneca’s ads for some of its costly drugs: “AstraZeneca may be able to help”? Sometimes state or local government programs, private charities, nonprofit agencies, or coupon programs help patients pay for their drugs. Patients who can’t get help from any of those sources often go without. None of the assistance programs, however, attack the underlying prices for the drugs, which pharmaceutical makers can set according to what the market will bear. They can pretty much do whatever they want with little push back from those who end up paying the bills – governments, insurers and patients. The U.S. has no cost controls, and government doesn’t negotiate drug prices the way many other countries do. So the price of commonly prescribed drugs like the EpiPen, a shot that stops life-threatening allergic reactions, has risen to more than $600 for two pens. In 2009 two pens cost $100. The price for Abilify, an antipsychotic, has risen 113 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the cholesterol-lowering drug Crestor has climbed 103 percent over the same time period, according to The Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, a group of employers, insurers and unions that are trying to raise public awareness of high drug prices. That helps explain why Medicare recently reported its spending on prescription drugs increased more than 17 percent in 2014 even though the number of claims from the program’s 38 million beneficiaries rose only 3 percent. Medicare’s prescription drug law was never meant to pay all a person’s drug expenses. This year once a beneficiary and her drug plan have paid $3,310 for medicines, she reaches the coverage gap where she must pay the cost of most of her drugs. If she spends, out of her own pocket, another $4,850 for drugs this calendar year, she qualifies for catastrophic coverage and pays only 5 percent of all her remaining drugs for the year. The trouble is that with prices so high, it’s easy to end up in the coverage gap paying out-of-pocket. Even protection offered by catastrophic coverage may not be enough. That’s especially true for people taking high-priced specialty drugs. In 2013, about 3 million people were in this predicament. “Not a lot of people pay above the threshold, but those who do can pay through the nose,” says Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. Escalating drug prices affect everyone – even those not taking expensive drugs or not on Medicare. High drug prices affect all insurance premiums sooner or later. Not long ago I spotted a letter to the editor in USA Today from Heather Block, age 53 who has Stage 4 breast cancer. She was calling for patients to organize and build a network to help craft solutions for the problem of skyrocketing drug prices. I talked to Block about this. Her zeal and interest in organizing patients reminded me of the early days of the consumer movement in the 1960s when citizens organized to pass legislation to make the marketplace safer and more fair. With drugs, Block says, it’s hard to organize people because of drug assistance programs that take the sting out of prices and make patients less willing to work against the companies, the presence of disease advocacy groups funded by the pharmaceutical industry and a general reluctance to speak up for fear of jeopardizing their own health and survival. She’s asking for consumers to share their stories at this email: h3ath3rblock@gmail.com. What problems are you having paying for prescription drugs? Write to Trudy at trudy.lieberman@gmail.com.

LATEST MEDICAL NEWS Meeting Coverage HIV Drug Fails in Small MS Trial Casts doubt on novel theory of MS etiology MedpageToday savesaved by John Gever John Gever Managing Editor, MedPage Today September 15, 2016 LONDON -- A drug trial intended to validate a novel theory of multiple sclerosis -- that it has its roots in ancient retroviral sequences embedded in the human genome -- came up short, researchers said here. Patients treated with the HIV drug raltegravir (Isentress), which could suppress expression of retroviral elements, showed no differences in brain MRI lesion counts after treatment compared with a pre-treatment baseline phase, reported Monica Marta, MD, PhD, of Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry. "The overall results for both primary and secondary outcomes are negative, with no apparent statistically significant outcome or trends for the treatment phase," she said in a poster presentation at the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis annual meeting. But the study doesn't disprove the so-called HERV (human endogenous retrovirus) theory of MS, due to the trial's many limitations, and testing of another group's treatment approach based on the theory is proceeding. This line of research originated with some of the first analyses of the fully sequenced human genome, which showed that a surprising amount -- up to 8% of the entire sequence -- appeared to encode retroviral proteins such as helicase and integrase enzymes like those found in HIV. These were initially considered "junk DNA" but subsequent studies showed that these sequences could be expressed under the right circumstances. Some of these HERV proteins have been isolated from MS brain lesions. As well, links have been documented between Epstein-Barr virus infection (itself linked previously with MS risk) and induction of HERV expression. And, separately, it has been noted that individuals with established HIV show a markedly lower rate of MS than the general population. Some researchers speculated that it is not the HIV infection that is responsible for the apparent protective effect, but rather -- since these observations were made in developed countries -- from antiretroviral treatment. All of these observations have come together to suggest that therapies aimed at HERV expression might affect MS risk and/or the disease course. The Barts and the London group, headed by Gavin Giovannoni, MBBCh, PhD, obtained support from Merck, which agreed to provide raltegravir for the 20-patient, 6-month study. When the trial was announced, Giovannoni told MedPage Today that it had not been easy to find support from HIV drug manufacturers because none of them have a presence in MS therapeutics and were therefore mostly uninterested in committing significant funds to such a trial. That, as much as anything, dictated the choice of drug and the size and scope of the trial, he said. The 20 patients, who were required to show evidence of MRI lesion activity at baseline, first underwent a 3-month observation period during which additional MRI brain scans were performed monthly. They then received raltegravir at 400 mg twice daily for 3 months while continuing to receive monthly scans. The primary outcome measure was the number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions seen after treatment versus the observational period. Secondary outcomes included new or enlarging T2 lesions and clinical measures of relapses and disability. No differences or even encouraging trends were seen between the treatment and observational phases, either for the primary outcome or for any of the secondary endpoints, Marta reported. Co-principal investigator Julian Gold, MBBS, of Queen Mary University here, told MedPage Today that the study was probably doomed by its limitations: the choice of raltegravir versus other anti-HIV agents as well as its use as monotherapy (HIV patients typically receive multidrug combinations) may not have achieved actual suppression of HERV elements. The small number of patients and short study duration also limited the researchers' ability to detect treatment effects. Asked what the next steps could now be, given these negative results, he replied, "I don't know." Gold said the lucrative market for current MS drugs appeared to be dissuading companies from searching for alternatives that get to the condition's actual cause. He pointed to another trial he is involved with in motor neuron disease, for which a major pharma company is providing substantial support. That has not existed for the use of anti-HIV drugs, he said, even though a secondary analysis of the raltegravir trial data confirmed that HERV protein expression correlated with MS lesion counts. "It's really a shame," he said. But this is not the only test of the HERV theory underway. Another group based in Switzerland has also been pursuing a direct anti-HERV strategy, employing a monoclonal antibody called GNbAC1 that binds to a particular expressed HERV protein. Sponsored by Geneva-based GeNeuro SA, a phase 2b study is now underway and has enrolled half of its projected 260 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, the firm said in a press release. As in the raltegravir trial, its primary outcome measure is T1 lesion counts assessed over 6 months. However, secondary outcomes will include clinical measures to be evaluated at 48 weeks. Multiple drug doses will be tested as well. Participants must have had at least one relapse in the past year or show at least one gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesion in the past 3 months. A pilot trial of GNbAC1, reported in spring of 2014, found that the drug stabilized lesion counts in patients with established MS. Giovannoni has conducted research on behalf of Merck Serono (unrelated to Merck). Other investigators in the raltegravir trial reported no competing interests. 2016-09-15T13:30:00-0400 Primary Source ECTRIMS Source Reference: Marta M, et al "Phase 2 baseline versus treatment clinical trial of the HIV drug raltegravir in patients with active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis: The INSPIRE study results" ECTRIMS 2016; Abstract P447. 0 comments Next More in Meeting Coverage Two RA Agents Similar in Head-to-Head Trial Novel HCV Drug Combo Shines in CKD Patients AHA: Does a C-Section Delivery Put Baby at Risk for Obesity?

HbA1c improved by 0.7 percentage points with the lower 5 mg dose and by 0.8 percentage points with the higher dose compared with placebo on a background of metformin and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor sitagliptin (Januvia), both significant at P<0.001 for the primary endpoint at 26 weeks. Those were "clinically meaningful reductions," Brett Lauring, MD, PhD, of drug developer Merck in Kenilworth, N.J., and colleagues reported here at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes meeting. Secondary endpoints also showed significant differences from placebo for the following: Weight was lower by 2.0 and 1.7 kg, or 4.4 and 3.7 lb, for the 5-mg and 15-mg dose groups, respectively More participants reached the less than 7% HbA1c goal at week 26 (32.1% lower dose and 39.9% higher dose versus 17.0%) Fasting plasma glucose was lower by 1.4 and 1.7 mmol/L, 25 and 31 mg/dL, respectively Systolic blood pressure came in 2.9 and 3.9 mm Hg lower with the two doses, respectively With three SGLT2 inhibitors already available, one member of the audience questioned why develop yet another. "With more agents, there's more choice on the marketplace for patients," answered Lauring, who added that differences have emerged among agents in some classes, like the DPP-4 drugs, and it's possible that the large cardiovascular outcomes trial program with ertugliflozin will be required to see if there is such a difference in the SGLT2s too given the "pretty compelling efficacy with this agent." Also, a fixed dose combination is attractive for patients, he added, having noted that "SGLT2 and DPP-4 inhibitors have differing, complementary mechanisms of action, and additive efficacy is expected." Clifford J. Bailey, PhD, of Aston University in Birmingham, England, called the findings "consistent with effects of other members of class" but cautioned that it's "not possible to make specific comparisons with other members of the class in other studies as populations and other aspects of the studies will differ." The VERTIS SITA2 trial included 263 type 2 diabetes patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1c of 7.0% to 10.5%) on metformin dosed at 1,500 mg/day or greater and sitagliptin at 100 mg/day. They were randomized to the addition of ertugliflozin at either 5 or 15 mg or placebo for 26 weeks. Adverse event rates were not higher overall with the drug than placebo, but there were more events deemed treatment related with both doses (10.9% and 14.4% versus 8.5%) and more discontinuations with the lower dose only (5 cases, 3.2%, versus one in the other groups, 0.7% each). Of the events of interest based on what has been seen with other SGLT2 inhibitors, there was a fairly high rate of genital mycotic infection in women (12.7% with the higher dose and 8.0% with the lower dose versus 1.9% with placebo, P<0.05) and a similar trend in men (3.7% and 4.9% versus 0.0%). Urinary tract infections occurred in 4.6% of the higher dose, 2.6% of the lower dose, and 2.0% of the placebo groups. Symptomatic hypoglycemia occurred in just 0.7% of the higher dose group but 3.8% of the lower dose and 2.6% of the placebo groups. "SGLT2 inhibitors are known to result in transient reductions in eGFR," Lauring noted. "And that's what we saw. There were reductions on order of 2 mL/min, which returned to baseline by week 26." There have also been associations with increases in LDL cholesterol but in the study "we didn't observe meaningful differences." Two other pivotal trials in the VERTIS series also reported positive results recently, in presentations at the American Diabetes Association meeting this year: VERTIS Mono with ertugliflozin as monotherapy against placebo and VERTIS Factorial, showing greater reductions in A1C with the ertugliflozin-sitagliptin combination than with ertugliflozin or sitagliptin alone. Merck and Pfizer have announced plans to file for FDA approval of ertugliflozin and two fixed-dose combinations (ertugliflozin plus sitagliptin and ertugliflozin plus metformin) by the end of this year. The study was conducted and funded by Merck and Pfizer. Lauring and all but one of the co-authors were employees of Merck or Pfizer. Reviewed by Henry A.

Over the 2015-2022 forecast period, the South-East Asia T2DM therapeutics market is expected to increase in value at a CAGR of 7.1%, from $1.7 billion to over $2.7 billion. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Therapeutics in South-East Asia Markets to 2022 states that as well as the rapidly expanding prevalence population in South-East Asia, market growth will be driven by the increased uptake of recently approved and emerging branded T2DM therapeutics, in favor of lower-cost generic products. One of the publishers analysts states that: Unmet needs relating to patient convenience and ease of use will be addressed significantly over the forecast period. Higher levels of innovation are apparent in the early-stage pipeline, which may lead to considerable improvements beyond the existing range of products, in terms of safety and efficacy in the long term. In terms of recently approved therapeutics, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT-2 inhibitors have already achieved strong market uptake and are all expected to increase their market shares over the forecast period. In comparison with many previously marketed therapies, these new products provide improved weight control and lowered hypoglycemia risk. In terms of late-stage pipeline products with the potential to change the treatment paradigm, six candidates stand out as offering superior safety, efficacy, and patient compliance. These are Novo Nordisk's NN-9535 (semaglutide subcutaneous formulation) and OG-217SC (semaglutide oral formulation) and Eli Lilly's Trulicity (dulaglutide), which are GLP-1 receptor agonists; Merck's ertugliflozin and Theracos's bexagliflozin, which are SGLT-2 inhibitors; and Merck's omarigliptin, which is a DPP-4 inhibitor.

The drug “controlled the most common form of the disease better than a rival’s medicine and worked against another form of MS for which there is no approved treatment,” reported Reuters. Investigators in charge of this study used Merck’s Rebif as the comparison drug in this trial to test its efficacy against Ocrevus for patients diagnosed with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). RMS patients exhibited no evidence of disease activity over the course of two years, according to Roche’s statement. A combination of clinical and MRI outcomes were used to test the efficacy of this drug throughout the study period. The endpoint was achieved when an RMS patient didn’t experience relapses, progression of disability, or have new or enlarging MRI lesions. Furthermore, PPMS patients didn’t display any signs of disease progression at 47 percent higher rate when compared to placebo, wrote Reuters. “With no approved treatment options, primary progressive MS remains a challenge for physicians and people with MS,” said Xavier Montalban, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Neurology and Neuroimmunology at Vall d’Hebron University Hospital, Research Institute and Cemcat, Barcelona, Spain. “Ocrevus significantly impacted three key disability measurements, which further highlight its clinical significance in people with primary progressive MS,” Montalban added. PPMS has no approved treatment yet so this data could bolster Roche’s case that it has a blockbuster on its hands. Ocrevus sales could reach about $3.8 billion by 2022. The company will present more detailed data this week at the 32nd Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis in London, England.

In a phase III study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Shingrix showed a 90% efficacy in adults aged 70 and older that was maintained for four years. Importantly, Shingrix demonstrated a greater level of protection for elderly patients than the rival Merck & Co vaccine. Shingles is a painful rash that develops as a result of the reactivation of the latent chickenpox virus. Complications from the virus intensify with age and can include scarring, vision problems and chronic pain. A person's risk for shingles increases sharply after 50 years of age. “If approved, this candidate vaccine could be an important tool for the prevention of shingles and the pain associated with it, which would significantly impact the health and quality of life of so many people,” said senior vice president Emmanuel Hanon. GSK said it expects to start submitting regulatory applications for its 50+ vaccine later this year. Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said the publication of a more detailed analysis was “reassuring” and confirmed its view that it could be a “class leading vaccine”. The broker said it expected first revenues for the product by 2018. Cantor forecast a prospective dividend yield of 4.8%, maintaining its “hold” recommendation and target price of 1700p. --UPDATE ADD BROKER COMMENT-- Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version Josh Allsopp Register here to be notified of future GSK Company articles View full GSK profile GlaxoSmithKline plc Timeline Video October 27 2016 GlaxoSmithKline shares are outperforming AstraZeneca Newswire October 27 2016 GlaxoSmithKline medicine goes down well in City Article October 24 2016 GSK seeks US green light for shingles vaccine Article October 20 2016 A solid, defensive play for yield investors, but just what could sink GSK?

Email Print Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Tweet Home â News Pain care lobby gave $3.5M in Ohio as opioid deaths climbed Metro Creative Connection By Julie Carr Smyth, The Associated Press Posted: 09/16/16, 5:16 PM EDT | Updated: on 09/16/2016 # Comments COLUMBUS >> As Ohio’s overdose epidemic has climbed toward a record high, an army of lobbyists representing makers of prescription painkillers and their allies poured more than $3.5 million into Ohio political coffers. Pharmaceutical companies and allied groups belonging to the Pain Care Forum lobbying collective gave nearly $2.5 million to federal candidates from Ohio from 2006 through 2015, according to data analyzed by The Associated Press and the Center for Public Integrity. State-level giving of more than $1 million was directed at candidates of both parties, including governors, attorneys general, Ohio Supreme Court justices and legislative leaders, and committee chairs in power positions over Ohio health law. Republican Party committees received about $137,000, while Democratic ones got $41,000. The investigation by AP and CPI found that the Pain Care Forum worked in Washington over the past decade to quietly derail efforts to curb U.S. consumption of pain-killing drugs, such as OxyContin, by promoting the vital role of prescription painkillers in Americans’ lives. That went hand in hand with a 50-state strategy. Advertisement Participating drug companies, associations and alliances also have other business before Ohio’s Legislature, but a steady flow of contributions from companies employing an average of 37 Ohio lobbyists at the Statehouse has meant their interests remain well represented when pain care issues arise. A huge chunk of the campaign cash identified through the analysis went to then-House Speaker John Boehner, of southwest Ohio, who received about $875,000 over the decade, according to the data. Among state candidates, Republican Gov. John Kasich topped the list, with about $46,000. Top state givers among forum members were Pfizer, Abbott Labs, Merck and Johnson & Johnson. Kasich has championed a host of remedies to Ohio’s opioid problem, beginning with creation of the Governor’s Cabinet Opiate Action Team within days of his 2011 inauguration. He has worked with state leaders since then to extend access to treatments and increase availability of the overdose drug naloxone and launched an education campaign for schoolchildren called Start Talking. A glimmer of good news: Painkiller prescriptions in Ohio have fallen from 11,261,528 in 2013 to 9,955,858 last year, according to the data. Despite all that, accidental drug deaths continued to skyrocket. Ohio overdose deaths have gone up annually over the past decade, from 1,515 in 2006 to 2,744 in 2015, according to the analysis. That 81 percent increase is the seventh highest among U.S. states over the period, the analysis found. When a new record was announced last month, Kasich said it made him “feel terrible.” He stressed that the state is making progress. After Kasich, the second highest recipient of Pain Care Forum contributions was state Sen. Dave Burke, a Marysville Republican and pharmacist. Burke received about $32,000 from forum participants from 2006 to 2015, according to the data, which represent a minimum figure for contributions. Burke chairs the Senate Medicaid committee, services on the budget-writing Finance committee and helped champion Ohio’s recently enacted medical marijuana law. Dozens of state lawmakers — including every House Speaker and Senate President and chairs of relevant committees — also received donations. Subscribe to Home Delivery and SAVE!

(TSX VENTURE: HTL) ("Hamilton Thorne" or the "Company"), a leading provider of precision laser devices and advanced image analysis systems for the Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) and developmental biology research markets today announced that it completed the acquisition of 100% of the operating assets of Massachusetts-based Embryotech Laboratories, Inc. for total consideration of approximately US$7.25 million. Hamilton Thorne estimates this transaction will be accretive to earnings in 2016 and is expected to add over US$5 million of revenue and more than US$1.5 million to EBITDA in calendar year 2017. Key Benefits of the Transaction: Significantly accretive to revenue, EBITDA, and net income Diversifies and increases recurring revenue to an estimated 40% of sales Expected to increase 2017 revenue by over 50% (vs. last 12 months actuals) Expected to increase 2017 EBITDA by over 100% (vs. last 12 months actuals) Establishes Hamilton Thorne as a leader in providing quality control products and services Opportunity to expand product offering in international markets Minimal dilution by using cash on hand and new 5-year term debt at 4.25% interest Sets the stage for additional acquisition opportunities "Embryotech is the acknowledged US leader in providing quality control services and testing assays to the ART community. In addition to acquiring a great brand, we will be strengthening the financial performance of Hamilton Thorne. Not only will this acquisition increase our scale, we anticipate that it will diversify our revenue base from a predominantly one-time sale of instruments model to a projected 40% recurring revenues from the sales of services and consumables," said David Wolf, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hamilton Thorne. "Combining Embryotech with Hamilton Thorne's portfolio of products and services provides Embryotech with increased financial strength, marketing expertise, and access to the international markets served by Hamilton Thorne. This relationship will bring greater resources to support our current operations and growth plans as well as provide greater opportunities to our employees," said Eric Dorman, Embryotech's President. Mr. Dorman will continue to lead Embryotech Laboratories as its President. Transaction Details Pursuant to the transaction, Hamilton Thorne paid US$6.075 million in cash and issued 7,759,154 common shares of Hamilton Thorne at a deemed issuance price of Cdn$0.198 per share. The aggregate share component of US$1.175 million was calculated based on a twenty-day weighted-average stock price prior to agreement date and the average US to Canada foreign exchange rate for the prior five days. The share consideration will be placed in escrow pending final calculation of certain closing adjustments and to satisfy any possible indemnity claims.  Bloom Burton & Co. Limited acted as financial advisor to Hamilton Thorne.

The Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 4.25% per annum, includes an escalating amortization schedule, and matures five years from the closing date.

(ACRX) was up more than 9% on Thursday, following positive results for ARX-04 in the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in post-operative study patients, including elderly patients and those with organ impairment, in its third phase III registration trial, dubbed SAP303. The primary objective of the SAP303 trial was to study the safety of ARX-04 in the post-operative management of moderate-to-severe acute pain. According to the trial results, majority of patients - including the majority of higher-risk patients - did not experience any adverse events. The company reported positive results from a phase III study, known as SAP301, which evaluated ARX-04 for the short-term treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain following ambulatory abdominal surgery in September 2015. Positive results were reported from a phase III trial, dubbed SAP302, which assessed ARX-04 in patients who presented to the emergency room with moderate-to-severe acute pain associated with trauma or injury last month. Now that the results of all phase III studies are out, the company intends to submit a new drug application for ARX-04 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically supervised settings with the FDA by the end of 2016. ACRX closed Thursday's trading at $3.60, up 9.76%. Shares of Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AERI) touched an all-time high of $34.69 on Thursday, following positive phase III results of its second glaucoma drug candidate Roclatan. Roclatan is a fixed dose combination of Aerie's most advanced drug candidate Rhopressa and Latanoprost, a widely prescribed prostaglandin analog for glaucoma. In the first phase III trial of Roclatan, known as Mercury 1, Roclatan demonstrated statistical superiority over Rhopressa and Latanoprost. Another phase III trial of Roclatan, named Mercury 2, is underway, and topline data readout from this trial is expected in the second quarter of 2017. The company filed its NDA for Rhopressa last week. AERI touched an all-time high of $34.69 on Thursday, before closing the day's trading at $30.61, up 44.87%. Amgen's (AMGN) global phase II trial of Erenumab has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in monthly migraine days compared with placebo in patients with chronic migraine. The study included 667 patients who were randomized to receive either subcutaneous placebo or subcutaneous Erenumab 70 mg once or 140 mg once a month. At week 12, there was a reduction of 50 percent or more in number of monthly migraine days in 40 percent and 41 percent (70 mg and 140 mg doses, respectively) of individuals in the Erenumab groups compared to just 24 percent of those receiving placebo. Results from phase III studies investigating Erenumab in episodic migraine are expected later this year. Erenumab is being co-developed by Amgen and Novartis (NVS). Amgen retains commercialization rights to Erenumab in the U.S., Canada and Japan while Novartis holds rights in Europe and rest of world. AMGN closed Thursday's trading at $172.64, up 1.47%. The FDA has approved Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s (ARLZ) once-daily YOSPRALA for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients at risk for aspirin-induced gastric ulcers. YOSPRALA is the only prescription fixed-dose combination of aspirin, an anti-platelet agent, and omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in the U.S. Daily aspirin is a standard of care for secondary cardiovascular event prevention, but gastrointestinal symptoms are often cited as the reason patients stop taking this important therapy. YOSPRALA is designed to support both cardio- and gastro-protection for at-risk patients. ARLZ closed Thursday's trading 5.13% higher at $5.74. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.'s (BMRN) Marketing Authorization Application for Brineura to treat children with CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease, has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. Accordingly, the review process has been started, with the opinion of EMA's Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP), and a decision from the European Commission anticipated by the third quarter of 2017. In the U.S., the NDA for Brineura is under FDA review, and a decision is expected on April 27, 2017. BMRN closed Thursday's trading at $95.38, up 0.08%. Cara Therapeutics Inc. (CARA) has initiated a phase 2b trial of an oral tablet formulation of CR845 for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis. The study is designed to evaluate three tablet strengths of CR845, 1.0 mg, 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg, dosed twice a day over an eight-week treatment period in approximately 330 osteoarthritis patients experiencing moderate-to-severe pain. The company expects to report top-line data from this trial during the first half of 2017. CARA closed Thursday's trading at $6.23, up 2.30%. Merck, (MRK) in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (PFE), on Thursday announced that a phase III study of Ertugliflozin, an investigational oral drug for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, met its primary endpoint. In the study, dubbed VERTIS SITA2, 5 mg and 15 mg daily doses of Ertugliflozin showed significantly greater reductions in A1C* of 0.69 percent and 0.76 percent, respectively, compared with placebo, when added to patients on a background of JANUVIA (100 mg/day) and stable Metformin (?1500 mg/day). *A1C is an average measure of blood glucose over the past two to three months. MRK closed Thursday's trading at $62.38, up 1.68%. Shares of Novavax Inc. (NVAX) plunged more than 83% in extended trading on Thursday, following the failure of its phase III trial of respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate. In the trial, dubbed Resolve, the company's respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate ((RSV F Vaccine) did not demonstrate efficacy in the prevention of moderate-severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (RSV msLRTD), as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms. The secondary objective of demonstrating efficacy of the RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV (RSV ARD) was also not achieved. NVAX closed Thursday's trading at $8.34, up 0.36%. In after hours, the stock was down 83.21% to $1.40. Otonomy Inc. (OTIC) has successfully completed an open-label phase 3b clinical trial of OTIPRIO in 501 pediatric patients with a history of otitis media requiring tympanostomy tube placement surgery. Otiprio was approved by the FDA last December for the treatment of pediatric patients with bilateral otitis media with effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement, and was commercially launched in March of this year. The drug has generated sales of $89 thousand year-to-date. The phase 3b trial of OTIPRIO involved a broader pediatric patient population than the previous phase III trials by including patients undergoing common concurrent surgeries and patients without bilateral effusion on the day of surgery. OTIC closed Thursday's trading at $18.00, up 1.24%. TapImmune Inc. (TPIV.OB) is all set to implement a 1-for-12 reverse stock split of its common stock in preparation for its proposed uplisting to the NASDAQ Capital Market. The reverse stock split will become effective on September 16, 2016. TPIV.OB closed Thursday's trading at $0.43, down 1.15%.

Another phase III trial of Roclatan, named Mercury 2, is underway, and topline data readout from this trial is expected in the second quarter of 2017. The company filed its NDA for Rhopressa last week. AERI touched an all-time high of $34.69 on Thursday, before closing the day's trading at $30.61, up 44.87%. Amgen's (AMGN) global phase II trial of Erenumab has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in monthly migraine days compared with placebo in patients with chronic migraine. The study included 667 patients who were randomized to receive either subcutaneous placebo or subcutaneous Erenumab 70 mg once or 140 mg once a month. At week 12, there was a reduction of 50 percent or more in number of monthly migraine days in 40 percent and 41 percent (70 mg and 140 mg doses, respectively) of individuals in the Erenumab groups compared to just 24 percent of those receiving placebo. Results from phase III studies investigating Erenumab in episodic migraine are expected later this year. Erenumab is being co-developed by Amgen and Novartis (NVS). Amgen retains commercialization rights to Erenumab in the U.S., Canada and Japan while Novartis holds rights in Europe and rest of world. AMGN closed Thursday's trading at $172.64, up 1.47%. The FDA has approved Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s (ARLZ) once-daily YOSPRALA for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients at risk for aspirin-induced gastric ulcers. YOSPRALA is the only prescription fixed-dose combination of aspirin, an anti-platelet agent, and omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in the U.S. Daily aspirin is a standard of care for secondary cardiovascular event prevention, but gastrointestinal symptoms are often cited as the reason patients stop taking this important therapy. YOSPRALA is designed to support both cardio- and gastro-protection for at-risk patients. ARLZ closed Thursday's trading 5.13% higher at $5.74. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.'s (BMRN) Marketing Authorization Application for Brineura to treat children with CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease, has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. Accordingly, the review process has been started, with the opinion of EMA's Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP), and a decision from the European Commission anticipated by the third quarter of 2017. In the U.S., the NDA for Brineura is under FDA review, and a decision is expected on April 27, 2017. BMRN closed Thursday's trading at $95.38, up 0.08%. Cara Therapeutics Inc. (CARA) has initiated a phase 2b trial of an oral tablet formulation of CR845 for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis. The study is designed to evaluate three tablet strengths of CR845, 1.0 mg, 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg, dosed twice a day over an eight-week treatment period in approximately 330 osteoarthritis patients experiencing moderate-to-severe pain. The company expects to report top-line data from this trial during the first half of 2017. CARA closed Thursday's trading at $6.23, up 2.30%. Merck, (MRK) in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (PFE), on Thursday announced that a phase III study of Ertugliflozin, an investigational oral drug for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, met its primary endpoint. In the study, dubbed VERTIS SITA2, 5 mg and 15 mg daily doses of Ertugliflozin showed significantly greater reductions in A1C* of 0.69 percent and 0.76 percent, respectively, compared with placebo, when added to patients on a background of JANUVIA (100 mg/day) and stable Metformin (=1500 mg/day). *A1C is an average measure of blood glucose over the past two to three months. MRK closed Thursday's trading at $62.38, up 1.68%. Shares of Novavax Inc. (NVAX) plunged more than 83% in extended trading on Thursday, following the failure of its phase III trial of respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate. In the trial, dubbed Resolve, the company's respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate ((RSV F Vaccine) did not demonstrate efficacy in the prevention of moderate-severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (RSV msLRTD), as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms. The secondary objective of demonstrating efficacy of the RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV (RSV ARD) was also not achieved. NVAX closed Thursday's trading at $8.34, up 0.36%. In after hours, the stock was down 83.21% to $1.40. Otonomy Inc. (OTIC) has successfully completed an open-label phase 3b clinical trial of OTIPRIO in 501 pediatric patients with a history of otitis media requiring tympanostomy tube placement surgery. Otiprio was approved by the FDA last December for the treatment of pediatric patients with bilateral otitis media with effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement, and was commercially launched in March of this year. The drug has generated sales of $89 thousand year-to-date. The phase 3b trial of OTIPRIO involved a broader pediatric patient population than the previous phase III trials by including patients undergoing common concurrent surgeries and patients without bilateral effusion on the day of surgery. OTIC closed Thursday's trading at $18.00, up 1.24%. TapImmune Inc. (TPIV.OB) is all set to implement a 1-for-12 reverse stock split of its common stock in preparation for its proposed uplisting to the NASDAQ Capital Market. The reverse stock split will become effective on September 16, 2016. TPIV.OB closed Thursday's trading at $0.43, down 1.15%. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 More Top Stories Tenants Vote To Remove Trump Name From Tower Sanders Joins Democratic Leadership But Remains An Independent Intel Spending $250 Million On Self-driving Tech Poll Shows Most Americans Want Trump To Compromise Senate Democrats Elect Chuck Schumer As New Minority Leader Major Averages Stuck On Opposite Sides Of Unchanged Line - U.S. Commentary Billionaire Wilbur Rumored For Trump Cabinet U.S. Homebuilder Confidence Holds Steady In November Stocks Turning In Lackluster Performance In Morning Trading - U.S. Commentary Domino's Completes World's First Pizza-by-drone Delivery AMC Bets On Funny Or Die Trump Denies Transition Disarray, Says Organized Process Taking Place U.S. Industrial Production Unexpectedly Comes In Flat In October U.S. Producer Prices Unexpectedly Hold Steady In October Paul Ryan Unanimously Re-nominated As House Speaker <<Previous        83 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Comeback Kid: Donald Trump Hugely Resilient In Business, Too Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Novartis Reportedly Considering Sale Of Alcon Eye Care Division Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Erickson Says Bankruptcy Court Approves Interim DIP Financing Sumitomo Electric Starts Operation Of CPV Power Generation Plant In Morocco Allianz Group Q3 Profit Climbs; Confirms 2016 Operating Profit Outlook NTT H1 Profit Up, Sales Down; Lifts FY Profit View, Cuts Sales Forecast Bechtle Q3 Profit Rises; Outlook For Year Adjusted Upwards Innogy 9-month Profit Declines; Confirms Forecast - Quick Facts SIG 4-Month Revenues Rise, LFL Revenues Down; CEO Stuart Mitchell Steps Down Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

Lean away from this obsessive focus on the professional class, Hillary. 09/15/2016 09:44 pm ET | Updated Sep 16, 2016 220 Jason Linkins Eat The Press Editor, The Huffington Post ASSOCIATED PRESS Sheryl Sandberg is one of the billionaires in the Clinton family orbit.  In case you missed the hot, speculative news about the 2016 presidential race, The Huffington Post’s Ben Walsh and Ryan Grim reported that sources close to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump are saying that he’d be inclined to appoint “eccentric” tech billionaire (and Trump endorser) Peter Thiel to the Supreme Court, where he’ll have a greater opportunity to ensure that America’s plutocrats are no longer bothered by nosy journalists or would-be trust-busters. But Hillary Clinton, she is not to be outdone! See, the former secretary of state knows tech billionaires, too (and not just disgraced ones), so if you want to get into a famous-friend-turned-potential-appointee fight, Clinton is ready to bring it. Here’s the skinny from Politico’s Morning Money newsletter: TREASURY WATCH: SANDBERG RISING — Early speculation held that Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg probably wouldn’t leave California to return to DC to serve as Treasury Secretary in a Clinton administration. That’s changed lately as MM hears more and more that she could return to be the first woman to lead Treasury. The left may not love her roots in the Bob Rubin wing of the Democratic Party but her star power and historic potential would probably blow away any opposition. Naturally, this is all mere scuttlebutt, though it is plausible scuttlebutt for a host of reasons. As noted above, Sandberg has “roots” in the Democratic Party, and yes, it’s from the part of the Democratic Party that everyone’s rightly skeptical about. Prior to her Facebook career, Sandberg was enmeshed with the folks who appeared on the Time magazine cover that has aged the poorest. Specifically, she served as chief of staff to Larry Summers during his tenure as secretary of the treasury, where he served under Bill Clinton.  But it’s not merely her place in the Clinton family orbit that makes this rumor feel just right. Sandberg is almost the perfect embodiment of Clinton’s larger economic policy portfolio ― indeed, the economic policy portfolio of the Democrats writ large ― which was ably summed up by author Thomas Frank in a March interview with HuffPost: “At some point, [the Democrats] decided that they weren’t all that interested in the concerns of working people anymore.” Rather, Frank says, they became fixated on “the concerns of the professional class, people with advanced degrees, people at the very top of our economic society.” On the stump, Clinton talks about the need to further diversify this professional class. Hey, let’s solve income inequality by ensuring that the corporate board of every military contractor in Washington’s suburban belt looks more like the United Colors of Benetton, guys! Installing Sandberg at the Treasury, and releasing all the “historic potential” that comes from being the first woman to head the agency, would be in keeping with that theme. That’s “Part One” of the plan, anyway. (”Part Three” is “everybody wins” and Part Two is a series of tastefully aligned question marks.) Sandberg, of course, is best known for being the author of Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, her insanely popular manifesto of next-wave feminist aspiration, which encourages women in the workforce (the “knowledge sector” workforce, anyway) to embolden themselves on the job and deconstruct all of the psychological barriers that these women have supposedly erected around themselves in order to surmount the more structural, sexist barriers erected by others (white men). The book, naturally, spawned the Lean In Foundation, which bills itself as “a nonprofit organization and online community dedicated to helping all women achieve their ambitions.” But while there is no shortage of positive testimonials available at the foundation’s website ― including one from Reese Witherspoon, who’s well-known to have only won a single Academy Award (and a Golden Globe and a BAFTA and a Screen Actors Guild Award) before Lean In came along ― it’s hard to actually quantify how well the Lean In brand is helping individual women in the workforce. However, it is easy to discern how well Lean In is serving its corporate sponsors. And it’s not exactly taking a courageous role in smashing the patriarchy. In a 2013 issue of The Baffler, journalist and author Susan Faludi undertook a deep examination of Lean In’s corporate partners in order to settle an argument: “Sandberg’s admirers would say that Lean In is using free-market beliefs to advance the cause of women’s equality. Her detractors would say (and have) that her organization is using the desire for women’s equality to advance the cause of the free market.”  Those detractors have a point!  As Faludi skillfully enumerates, Lean In’s corporate partners are legion and include big names, such as: “Chevron, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, Comcast, Bank of America and Citibank, Coca-Cola and Pepsico, AT&T and Verizon, Ford and GM, Pfizer and Merck & Co., Costco and Walmart, and, of course, Google and Facebook.” As Faludi notes: Never before have so many corporations joined a revolution. Virtually nothing is required of them — not even a financial contribution. “There are no costs associated with partnering with Lean In,” the organization’s manual assures. “We just ask that you publicly support our mission and actively promote our Community to your employees.” All the companies have to do is post their logo on Lean In’s “Platform Partners” page, along with a quote from one of their executives professing the company’s commitment to advancing women. But as Faludi goes on to report, many of these corporations’ commitments to “advancing women” look very suspect when you start to examine their sundry legal altercations. Here’s just a taste from Faludi’s files: Citibank: “In 2010, six current and former female employees sued Citibank’s parent company, Citigroup, for discriminating against women at all levels, paying them less, overlooking them for promotions, and firing them first in companywide layoffs.” Booz Allen Hamilton: “In 2011, Molly Finn, a former partner at the firm who had been fired after serving as its highest-ranking female employee and a star performer, sued for sex discrimination. She charged the company with creating an unwelcome environment for women and intentionally barring them from top leadership posts. During a review for a promotion (which she was subsequently denied), she was told to stop saying ‘pro-woman, feminist things,’ she recalled.” Wells Fargo: The bank reached a class-action settlement in a suit that “charged that the bank’s brokerage business, Wells Fargo Advisors (originally Wachovia Securities), discriminated against women in compensation and signing bonuses, denied them promotions, and cheated them out of account distributions, investment partnerships, and mentoring and marketing opportunities.” Walmart: “In 2011, the world’s largest retailer famously managed to dodge one of the largest class-action sex-discrimination suits in U.S. history (involving 1.5 million women), after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on technical grounds that the case didn’t constitute a single class action.” Faludi went on to seek comment from Sandberg about how Lean In squares its willingness to provide positive press to these corporations with the fact that, in many instances, they do not exactly deserve it ― as well as whether her current employer, Facebook, was taking to the Lean In revolution with any degree of zeal. For her troubles, Faludi was sent on a comical runaround that ended with some PR drone answering her questions by rejecting their premises.  Suffice it to say that whatever benefits the Lean In revolution have provided for individual women in the workforce, it’s been a far greater boon to these corporate partners. For the low, low price of lip service to Lean In’s compilation of empowerment aphorisms, they might obtain the foundation’s imprimatur ― behind which they can hide a bevy of sins that a more rigorous band of feminists might confront more critically. It’s the sort of brand-washing opportunity you can’t find many places. Though one place you can find it? The Clinton Foundation! There’s little doubt that Clinton could benefit from Sandberg’s “star power” and her optimism. But this hot rumor is a trial balloon that floats many thousands of miles above the reality of our economy. It’s yet another pitch from the Clinton camp that’s aimed at an affluent and over-served segment of the population, squarely missing those who truly regard their future fortunes with a mix of anxiety and resignation. Trump, on the other hand, doesn’t cater to the professional class at all. His pitch is squarely aimed at all the people Clinton talks over, above and around. He’s a class traitor, leading a band of white nationalists under a banner that promises to claw back the spoils of the country’s elites, and redistribute them to everyone who feels like they’ve lost out in the past half-century of progress. Floating Sandberg as a possible Cabinet appointee comes at a curious time in the presidential race. As Clinton’s lead in the polls erodes, there seems to be a growing awareness that her campaign needs to retool its message to voters. What Sandberg’s name signals is that the next phase of the Clinton team’s public communications will be more optimistic and audacious. That’s not an entirely half-baked approach. This is a message that would draw contrast with Trump’s downcast view of the world and the gutter stylings he deploys to convey it. The only hitch is that it’s hard to know for whom this message is intended. Surely not for the people in Ohio whose affections Clinton now desperately needs to win back. Right now, the race in that state ― and elsewhere ― seems to be trending in the other direction.  Will further Lean In-esque paeans to the aspirations of well-heeled professionals draw these voters back to Clinton’s fold? I’m starting to wonder if the tightening race isn’t so much based on the recent media coverage of Clinton’s pneumonia as it is a product of the fact that her larger economic pitch has always tended to exclude the very people most in need of reassurances and a vision for the future. Trump may be a dangerous strongman, but he takes that strongman act right to that portion of the electorate who likely greet Clinton’s message ― and her obsession with the already affluent ― as tone-deaf. There’s no doubt that Sandberg has proven that you can gather up a bunch of management bromides, package them as a prosperity gospel to the professional class and create a viral sensation. Clinton has, for a long while, spliced this sort of DNA into her economic pitch ― and it probably sounds great to both her donors and her base. But it’s an open question as to whether this reaches the voters she needs to persuade.  In the end, I’m just not sure you can actually beat authoritarianism with a wall of Successories posters. But it’s starting to look like we’re going to find out.

Led by the Gates Institute with support from Bayer, 120 Under 40 recognizes and highlights the achievements of the next generation of family planning leaders worldwide. Over the course of this multi-year project, 120 young family planning champions will be highlighted, 40 in each of the three project years. This year’s 40 winners are journalists, medical doctors and service providers, advocates, researchers, and founders of nonprofits. They work all over the world—in clinics and universities, in offices, and in the field—to advance family planning and reproductive health. In Ethiopia, Minister of Health Kesetebirhan Admasu has championed the country’s highly successful Health Extension Network, which improves the quality and availability of primary health care services—especially family planning and reproductive health—through community-based health workers. In India, Vithika Yadav is providing accessible, non-judgmental information on sexual and reproductive health and rights through the digital platform Love Matters India. From the United States, Turkey native Burcu Bozkurt co-leads the International Youth Alliance for Family Planning, a global network of 50-plus country coordinators working to amplify and empower the voices of young family planning and reproductive health advocates. The 40 winners for 2016 were chosen through public online voting, scoring by a jury of experts and leaders in family planning, and the project secretariat. The winners each receive $1,000 from the Gates Institute to continue their work in family planning. “We were thrilled by the caliber of the nominees in this first year of 120 Under 40, and these 40 winners are truly an outstanding group,” says Jose “Oying” Rimon II, Director of the Gates Institute and chair of the 120 Under 40 Jury. “With these young leaders at the helm, the family planning movement and its commitment to protecting health and saving lives are in excellent hands.” A smaller representative group of winners have been invited to attend the 120 Under 40 celebrations in the United States from September 21 to 23. These celebrations, which coincide the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York, will include training in advocacy and leadership, meetings with influential leaders, and opportunities for the winners to share personal stories about their passion for family planning and reproductive health. The activities will be co-hosted in Baltimore, Washington DC, and New York City by the Gates Institute, Bayer, Population Council and the FP2020 partnership.

Embargoed until 4 p.m. ET, Thursday, Sept. 15 ORLANDO, Florida, Sept. 15, 2016 – Abnormalities in a type of cell involved in blood vessel development and healing may explain why adults who were born prematurely are at increased risk of high blood pressure and other heart alterations, according to new research presented at the American Heart Association’s Council on Hypertension 2016 Scientific Sessions. Researchers at the University of Montreal compared the function of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) – which help maintain healthy blood vessels – taken from 30 young adults (21-28 years old) born very preterm (less than 29 weeks gestation) and 30 young adults born at term (37 or more weeks gestation). Among the findings: In lab tests, the cells from preterm adults were slower to form colonies, a key step in forming new capillaries; In preterm adults, slower colony formation was associated with two risk factors of heart disease, a higher systolic (top number) blood pressure and enlargement of the heart’s left pumping chamber. Abnormal function of ECFCs has also been associated with early complications of preterm birth. For example, prolonged oxygen therapy exposure and consequent development of lung disease.

This report provides details of the latest Co-development agreements announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of Co-development agreements from 2010 to 2016. There is an increasing willingness for parties to enter co-development deals; such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big product win, whereas traditional licensing deals forfeit upside for near term upfront, milestone and royalty payments. Co-development partnering allow the parties to securitize value and reduce risk, but keep a part of the potential upside should the product reach the market. Event if the licensor does not commercialize the project they can either sell those rights to the licensee partner or another partner for an amount higher than would have been achieved at an earlier stage licensing deal. There are mainly two forms of co-development deals; Either the parties agree on a certain division of ownership, or decide that one party gets the rights to commercialise the drug in a certain geographical area, and the other side gets the other geographical area rights. Typically, the ownership division applies when it is likely that the project will be licensed at a later point in time. The geographical split usually applies when the two companies are determined to commercialise the drug themselves. Another reason for co-development deals is the joint origin of a project. Drug development projects often require various scientific and technological novelties that stem from different companies. If both companies contributed to the origination of the project, then both have from the beginning a stake in the project. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not.

This report provides details of the latest collaborative R&D deals announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully up to date with the latest information, the report provides details of collaborative R&D deals from 2010 to 2016. There has been a long standing willingness for parties to enter collaborative R&D deals. Such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big R&D win, whilst mitigating the risks of going it alone in the risky preclinical and clinical development stages. Collaborative R&D is a specific type of partnering deal whereby the parties to the deal agree to collaborate on the research and development and subsequently commercialize a compound, product or technology. There are several forms of a collaborative R&D deal; A traditional collaborative R&D arrangement whereby an owner of intellectual property (the licensor) provides access to its technology to another company (the licensee) in return for agreed payments and royalties on subscequent sales of product(s) derived from the intellectual property. In more recent times, licensing is often the outcome of a successful period of collaborative R&D on the research and development of a technology or compound, resulting in a product which can be commercialized. In this situation, the collaborative R&D agreement governs who has permission to commercialize and what payments are due should commercialization proceed. The report provides a detailed understand and analysis of how and why companies enter collaborative R&D deals. The majority of deals are multicomponent whereby the licensee retains either a right or option to license to comoercialize the resultant product of the research collaboration. There are also numerous pure licensing deals whereby the products originator takes on a development/commercialization partner in order to maximize a technologies/products prospects. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payment clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not.

Is It Stress or a Stroke? Common Stroke Symptoms Silent Stroke: Hard to Recognize F.A.S.T. Test for Stroke Signs Font Size A A A Minorities Less Likely to Get Clot-Busting Drug But study couldn't determine why white male patients were more likely to get tPA in hospital WebMD News from HealthDay By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, Sept. 14, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A clot-busting drug known as tPA can greatly improve stroke outcomes, but it isn't given to minorities nearly as often as it is given to white men, a new U.S. study shows. Blacks were 26 percent less likely, and other minority patients were 17 percent less likely, to be treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) than white men, the researchers found. In addition, women were 8 percent less likely to be given the clot buster than men. "It is helpful to get a sense of what factors are associated with not treating patients with this proven therapy," said lead researcher Dr. Steven Messe. He is an associate professor of neurology at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Although Messe isn't sure why these disparities exist, he thinks "it is possible that this has already improved in more recent years." The drug is given after an ischemic stroke, which is caused by a blood clot in the brain; tPA dissolves the clot and restores blood flow to the blocked vessel. It cannot be used for a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). "Given that tPA has been demonstrated to improve neurologic outcome after stroke, we should be treating all eligible patients," Messe said. To this end, he said, patient education about stroke symptoms and what to do when a stroke is suspected is needed, as well as continued development of stroke centers. "Hopefully, we can continue to improve treatment rates overall by addressing some of these issues," Messe said. The study was funded in part by Pfizer Inc., and the Merck Schering-Plough Partnership. For the study, Messe and his colleagues looked at the eight-year period between 2003 and 2011 to see how many patients who arrived at a hospital within two hours after a stroke were given tPA. All of the patients were eligible to get the drug, the researchers said. Of the nearly 62,000 people in the study, more than 15,000 (25 percent) did not receive tPA within three hours, the findings showed. 1 | 2 Next Page > Continue reading below...

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 15, 2016 10:54am   Comments Share: Related BAX Stocks Hitting 52-Week Highs Earnings Scheduled For October 25, 2016 Tracking Dan Loeb's Third Point Portfolio - Q3 2016 Update (Seeking Alpha) Barclays reinstated coverage of Baxter International Inc (NYSE: BAX) with an Overweight rating and $52 price target as it sees upside to long-term growth and margin targets. Since spinning off the Baxalta biopharma business in May 2015, the company has delivered a series of beats and raises due to its focus on R&D investment in the medtech business and better cost controls. Baxter expects 2020 operating margin (OM) of 17-18 percent (unlevered), driven by cost savings, new products, and portfolio management. Barclays noted that post-spinoff, Baxter raised its long term targets by 350 bps at the midpoint, and topped its initial 2016 guidance by 200 bps (current 12 percent vs. initial 10 percent OM). "Organically, we think BAX can top this goal and using the balance sheet could add to OM and EPS," analyst Matthew Taylor wrote in a note. Taylor expects the solid MSD growth to continue and should come from key products such as Sigma Spectrum, PD cyclers, CRRT, anesthesia, and biosurgery. Further, the company has other growth/margin accretive assets including pharma, anesthesia, and nutrition. "While we understand the valuation pushback on BAX, we think investors are missing the medium-term margin and M&A potential, along with the strength of BAX's new products, which we think will resolve this disparity," Taylor added.

Minyanville Bayer AG (ADR) (BAYRY) Makes the Monsanto Deal Work By Scutify Sep 15, 2016 9:12 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Bayer AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:BAYRY) rose 3% in early Wednesday trade after its $66 billion, $128-per-share bid for Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) was accepted. Top executives appeared on TV to say they expect regulators to approve it, and Bayer stock was lifted in response. Monsanto stock barely reacted to the deal on Wednesday morning, still hovering near the pre-bid price of $107, a value of $46.2 billion. That is doubtless due to the regulatory juggernaut that Bayer's deal still has to go through, with both European and American agencies showing increased skepticism toward big deals of any sort. The deal would consolidate a global farming chemical-and-seed business at a time of global glut in farm commodities. I drove through the Midwest several times in the last month, and the corn really was as high as an elephant's eye, the soybeans super-abundant in the fields. This is thanks in large part to genetically-modified seed and fertilizers made by Monsanto. But if it goes through, expect good things from Bayer and BAYRY stock. The Terms of the Deal The terms of the deal, announced in a press release, include $19 billion in new Bayer stock, in the form of mandatory convertible shares with subscription rights, and $47 billion in cash, to be financed through a $57 billion bridge loan which has already been obtained. 4 Vanguard Funds I'll Never Sell Buying these Vanguard funds was one of the most profitable decisions of my life. And they can change your life, too! You'll find their names & complete details in my latest Special Report. It's yours FREE, online here! If the deal falls through, Monsanto gets a $2 billion break-up fee. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google The price is 44% more than Monsanto was worth in May, and 19% above the $106 per share it was worth before the deal was announced. Assuming the deal does go through, the shareholders are going to do very well. The question becomes whether there can be big farming profits in a world of GMO, and whether BAYRY can capture them at the hefty price it is paying. The answer, of course, is yes. Making It Work What is working with grains can work with other agricultural commodities. Genetic engineering is really just an acceleration in the cross-breeding technology we have been using for centuries, techniques we've been using on cats and dogs for millennia. Ironically, Bayer becomes the largest player in GMOs at a time when the German government is among the most skeptical in the world about them. Before this deal, Bayer was basically a medical company. The soccer team it launched in 1904 still has a Bayer aspirin tablet on its club shield. Its drugs include Cipro, Levitra, Xarelto and the Yaz line of birth control products. It's more heavily involved in consumer products, like Aleve, Claritin, One-a-Day, and in and animal health products like Advantix. Regulators may protest that Monsanto makes GMOs a two-way race between Bayer, a German company, and Syngenta AG (ADR) (NYSE:SYT), whose sale to ChemChina is now being finalized. Monsanto would give Bayer a market cap north of $130 billion - hefty, but still well short of pharmaceutical giants like Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson & Johnson Inc. (NYSE:JNJ). That's part of the hope here - that Monsanto's roughly $15 billion in annual sales, and $3.5 billion in net income, can deliver to Bayer the financial kick it needs to play in those big leagues of drug discovery. This deal would more than double Bayer's sales, and triple its net income. However, it may take up to two years to close, and would meanwhile occupy all of management's time. More Deals On The Way Given the price, and what this does to the Bayer balance sheet, it seems inevitable that more deals are going to follow this one. The whole crop unit could become a new company, the consumer health units might be sold, or the pharmaceutical units could go on the market. Either way, it's going to be interesting times for Bayer shareholders. My personal view is it's going to be a profitable time, that the combined company, and its pieces, are going to be worth a lot more in two years than they are now.

Jim Cramer is willing to be called crazy. In the past few weeks, Cramer's charitable trust has built a new pharmaceutical position in its portfolio for Bristol-Myers Squibb. "The drug company I have referenced for years as the kind of high-quality secular growth business that is totally immunized against the slings and arrows of the Federal Reserve or a slowing economy," the "Mad Money" host said.

"To me, at these levels, it just screams value, even as you might have to wait a while for this investment to pay off." -Jim Cramer Bristol-Myers shares have fallen more than 26 percent in the past two months. On Aug. 5, the stock plunged 16 percent, wiping out $20 billion in value in a single session on news that its flagship oncology drug, Opdivo, failed to meet its primary endpoint in a clinical trial for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The news set back the company's most important drug and prompted analyst downgrades and estimate cuts. "To me, at these levels, it just screams value, even as you might have to wait a while for this investment to pay off," Cramer said. Opdivo is already available commercially and helps patients' immune systems' T-cells fight cancer more effectively. The drug has grown dramatically, as it generated nearly $1 billion in sales in 2015 and more than $1.5 billion for the first 6 months of 2016. As soon as investors heard that the drug failed to meet its primary endpoint, Wall Street turned its back on the whole franchise, assuming that people would switch to a competitor like Merck's Keytruda. However, Cramer said the drug did not meet goals because Bristol-Myers set the bar too high. When it designed the clinical trial, it included patients who expressed a specific protein by more than 5 percent — a very low level. Why circle back to the stock now? Cramer's charitable trust bought the stock because Opdivo estimates have now gone from too high to too low, now that most analysts have stripped the non-small lung cancer numbers from estimates. Additionally, the company has another non-small cell lung cancer trial to pair Opdivo with another of its drugs. If that trial goes well, estimates will need to be raised. "Let's not act like Bristol-Myers is some one-drug wonder biotech firm," Cramer said. It has a host of drugs that treat a variety of diseases, and sports a robust drug pipeline even after taking Opdivo estimate cuts into account. However, it is important for investors to keep in mind that Bristol-Myers is now a value investment that requires a long-term time horizon, Cramer said. It could take a year or two for the story to play out. Short term, it could be choppy and the stock could go lower. Cramer recommended pouncing on weakness, especially as there could be some heading into the election. "In this negative environment for the drug industry, I think Bristol-Myers has finally come down to the point where it is simply too attractive to ignore as a long-term investment," Cramer said.

IAM Magazine Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top patent professionals Top IP strategists International reports Events Media IPBC UN panel recommends stricter patentability rules and compulsory licensing to improve access to medicine 16 Sep 16 < Back to Blogs Jack Ellis A United Nations taskforce released its much-anticipated report on patient access to medicines this week. In the run-up to the report’s publication, many IP owners expected that the role of patents in the drug industry would very much be in the firing line – and the taskforce’s newly published recommendations for improving healthcare access are likely to make difficult reading for plenty of rights holders. To provide some background, the UN Secretary-General’s High Level Panel on Access to Medicines (HLP) was assembled and set to work in November 2015, with the objective of reviewing and assessing “proposals and recommend solutions for remedying the policy incoherence between the justifiable rights of inventors, international human rights law, trade rules and public health in the context of health technologies”. Of course, there are myriad other factors that have relevance here – and the report itself acknowledges that, while they are not within its mandate, there “are many reasons why people do not get the healthcare they need, including, inter alia, under-resourced health systems, a lack of sufficiently qualified and skilled healthcare workers, inequalities between and within countries, regulatory barriers, poor health education, unavailability of health insurance, exclusion, stigma, discrimination and exclusive marketing rights”. This report is focused squarely on the interplay between IP rights, market regulation and healthcare. The argument behind all of this is that pharmaceutical patents allow their owners to raise the prices of medicines, and maintain those high prices for the duration of the patent term, therefore putting the medicines in question beyond the reach of many patients and healthcare systems – and particularly those in the developing world. In response, some countries have denied patent protection for certain drugs, or have issued – or threatened to issue – compulsory licences that effectively override rights holders’ patents and allow generic manufacturers to produce cheaper versions of the drugs they cover. On the other side of the fence, pharmaceutical innovators claim that the right to exclude awarded to them by patent ownership gives them an opportunity to recoup at least some of the massive R&D investment they have made in discovering, manufacturing and marketing new drugs. When their patents are revoked or are subject to compulsory licences – or when they are prevented from obtaining patent protection in the first place – their incentives for continued, sustained investment in R&D activities are removed, which leaves a big question mark hanging over the development of new drugs further down the line. In short, both camps claim that they have the best answer to the issue of improving global health outcomes. The HLP report aims to come up with some conclusions to this long-running debate. Some of its key recommendations are as follows: World Trade Organisation (WTO) member states should “make full use of the policy space available in Article 27 of the TRIPS [Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights] Agreement by adopting and applying rigorous definitions of invention and patentability… to ensure that patents are only awarded when genuine innovation has occurred”. This is intended to address the activity of ‘evergreening’ – whereby pharmaceutical companies allegedly seek patents on minor adjustments to a core product, that do not improve its efficacy, in order to prolong their right to exclude. Rights holders will be concerned that governments will take this as carte blanche to deny patent protection on certain inventions, however. Following on from the above, “governments and the private sector must refrain from explicit or implicit threats, tactics or strategies that undermine the right of WTO members to use TRIPS flexibilities”. This would appear to be in reference to bilateral free trade agreements, as well as wider proposed pacts such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, led by developed nations such as the United States and Japan, that require partners to implement legal and regulatory reforms that strengthen the exclusive rights awarded to patent owners. Governments should adopt and implement legislation that “facilitates the issuance of compulsory licenses”. The HLP report stresses that such legislation “must be designed to effectuate quick, fair, predictable and implementable compulsory licenses for legitimate public health needs, and particularly with regards to essential medicines”. Clearly, this is not something that many pharmaceutical patent owners will welcome. They will fear that this will encourage governments to issue compulsory licences even in situations where there is not a compelling and urgent case to be made for them. Private sector companies should “report, as part of their annual reporting cycle, on actions they have taken that promote access to health technologies” and governments should require them to disclose “the costs of R&D, production, marketing and distribution of health technology” along with any public funding they may have received in the course of drug development. Universities and research institutions in receipt of public funding “must prioritise public health objectives over financial returns in their patenting and licensing practices”. Stakeholders should “test and implement new and additional models for financing and rewarding public health research and development”. The current system where R&D budgets are generally tied to product-related revenues – and where the exclusivity awarded by patent protection plays a vital role – should be supplemented and replaced by one that ‘de-links’ the costs of innovation from end prices of drugs. This could take the form of up-front grants, tax breaks and cash prizes for reaching certain development milestones. To this end, the UN should initiate a process for governments to negotiate a binding ‘R&D Convention’ and a ‘Code of Principles for Biomedical R&D’ that would set out the public health aims of innovation and govern R&D financing. There’s plenty of food for thought in there, not least the much greater role of government, and of the UN itself, in the future of drug development that is envisaged. How any of that would work in reality remains to be seen (if it is ever seen at all). What can be said for sure at this stage is that many of those working in IP management in the life sciences industries will feel hard done by, notwithstanding efforts by the likes of Gilead, Merck and Novartis to try out market-based solutions to the access problem - and the fact that around 95% of the treatments on the World Health Organisation's current Essential Medicines list are off-patent anyway. Despite nods to “the justified rights of inventors”, the HLP’s recommendations do generally seem to support the views of those who would like to see a weakening of IP rights in the pharmaceutical space. On November 3 in Munich, IAM hosts its first-ever Pharma and Biotech Summit. No doubt this report and its implications will be one of the major topics of conversation throughout the day.   Sectors IP management Licensing IP politics IP litigation Patents IP business Leave a comment Please log in or register to leave a comment.

An analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry found that physicians are more likely than not to write prescriptions for patients who request a therapy after seeing a pharmaceutical ad for that brand. However, only one in 10 consumers are likely to see such an ad and ask their doctor for a prescription. (Stat) 2. Mylan, which markets the EpiPen, is now under scrutiny for its executive compensation practices. The drugmaker paid its top five executives $300 million over the past five years, making it one of the top spending pharmaceutical companies even though it is ranked eleventh by revenue and sixteenth by market capitalization.
