But for centuries, onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness, had plagued remote communities in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Lifelines for villagers, the rivers are breeding grounds for black flies that, infected with a parasite worm, transmit the disease through repeated biting. In return, those infected transfer the disease to uninfected flies who bite them, resulting in a plague characterized by extreme itching and eventual blindness. That the simple chore of getting water in these communities is no longer as much of a danger as it had been for generations is due to William “Bill” Campbell, an Irish-born scientist who, with his colleagues at Merck Research Laboratories, discovered a novel therapy for treating the disease. In 2015, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, sharing it with Satoshi Ōmura of Japan. One wonders why it took so long. It was in the late 1970s when, working with a batch of microbe strains that Ōmura sent over for evaluation, Campbell developed a drug using ivermectin (later named Mectizan) and suggested it would work for river blindness in humans. Not only did the drug work, it also proved effective against the parasite that causes elephantiasis (so-called because of the elephant-like appearance of swollen limbs in severely affected cases), which co-exists with river blindness in many places.

Several countries in Africa are making significant progress towards eliminating both diseases. In Latin America, three countries – Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico – have effectively eliminated river blindness. Campbell, who at 86, is fit and trim with twinkling eyes, a keen mind, and self-effacing wit, is also decidedly modest about his Nobel Prize.

(Copyright © Nobel Media AB 2015 Photo: Dan Lepp) “I think of it as an award in which I’m the representative of the Merck company’s research teams,” he said in one of several phone conversations that I had with him over the summer, prior to a meet up in Cape Cod, where he and his wife, Mary, children (two daughters and a son), and five grandchildren had gathered for a vacation in early August. The respite is a welcome break from all the attention that being a Nobel laureate has brought. He had settled into retirement in North Andover, MA, enjoying time with Mary (they met at a church function in Elizabeth, NJ over 50 years ago), his three-times weekly doubles ping pong games, solitary kayak trips in early morning, an occasional hike up nearby half-mile hill, and painting and writing poetry that reflects his passion for roundworms and other kinds of parasitic worms.

(Copyright © Nobel Media AB 2015 Photo: Pi Frisk) A true Renaissance man who can turn his hand to any number of things, Campbell likes to keep it simple. In fact, the title of his Nobel Lecture, “Ivermectin: A Reflection on Simplicity,”could serve as a mantra for the man himself. More than anything, the now world-famous biologist and zoologist, is a naturalist who espouses nature-based remedies for curing diseases. He told Adam Smith, the chief scientific officer of Nobel Media, “there is a certain amount of hubris in humans thinking that they can create molecules as well as nature can create molecules in terms of the diversity of molecules, because nature consistently produces molecules that have not been thought of by humans.” Campbell’s appreciation of nature is rooted in his childhood. He grew up in Ramelton, a small farming town in County Donegal, with two older brothers and a younger sister. The town is situated on mouth of the River Lennon, in one of the most beautiful and remote spots in Ireland. His parents, Sarah Jane Campbell (née Patterson) of Dunfanaghy, and R.J. Campbell of Fanad, ran a general store, supplying farmers. His father also farmed, raising shorthorn dairy cattle that won prizes at agricultural shows. And it was at an agricultural show that 14-year-old Campbell picked up a leaflet on fluke worms in sheep that, in hindsight, may have influenced his interest in becoming a scientist.

(Copyright © Nobel Media AB 2015 Photo: Alexander Mahmoud) But then Campbell could just as easily have become a writer, an artist or a historian. His teacher during his formative years, Miss Martin, “instilled a love of learning, not in the sense of a chore to be mastered, but getting the satisfaction of knowing something, and remembering something. She had a tremendous influence on me,” he says. Desmond Smyth, the renowned parasitologist, who was Campbell’s science professor at Trinity College, was another key influencer. “He changed my life by developing my interest in parasitic worms,” he says. After graduating with first class honors in zoology from Trinity, Campbell went on to the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he earned a Ph.D. in 1957 for work on liver fluke in deer. Headhunted by Merck out of school, he stayed with the company for over 30 years developing many significant drugs, including a treatment for trichinosis. William C. Campbell and his wife, Mary, showing the Nobel Medal during their visit to the Nobel Foundation on December 12, 2015. (Copyright © Nobel Media AB 2015 Photo: Alexander Mahmoud) After his retirement from Merck, Campbell taught undergraduate biology and graduate history at Drew University until 2012. Nowadays, he often begins lectures by showing a picture of his ­father’s cows. “Of course it has ­absolutely nothing to do with the lecture, but I like to tell people where I’m from because it is such a part of me,” he says. When I remark that he still has a hint of an Irish accent after all this time in America, he laughs. “After about three days in Donegal with my family, Mary says it comes back.” And that will be soon. In September, Campbell will be honored by IT Sligo and then go home to Ramelton for a town reception. “My brother, Bert, said he’ll make sure that there will be time for family picnics on Marble Hill beach,” Campbell, his eyes lighting up at the prospect, says. “His lovely mother used to put together such wonderful picnics for us,” Mary adds. Campbell agrees. “I was very lucky to have a great mother and a great father.” He pauses for a moment, verklempt. “That’s one of those things about the Prize – you wish they were around.”  ℘℘℘ You have lived here a long time. Do you feel more American than Irish as the years go by? Well, I feel both and that may seem strange. I never ceased to feel Irish but I also feel American. I am proud to be American and I am proud to be Irish and proud to be a citizen of the U.K. Tell me about growing up in Donegal? My father started with a little grocery shop and built it up over his lifetime into a general merchant store selling farm equipment, hardware, kitchen utensils, and chinaware – just about everything. Sometimes the farmers would come in at lunch time when the shop would be closed but my father would always get up, much to my mother’s distress, and go out and talk to farmers. It wouldn’t have occurred to him not to open the shop for some farmer who had maybe come in from a long distance. He was a natural entrepreneur and businessman. He also farmed. He just loved to do that. He grew a lot of potatoes and oats, and raised dairy cattle. He used to take his purebred dairy shorthorns to shows. One thing that sort of typified my father, was that he brought electricity to the town. He hired people to set up the poles and the wires to bring electricity to the whole town. He bought this big generator – the engine room that housed it was behind our house. When we were in bed, we could hear this generator going through its paces before it settled down into a steady rhythm. People in those days who had battery-powered radios would bring them to my father’s shop to get them charged. Then after the war, he bought three or four smaller diesel-fueled generators. I had wonderful parents. My mother was saintly. I don’t use “saintly” in a religious or liturgical sense, though she was devout, but rather to convey a sense of her profound goodness. She was very caring. I never heard her say a bad thing about anyone.

(Photo: Kit DeFever) Has your life changed since the Nobel Prize? There is no way you can stop it from changing your life because there is just a constant barrage of invitations and letters and emails and requests. And while they are all wonderful to have, there are just so many of them and I am now very ancient and have no secretary or manpower or secretarial skills, it is stressful for me. Whether I say yes or no, it is just a constant preoccupation, especially if the invitation is from someone I know, and I have a lot of speeches to give and lectures to write. The Nobel experience itself was just out of this world, and then to meet the President of the United States was a great honor. I think the main positive is being contacted by people you haven’t been in touch with for many, many years and to know that people still remember you. In fact, the most positive thing is that people actually enjoy hearing about it. They actually get pleasure out of talking to someone who had [the Nobel] experience. I understand that as a boy, you became interested in science after picking up a leaflet on Fluke worms in sheep at an agricultural show. One of the things that has happened with the prize, it is that I find myself telling the same story and even writing it. Only in retrospect, did I find it intriguing that I only remembered one thing about that show, and that happened to be a leaflet about a parasitic worm that I took home with me. I didn’t think, “Aha! This is what I want to study.” The decision came gradually, and it all really stemmed from Desmond Smyth, my professor at Trinity College. He was a fantastic man, the sort of teacher who changes people’s lives. He was very encouraging and engaged me in the study of parasitic worms. How did the decision to go to Trinity College come about? At that time and place, if you were a Protestant you went to Trinity, or perhaps to Queen’s University Belfast. If you were a Roman Catholic you tended to go to University College Dublin, or University College Galway or Cork. That is the reality of how it was at the time. One of the things I liked when I came to this country was what I naïvely perceived to be a lack of prejudice because people didn’t seem to know by looking at me whether I was Protestant or Catholic. Whereas in Ramelton, if a new person moved to town, everyone knew, before they even got there, whether they were Protestant or Catholic. It was ridiculous, but that is the way it was. How did you end up at the University of Wisconsin? As I was nearing graduation, a professor at the University of Wisconsin wrote to Smyth in Dublin. They knew each other’s work, and as a result of this contact, I applied to do research and graduate studies at Wisconsin. When I got there, my professor had a project on liver fluke that he and his department were working on. This was the giant liver fluke that is very pathogenic in deer and sheep, so it turned out to be the perfect spot for me. And this led to a job at Merck? Yes. The head of parasitology at Merck wrote to my professor at Wisconsin to see if there was anybody just finishing their PhD that he might recommend. I looked at the map of northern New Jersey and decided (unfairly, of course) that it didn’t look appealing. But my professor said, “Just go there and have the experience and stay in New York.” So that is what I did. It turned out that seeing the work being done at Merck, and meeting the people there, intrigued and impressed me. When I got back to Wisconsin, there was a letter offering me a job. Ivermectin, as well has having a huge impact on human diseases, has also made a difference in veterinary practice. How did it come about? Yes. I meet a lot of veterinary practitioners who tell me that. [The discovery] was a long process of finding a drug that worked against some worms, and then testing it against other worms, and following up with more testing, and more experiments. That involved a lot of hard work and a lot of persistence. Knowing enough about worms to draw analogies between the different types, and where they live and what they do, was a key factor. Parasite Window, 1992, featured in Campbell’s book, Poem, Paint and Pathogen. Was it a huge eureka moment when you realized that the treatment for parasites in horses might be used to treat humans? No, it wasn’t. I was very conscious of human worm diseases. While still at Merck, I was lecturing at New York Medical College on human parasitic worms. And I had been in South America on an Inter-American Fellowship in Tropical Medicine. So there was never a eureka moment for me. When you discover something active, you have a sort of subdued excitement because the chances are overwhelming that it is going to fall by the wayside. The vast majority turn out to be too toxic or too unstable or too stinky… But, on the other hand, there certainly were moments that were more important than others, some things that would shift the trajectory a bit, and therefore we might call them inflection points; certainly I am thinking about the horses here. Can you talk about the river blindness trials? I read that you persuaded Merck to make the drug available for free in poor countries. First of all, let me say that the trials were carefully done by the Merck medical people working with French tropical medicine experts in Africa. Any trial that is a first trial in humans has to be very cautious but this was out of the ordinary in terms of being cautious. And when it worked, there was some serious skepticism on the part of leading authorities that had do with people being susceptible to particular drugs and particular life stages being more dangerous to treat than other life stages, in terms of hypersensitivity, reactions and so on. But Merck decided to go ahead despite the skepticism and set up its own trials and not rely on some big international agency. And again, it worked just wonderfully well and the question then was what to do with it. As a pharmaceutical company, it would have been nice to sell it at a profit, but those most affected lived in poor countries, so there was no way people were going to get it unless it was donated. And this decision was decided by the chairman and CEO of the company in collusion with a handful of three or four top associates, and I was not one of them. To my mind, they are the ones, and the only ones, who deserve credit for that donation. What else have you worked on? As a parasitologist, I have had the privilege of interfacing with both human and veterinary medicine because parasites are so important to both. There is one particular disease that I spent an enormous amount of time on and that is trichinosis, the one you get from eating under-cooked pork. I gave a talk at George Washington University, in D.C., in March and at the end of the lecture, a young fellow put up his hand and said, “I heard that you once gave Scotch whiskey to pigs. Can you confirm that?” And I said, “I never in my entire life gave Scotch whiskey to pigs. I gave them Irish whiskey!” I fed the pigs seven-year-old John Jameson whiskey because of reports that alcoholic beverages would prevent trichinosis, and published a paper on it. And did it work? Yes, but you would have to drink an awful lot of it. It would be a very expensive and hazardous cure. Humans affected with trichinosis get tremendous fever and pain – pigs don’t get either. You can give them enough [trichinosis] to eventually kill them with infection, but they never get the fever. What are your thoughts on using animals in research? I don’t dismiss it lightly. In biomedical research we say that it is justified because it is to benefit humans. I realize for some people that is not enough. I can certainly respect the difficulty that people have with it. A number of years ago a British member of parliament tried to get a bill passed that all medicines in which animals were used in the research would have to carry a label saying, “Animals were used in developing this product.” The bill never got passed but I think it would have made people stop and think, “Okay, I’m against the use of animals in research. Do I take the drug or be noble and say ‘no,’ even if it’s going to cure me?” There is a big focus now on using one’s own autoimmune system to target disease. Yes, and some of it has to do with worms. There is a connection between early childhood worm infections and a stronger immunity. You can cure some diseases by infecting the person with worms. In Mexico, for a couple of hundred dollars you can become infected with worms as a cure for irritable bowel syndrome. You can get the treatment in London. It hasn’t caught on here because people are put off by the idea of worms. Most of the research is being done on the fringe. Established researchers won’t touch it. You have spent your whole career developing chemical answers to disease — but you’ve said that we need to look to nature for cures. Yes, absolutely. I believe that. We need to look at the immunological response and other biological approaches rather than chemical contrivances. We need to continue to work on other ways of interrupting life cycles and disrupting transmission of disease. One would hope that eventually [chemicals] would be replaced but certainly we are not anywhere near that yet, except in certain cases such as virus diseases. In terms of the Prize, you like to give credit to others, saying the discovery was a team effort. Right, that is really important. I’m a representative of the Merck company’s “team of teams” – parasitologists, chemists, microbiologists, and toxicologists. If there was a problem or an obstacle in one department, somehow it was solved. As obstacles arose, they got resolved. And of course, there was a lot of good fortune…things went better than one had any right to expect. How do you stay fit and mentally alert? The thing that I cling to, no matter how busy I get, is playing doubles ping-pong three times a week. It is very energetic and requires a lot of mental focus. I also kayak early in the morning. I love the serene atmosphere. When you have the lake all to yourself, it is such a source of refreshment. And of course, it’s good physical exercise as well. Also, I paint and write poetry. Those are things that you can keep on doing. Well, the painting you can keep doing. The poetry seems to be something that is either there or not there. From your paintings and your poetry, I have come to the conclusion that you love worms.­­­­ Yes. I consider them beautiful. They are just doing their own thing and not meaning to be destructive. And I have said in some recent papers that the objective is not to get rid of parasitic worms, the objective is to get rid of parasitic diseases. One of your worm paintings actually looks like a stained- glass window. Yes. Several of them do. It is always the same stained glass window. One last question — as a scientist and as a person, do you believe in the afterlife? Ah. I cannot answer that. I have a very fuzzy but very important religious faith – you know, from growing up in a Christian household. When I say I can’t answer that, it is not just that I don’t want to (although I don’t want to) but it is because I don’t have an answer that satisfies me. I don’t believe in heaven with a big-bearded God and Saint Peter with a big keys at the gate and stuff. I am not a literalist in terms of religious faith. I am very liberal. In fact, I am a very fuzzy-minded person when it comes to those things… But I can’t let go of the belief that there’s something there.

Merck aims to empower infertile women across the continent through access to information, health and change of mind-set through their initiative that was launched in June 2015 “More than a Mother” “Jackeline Mwende, a young woman of 27 years from Masii, Machakos County in Kenya hands were hacked off - not by thieves but by her own husband for failing to conceive, even though he was the one with fertility problems. Her husband told her 'Today is your last day'.  It is so shocking that someone would go to such an extent to batter his own wife and leave her nearly dead. Infertility should never be a reason to separate, hurt or kill your partner. There are so many options out there available to manage infertility” said Hon. Joyce Lay, Member of Parliament and the Ambassador for ‘Merck More than a Mother’ in Kenya. “Through -Empowering Berna- project, Merck will support Jackeline Mwende throughout the rest of her life to empower and enable her to become an independent productive member in society. ‘Merck More than a Mother’ initiative will provide Mwende with a monthly income of Sh25,300, then will establish a business for her in which she will be able to generate a sustainable monthly income of not less than Sh25,000. At the same time Merck will provide her with prosthetic hands in addition to the needed physical and physiological rehabilitation to enable her to support herself and stand on her own two feet despite the challenge of her brutal disability that was caused by the stigma of infertility – even though her husband is the one who was found with the infertility problem, yet she is still the one who bore the devastating consequences of the public stigma associated with it," said Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. “Mwende didn't deserve what she went through and especially that her husband is the one who was found with the infertility problem and not her. Society, government and all stakeholders need to continue to join hands with Merck in their campaign to encourage the acceptance people live with infertility because the stigma associated with infertility puts pressure on them to a point where they do crazy and criminal things. We need to know that it's a shared responsibility, not just for the couple but for the society too,” Joyce Lay added. "Jackline Mwende's story is the reason all people should appreciate ‘Merck More than a Mother’ initiative. No sane person should torture a woman for failing to produce children. Men should not think that their failure to be a biological father is due to women's infertility. Why torture a fellow human being and inflict such permanent bodily harm for a fault that could be yours?  No amount of justice in the courts of law will bring back Mwende’s arms. Justice will only prevail if Mwende’s case marks a turning point in society that appreciates one fact- "that women are women irrespective of their ability to bear children. They need to be respected," emphasized Hon. Sarah Opendi, Uganda Minister of State of Health and Uganda ambassador of Merck more than a Mother "This terrible violence Mwende suffered ny5tghas emphasized the significance of ‘Merck More than a Mother’ initiative for Africa. ‘Merck More than a Mother’ will continue working closely with partners to create a culture shift and to empower infertile women economically and socially through "Empowering Berna" Project to ensure no other woman in Africa should ever go through such violence, humiliation or misery again," Rasha Kelej emphasized. About “Merck more than a Mother” initiative: In many cultures, childless women still suffer discrimination, stigma and ostracism. Infertility can transform from an acute, private distress into a harsh public stigma with complex and devastating consequences. An inability to have a child or to become pregnant can result in being greatly isolated, disinherited or assaulted. This may result in divorce or physical and psychological violence. “Merck More than a Mother” initiative aims to define interventions to reduce the stigma and social suffering of infertile women, empower them and raise awareness about male infertility and the necessity for a team approach to family building among couples across the continent. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), lower levels of development are thought to be associated with higher levels of non-genetic and preventable causes of infertility. For instance, poor nutrition, untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs), unsafe abortion, consequences of infections caused by the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) or child marriage, exposure to smoking, leaded petrol and other environmental pollutants can lead to infertility. About “Empowering Berna” Project “It is very important to empower infertile women through improving access to awareness, health and change of mindset so they can bear children as part of their human rights. In case they can no longer be treated, ‘Empowering Berna’ project will contribute towards empowering and training them to establish their own small business so that they can be independent and re-build their own lives, a woman is more than a mother, ‘Empowering Berna’ initiative will prove this every day.” Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer of Merck Healthcare.

MSD’s biosimilar drug MK-1293 references Lantus, an insulin-based diabetes treatment originally developed by Sanofi. Samsung Bioepis has contributed to MK-1293’s development as an investment partner to MSD.   Samsung Bioepis research lab. Samsung Bioepis MK-1293 is already undergoing a marketing authorization review by the European Medicines Agency, as MSD seeks to commercialize the drug in both the U.S. and Europe, the world’s two biggest markets for biosimilar drugs. Biosimilars refer to cheaper, near-replicas of biologic drugs which have lost patent protection. Sanofi’s formulation patent on Lantus, the company’s top-selling drug, expired last year in the U.S. and Europe. If approved, MK-1293 is expected to compete against not only Lantus but also a Lantus biosimilar developed by Eli Lilly, which has already secured approval from the FDA and EMA and is nearing commercialization. MK-1293, also known as SB9, stands as one of Samsung Bioepis’ six biosimilars that reference some of the world’s top biologic drugs -- Enbrel, Remicade, Humira, Avastin, Herceptin and Lantus. Two of them -- one based on Amgen’s Enbrel and another on Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade -- were approved in Europe earlier this year and have been commercialized in some countries in the region. Samsung Bioepis’ Humira biosimilar is awaiting marketing approval from the EMA while its two biosimilars referencing Avastin and Herceptin are currently undergoing phase three clinical trials. Samsung Bioepis is the biosimilars development unit of South Korean electronics giant Samsung Group. Alongside its parent company Samsung BioLogics, a contract manufacturer of biologic drugs, Bioepis is at the center of the conglomerate’s latest push to secure a lead in biopharmaceuticals.

The Phase-III trial, dubbed CheckMate-026, investigated Opdivo as a therapy for previously untreated patients with non-small cell lung cancer and compared those patients to another group receiving chemotherapy, the standard of care. Opdivo failed to demonstrate that it was a superior treatment to chemotherapy in terms of progression-free survival. Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson gave the edge to Merck's competing treatment, Keytruda, saying that the drugmaker now will be allowed to promote its therapy as “the only one that has been proven to improve survival in first-line lung cancer,” in direct-to-consumer advertising. “This puts BMS on its back foot from a commercial perspective, as it tries to defends its franchise,” he noted. See also: As immuno-oncology therapies evolve, so will the marketing Keytruda will likely gain “significant” traction in the overall market, and that traction in the long-term could mean more combinations with chemotherapy agents or other immunoncology therapies over time, Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note. He added that Merck will “dominate” the first-line lung cancer market for at “least the next 12 months” in certain lung-cancer patients. Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst for Evercore ISI, wrote Friday that the first-line lung-cancer market is worth more than $12 billion. He estimates that Merck's current label for Keytruda in this setting opens the drug up to 30% of that market. Opdivo has been the market leader in terms of sales. Opdivo brought in $942 million in 2015, compared to Keytruda's $566 million. The marketing spend for Opdivo was also significantly higher last year, to the tune of $125.9 million for Opdivo compared to $7.3 million for Keytruda, according to Kantar Media. See also: Merck's Keytruda versus Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo The trial's failure is considered a serious disappointment by both Bristol-Myers Squibb's management and analysts. The misstep can be traced back to BMS' attempt to pursue the broadest possible label by including too vast a patient population in the study, which ultimately created a bigger risk. This setback will likely open the door for Keytruda to gain market share and pins Bristol-Myers Squibb's hopes for a first-line treatment on its combination trial studying Yervoy and Opdivo. That trial is not expected to be completed until January 2018. Anderson wrote in the same analyst note that “the missed result reflects the fact that BMS pushed the envelope too far in designing the trial.” Merck, on the other hand, studied a narrower patient population in its monotherapy for Keytruda — a move that increased its chance of success. BMS, for this trial, chose a population of patients with tumors that express a specific protein — PD-L1 — at levels equal to or greater than 5%. Merck, on the other hand, chose patients for its trial with much higher levels of expression: with 50% and greater expression of PD-L1. The level of PD-L1 within lung-cancer tumors is considered an important bellwether for how well immunoncology agents will perform.

(BRCD), Davita Inc (DVA) and Moneygram International Inc (MGI) Are 3 of Today’s Best Stocks View All Posts U.S. stocks closed slightly higher Tuesday after making another run at all-time highs. Gold rose, oil fell and 10-year Treasuries finished higher. Stocks notched modest gains Tuesday with the S&P 500 rising 0.04% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.02%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.24%. Overall, broader benchmarks did not do much Tuesday, but Chemours Co. (NYSE:CC), Endo International plc (NASDAQ:ENDP) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (NYSE:VRX) excited investors with big gains. Chemours Co. (CC) Chemours Co., previously a unit of E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE:DD), jumped 10.5% after the company reported second-quarter earnings that easily beat Wall Street estimates. On an adjusted basis, CC earned 27 cents during the June quarter. Analysts expected Chemours to post earnings of 17 cents per share. 9 Stocks to Buy That Will Sprint Past Everything Else CC’s revenue declined to $1.38 billion from $1.51 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected the chemicals maker to post revenue of $1.42 billion. CC said it has cut costs by $100 million and is improving margins, two primary concerns of investors regarding the company’s previously slumping shares. Endo International plc (ENDP) Shares of specialty healthcare company Endo International Plc surged 21.8% on more than five times the average daily volume after the company delivered second-quarter results that topped analysts’ expectations. ENDP reported an adjusted second-quarter profit of 86 cents per share. Analysts expected 74 cents a share. Endo’s revenue for the quarter was $921 million, ahead of the $863.9 million in sales Wall Street forecast. ENDP forecast full-year EPS of $4.50 to $4.80 on revenue of $3.87 billion to $4.03 billion. Endo “said it also saw sales growth for its drug Xiaflex, a drug used to treat adults with Dupuytren’s contracture, which causes a thickening and tightening of tissue under the skin in the hand,” according to CNBC. Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Embattled pharmaceuticals maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc soared 25.4% on more than quadruple the usual turnover after the company said it should be able to earn enough cash to keep it from violating its debt covenants. VRX said second-quarter adjusted earnings dropped to $1.40 a share. Analysts expected it to earn $1.48 per share. Valeant’s sales declined 11% to $2.42 billion. Apple Inc. (AAPL): How Much Does a Better Apple Watch Matter? However, there are signs of stability at the company, which has seen its shares lose about 90% over the past year. Importantly, VRX backed financial guidance, indicating it does not believe it will encounter problems keeping in line with bank covenants. VRX also said it could sell some non-core assets to reduce its heavy debt burden, reports the Wall Street Journal. At the time of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

MSD’s biosimilar drug MK-1293 references Lantus, an insulin-based diabetes treatment originally developed by Sanofi. Samsung Bioepis has contributed to MK-1293’s development as an investment partner to MSD. A Samsung Bioepis employee (Samsung Bioepis) MK-1293 is already undergoing a marketing authorization review by the European Medicines Agency, as MSD seeks to commercialize the drug in both the U.S. and Europe, the world’s two biggest markets for biosimilar drugs. Biosimilars refer to cheaper, near-replicas of biologic drugs which have lost patent protection. Sanofi’s formulation patent on Lantus, the company’s top-selling drug, expired last year in the U.S. and Europe. If approved, MK-1293 is expected to compete against not only Lantus but also a Lantus biosimilar developed by Eli Lilly, which has already secured approval from the FDA and EMA and is nearing commercialization. MK-1293, also known as SB9, stands as one of Samsung Bioepis’ six biosimilars that reference some of the world’s top biologic drugs -- Enbrel, Remicade, Humira, Avastin, Herceptin and Lantus. Two of them -- one based on Amgen’s Enbrel and another on Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade -- were approved in Europe earlier this year and have been commercialized in some countries in the region. Samsung Bioepis’ Humira biosimilar is awaiting marketing approval from the EMA while its two biosimilars referencing Avastin and Herceptin are currently undergoing phase three clinical trials. Samsung Bioepis is the biosimilars development unit of South Korean electronics giant Samsung Group. Alongside its parent company Samsung BioLogics, a contract manufacturer of biologic drugs, Bioepis is at the center of the conglomerate’s latest push to secure a lead in biopharmaceuticals.

VACCINE QUACKERY BOMBSHELL: Key studies cited to 'prove' vaccines are safe were funded almost entirely by vaccine manufacturers Tuesday, August 09, 2016 by Mike Adams, the Health Ranger Tags: vaccine science quackery, conflicts of interest, autism risk (NaturalNews) Are you surprised by blatant scientific fraud anymore? Every informed person in the world today knows that everything is rigged: the money system, government grants, news media, polls and elections, medicine and even science. In fact, over the last two decades, most "science" has become nothing more than a corrupt system of quackery, fraud, and corporate infiltration of the scientific establishment where "scientists" are turned into corporate prostitutes to fake whatever results produce the most profits. And now, thanks to Brian Hooker and the Alliance for Natural Health USA, we have yet another bombshell example of the outright quackery and science fakery of the vaccine industry. What you read here will probably not surprise you, but to most people who believe the vaccine propaganda and lies of the criminal medical establishment, these realizations are nothing short of bombshells. Scientists who are given loads of money by vaccine manufacturers just happen to conclude vaccines are always safeIn this critical review of the scientific literature on vaccines, ANH-USA and Brian Hooker carefully scrutinize the gross scientific flaws and blatant financial conflicts of interests that undermine the most commonly cited scientific studies which "prove" vaccines don't cause autism. In a startling percentage of these studies, the "scientists" were either directly funded by vaccine manufacturers who stood to profit from vaccine safety whitewashing or served as highly paid expert witnesses to defend vaccine makers against lawsuits. What we really see in this critical review is a systemic pattern of scientific fraud, criminal corruption and the complete abandonment of research ethics in the relentless quest to "prove" vaccines are safe (and thereby sell more of them to more vaccine victims). Here, I've reprinted just a few of the descriptions from the ANH-USA analysis. Click here for the full paper. As you read the highlights below, remind yourself that if vaccines are safe, then Hillary Clinton is a saint, chemical pesticides are good for you and mercury enhances brain function. Conflicts of interest galore!No evidence for measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine-associated inflammatory bowel disease or autism in a 14-year prospective study (1998) Authors: Peltola H, Patja A, Leinikki P, Valle M, Davidkin I, Paunio M. Conflicts of interest: This study was funded by Merck, which makes the current formulation (MMR-II) of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, and stands to profit from results that disprove any dangers. Mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine and the incidence of autism recorded by general practitioners: a time trend analysis (2001) Authors: Kaye JA, del Mar Melero-Montes M, Jick H. Conflicts of interest: The authors of this paper were residents at the Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program at Boston University School of Medicine. This program is supported in part by grants from AstraZeneca, Berlex Laboratories, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Boots Healthcare International, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, GlaxoSmithKline, Hoffmann-La Roche, Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, RW Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute, McNeil Consumer Products, and Novartis Farmaceutica. Funding for their residency program is directly tied to those profiting from the vaccine companies their claims protect. Neurologic disorders after measles, mumps, rubella vaccination (2002) Authors: Makela A, Nuorti JP, Peltola H. Conflicts of interest: Major MMR and MMR-II manufacturer Merck funded this study, and held a worldwide monopoly on these vaccines during the time of the research. Pervasive developmental disorders in Montreal, Quebec, Canada: prevalence and links with immunizations (2006) Authors: Fombonne E, Zakarian R, Bennett A, Meng L, McLean-Heywood D. Conflicts of Interest: The lead author of this study, Dr. Eric Fombonne, has significant conflicts of interest, as he has many times represented vaccine manufacturers as an expert witness in thimerosal litigation, opposing the families of vaccine injured children. Age at first measles-mumps-rubella vaccination in children with autism and school-matched control subjects: a population-based study in metropolitan Atlanta (2004) Authors: DeStefano F, Bhasin TK, Thompson WW, Yeargin-Allsopp M, Boyle C. Conflicts of interest: Two of these individuals were employees of the National Immunization Program of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is charged to increase immunization rates in the US in order to prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases. Thus there was a propensity against finding a causal relationship between vaccines and vaccine adverse events, which is demonstrated clearly in the text of the paper by the authors' faulty explanation when statistically significant relationships are observed. Dr. William Thompson, co-author of the paper and lead statistician with the CDC, has recently (August 2014) come forth with evidence of fraud committed specifically regarding this paper, and has launched a complaint against his co-authors regarding both the outcomes and the interpretations of the results of this study. A population-based study of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination and autism (2002) Authors: Madsen KM, Hviid A., Vestergaard M., Schendel D, Wohlfahrt J, Thorsen, P. Conflicts of interest: This study was funded by the National Immunization Program (NIP) at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which had a vested financial interest in increased uptake of the MMR vaccine, as it directly bought the vaccine from Merck and distributed it for reimbursement to the states' public health departments. Also, one of the co-authors of the study, Dr. Diana Schendel, was a CDC employee at the time of publication. In addition, three of the co-authors (Dr. Mads Melbye, Mr. Jan Wohlfahrt, and Mr. Anders Hviid) were employees of Staten Serum Institut, a for-profit company that manufactures and distributes vaccines in Denmark. Additional note: Another of the study authors, Poul Thorsen, is currently an international fugitive, wanted by law enforcement authorities for research fraud, money laundering and various crimes carried out in conjunction with the CDC. No evidence for a new variant of measles-mumps-rubella-induced autism (2001) Authors: Fombonne E, Chakrabarti S. Study's flaws: Comparing purposive samples to convenience samples is not a valid research method and therefore should not be relied upon to make inferences regarding the MMR vaccine and autism. The authors also do not list the source of the third convenience study, further calling into question the validity of the sample. Conflicts of interest: After this paper was published, lead author Dr. Fombonne violated scientific ethics at his post at Montreal Children's Hospital and McGill University when he improperly used samples derived from autistic children for another study unauthorized by their parents. Dr. Fombonne has also testified as an expert witness for vaccine manufacturers and against families with reportedly vaccine-injured children, both in civil courts and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for the US. MMR and autism: further evidence against a causal association (2001) Authors: Farrington CP, Miller E, Taylor B. Study's flaws: Despite the authors' claims, the data presented as evidence in the paper instead seems to actually confirm a temporal relationship between the MMR vaccine and the age of first diagnosis.

More news on vaccine science quackery Many medical journals have no policies regarding conflicts of interest in published research studies NaturalNews exposes secret vaccine industry ties and military involvement with Institute of Medicine, reveals fatal conflicts of interest at IoM European Parliament votes to ban industry-connected scientists from Food Safety Authority Conflict-of-interest training reduces brand-name antidepressant prescription Paul Offit is the George Stephanopoulos of the vaccine industry: refuses to disclose financial ties to industry FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg pushing to eliminate conflict of interest laws, allow paid drug company shills to fill advisory positions Nearly all EU scientists attacking new restrictions on toxic chemicals have financial ties to chemical industries About the author:Mike Adams (aka the "Health Ranger") is a best selling author (#1 best selling science book on Amazon.com) and a globally recognized scientific researcher in clean foods. He serves as the founding editor of NaturalNews.com and the lab science director of an internationally accredited (ISO 17025) analytical laboratory known as CWC Labs. There, he was awarded a Certificate of Excellence for achieving extremely high accuracy in the analysis of toxic elements in unknown water samples using ICP-MS instrumentation. Adams is also highly proficient in running liquid chromatography, ion chromatography and mass spectrometry time-of-flight analytical instrumentation. Adams is a person of color whose descendents include Africans and American Indians. He self-identifies as being of American Indian heritage, which he credits as inspiring his "Health Ranger" passion for protecting life and nature against the destruction caused by chemicals, heavy metals and other forms of pollution. Adams is the founder and publisher of the open source science journal Natural Science Journal, the author of numerous peer-reviewed science papers published by the journal, and the author of the world's first book that published ICP-MS heavy metals analysis results for foods, dietary supplements, pet food, spices and fast food. The book is entitled Food Forensics and is published by BenBella Books. In his laboratory research, Adams has made numerous food safety breakthroughs such as revealing rice protein products imported from Asia to be contaminated with toxic heavy metals like lead, cadmium and tungsten. Adams was the first food science researcher to document high levels of tungsten in superfoods. He also discovered over 11 ppm lead in imported mangosteen powder, and led an industry-wide voluntary agreement to limit heavy metals in rice protein products. In addition to his lab work, Adams is also the (non-paid) executive director of the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center (CWC), an organization that redirects 100% of its donations receipts to grant programs that teach children and women how to grow their own food or vastly improve their nutrition. Through the non-profit CWC, Adams also launched Nutrition Rescue, a program that donates essential vitamins to people in need. Click here to see some of the CWC success stories. With a background in science and software technology, Adams is the original founder of the email newsletter technology company known as Arial Software. Using his technical experience combined with his love for natural health, Adams developed and deployed the content management system currently driving NaturalNews.com. He also engineered the high-level statistical algorithms that power SCIENCE.naturalnews.com, a massive research resource featuring over 10 million scientific studies. Adams is well known for his incredibly popular consumer activism video blowing the lid on fake blueberries used throughout the food supply. He has also exposed "strange fibers" found in Chicken McNuggets, fake academic credentials of so-called health "gurus," dangerous "detox" products imported as battery acid and sold for oral consumption, fake acai berry scams, the California raw milk raids, the vaccine research fraud revealed by industry whistleblowers and many other topics. Adams has also helped defend the rights of home gardeners and protect the medical freedom rights of parents. Adams is widely recognized to have made a remarkable global impact on issues like GMOs, vaccines, nutrition therapies, human consciousness. In addition to his activism, Adams is an accomplished musician who has released over a dozen popular songs covering a variety of activism topics.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.24 or 0.08% to 18,529.29, suffering marginal losses one session after soaring more than 1% last Friday. Stocks failed to sustain momentum from Friday's rally brought about by a robust U.S. jobs report for the month of July that helped provide a considerable tailwind to slumping financial stocks. The NASDAQ Composite index lost 7.98 or 0.15% to 5,213.14, while the S&P 500 Composite index dipped by 1.98 or 0.09% to 2,180.89, each retreating from record closing highs from the prior session. On the S&P 500, stocks in six of 10 sectors closed in the red, as stocks in the Health Care, Telecom and Consumer Services industries lagged. Stocks in Energy and Basic Materials sectors led, each gaining more than 0.20% on the session. At session-highs, the S&P 500 hit a fresh all-time record intraday high of 2,185.44 on Monday morning. Meanwhile, the CBOE VIX Volatility Index inched up 0.11 to end Monday's session at 11.50. Last Friday, the Vix fell to a two-month low of 11.18, down sharply from a high of 14.24 on August 2. The lack of volatility on equity markets on Wall Street reflects the recent sideways trading of late, as investors have largely avoided bonds due to near-record low yields. The top performer on the Dow was Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), which gained 0.96 or 1.10% to 88.52. It came as U.S. crude futures jumped by nearly 3% to $43 a barrel, extending a weeklong rally from three-month lows hit early last week. The rebound was driven by bullish comments from OPEC president Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada on the possibility of an accord by the 14-member cartel at a meeting in Algeria in late-September aimed at stabilizing the volatile global energy market. U.S. crude futures are still down sharply from their June highs of $51 when WTI crude traded at a 10-month high. The worst performer was Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK), which lost 1.17 or 1.83% to 62.69. Shares in Merck retreated on Monday, one session after the pharmaceutical giant soared more than 10% after rival BMY reported disappointing results with a late stage clinical trial for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The developments could open a window for Merck to seize market share with sales of its drug Keytrada. Also on Monday, WMT shares fell slightly from 0.41 or 0.56% to 73.35 after the retail giant announced that it has closed on a $3 billion cash merger of Jet.com, marking the largest acquisition of a private e-commerce company on record. In addition, another $300 million in Walmart shares will be paid incrementally as part of the transaction, Walmart said in a statement. "We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that's what our customers want," said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), Inc. "We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities. Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we're pursuing will happen quicker, and we'll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time." The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Liberty Interactive Corp A (NASDAQ:QVCA), which added 0.78 or 3.78% to close at 21.39 on Monday. Shares in Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA), the parent company of home shopping network of QVC, crashed 21% on Friday after the Colorado-based media holdings company warned that it could be moving into a "choppy retail environment," marred by weakening consumer demand. The worst performer was Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY), which fell 2.80 or 3.08% to 88.04. Shares in the Delaware-based pharmaceutical company are still up by more than 30% over the last three months. On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 1,665-1,291 margin. Investing.com offers an extensive set of professional tools for the financial markets.

Kaufman was indicted Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2016 for stealing from a series of clients between 2009 and 2014. (Dale Omori, The Plain Dealer) Print Email John Harper, cleveland.com By John Harper, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 10, 2016 at 4:00 PM, updated August 10, 2016 at 4:01 PM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A Cuyahoga County grand jury indicted a former Cleveland attorney Wednesday for stealing money from his clients. Paul Kaufman, 67, is charged with 41 felony counts including theft and forgery. He resigned from his law practice in 2015 after numerous clients filed complaints with the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection. Victims were awarded $189,000 out of the fund. Kaufman, of Shaker Heights, now faces prison time if convicted of stealing from 15 clients. The attorney won the clients more than $215,000 in a class action settlement with drug maker Merck in 2009, the Cuyahoga County prosecutor says, but failed to distribute the funds to the plaintiffs in the settlement. Previously: Former Shaker Heights attorney's clients reimbursed for $189,000 "Attorneys like Paul Kaufman are why so many people look down on the legal profession," Assistant County Prosecutor James A. Gutierrez wrote in a news release. "He chose to ignore his responsibilities as a lawyer and to cheat his clients, and now he is going to have answer for those crimes." The Ohio Supreme Court suspended Kaufman's law license last year. In its order, the court writes that Kaufman "has engaged in conduct that violates the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct and poses a substantial threat of serious harm to the public." Calls to Kaufman's listed phone number were not answered Wednesday afternoon. He is scheduled to be arraigned in Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas on Aug. 24.

Soptelean The Valley Banner ELKTON — Mold found throughout the Elkton Municipal Building led the town council to close the historic building last week. With councilmembers Joshua Gooden and Jeff Jones absent during an emergency meeting on Wednesday, Aug. 3, council voted 4-0 to move the employees out of the building as soon as possible. Town staff were relocated to space in the Elkton Area Community Center on Blue and Gold Drive on Thursday, Aug. 4. As of Monday, about half of the computers and other equipment had been moved, Printz said. During the emergency meeting, council heard from Mike Delaney, owner of Servpro in Harrisonburg. Delaney was hired after a pipe burst and flooded the basement of the municipal building and forced the town’s Police Department to relocate to the EACC three weeks ago. The municipal building, which was built in 1840 for Dr. Simeon B. Jennings and served as a Confederate hospital during the Civil War, is located between Rockingham Street and Spotswood Avenue. It was donated to the town by Merck & Company in 1964. “There’s mold on all levels of the house, and there probably has been for ... years. It will be quite expensive to do everything that building needs,” Delaney said, adding that it can be fixed but wondered if council should spend the money to do so. “How much money do you want to put into that old house?” he asked. Delaney said the town’s insurance with the Virginia Municipal League covers $15,000 for mold, but added that the town would have to spend additional money to fix the problem. “Most of the walls in the basement need to be taken down,” he said. The town has not yet received an estimate on the repairs, but Public Works Director Troy Shifflett guessed it would cost around $200,000 to rebuild walls in the basement and set up a barrier outside. He said that mold was being spread throughout the building by an old air conditioning unit. In response to questions from council about how the mold would affect town employees, Delaney said everyone reacts differently, i.e. some are affected and some aren’t. “The Harrisonburg city offices were pretty bad for a long, long time in their old building,” he said. Delaney recommended town employees wear an N95 mask when inside the building. Such a mask can be purchased from Lowe’s or Home Depot, he said, adding that events can still be held outside the building. Air scrubbers could be seen and heard buzzing and blowing air out of the basement on the building on Tuesday, Aug. 2, during a National Night Out event, which was held on the building’s porch and lawn facing Rockingham Street. In response to a question from Councilman Gerry “Bootie” Comer, Delaney said the town can sell the historic building without fixing it as long as it notifies the buyer of any issues. “People sell houses all the time as is,” he said. The value of the 1.37-acre property at 173 W. Spotswood Ave. is $559,300, according to the Rockingham County GIS website. That includes $120,000 for the land and $439,300 for improvements. “God gave us this opportunity to fix this thing,” Printz said, referring to the water pipe that burst. He added that protecting the town’s employees is the council’s top priority. The property is one of the few remaining architectural treasures left in our community, Printz said. “The building will not be harmed in any way and will be respected for the historical significance and personal fondness we all have for it,” he said via email. “Town council members and I are carefully considering every option moving forward and are eager to hear input from residents and civic organizations regarding the next chapter for one of Elkton’s most beloved landmarks,” he added.

He is credited with founding the field of femtochemistry, which probes the mechanics of chemical reactions using laser pulses lasting just tens of femtoseconds (1 femtosecond is 10–15 s). An Egyptian-born US citizen working at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Zewail was the first Arab to win a science Nobel. He championed science education and research in his native country and founded the Zewail City of Science and Technology, a university that opened its doors to students in 2012 near Cairo. Raheb Homavandi/Reuters Iran executes scientist Shahram Amiri, an Iranian nuclear scientist, has been hanged for espionage, his country’s officials announced on 7 August. Amiri said that he had been abducted by the CIA during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in 2009, and taken to the United States to be interrogated and tortured. But the US government denied that, and US media alleged that he had been a paid informant who defected voluntarily. He returned to Iran in 2010 and was later convicted of passing secrets about Iran’s nuclear activities to the United States. Iran has maintained that its nuclear programme has only peaceful purposes. Amiri was reportedly an isotope researcher at the Malek-Ashtar University of Technology in Tehran. RESEARCH Cancer drug fails A promising lung-cancer drug failed in a key clinical trial, sending stock in the drug’s developer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, tumbling by 17% on 5 August. The drug, called Opdivo (nivolumab), is one of a suite of new cancer therapies that release immune responses against tumours by blocking a protein called PD-1. Opdivo has been shown to benefit some people with advanced cancers, including lung cancer. But Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is based in New York City, announced last week that Opdivo had failed as a front-line therapy for lung cancer. Stock in a competing firm, Merck of Kenilworth, New Jersey, rose 10% after the news. Turkish purge The Turkish research agency TÜBİTAK in Ankara has removed 139 staff from their posts, pending investigations into their possible connections with the Gülen movement, which President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan claims was behind the country’s attempted coup last month. A further 28 staff have resigned, according to statements by Turkish science minister Faruk Özlü on 5 August. TÜBİTAK, which helps to design the country’s research policy and distributes grant money, has previously been purged. In 2014, agency engineers were dismissed after they declared that incriminating recordings of allegedly tapped telephone conversations between Erdoğan and his son — which Erdoğan said were fabricated — were not manipulated. Mosquito trial The US Food and Drug Administration announced on 5 August that a proposed Florida field test of genetically modified mosquitoes poses few risks to the environment or human health. The announcement clears the way for the board of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District to allow the release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying a gene that kills the insects’ offspring, in an effort to control diseases they transmit, including dengue and Zika viruses. Local residents will vote in a non-binding referendum, currently slated for November, before the board decides whether to go ahead with the trial. POLICY Data push-back A coalition of researchers has rebuffed a proposal to share clinical-trial data rapidly. In February, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) proposed that clinical-trial leaders should make the de-identified patient data that underlie a journal article public within six months of publication. The 282 signatories to an article published on 4 August in The New England Journal of Medicine said that the ICMJE proposal was too burdensome and would have unintended consequences, such as delaying publication of results (N. Engl. J. Med. 375, 405–407; 2016). They said that researchers should have at least two years — but up to five — to make data public. US climate rule The White House released a sweeping new climate policy on 2 August, instructing all federal agencies, from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Transportation, to consider the impacts of their actions on climate change from now on. The agencies are also required to quantify those impacts, mainly in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions. The policy comes from the White House Council on Environmental Quality, which was established in 1969 to advise agencies when they are preparing environmental-impact statements. EVENTS Private Moonshot A private mission to the Moon has been approved for the first time, by the US government. Moon Express, a company in Cape Canaveral, Florida, announced on 3 August that it had been given permission to travel beyond Earth’s orbit and put a robotic lander on the Moon in 2017. Moon Express was founded in 2010 by three technology entrepreneurs, and is one of the companies competing for the Google Lunar XPRIZE; the competition will award US$20 million to the first company to land a privately funded spacecraft on the Moon. Moon Express is yet to finish building its MX-1 lander (pictured, artist’s impression). Courtesy of Moon Express Missing vaccines An investigation by the Associated Press has reported that 1 million yellow-fever vaccines sent in February by the World Health Organization and its partners to tackle a large outbreak in Angola cannot be accounted for. Six million vaccines were sent in total. Of those that can be traced, some were sent to regions where there was no yellow fever; others were improperly stored, or arrived without the syringes to administer them, according to the 5 August report. The agencies involved have responded that a wastage of around 10% is expected in mass-vaccination campaigns for yellow fever — and Angolan officials have denied that any vaccines went missing. Goodnight Yutu China’s moon rover Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, was officially declared dead by state officials on 3 August. It arrived on the Moon in December 2013, and was intended to carry out a three-month exploration of the lunar surface, but it survived for more than two years before going dark for the last time. The six-wheeled, solar-powered rover was struck by mechanical difficulties in early 2014, but had already used its penetrating radar to probe the structure of the lunar soil to a depth of more than 100 metres, and sent back data and high-resolution images to Earth. The mission made China the third country to land a craft on the Moon, after the United States and the Soviet Union. APS moves meeting A division of the American Physical Society (APS) has voted to move its 2018 annual meeting from its originally planned location of Charlotte, North Carolina, as a result of a state law, enacted in March, that forces transgender people to use only toilets that correspond to their sex at birth. The chair of the APS Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics said that it wanted to “provide a welcoming environment for all members”. The APS, which made the statement on 4 August, will hold its conference in Florida instead. Zika in Cuba Cuba has discovered two cases of locally acquired Zika-virus infection, the nation’s health ministry announced on 4 August. The country’s preventive campaigns had been largely successful in staving off infections, with only 30 imported cases identified in Cuba this year, and only one previous locally transmitted case, in March. On 3 August, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the first clinical trial of a Zika vaccine, which it plans to test in 80 healthy volunteers. NIH officials say that the vaccine will probably not be ready for deployment until 2018. FUNDING Climate-cut U-turn Australia’s government has ordered its national science agency to re-prioritize basic climate research, six months after the organization unveiled controversial plans to slash jobs in the sector. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) will — on government instructions — create 15 new climate-science jobs and receive an extra Aus$37 million (US$28 million) over the next 10 years, science minister Greg Hunt announced on 4 August. But the intervention may have come too late to repair damage already caused, researchers say. See go.nature.com/2akgeyp for more. TREND WATCH Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are the rising stars of model-organism research, an analysis of grants from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) finds. A team at the NIH Office of Portfolio Analysis used text mining and manual searching to assess successful applications for R01 awards, the NIH’s main grant programme for individual investigators. Whereas the proportions of grants allocated to zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans studies rose between 2008 and 2015, the fraction for research with Xenopus frogs fell.

(NYSE: MRK) demonstrated in its similar Keynote-024 trial. Anderson continued that Brisol-Myers could still receive a "compendia listing" for its drug which "would garner the company some market share in the 1L setting." The analyst added, "Beyond this data set, it is also important to know how PDx/CTLA4 (BMY and AZN) and PDx/chemotherapy (many companies) combination trials read out – much of this should begin to surface in 2017. On the former, the analyst community widely expects positive results and argues this will salvage BMY's efforts in 1L lung. However, Friday's news teaches that the industry is still moving up the IO learning curve, meaning that surprises (both positive and negative) can occur." Anderson further stated there are too many unknowns and predicting the longer-term market share winner is a "challenger." However, the near-term picture is "clearer" as Merck's drug will become the market leader in 1L lung at the expense of Bristol-Myer's. In fact, Merck's ramp in 1L lunch "should be fast" and "this will manifest first in the US, with an inflection point almost certainly occurring before year-end." Shares of Merck remain Outperform rated with a price target raised to $74 from a previous $66. Shares of Bristol-Myers remain Market Perform rated with a price target lowered to $65 from a previous $79.

The data showed softening of inflation to the lowest level of the year in July. Meanwhile, the dollar is firmer and commodities are mostly lower. With the reporting season slowly and steadily winding down, trader focus is likely to shift to the economy. A report released earlier in the day showed an unexpected decline in non-farm productivity and a sharp rise in unit labor costs. Among the overseas markets, Asia had a mixed outing, while the European markets had looked up to the Chinese inflation data and that the scope it offers for stimulus boost and some domestic data on German trade data and U.K. Industrial output. Given the overbought levels of the U.S. markets, any optimism could be under-laced with caution.   U.S. stocks retreated on Monday, as valuation concerns, aggravated by weak Chinese trade data, led to weakness.     The major averages opened higher but reversed course and fell below the unchanged line in late morning trading. Thereafter, the indexes languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before ending lower. The Dow Industrials ended down 14.24 points or 0.08 percent at 18,529, the S&P 500 Index closed 1.98 points or 0.09 percent lower at 2,181 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at 5,213, down 7.98 points or 0.15 percent.    Seventeen of the thirty Dow components closed lower for the session, while the remaining thirteen stocks gained ground. Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) came under selling pressure, but Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Caterpillar (CAT) moved to the upside.    Among the sectors, oil service stocks rose notably. On the other hand, biotechnology stocks came under selling pressure.    Currency, Commodity Markets   Crude oil futures for September delivery are edging up $0.03 to $43.05 a barrel after climbing $1.22 to $43.02 a barrel in the previous session. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is currently trading at $1,337.50, down $3.80 from the previous session's close of $1,341.30. On Monday, gold fell $3.10.    On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 102.12 yen compared to the 102.45 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1076 compared to yesterday's $1.1088. Asia   The Asian markets ended mixed, with the Hong Kong, Indian, Indonesian and Malaysian markets retreating while the rest of the markets advanced. The mixed sentiment came about as traders digested the negative close on Wall Street overnight and Chinese inflation data.    The Japanese market advanced, as the yen weakened. The Nikkei 225 Index saw nervousness for much of the morning before moving decisively higher in the afternoon. The index ended up 114.40 points or 0.69 percent at more than a 2-week high of 16,765.    Export, financial, food, chemical, pharma and resource stocks ended mostly higher, while construction and utility stocks retreated.    Australia's All Ordinaries Index also experienced volatility in the morning but moved higher in the afternoon. At the close of trading, the index was up 11 points or 0.20 percent at 5,637. Telecom, energy and financial stocks gained ground, helping to offset weakness in the consumer, healthcare, industrial, material, IT, real estate and utility spaces.    China's Shanghai Composite Index added 21.40 points or 0.71 percent before ending at 3,026, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended down 29.15 points or 0.13 percent at 22466.    On the economic front, inflation in China slowed to 1.8 percent in July from 1.9 percent in June, the National Bureau of Statistics reported. The rate was in line with expectations and marked the lowest since December 2015. However, on a monthly basis, inflation was at 0.2 percent, the first positive reading in 5 months.    A separate report showed that the pace of year-over-year decline in Chinese producer prices slowed to 1.7 percent from 2.6 percent. Economists expected a drop of 2 percent.    The National Australia Bank reported that confidence among businesses in Australia ebbed in July, with the corresponding indicator at 4 compared to 5 in June. The business conditions index also fell to 8 from 11.    The Reserve Bank of India left its key interest rates unchanged at the final rate-setting meeting chaired by Governor Raghuram Rajan. The move was attributed to the need for accommodative policy even as headline inflation pushes on the seams of a 2-year high and poses upside risks.    Europe   After an uncertain start, stocks in Europe have moved higher, tracking the tame Chinese inflation data, fairly inane domestic corporate and economic news flow.    In major corporate news, Munich Re reported weak results for its second quarter but maintained its profit forecast for the full year. AstraZeneca announced that the Phase III SELECT-1 trial of Selumetinib did not meet primary endpoint in patients with KRAS mutation-positive or KRASm locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer or NSCLC.     On the economic front, data released by the German Federal Statistical Office showed that German exports rose a calendar and seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent month-over-month in June, reversing the 1.8 percent drop in May. Imports were up 1 percent following an unchanged performance in May. The trade surplus rose to 24.9 billion euros from 23.9 billion euros last month, above the 23 billion euro-surplus expected by economists.     Two separate reports released by the U.K. Office for National Statistics showed that U.K. industrial output unexpectedly rose month-over-month in June, although manufacturing output fell more than expected. Meanwhile, the U.K.'s visible trade deficit widened in June, as import growth outpaced export growth.  U.S. Economic Reports With hours worked increasing by more than output, the Labor Department released a report showing an unexpected decline in U.S. labor productivity in the second quarter. The report showed that productivity fell by 0.5 percent in the second quarter after sliding by 0.6 percent in the first quarter. The decrease came as a surprise to economists, who had expected productivity to climb by 0.5 percent. Meanwhile, the Labor Department said unit labor costs surged up by 2.0 percent in the second quarter after edging down by a revised 0.2 percent in the first quarter. Economists had expected labor costs to climb by 1.8 percent compared to the 4.5 percent jump that had been reported for the previous quarter.    The Commerce Department is due to release its wholesale inventories report for June at 10 am ET. Economists expect unchanged inventory levels in June compared to the previous month.    The May report revealed a 0.1 percent month-over-month uptick compared to expectations for a 0.2 percent increase. At the same time, wholesale sales rose 0.5 percent.    The Treasury is set to announce the results of its auction of 3-year notes at 1 pm ET.    Stocks in Focus   CAI International (CAI) reported below-consensus adjusted earnings per share for its second quarter, but its revenues beat estimates.    Computer Sciences (CSC) reported better than expected first quarter adjusted earnings per share and revenues. Updating on its impending merger with the enterprise segment of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), the company said it is proceeding as per plan and is likely to close in late March 2017.     Hertz Global (HTZ), which recently spun-off its equipment rental business, reported better than expected second quarter adjusted earnings per share and its revenues were in line. The company's full year adjusted earnings per share guidance was also in line.    Manitowoc (MTW) reported in line bottom line results for its second quarter, but its revenues missed estimates. The company also lowered its full year revenue guidance.    Microchip (MCHP) reported better than expected first quarter adjusted earnings per share, but its revenues were below estimates. The company's revenue guidance for the second quarter was positive.    New Corp.'s (NWS) fourth quarter results beat estimates.  Valeant Pharma (VRX) reported below-consensus second quarter results but it confirmed its full year guidance. Coach (COH) said it expects double-digit growth in earnings per share growth and low-mid single digit revenue growth for 2017 after reporting better than expected second quarter bottom line results.   Disney (DIS), Healthways (HWAY), Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC), Mylan Labs (MYL), SunPower (SPWR), ViaSat (VSAT) and Yelp (YELP) are among the companies due to release their quarterly results after the close of trading. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Worst IPO flops of 2016 Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Offices Of Samsung, Pension Fund Raided Over Scandal Involving President Infineon Sees Higher FY17 Revenues, Raises Margin View, Despite Weak Q4 Profit Volkswagen Brand Focuses On Electric Cars, US In Transformation Plan Twitter Suspends CEO Jack Dorsey's Account Briefly HP Q4 Profit Meets View - Update What's In The Offing For These Biotech Stocks?

Embrace the Breakout in ConocoPhillips (COP) Stock iShares Russell 2000 Index (ETF) (IWM): Our Year-End Target View All Posts Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) shares have dropped nearly 20% since Friday’s open after the company said a trial for once-promising lung cancer drug Opdivo failed. The technical damage in the near-term on the charts of BMY stock is significant. However, Squibb shares are arriving at a promising support zone, where either buying stock or selling options spreads might just make you a pretty penny. Investors and traders in pharmaceutical stocks — and particularly those in the biotechnology industry — are well-aware of what can happen to a stock after a surprising drug trial failure or success. Through that lens, the big two-day drawdown in BMY stock isn’t exactly a massive surprise. But given the size of Bristol-Myers Squibb, this selloff does look to be somewhat overdone. In reaction to the negative news out of Bristol-Myers shares of competitor Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) rallied strongly last Friday as its competitor drug to Opdivo now becomes the focus of hope. BMY Stock Charts Starting off with the multiyear picture, we see that as a result of the two-day selloff, BMY stock has now broken below its 2013 support line and the orderly uptrending channel. Just two days ago, Bristol-Myers Squibb was trading near the very upper end of this channel and is threatening to break this multiyear channel. Note that the lower end of the channel also lines up with the blue 100-week simple moving average, thus creating a technical confluence support zone around the low to mid-$60s. 7 Stocks to Buy for the Federal Reserve Rate Hike Importantly, however, while this trading channel is now broken on a daily closing basis, on a weekly closing basis, the channel has not yet broken. In other words, there is still hope that, come this Friday, BMY shares rally a little and close the week back inside the lower support line of this channel. And there’s plenty of precedence for this. Click to Enlarge On the daily chart, we see that while this so far two-day drop in BMY stock has sliced right through and below the stock’s medium-term moving averages, Squibb is now also arriving at a better horizontal technical support area, which I marked with the gray box. This support area has held as support since late 2014 and spans from around $58 up to about $61. Click to Enlarge Also note that the two-day selling spree so far has led to a rally in implied volatility in Bristol-Myers Squibb’s options. Option sellers that think downside in BMY stock is floored for the next few weeks can take advantage by selling out-of-the-money puts or put spreads. More directional traders could look to leg into partial long positions in BMY itself and adding to it upon a notable bullish reversal. Should the stock close below the $58 meaningfully on a weekly closing basis, the trajectory of the stock could point lower still. Like what you see?

Thinkstock "Then the reality is you need to then manage the data around those 12 individuals and then it comes down to scope, scale and size," notes Clark Golestani, CIO of Merck. Sometimes, if there is a small amount of information company officials need to work with, "paper may be the most efficient method," he says. If it's a larger amount of data, "putting in a locally based system will be necessary." And there are other global challenges, like how to handle systems that capture information about customers through all forms of communication -- especially in highly regulated industries like healthcare. IT also has to, of course, grapple with issues that are more technical than regulatory, especially in countries with less-developed infrastructures. "So you've got the technical challenge of network availability and network stability and power availability and stability," Golestani says. "I think those actually are easier to [solve] with technology than the information privacy aspects, because one can employ all sorts of technical techniques to build robustness into the technology."

Natural News investigates astonishing pattern of blatant scientific fraud across federal agencies Tuesday, August 09, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: scientific fraud, federal agencies, special interests (NaturalNews) Longtime readers are very familiar with our record of focusing on fraud and abuse in the scientific community. But if you're new to Natural News, you may not yet know that we are extremely dedicated not only to promoting legitimate science and research, but also to rooting out and exposing scientific corruption, especially when your tax dollars are involved. As such, we've taken a comprehensive look at scientific fraud committed by our government, and have found that there are some patterns: Phony research tends to support political and/or corporate agendas. That is, if the government has taken a certain position on an issue, its agencies are then tasked with conducting "research" which "proves" that the government's position is the correct one. The same is true with research pertaining to private sector corporations, which of course are major donors to political candidates from both major parties. Whatever scientific results the corporate masters want, they get. In no particular order, here are some of the most common topics and issues subject to government scientific malpractice: Climate change/global warmingSince the mid-1970s, the U.S. government has used the issue of climate as a tool to essentially force social change. As part of an overall effort to induce the populace to depend more on government for their existence, "scientific evidence" has been mass-produced in such a way as to drive local, state and federal policies that enable the government to achieve its goal of more collectivism and less individualism and freedom. But that's just within our country. More broadly, the global warming hoax is part of Agenda 21, which is a master plan, for lack of a better term, to replace individual governments and political systems with a series of panels and commissions made of global elites and their minions.[1] Agenda 21 "is the blueprint, it is the action plan, to inventory and control all land, all water, all plants, all minerals, all construction, all animals, all means of production, all energy, all information and all the human beings in the world," says Rosa Koire, an anti-Agenda 21 activist. "It is a completely comprehensive plan, it's global and it's implemented locally... It is in every single town all across the United States and across the world."[2] There is no doubting that. So-called "green energy" policies and those that deal with air, water, soil and so on, are all part of the master plan, implemented by state and local functionaries and elected officials who are true believers, even if they don't know the big picture. And all of this is supported with phony science. One of the most popular and well-worn lies is that "97 percent" of all climate scientists agree with the premise that modern man is destroying the planet with technology (hence the changing weather). But no matter how many times the White House and government agencies say so, it remains a myth. Not only that, but the government's own environmental and atmospheric agencies are perpetuating the lie by manipulating climate data. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, along with NASA, have both fabricated data, most recently ahead of a global climate meeting in Paris. Plus, a hack in 2009 exposed climate change fraud at a respected university in England. Vaccine-caused autism For years, the government has denied there is any evidence linking the mumps, measles and rubella vaccine to autism. But in 2014, a scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention admitted that he and other researchers at the CDC covered up evidence that the link exists. This, years after respected Dr. Andrew Wakefield found the connection and published his research, only to see it retracted after Big Pharma, government and others with vested interests in seeing populations continually vaccinated no matter the dangers went on the warpath. The Vioxx scandal In 2005, Dr. David Graham, a scientist with the Food and Drug Administration, admitted that his own agency was incapable of protecting the citizenry from dangerous and harmful drugs. In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Graham said that since the disaster involving Vioxx, which was released in 1999 as a medication designed as a potent pain reliever, the agency had not changed one iota. Vioxx, which was manufactured by Merck, was linked to a fourfold increased risk of heart attacks, according to the company's own internal study – findings the company would later dispute. It was eventually pulled from the market only months after the FDA approved it, but according to Graham, a 20-year FDA employee, the mindset at the agency is all wrong for the approval process. "The organizational structure within the [Center for Drug Evaluation Research] is currently geared towards the review and approval of new drugs," he said in a media interview. "When a serious safety issue arises at post marketing, the immediate reaction is almost always one of denial, rejection and heat. They approved the drugs, so there can't possibly be anything wrong with it. This is an inherent conflict of interest." He added: "I would argue that the FDA as currently configured is incapable of protecting America against another Vioxx. Simply put, FDA and the Center for Drug Evaluation Research (CDER) are broken." Toxic lead in water The vast majority of Americans depend on public systems for their drinking water, but the truth is, many systems around the country contain unacceptable levels of toxins, far and above what is mandated by the agency responsible for ensuring that water is clean – the Environmental Protection Agency. As proven by Mike Adams, the Health Ranger and director of the Consumer Wellness Center Labs, samples of local drinking water were found to contain unsafe levels of heavy metals like copper, arsenic and lead. Adams' testing followed the shocking discovery last year that dramatically unsafe levels of lead were found in the public water system feeding the Michigan city of Flint. There, the EPA – along with the state's environmental agency – failed citizens repeatedly through inaction and incompetence. While some state officials were held to account, no one at the federal level – meaning, no one in the EPA – was held responsible. The regional director, Susan Hedman, was allowed to resign and slink away from the mess. The Flint episode took place after another EPA-caused disaster in August 2015. Then, highly toxic water escaped from the abandoned Gold King mine in Colorado, after an EPA contractor ruptured a wall that was holding back millions of gallons of yellow-colored, contaminated water. The resulting spill caused a yellow stream of toxic sludge that eventually flowed through Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, via the Animas and San Juan rivers. That spill, one group estimated, could cost taxpayers upwards of $30 billion to clean up. FDA collusion with Monsanto One of the largest agribusiness companies in the world – Monsanto – is also one of the most influential inside the U.S. government. Monsanto is the developer of the widely-used herbicide Roundup, which contains the chemical glyphosate, which the World Health Organization has said "probably" causes cancer. In addition, Monsanto is king of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which have been linked to toxic effects on plants, animals and the soil. The company has also opposed efforts in the United States to require the labeling of GMO foods. But perhaps the most nefarious thing about Monsanto is its influence on U.S. government policy, which it has been able to affect literally by infiltrating the FDA with one of its own, Michael Taylor. An attorney whose firm worked with the company as a client, and who later joined as vice president for public policy, Taylor has worked for the FDA in both the Clinton and Obama administrations. Though he left the FDA in June, it wasn't before he steered passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act, a measure that handed more authority to the FDA without really improving "food safety." In addition, it was a boon for Monsanto, because it gave the company a near monopoly on seeds by criminalizing seed-saving, something farmers have been doing since the earliest days of organized agriculture. In addition, President Obama has just signed into law legislation that makes the labeling of GMO foods a voluntary act, and only then through hard-to-understand digital coding. The new federal statute effectively blanks state laws that actually required food companies to disclose – as in label – all genetically modified ingredients in their foods. Now Monsanto and other food and chemical companies will no longer have to spend tens of millions on advertising to defeat state-level GMO labeling regulations. The DEA and medical marijuana Though the Obama administration has chosen not to enforce existing federal laws criminalizing the recreational use of marijuana in states, the Drug Enforcement Administration has long blocked research into the health benefits of medical marijuana. Even though cannabis has a long history of medicinal use the world over, the federal government has made up its mind that in every instance pot is bad, and it doesn't matter what the facts are. As for the DEA, it gained substantial power to enforce the nation's prohibition against all uses of marijuana via the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Obama's decision not to enforce laws passed in Colorado and Washington permitting regulated recreational use of marijuana is just a patch; the next president may or may not follow his lead. Congress should pass legislation decriminalizing all uses of marijuana – that is the only fix that makes sense, in terms of what the facts are about cannabis, and as a way to dramatically reduce the power of deadly Mexican drug cartels. Conclusions Without question, big business, special interests, flawed, faked science and institutional bias guide many of the federal government's policies. Most agencies are subject to outside influences, and all of them bend to the political will of the Executive Branch that controls them. If the White House says global warming/climate change is real and being caused by too many SUVs, then that's the gospel truth – no matter what the real data show. If Monsanto wants to influence agricultural and food policies, it simply infiltrates one of its own into a high government policy position. If the government decides cannabis doesn't provide any health benefits at all, then that's the way it is. And so on. The bottom line is this: Our government and its various agencies are no longer for sale. They were bought and paid for long ago.

Photo: Satish Kaushik/Mint New Delhi: Mint brings to you your daily dose of legal news. A look at some interesting issues that are likely to be taken up on Tuesday. Constitutionality of entry tax A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court will continue hearing a question of validity of entry tax levied by state governments on goods. Several companies, including Vedanta Aluminium Ltd, Essar Steel Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd and Adani Enterprises Ltd contended that the entry tax provisions violate the right to free trade and commerce, guaranteed under the Constitution. Read more NEET: Plea alleging paper leak The apex court is set to hear a plea asking the court to intervene and seek a status report into the allegations that questions of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for medical colleges were leaked. The apex court was responsible for the first NEET to happen this year in two phases. Read more Alleged irregularities in clinical trials of cervical cancer vaccines The Supreme Court will hear a case relating to alleged irregularities in clinical trials conducted for cervical cancer prevention vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, manufactured by pharmaceuticals major Merck Sharpe and Dohme, respectively. The case was stuck in a limbo since January last year after the court had asked the government to place before the court the report of parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare. A question whether the court can review a report of the parliamentary standing committee is also under question. Govt petition against Sesa Sterlite merger The apex court will hear a bunch of cases related to the merger between iron ore miner Sesa Goa Ltd and copper producer Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd, earlier called Sesa Sterlite Ltd (now Vedanta). The ministry of corporate affairs, which first moved the court in 2014, contended that the merger was designed to evade taxes. The income-tax department also joined the case later. The court agreed to hear the case in detail in January 2015. Read more Prasar Bharati feed sharing case The Supreme Court will also hear the case regarding mandatory feed sharing by private broadcasters with state-run Prasar Bharati. Under the Sports Broadcasting Signals (Mandatory Sharing with Prasar Bharati) Act, broadcasters are required to compulsorily share signals of sporting events of national importance with the public broadcaster. However, private broadcasters like Star India, who have made significant investments for the rights to broadcast, seek exemption from sharing these signals with private cable operators. Read more Plea seeking app-based taxis to switch to CNG The Delhi high court will hear a case brought by the Association of Radio Taxi, bringing to the court’s notice that Ola is plying diesel vehicles in Delhi in violation of Supreme Court orders, the Radio Taxi Scheme, 2006 and City Taxi Scheme of 2015. Read more: http://bit.ly/2b96Px7 On 29 July 2015, justice Manmohan Singh of the Delhi high court directed strict enforcement of the 1 January state government order banning app-based cab services until they complied with the guidelines. From time to time, the court’s orders were sought to be enforced. On 14 October 2015, the court extended the companies a breather and allowed them to ply diesel-run taxis from point to point in the national capital till 1 March 2016, by when they will have to shift completely to compressed natural gas (CNG). Read more Since then, companies such as Meru and Ola have been seeking extension from the court to fully effect the conversion to CNG.

Meet the Contributors → Heron Gains FDA Support For Nausea Drug After A Year Under Review David Holley August 10th, 2016 @xconholley @xconomy Like Us Xconomy San Francisco —  The decision that Heron Therapeutics has been waiting on for almost a year is finally in: The FDA has approved the Redwood City, CA-based company’s drug for nausea and vomiting associated with certain chemotherapy regimens. Heron (NASDAQ: HRTX) first submitted a new drug application for the treatment, granisetron (Sustol), to the FDA in September 2015. The regulatory agency extended its expected decision date three times, most recently in April. Now, with the approval in hand, Heron says it hopes to begin selling the drug in the fourth quarter of this year. Granisetron is an extended-release, injectable drug that aims to help cancer patients—particularly those with breast cancer—deal with both immediate and delayed nausea and vomiting resulting from chemotherapy, for up to five days. The drug works to counter the side effects of a couple of the most commonly prescribed types of chemotherapy, such as anthracycline and cyclophosphamide combinations, Heron says. The company’s stock rose about 9.8 percent from yesterday’s closing price, to $21.80, as of 9:57 a.m. in New York. Waltham, MA-based Tesaro won approval in September 2015 for another anti-nausea drug being sold as rolapitant (Varubi), which ran into trouble after it missed clinical goals in the first two of its three late-stage trials. The company’s third attempt at a Phase 3 trial hit all of its primary and secondary goals, as Xconomy previously reported. There are a number of other drugs that aim to aid patients with chemo-induced nausea, including Merck’s aprepitant (Emend) and palonosetron (Aloxi), which is marketed and distributed by Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai. In its news release, Heron says it aims to make granisetron stand out by noting its ability to potentially protect patients for up to five days. In particular, Heron says that other drugs, “including palonosetron, are generally effective for 48 hours or less.” On the palonosetron website, the drug is touted as being used to treat nausea on the day of chemo, as well as up to five days following chemotherapy. Heron didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on pricing of the newly approved drug. David Holley is Xconomy's national correspondent based in Austin, TX.

Pharmaceutical companies usually are involved in a lengthy process in getting their drug candidates to market through clinical trials. There is a fair amount of risk involved, should a study come back negative or a candidate not be approved. Conversely, if a drug is approved or passes a clinical trial, there can be big upside. Drug prices may be under pressure due to the campaign rhetoric and under scrutiny, but if generic drugs are going to keep increasing in market share of existing drugs, then there would seem to be a reason for owning major pharmaceuticals. The July 29 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and for most of the selected pharmaceutical stocks, short interest was down. A reminder: short sellers betting against big pharma are taking on an added risk. They have to pay out the ongoing high dividends on top of the cost of borrowing the shares. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) saw its short interest increase slightly to 47.81 million shares from the previous 47.67 million. Shares of Pfizer closed Tuesday at $35.08, within a 52-week trading range of $28.25 to $37.19. Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) had a fall in short interest to 28.37 million shares, from 32.06 million in the previous period. Its shares closed Tuesday at $62.49, in a 52-week range of $45.69 to $64.00. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA) short interest decreased to 20.81 million shares. The previous level was 22.34 million. Shares closed Tuesday at $53.45, in a 52-week range of $48.01 to $70.09. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY) saw its short interest decrease to 14.06 million shares from the previous reading of 17.42 million. Shares closed Tuesday at $61.61, within a 52-week range of $51.82 to $77.12. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) short interest fell to 50.88 million shares, compared to the previous 60.57 million. Shares of AbbVie closed Tuesday at $66.76, in a 52-week trading range of $45.45 to $69.82.

The Chemical Castration of Our Children's Brains Wednesday, August 10, 2016 by: Natural News Editors Tags: chemical castration, Children, medications (NaturalNews) In the Vaxxed movie, we have seen how the power establishment not only endangers our children through unproven and dangerous vaccines, the power establishment, as reported to The Common Sense Show by Jon Rappoport, the movie was censored to an extreme degree. (Article by Dave Hodges, republished from Thecommonsenseshow.com) Despite the attempts from the criminal elite to maintain their power over the health and welfare of our children, we are finally, we are getting some concentrated attention on the topic of vaccines and the extreme dangers they pose in the name of increasing the bottom line for medical profits. Yesterday, Mike Adams released an article which cited the fact that 10% of all women in Canada who take the HPV vaccine, end up being treated in an emergency room for side-effects. On the same day as Mike Adams published, I also released a story which released research data going back over 5 years which demonstrated the clear and present danger posed by government should never be allowed to legislate choices which should be reserved for parents with regard to their children's health and welfare. The parents are sovereign over the welfare of their children, not the nanny state. The article focused on the vaccine, Gardasil. In the name of increasing the corporate bottom line, the government watchdog industries of the DEA and FDA, as well as the office of the President, have become the willing lap dogs for Big Pharma and this unholy alliance is serving to endanger our children. It Is Not Just Vaccines, Big Pharma Is Preying Upon Our ChildrenBig Pharma has gone to great lengths to increase sales to the youth of America either through chemically castrating our children's brains or by producing drugs with very serious side effects which serve to seriously degrade both the brain and the body. Our children are being systematically destroyed by the pharmaceutical industry. Children and Psychotropic Drugs Psychotropic drugs affect brain activity associated with mental processes and behavior. While such medication "can have significant benefits for those with mental illnesses, they can also have side effects ranging from mild to serious," including drowsiness, suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, loss of coordination, blurred vision, tremors, weight gain and high cholesterol, according to a report released in 2011 by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). The report was the result of a five-state study on the rates at which kids both in and out of foster care were prescribed psychotropic drugs through Medicaid in 2008. According to the GAO, foster children in Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon and Texas were prescribed psychotropic drugs at rates 2.7 to 4.5 times higher than children not in foster care. This gap may be because kids usually enter foster care after being abused or neglected and living through traumatic experiences. However, as a former clinician, I can unequivocally state that all factors can affect mental health and this does not warrant the wholesale medicating of our children. But the GAO report also found that in each of the five states studied, foster kids were more likely to be on five or more psychotropic medications, and many children are placed on doses that exceed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved levels for their ages thus, increasing the potential for adverse side effects. Some of the medications have not even been approved as safe and effective for children by the FDA. The Ritalin Conspiracy Let's make up a brain disorder, which parallels normal restlessness of children and then transform a dangerous drug, methamphetamine, and get as many kids on the drug as possible. It is good work if you can find it and pharmaceutical companies like Merck and Eli Lilly are leading the way in medical fraud and in the name of record corporate profits The use of Ritalin has become so rampant, that even the DEA has become alarmed by the tremendous increase in the prescribing of these drugs in recent years. Since 1990, prescriptions for methylphenidate have increased by 500%, while prescriptions for amphetamine for the same purpose have increased 400%. The American Pediatric Association claims Ritalin is over prescribed by 600%. For well over a decade, many scientists have speculated that ADD drugs are dangerous and can cause serious injury and death. Etta Brown[5], a licensed educational psychologist and author of Learning Disabilities: Understanding the Problem and Managing the Challenges explained in response to her study that drugs like Ritalin actually destroy the neural function in children's brains. As a result, children who have undergone treatment with Ritalin[5] will actually have a much more difficult time processing information and learning new things. This kind of defeats the purpose of getting children to sit still in school while placed in a zombified state. Brown further reported that Ritalin is responsible for the development of a permanent tic in the face, neck, and head of many of the children who have taken or are taking it. Ironically, Ritalin is responsible for causing far more serious neurological damage than the problems it is alleged to treat. Meta analyses studies over the years have revealed that while drugs like Ritalin visibly place children into a trance like state, these drugs destroy the vulnerable, delicate and developing nervous systems which can and does permanently cripple their ability to function as normal human beings. On his deathbed, the "father" of ADHD, Leon Eisenberg, admitted that the disorder was a fraud that sets up children for life-long risks of drug addiction and failure. ConclusionAny society that would tolerate its power elite abusing children to the degree that we see here, does not deserve to maintain its power of over the people. I have a newsflash for all parents. Big Pharma and their servants in the DEA and FDA do not own your children. When these soulless bastards tie school attendance to vaccine compliance, home school your children. When they outlaw home schooling as they have in Germany, be willing to engage in civil disobedience and go to jail. When they come for your children to inject them with these poisons, it is time to take to the streets. Enough is enough America!

Proof sciencebasedmedicine.org's Doctor David Gorski is a liar - And if you find a bigger Gorski Lie to better this example let us know Wednesday, August 10, 2016 by: Natural News Editors Tags: Dr David Gorski, liar, vaccine propaganda (NaturalNews) It is a serious matter when a medical doctor abuses the trusted status of a licensed medical professional to abuse bully disparage and attack others. It is worse when he uses that status and trusted position to lie about published medical research to make false claims intended to mislead and actively spread deliberate misinformation about medical knowledge whilst doing so to make false claims about others. It is even worse when he does it so publicly and routinely, publishing to mislead people worldwide and on a daily basis on the internet. (Article by ChildHealthSafety, republished from https://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com) Here on CHS we examine just one deliberate intentional lie by Dr Gorski, the circumstances in which he made that lie and look at some implications. The lie we are interested in is published on the website sciencebasedmedicine.org. It is in an attack blog directed against investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson for her work exposing the scandal of vaccines causing autism in hundreds of thousands of US children. Dr David Gorski engages in his dishonest bullying conduct against a number of other people in the same blog post. But first some background and we also invite readers to post comments here with other examples of Dr Gorski's sciencebasedmedicine.org's lies which they believe they have found to see if they can better our example. Dr Gorski's behavior reveals him as a pseudoscientist and quack. And it indicates Dr Gorski may not be of good moral character – which is what his dishonesty suggests. This kind of behavior also brings all of modern medicine into disrepute and taints all medical doctors. Government health officials are able to avoid answering difficult questions hiding behind bloggers like Gorski who distract attention whilst spreading blatant misinformation and attacking wrongfully the characters and credibility of independently minded people who ask and even sometimes answer the questions health officials prefer to avoid. It of course also tells the world about the website sciencebasedmedicine.org. Dr David Gorski is its Managing Editor. What are the other editors doing about Gorski's deliberate lies and online bullying? Do they condone Dr Gorski's behavior? Have they done anything to stop it? Do they intend putting matters right? Gorski has been doing this kind of thing for many years. The other editors are: Stephen P Novella; Kimball C. Atwood IV, MD; Mark A. Crislip, MD; Harriet Hall, MD; and Paul Ingraham [a former Registered Massage Therapist in Vancouver, Canada]. Are they liars too? We do not know about that because we have not considered any of their work. But if they do nothing then that tells you something about them. Dr David Gorski seems to lie as a matter of routine. Worse still he asserts he relies on science when he is just lying. Gorski of course is not the only liar. On CHS we have highlighted other liars who have been caught lying blatantly, in some instances having to apologize and pay compensation. So what are the implications of Gorski's cyber bullying and lying under the requirements to be met by a licensed medical practitioner in the State of Michigan? [Dr Gorski practices medicine in Michigan]. The Michigan Board of Medicine appears to be responsible for enforcing for the practice of medicine the Public Health Code under Public Act 368 of 1978, as amended. Section 16221 contains a multitude of behaviours but lying appears to fall under a "lack of good moral character". After all, if a licensed medical professional lies about medical knowledge to mislead others and so publicly that does not sound like someone of good moral character, does it? But that is not all. If Dr Gorski advises and treats patients on the basis of the kind of defective untrue and misleading information he published on his blog then he may violate other requirements. Violations include negligence or failure to exercise due care as well as any conduct or practice that impairs, or may impair, the ability to safely and skillfully practice medicine. And it may also indicate a lack of competence to advise and treat patients in accordance with his obligations. Incompetence can be a violation. A mental inability reasonably related to and adversely affecting the licensee's ability to practice in a safe and competent manner can also violate the Code. That raises the question of whether Dr Gorski's psychological profile as revealed by his blogging activities and specifically his inability to be truthful about medical scientific matters makes him psychologically unfit to treat patients. That is not a question for CHS to answer but it would seem an appropriate question to ask. So what did the liar Dr David Gorski do? He published one of his usual rambling articles on the sciencebasedmedicine.org website. It was 3333 words entitled "Anti-vaccine propaganda from Sharyl Attkisson of CBS News" published on April 4, 2011. You can see this was not a trivial matter. Gorski attacked a prominent US journalist along with a number of other people and he lied to do it. Ms Attkisson reported for CBS News on a peer reviewed journal paper published by Dr Helen Ratajczak. Ms Attkisson's report included: "The article in the Journal of Immunotoxicology is entitled "Theoretical aspects of autism: Causes–A review.[1]" The author is Helen Ratajczak, surprisingly herself a former senior scientist at a pharmaceutical firm. Ratajczak did what nobody else apparently has bothered to do: she reviewed the body of published science since autism was first described in 1943. Not just one theory suggested by research such as the role of MMR shots, or the mercury preservative thimerosal; but all of them." Vaccines and autism: a new scientific review[2] By Sharyl Attkisson CBS News April 1, 2011 This is the part of Dr David Gorski's article in which the lie appears and it is a significant lie: And she cites the anti-vaccine blog Child Health Safety[3] as one of her references? The date of the CHS entry cited is June 30, 2010. All I could find was this entry[4], which purports to argue that both Merck's Director of Vaccines and the U.S. government have admitted that vaccines cause autism all based on the long known science showing that a maternal case of rubella while carrying a fetus can result in autism in the child, something that's been known for several decades and is in fact one reason why vaccination against rubella is so important. How on earth did this get through peer review. Obviously, the peer reviewers of Dr. Ratajczak's article were either completely ignorant of the background science (and therefore unqualified) or asleep at the switch." Notice our emphasis added to just three words "all based on". Dr Gorski chose those words to make sure his lie would be all the more convincing. Those three words show how deliberate and calculated Dr Gorski was being in his lying and dishonesty. And just to make sure we are comparing apples with apples, this is the CHS article Dr Gorski lied about Vaccination Causes Autism – Say US Government & Merck's Director of Vaccines[5] as it appeared when Dr Gorski wrote his blog post in April 2011. Notice how in his article Dr Gorski admits he found and read the article. There is no mistake. And of course Dr Gorski was making claims intended to damage the reputations of Ms Attkisson and Dr Ratajczak among others. So it was deliberate, intentional and to cause harm to others. And it was bullying cyber abuse. Now what you can also see here is that Dr Gorski not only lied about the CHS article but he also lied about a number of other things [and this is just looking at the one paragraph] and all for the purposes of attacking Ms Attkisson and Dr Ratajczak. Most people do not click on links in blog posts. But this particular Gorski lie would be one CHS would know to be a lie without needing to refer to the CHS article concerned. But we make sure you can refer to it to so you can see just how dishonest Doctor David Gorski MD is. Contrary to Dr David Gorski's contrived and dishonest claims, the admissions by Merck's Director of Vaccines and U.S. government agencies that vaccines cause autistic conditions were not "all based on" autism caused by rubella infection. They were not based on that at all. And that is perfectly clear from the CHS article. So Gorski despite having found and read the CHS article clearly lied and did so deliberately and intentionally with a remarkable degree of dishonesty. It is also plain for all to see that not only did the CHS article cover several known causes of autism and not just one [as the liar Dr Gorski claimed], but also the quotes admitting vaccines cause autism were in relation to further separate mechanisms by which that can happen. In addition to that the CHS article quoted, cited and linked to original sources including a number of peer reviewed medical journal papers. What is also notable is the causes of autism which Dr Gorski omitted are causes which he steadfastly has avoided referring to. It is difficult for him to deny the admissions made because they were made and the CHS article cited and linked to original sources showing that. That is another aspect of his dishonesty. He ignores completely evidence which goes against the political commercial views he publishes under contract on sciencebasedmedicine.org to support the drug industry and to support government officials in pressurising parents into giving dangerous unnecessary vaccines to their children. But what it does show is that Dr Gorski knows those admitted causes are known real causes of vaccine-caused-autism. If he were to contradict that he would also have to claim Merck's Director of Vaccines and US Government agencies were lying when they made those admissions – admissions which were against their interests [but definitely in the public interest]. So Gorski avoids acknowledging the admissions, but in doing so tacitly confirms he knows they are true. But Gorski did not stop there. He lied also about it being improper of Dr Ratajczak to cite CHS in a peer reviewed journal. But it would have been improper for Dr Ratajczak to take the benefit of the work of others without citing CHS as the source. To do that would have been plagiarism. Dr Ratajczak properly cited the source of the information, which itself cited original sources. So Gorski lied again. And of course Dr Gorski knows that. This also addresses a further lie by Dr Gorski, that the peer review system of the journal concerned was in some way defective by allowing such a citation. Clearly, it was not and could not have been. And that brings us to a final point. That one Gorski paragraph is comprised of 133 words, yet it contains at least 3 lies. So on that basis one might estimate 75 Gorski lies in just that one blog post of 3333 words. And he blogs 6 days a week under contract, so that could be around 450 Gorski lies a week. And over the course of a year it could be 22,500 lies p.a. making Dr Gorski quite an impressive liar by quantity. And if sciencebasedmedicine.org contains that many lies from just one author, how many other lies might there be, if any? You should not hold your breath waiting for the Michigan Board of Medicine to do anything. But what this information does is raise the question: if one doctor can lie that much in one year and so blatantly and publicly and get away with it, how many other doctors and "scientists" are lying too? How many in the US Centers for Disease Control for example?

It is second phase III failure for Selumetinib A new immunotherapy treatment for lung cancer developed by AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) has failed its final trial, though the pharma giant will push ahead with more combinations using the drug. Selumetinib was tested in combination with docetaxel chemotherapy as a second-line treatment in patients with a specific type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), and selumetinib did not have a significant effect on overall survival, said AstraZeneca. It is the second final trial setback for selumetinib, which also failed to make significant difference to patients suffering from the rare eye cancer uveal melanoma despite also showing well in earlier trials. AstraZeneca is still developing the drug for people suffering from differentiated thyroid cancer and neurofibromatosis type 1, where tumours attach themselves to nerve tissue. Sean Bohen, global medicines development and chief medical officer at AstraZeneca, said the result was disappointing especially after promising results from the combination in the Phase II trial. “We remain committed to further developing treatments in the lung cancer setting, such as our immunotherapy combinations and targeted EGFR treatments." AstraZeneca licensed the Mek 1/2 inhibitor from US-listed Array BioPharma (NASDAQ:ARRY), which saw its shares crash 18% to US$3.63 on the diminishing prospect of future royalties from selumetinib after the two trial disappointments. Data from the studies in the thyroid cancer and neurofibromatosis type 1  studies are due late next year. Broker Shore Capital added that in oncology, AstraZeneca’s core focus has been on key pipeline assets including Tagrisso, Lynparza and immuno-oncology (IO) checkpoint inhibitors Durvalumab and Tremelimumab. In NSCLC applications, it is looking towards the MYSTIC study next year, which investigates the combination of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab as a first-line therapy. Astra’s announcement was the second disappointing outcome for NSCLC sufferers in the space of a week. Bristol Myers Squibb lost a fifth of its value when it announced on Friday that its immunotherapy treatment Opdivo failed its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in its phase III trial for NSCLC. Lung cancer is one of the hardest of all cancers to treat and Opdivo was tipped to have peak sales of between US$12-15bn. Rival Merck got a major boost, however, as its lung cancer immunotherapy treatment Keytruda has passed its trials and been approved. Shares in AstraZeneca eased 14p to 5,176p while in New York Array shed 18% to US$3.65. -- adds detail, share prices, broker comment -- Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version Philip Whiterow Register here to be notified of future AZN Company articles View full AZN profile AstraZeneca Timeline Article Tue AstraZeneca restarts cancer drug trials after US all clear Article Thu Is too great a risk of MYSTIC failure factored into AstraZeneca's price?
