While common, experts say these kinds of relationships raise conflict of interest concerns and must be carefully navigated. Here's a quick look at how Noseworthy, a neurologist by training, might manage his dual roles as Mayo's CEO and Merck board member. 1) How unusual it is for someone of Noseworthy's stature to serve on a pharmaceutical's board? It's not that unusual. Noseworthy will join high ranking medical professionals from Johns Hopkins, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on the Merck board. Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed 41 board members of the 50 biggest drug companies held leadership positions in American medical colleges. • Related: Dayton concerned by Mayo Clinic favoring privately insured patients Supporters of these ties say bringing people who run world renowned medical centers like Mayo Clinic together with the pharmaceutical industry can improve medicine. Drug companies, they say, can learn a lot about patient care from people like Noseworthy. And it can go both ways. In a statement, a Mayo spokesperson said that the appointment will give the hospital another lens into the "highly complex health care marketplace and to anticipate major trends in the pharmaceutical industry that may affect patients." 2) What's the concern then about a hospital CEO sitting on drug company board? Anyone who sits on the board of a drug company has a fiduciary responsibility to that company — you work for shareholders. For hospitals, where these drugs are administered and sometimes even tested in clinical trials, the relationship raises some important questions. A hospital executive who sits on a drug company board could feel pressure to get his hospital to buy the drug company's products. Hypothetically speaking, Noseworthy's presence on the board could potentially "give Merck a leg up" inside Mayo, said Dr. Eric Campbell, a Harvard Medical School professor who researches physician conflicts of interest. "It could increase the likelihood that the patients who are seen there will get Merck drugs," he said. "It could also create the impression that the Mayo Clinic is endorsing Merck." These tricky relationships aren't limited to hospital executives who sit on the boards of drug companies, he added. His research suggests that 85 percent of doctors have some form of a relationship with pharmaceutical companies. 3) What is Mayo saying about how it will handle these potential conflicts? Mayo says its board of trustees and board of governors carefully vetted the appointment and ultimately decided that the board position would raise Mayo's credibility rather than dilute it. The clinic also says a conflict of interest plan is being developed and that it will be monitored by an oversight committee. Practically speaking, Noseworthy will recuse himself from decisions involving Merck, including decisions about drug purchasing, business relationships and research initiatives. Mayo also said that Noseworthy will disclose his board membership when speaking publicly about pharmaceutical industry issues. 4) Will Noseworthy be paid? Yes, he will. His compensation for serving on the Merck board will include $110,000 in compensation and $170,000 in deferred stock per year. Mayo said this is standard practice for Merck's board members and that it adheres to Mayo policies that allow employees to be paid for board work done on personal time. Mayo says that it actually lags other prestigious hospitals that have leaders on drug and medical device company boards. So, Mayo's own Board of Trustees is interested in having more of its leaders serve in similar roles in the future. The trustees believe that these memberships will only expand the experience and insights of clinic employees.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News Cancer Immunotherapy: Building on Initial Successes to Improve Clinical Outcomes LONDON, April 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — This new report builds on our 2014 Insight Pharma Report, Cancer Immunotherapy: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Cancer Vaccines, and Adoptive T-cell Therapies. In that report, we focused on the major classes of cancer immunotherapy drugs that were then emerging from academic and corporate research: immune checkpoint inhibitors, cancer vaccines, and adoptive T-cell therapies. Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4823008/ This new report includes an updated discussion of approved and clinical stage agents in immuno-oncology, including recently-approved agents. It also addresses the means by which researchers and companies are attempting to build on prior achievements in immuno-oncology to improve outcomes for more patients. Some researchers and companies refer to this approach as „immuno-oncology 2.0.” The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), in its 12th Annual Report on Progress Against Cancer (2017), named „Immunotherapy 2.0” as its „Advance of the Year.” Nevertheless, metastatic melanoma remains incurable. Furthermore, in many studies in advanced melanoma and other cancers, only a minority of patients have benefited from immunotherapy treatments. Researchers and companies are therefore looking for ways to build on the initial successes of the immuno-oncology field to improve outcomes for more patients, hence the need for an „immuno-oncology 2.0.” Agents that are intended to improve the results of treatment with agents like checkpoint inhibitors may also be referred to as „second-wave” immuno-oncology agents. As discussed in this report, researchers have found that checkpoint inhibitors produce tumor responses by reactivating TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes)—especially CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. This key observation is perhaps the most important factor driving development of second-wave immuno-oncology strategies. As a result, researchers have been developing biomarkers that distinguish inflamed (i.e., TIL-containing) tumors—which are susceptible to checkpoint inhibitor therapy—from „cold” tumors, which are not. They have also been working to develop means to render „cold” tumors inflamed, via treatment with various conventional therapies and/or development of novel agents. These studies are the major theme of „second-wave” immuno-oncology, or „immuno-oncology 2.0.” Highlights of this Report Include: – Approvals of checkpoint inhibitors – Biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitor treatments – Approved and clinical-stage immunotherapy biologics other than checkpoint inhibitors – Immunotherapy with TIL cells – Commercialization of TIL therapy – Adoptive immunotherapy with genetically engineered T cells bearing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) – Manufacturing issues with CAR T-cell therapies – General conclusions on the progress of cellular immunotherapy – Outlook for cancer immunotherapy Executive Summary Approvals of checkpoint inhibitors As discussed in Chapter 2, researchers are continuing to conduct clinical trials designed to gain approval for new checkpoint inhibitors and for new indications for already-approved agents. Notable recent developments include the 2016 approval of atezolizumab (Roche/Genentech’s Tecentriq), the first PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) inhibitor to be approved. On May 18, 2016 atezolizumab was approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has worsened during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy, either before or after surgical treatment. Later, on October 18, 2016, the FDA approved atezolizumab for use in patients with metastatic NSCLC (regardless of PD-L1 expression) who have progressed during or after treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy or appropriate targeted therapy. Also in October 2016, the FDA approved the PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) inhibitor pembrolizumab as a monotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ?50%. This was after this agent met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ?50%. In contrast, monotherapy with the competing PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo) did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ?5%. This result is affecting the competition between BMS’ nivolumab and Merck’s pembrolizumab. In Merck’s KEYNOTE-024 trial, the patient population that was treated with either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy consisted of individuals with previously untreated advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ?50%. In contrast, BMS’ CheckMate 026 trial of nivolumab as a monotherapy evaluated the drug in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at only ?5%. This difference in trial design may explain the divergent results of the two trials, rather than a potential superior efficacy of pembrolizumab over nivolumab. Nevertheless, the results of the KEYNOTE-024 trial advance the prospects of Merck’s pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with high levels of PD-L1 expression, while BMS must conduct an evaluation of its study and decide what to do next. In addition to the discussions of approved checkpoint inhibitors, Chapter 2 also includes discussions of clinical stage agents in this class. These include Novartis’ PD-1 inhibitor PDR001, AstraZeneca’s PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab, and Merck-Serono/Pfizer’s PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab. Notably, avelumab has been under evaluation in a pivotal Phase 2 trial in Merkel cell carcinoma, with favorable results reported in the 2016 ASCO annual meeting. Merck-Serono and Pfizer plan to submit the drug to regulatory authorities based on these results. Biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitor treatments The later sections of Chapter 2 discuss the role of biomarkers in checkpoint inhibitor treatments, especially in the context of „immuno-oncology 2.0.” „Immuno-oncology 2.0” may involve development of novel agents, such as those discussed in this and other chapters of the report. It may also involve combining different immunotherapies, combining immunotherapies with older types of treatments and/or with new experimental treatments, or other novel approaches. The development and use of biomarkers will be key to the progress of „immuno-oncology 2.0.” Biomarkers will help researchers and physicians predict responses to immunotherapy treatments. Such tests may not only spare patients the costs and adverse effects of treatments that may not help them, but may also help researchers to design optimal, „personalized” treatments. Several classes of biomarkers are in use and/or development for cancer immunotherapy, and especially for use in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. A target biomarker is a biomarker that reflects the presence of a specific molecular drug target. In the case of PD-1 inhibitors, the direct target is PD-1, and the downstream target (i.e., the ligand of PD-1 that is affected by its binding) is PD-L1. In the case of PD-L1 inhibitors, the direct target is PD-L1. Recent results from studies of first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab as a monotherapy demonstrate the potential value of PD-L1 as a biomarker in treatment of patients with PD-1 inhibitors. PD-L1 as a biomarker has also been important in clinical studies supporting the approval of the PD-L1 blocking agent atezolizumab. Researchers found that increased PD-L1 expression in the tumors of patients with urothelial carcinoma was associated with response to atezolizumab. Although patients with tumors negative for PD-L1 expression might still respond to the drug, the greater efficacy of atezolizumab in those classified as positive for PD-L1 expression suggests that the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells may help identify patients more likely to respond to treatment with the agent. Target biomarkers—especially PD-L1—are being used to define patient subsets that can productively be treated with a checkpoint inhibitor, especially in clinical trials and in approval decisions by regulatory agencies. However, these tests imperfectly discriminate between patients who can benefit from these therapeutics and those who cannot. Moreover, they are of little use in designing improved therapies that build on current checkpoint inhibitor therapies to improve patient outcomes. Genetic biomarkers are also under investigation for use in cancer immunotherapy. In immuno-oncology, genetic biomarkers are generally used to determine the likelihood that a patient’s tumors possess a sufficient somatic mutation load to support a large and diverse population of CD8+ TILs, which are specific for mutation-associated neoantigens. Treatment with checkpoint inhibitors can then reactivate these TILs, resulting in effective antitumor immune responses. Examples of genetic biomarkers discussed in this report include mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency and mutation load, as determined by whole-exome sequencing. Immunological biomarkers enable direct testing to determine whether a patient’s tumors contain sufficient TILs to enable successful treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. In particular, researchers have found that CD8+ TILs located at the invasive margin of a tumor (as determined, for example, by quantitative immunohistochemistry) appear to be necessary for successful treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. In one study, researchers found that pre-existing CD8+ T cells located at the invasive margins of tumors from patients with metastatic melanoma may predict response to therapy with the anti-PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. Patients who responded to therapy showed proliferation of the intratumoral CD8+ T cells that directly correlated with reduction in tumor size. The researchers established a predictive model based on CD8 expression at the invasive margin and validated the model in an independent group of 15 patients. Another type of immunological biomarker is the „Immunoscore”—a method of characterizing the nature and function of immune cell infiltrates into tumors based on measuring the densities of CD3+ and CD8+ cells in the tumor core and the invasive margin using immunohistochemistry. The Immunoscore was developed by Jérôme Galon, Ph.D. [Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM)] and his colleagues for use in studies of colorectal cancer. According to Dr. Galon’s findings, use of checkpoint inhibitors is the logical strategy for patients with high Immunoscores. In contrast, for patients with low Immunoscores, effective immuno-oncology treatments will need to focus on getting immune cells into the tumor in the first place (e.g., by treatment with a „second-wave” immunotherapy agent) before checkpoint inhibitors can be used. Genetic and immunological biomarkers may be combined with target biomarkers and other parameters to move toward better discrimination between patients who are likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibitor treatments and those who are not. Specifically, biomarkers can be used to discriminate between „cold” and inflamed tumors. Genetic and immunological biomarkers can also be used to design therapies that can turn „cold” tumors into inflamed tumors, thus improving responses to checkpoint inhibitor therapy and other immunotherapies. For example, these biomarkers might be used to design combinations of treatments that induce immune infiltration of tumors with checkpoint inhibitors that activate or reactivate infiltrating immune cells, such as TILs. Novel agents that might induce immune infiltration of tumors are discussed in several chapters of this report. More immediately, combination therapies involving the use of older treatments or agents, followed by administration of checkpoint inhibitors, are under clinical investigation to determine whether any of these older agents might render „cold” tumors inflamed, making them susceptible to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Among these older treatments (discussed in Chapter 2) are radiation therapy (especially stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), targeted therapies, and cytotoxic chemotherapies. Approved and clinical-stage immunotherapy biologics other than checkpoint inhibitors Various chapters of this report focus on approved and clinical-stage biologics other than the checkpoint inhibitors. Most of these agents may be used as „immuno-oncology 2.0” agents, i.e., agents that promote T-cell infiltration of tumors, thus rendering them susceptible to successful treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. In addition to serving as an introduction to the report as a whole and discussing the early history of cancer immunotherapy, Chapter 1 focuses on cytokines as cancer immunotherapeutics. Interleukin-2, interferon-alpha-2a, and interferon alpha-2b have long been approved for treatment of various cancers. To this day, despite the introduction of newer immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, high-dose recombinant IL-2 (Novartis/Prometheus Laboratories’ Proleukin) is the only drug so far that has produced durable, long-term responses in patients with metastatic melanoma or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. According to Patrick Ott, M.D., Ph.D. (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA), „High-dose IL-2 has a track record of patients who have been disease-free for 20 years, and we just don’t know that yet with the new drugs [such as checkpoint inhibitors].” In the case of advanced melanoma, high-dose intravenous bolus IL-2 induces objective clinical responses in 15–20% of patients and durable complete responses in 5–7% of these patients. For metastatic RCC (mRCC), high-dose intravenous bolus IL-2 gives an objective clinical response rate of approximately 25% and a 7% durable complete response rate. However, high-dose IL-2 has a significant degree of toxicity. Because of its adverse effects, high-dose IL-2 therapy for cancer requires an expert, experienced team of clinicians and specialized centers. Under such conditions of care, IL-2-related toxicity can usually be easily managed. Despite its logistical disadvantages, several investigators are attempting to revive use of IL-2 in cancer immunotherapy. In the current era, it is possible to use targeted therapies as salvage agents to treat patients who do not do well with IL-2. There may also be opportunities to develop combination therapies of IL-2 with radiation or checkpoint inhibitors, and clinical trials of these combination therapies are underway. IL-2 treatment also requires only a median of one month of therapy and gives a long duration of benefit without the need for additional treatment. This is not true, for example, for treatment with cytotoxic therapies or targeted therapies. In addition to its use as a stand-alone drug, IL-2 is also used as part of certain cellular immunotherapies. Other, newer cytokine-based therapies discussed in Chapter 1 are in early-stage clinical trials. Notably, local intratumoral electroporation of a DNA plasmid that encodes human IL-12 (pIL-12) (OncoSec’s ImmunoPulse) can result in systemic responses in metastatic melanoma patients. This procedure appears to induce TILs and anti-tumor immunity in both the injected tumors and in distant tumor sites. A Phase 2 trial indicates that intratumoral pIL12-electroporation therapy may prime systemic responses for checkpoint inhibitor blockade, apparently by generation of CD8+ TILs. ImmunoPulse therapy followed by treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor is therefore a potential immuno-oncology 2.0 therapy for metastatic melanoma. Other early-stage potential immuno-oncology 2.0 therapies discussed in Chapter 1 are based on the cytokines IL-10 and IL-15. In addition to discussing approved and clinical-stage checkpoint inhibitors and their mechanisms of action, Chapter 2 includes discussions of clinical-stage checkpoint inhibitor modulators, such as LAG-3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) inhibitors, TIM-3 (T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3) inhibitors, small-molecule IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) pathway inhibitors, and a small-molecule PI3K? (phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma) inhibitor. These agents are in Phase 1 or Phase 2 development. In general, they work to overcome immunosuppression and/or T-cell exhaustion, and thus may overcome blocks to T-cell activation by checkpoint inhibitors. Chapter 3 focuses on immune agonists. Immune agonist therapeutics—most of which are mAbs—target specific cell surface proteins on T cells, resulting in stimulation of T cell activity. This mechanism contrasts with that of checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to overcome blockages to T cell activity mediated by immune checkpoints. Companies are developing immune agonist immunotherapeutics principally for use in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., as immuno-oncology 2.0 agents). All of the agents discussed in this chapter are in early-stage clinical trials. Chapter 4 discusses bispecific antibody (bsAb) cancer immunotherapeutics. A bispecific Ab (bsAb) is a type of mAb. bsAbs are designed with two different variable domains that enable the Ab to bind simultaneously to two different types of targets. bsAbs used in cancer immunotherapy usually bind one target on a tumor cell and another target on a cytotoxic immune system cell, bringing the two types of cells into close proximity. This allows the immune system to act against the tumor cell. There are currently two approved and marketed bsAb cancer immunotherapeutics—catumaxomab (Neovii Biotech’s Removab) and blinatumomab (Amgen’s Blincyto). Catumaxomab is a rat-mouse hybrid bsAb that targets the tumor antigen epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and the T-cell surface molecule CD3. It is approved in Europe for treatment of malignant ascites in patients with EpCAM-positive cancer if a standard therapy is not available. Blinatumomab is a murine Ab-derived small bsAb that targets CD3 on T-cells and CD19 on B-cell neoplasms. It is approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval program for treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. It has also been granted conditional marketing authorization in the European Union for the treatment of adults with Ph- relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL. Blinatumomab is the first anti-CD19 drug to receive FDA approval. As discussed in Chapter 6, the most advanced CAR T-cell (genetically engineered T cells bearing chimeric antigen receptors) therapies in development target CD19 and are intended for treatment of CD19+ B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. However, none of these cellular therapies is yet approved. As with other first-generation bsAbs, blinatumomab is unstable and has a short serum half-life. It must be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion over a minimum of 4 weeks. The infusion can be administered to outpatients via a minipump system. The short half-life of the agent is not due to the formation of antimouse Abs. Researchers and companies are working on technology platforms that can yield more stable bsAbs. Some companies and researchers are attempting to develop bsAb agents as alternatives to CAR T-cell therapies. These companies see bsAbs as potentially safer than CAR T cells. Moreover, bsAbs can be manufactured like other Ab-based biologics and then administered to patients with cancers specifically targeted by the bsAb. There is thus no need to isolate autologous T cells as the basis for a patient’s therapy or to develop and carry out individualized manufacturing protocols, as in the case of CAR T cells. Except for catumaxomab and blinatumomab, all bsAb candidates are in Phase 1 trials. No efficacy findings have been published. Thus, it is not known whether any of these agents is likely to be approved, and it is too early to tell whether bsAbs can serve as an alternative to CAR T-cell therapies. Key issues in the bsAb area include moving away from rodent-derived Abs toward human or humanized molecules, and developing agents with improved stability and half-life in the circulation. Developers of bsAbs need to develop improved technologies aimed at producing more stable molecules. Also important are the ability to easily design and manufacture bsAbs and to rapidly redesign improved versions of agents entered into first-in-humans trials. Based on these issues, companies have developed several platform technologies for producing bsAbs, which are discussed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 focuses on therapeutic anticancer vaccines and oncolytic viruses. Efforts to develop therapeutic cancer vaccines began in the 1990s. However, the cancer vaccine field has been characterized by a long series of clinical failures, beginning in the 1990s and continuing to the present day. Researchers have been working to overcome these difficulties by using improved research methodologies and by employing advances in our understanding of immuno-oncology. In the current era, researchers have used their greater understanding of dendritic cell biology to attempt to improve the design of peptide and protein vaccines. Another important factor that has contributed to the failure of cancer vaccines is immune suppression in the tumor environment. Some researchers hypothesize that one way to overcome this immunosuppression is to administer vaccines in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. More recently, researchers have been investigating the mechanisms by which the immune system—especially TILs—recognize tumor cells and differentiate them from noncancer cells. These studies have focused on „neoantigens”—i.e., antigens that are specific for cancer cells, as opposed to normal, noncancer cells. These neoantigens are associated with somatic mutations that arise in the evolution of tumor cells. TILs—especially CD8+ intratumoral T cells—may mediate tumor regression, and this antitumor activity may be enhanced by checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Researchers therefore hypothesize that neoantigen-based vaccines may be more effective than earlier types of cancer vaccines. They further hypothesize that determination of neoantigens in tumors may provide technology platforms for the design of effective cancer vaccines. As discussed in Chapter 5, there are currently one approved and marketed therapeutic cancer vaccine and one approved and marketed oncolytic virus therapeutic. Sipuleucel-T (Dendreon/Valeant’s Provenge) is a personalized dendritic cell vaccine that targets prostatic acid phosphatase. It was approved by the FDA for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in 2010 and was approved in Europe for the same indication in 2013. It is the first approved therapeutic cancer vaccine. However, sipuleucel-T has an apparently minimal effect and is very expensive. It also faces significant competition from small-molecule agents. As a result, sipuleucel-T sales—and Dendreon the company—have faltered. Dendreon filed for filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2014, and its assets were sold to Valeant in 2015. As of May 18, 2016, Valeant was looking to sell off the „laggard” Provenge, in order to ameliorate its own debt problems. Therefore, the future of sipuleucel-T remains in doubt. In 2015, the FDA approved talimogene laherparepvec (Amgen’s Imlygic, also known as T-Vec), an oncolytic herpes simplex virus that expresses granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). It is approved for the treatment of melanoma lesions in the skin and lymph nodes. This oncolytic virus is injected into a single tumor, where it lyses tumor cells. It was postulated that upon lysis of tumor cells in the treated lesion, systemic immune responses are induced. There was evidence for induction of immune responses in distant tumor sites in a published Phase 1 study, and there was a trend toward improved overall survival in early results of a Phase 3 study presented at the 2013 ASCO Annual Meeting. However, as determined by completed results of the same Phase 3 study, the agent was not subsequently shown to improve overall survival or have an effect on distant metastases. Strictly speaking, T-Vec is not a cancer vaccine, since it carries no tumor antigen in its molecular structure. It is designated as an oncolytic virus therapy and is the first such agent to receive FDA approval. However, since it had been designed to immunize patients systemically against multiple tumor antigens, it is generally considered a „cancer vaccine” in scientific and market research reports. Amgen and Merck—together with their academic collaborators—have been conducting clinical studies of a combination of the oncolytic virus therapy talimogene laherparepvec and the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab. The results of a Phase 1b study presented at the 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting appeared promising. The combination therapy is now under investigation in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Other researchers are conducting clinical trials of combinations of T-Vec with another checkpoint inhibitor, ipilimumab. Chapter 5 includes discussions of several therapeutic cancer vaccines and one oncolytic virus therapeutic that are in clinical development (from Phase 1 to Phase 3). Phase 3 vaccines include Bavarian Nordic’s PROSTVAC-VF and Argos Therapeutics’ AGS-003. PROSTVAC-VF is being developed for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the same indication as sipileucel-T. It targets prostate specific antigen (PSA). PROSTVAC-VF is a recombinant poxvirus agent carrying genes for PSA and three costimulatory molecules. Unlike sipileucel-T, it is an „off-the-shelf” immunotherapeutic that can be manufactured as a biologic product. Phase 2 data suggests that PROSTVAC-VF may have superior efficacy compared to currently approved agents. Argos’ AGS-003 is a personalized dendritic cell vaccine that is under investigation in Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with mRCC. To produce the vaccine, autologous dendritic cells are loaded with mRNA from the patient’s mRCC tumor. Some of the tumor cell mRNAs encode tumor antigens that are expressed on the surfaces of the dendritic cells (in the context of MHC class II molecules); these cells also express CD40. The tumor mRNA-programmed autologous dendritic cells constitute the vaccine, which is then formulated into an intradermal injection for administration to the patient. The dendritic cells serve as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that activate T cells specific for the patient’s tumor antigens. The interaction of CD40 with its ligand on activated T cells induces secretion of IL-12 by the dendritic cells. IL-12 promotes the differentiation of T cells into T helper 1(Th1) cells. The Phase 3 trial of AGS-003 is a follow-up to favorable Phase 2 data that was presented at the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting. Notably, several early-stage therapeutic cancer vaccine programs discussed in Chapter 5 are based on research designed to identify naturally processed Class I and Class II peptide epitopes for formulation into vaccines. TapImmune is developing two vaccines based on research at the Mayo Clinic designed to identify such epitopes from specific tumor antigen proteins, in one case HER2/neu (in HER2/neu+ breast cancer) and in the other case TPIV200 folate receptor alpha (in ovarian cancer and triple negative breast cancer). Neon Therapeutics’ NEO-PV-01 is based on research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Center and the Broad Institute to identify naturally-processed neoantigen peptide epitopes from patient tumors using exome sequencing and predictive algorithms for MHC binding. Unlike the TapImmune products, this research is designed to identify these epitopes from multiple tumor antigen proteins. Neon is one of several recently formed cancer vaccine companies discussed in Chapter 5 that are focused on neonatigen science and technology. Among companies exploring neoantigen vaccines, the only other one that has reached the clinical stage as of 2016 is the German firm BioNTech AG. BioNTech specializes in mRNA-based neoantigen vaccines, as opposed to peptide vaccines. The company presented an abstract describing the design of the still-ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of its IVAC (individualized vaccine) Mutanome in advanced melanoma patients at the 2015 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. In September 2016 BioNTech entered into a collaboration with Genentech to develop, manufacture, and commercialize novel mRNA-based, neoantigen/neoepitope cancer vaccines based on the IVAC Mutanome technology platform. Other neoantigen vaccine companies mentioned in Chapter 5 that have not yet reached the clinic are Gritstone Oncology, ISA Pharmaceuticals, Agenus, and Caperna (a Moderna venture company). Imuno-oncology 2.0 strategies now feature prominently in therapeutic cancer vaccine and oncolytic virus therapeutic development. This is particularly true with neoantigen vaccines, which are designed to induce neoantigen-specific TILs within patients’ tumors. The strategy is to use the vaccine to induce the TILs, rendering checkpoint inhibitors effective in inducing tumor regression. Based on this strategy, Neon’s NEO-PV-01 vaccine is being combined with poly-ICLC adjuvant and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab in collaborative clinical studies in advanced melanoma, smoking-associated NSCLC, and bladder cancer. The immuno-oncology 2.0 strategy has become a general theme of cancer vaccine research and development beyond neonantigen vaccines—use cancer vaccines to render tumors inflamed, and use checkpoint inhibitors to induce regression of the inflamed tumors. Thus, there are several examples of trials of cancer vaccine/checkpoint inhibitor combinations discussed in this chapter. In some cases, cancer vaccines are being tested in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials, rather than the „traditional” approach of first getting a vaccine approved and then conducting trials of the vaccine in combination with other agents. It is possible that testing a vaccine in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in early stage clinical trials may reduce the number of failed cancer vaccines. However, whether this is true remains to be seen. Chapter 6 focuses on the use of adoptive T-cell immunotherapies for cancer. In this class of therapies, autologous or syngeneic activated T cells (which may or may not be genetically modified) are infused into patients in order to attack their cancers. Adoptive immunotherapy is also known as adoptive cell transfer (ACT). Immunotherapy with TIL cells ACT was pioneered by Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The major focus of the Rosenberg group has been TIL therapy, which involves isolation of TILs (which are really tumor-infiltrating T cells) from a patient’s tumor, followed by ex vivo expansion of these cells with IL-2. The TILs and high-dose IL-2 are then infused intravenously into the patient. The infused T cells traffic to tumors and can mediate their destruction. Clinical study of TIL therapy has continued to the present day. Moreover, attempts to overcome some of the limitations of TIL therapy have resulted in the development other newer forms of ACT based on various types of genetically engineered T cells. Most studies with TIL therapy have been in advanced melanoma. The Rosenberg group presented the results of a Phase 2 trial of TIL therapy in stage 4 metastatic melanoma patients who had received preparative lymphodepletion therapy at the 2014 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). At the time of analysis, 11 of 101 patients had achieved a complete response, and 44 had achieved a partial response, for an overall objective response rate (ORR) of 54%.

2017 /PRNewswire/ -- This new report builds on our 2014 Insight Pharma Report, Cancer Immunotherapy: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Cancer Vaccines, and Adoptive T-cell Therapies. In that report, we focused on the major classes of cancer immunotherapy drugs that were then emerging from academic and corporate research: immune checkpoint inhibitors, cancer vaccines, and adoptive T-cell therapies. Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4823008/ This new report includes an updated discussion of approved and clinical stage agents in immuno-oncology, including recently-approved agents. It also addresses the means by which researchers and companies are attempting to build on prior achievements in immuno-oncology to improve outcomes for more patients. Some researchers and companies refer to this approach as "immuno-oncology 2.0." The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), in its 12th Annual Report on Progress Against Cancer (2017), named "Immunotherapy 2.0" as its "Advance of the Year." Nevertheless, metastatic melanoma remains incurable. Furthermore, in many studies in advanced melanoma and other cancers, only a minority of patients have benefited from immunotherapy treatments. Researchers and companies are therefore looking for ways to build on the initial successes of the immuno-oncology field to improve outcomes for more patients, hence the need for an "immuno-oncology 2.0." Agents that are intended to improve the results of treatment with agents like checkpoint inhibitors may also be referred to as "second-wave" immuno-oncology agents. As discussed in this report, researchers have found that checkpoint inhibitors produce tumor responses by reactivating TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes)—especially CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. This key observation is perhaps the most important factor driving development of second-wave immuno-oncology strategies. As a result, researchers have been developing biomarkers that distinguish inflamed (i.e., TIL-containing) tumors—which are susceptible to checkpoint inhibitor therapy—from "cold" tumors, which are not. They have also been working to develop means to render "cold" tumors inflamed, via treatment with various conventional therapies and/or development of novel agents. These studies are the major theme of "second-wave" immuno-oncology, or "immuno-oncology 2.0." Highlights of this Report Include: - Approvals of checkpoint inhibitors - Biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitor treatments - Approved and clinical-stage immunotherapy biologics other than checkpoint inhibitors - Immunotherapy with TIL cells - Commercialization of TIL therapy - Adoptive immunotherapy with genetically engineered T cells bearing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) - Manufacturing issues with CAR T-cell therapies - General conclusions on the progress of cellular immunotherapy - Outlook for cancer immunotherapy Executive Summary Approvals of checkpoint inhibitors As discussed in Chapter 2, researchers are continuing to conduct clinical trials designed to gain approval for new checkpoint inhibitors and for new indications for already-approved agents. Notable recent developments include the 2016 approval of atezolizumab (Roche/Genentech's Tecentriq), the first PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) inhibitor to be approved. On May 18, 2016 atezolizumab was approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has worsened during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy, either before or after surgical treatment. Later, on October 18, 2016, the FDA approved atezolizumab for use in patients with metastatic NSCLC (regardless of PD-L1 expression) who have progressed during or after treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy or appropriate targeted therapy. Also in October 2016, the FDA approved the PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) inhibitor pembrolizumab as a monotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ?50%. This was after this agent met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ?50%. In contrast, monotherapy with the competing PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo) did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ?5%. This result is affecting the competition between BMS' nivolumab and Merck's pembrolizumab. In Merck's KEYNOTE-024 trial, the patient population that was treated with either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy consisted of individuals with previously untreated advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ?50%. In contrast, BMS' CheckMate 026 trial of nivolumab as a monotherapy evaluated the drug in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at only ?5%. This difference in trial design may explain the divergent results of the two trials, rather than a potential superior efficacy of pembrolizumab over nivolumab. Nevertheless, the results of the KEYNOTE-024 trial advance the prospects of Merck's pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with high levels of PD-L1 expression, while BMS must conduct an evaluation of its study and decide what to do next. In addition to the discussions of approved checkpoint inhibitors, Chapter 2 also includes discussions of clinical stage agents in this class. These include Novartis' PD-1 inhibitor PDR001, AstraZeneca's PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab, and Merck-Serono/Pfizer's PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab. Notably, avelumab has been under evaluation in a pivotal Phase 2 trial in Merkel cell carcinoma, with favorable results reported in the 2016 ASCO annual meeting. Merck-Serono and Pfizer plan to submit the drug to regulatory authorities based on these results. Biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitor treatments The later sections of Chapter 2 discuss the role of biomarkers in checkpoint inhibitor treatments, especially in the context of "immuno-oncology 2.0." "Immuno-oncology 2.0" may involve development of novel agents, such as those discussed in this and other chapters of the report. It may also involve combining different immunotherapies, combining immunotherapies with older types of treatments and/or with new experimental treatments, or other novel approaches. The development and use of biomarkers will be key to the progress of "immuno-oncology 2.0." Biomarkers will help researchers and physicians predict responses to immunotherapy treatments. Such tests may not only spare patients the costs and adverse effects of treatments that may not help them, but may also help researchers to design optimal, "personalized" treatments. Several classes of biomarkers are in use and/or development for cancer immunotherapy, and especially for use in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. A target biomarker is a biomarker that reflects the presence of a specific molecular drug target. In the case of PD-1 inhibitors, the direct target is PD-1, and the downstream target (i.e., the ligand of PD-1 that is affected by its binding) is PD-L1. In the case of PD-L1 inhibitors, the direct target is PD-L1. Recent results from studies of first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab as a monotherapy demonstrate the potential value of PD-L1 as a biomarker in treatment of patients with PD-1 inhibitors. PD-L1 as a biomarker has also been important in clinical studies supporting the approval of the PD-L1 blocking agent atezolizumab. Researchers found that increased PD-L1 expression in the tumors of patients with urothelial carcinoma was associated with response to atezolizumab. Although patients with tumors negative for PD-L1 expression might still respond to the drug, the greater efficacy of atezolizumab in those classified as positive for PD-L1 expression suggests that the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells may help identify patients more likely to respond to treatment with the agent. Target biomarkers—especially PD-L1—are being used to define patient subsets that can productively be treated with a checkpoint inhibitor, especially in clinical trials and in approval decisions by regulatory agencies. However, these tests imperfectly discriminate between patients who can benefit from these therapeutics and those who cannot. Moreover, they are of little use in designing improved therapies that build on current checkpoint inhibitor therapies to improve patient outcomes. Genetic biomarkers are also under investigation for use in cancer immunotherapy. In immuno-oncology, genetic biomarkers are generally used to determine the likelihood that a patient's tumors possess a sufficient somatic mutation load to support a large and diverse population of CD8+ TILs, which are specific for mutation-associated neoantigens. Treatment with checkpoint inhibitors can then reactivate these TILs, resulting in effective antitumor immune responses. Examples of genetic biomarkers discussed in this report include mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency and mutation load, as determined by whole-exome sequencing. Immunological biomarkers enable direct testing to determine whether a patient's tumors contain sufficient TILs to enable successful treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. In particular, researchers have found that CD8+ TILs located at the invasive margin of a tumor (as determined, for example, by quantitative immunohistochemistry) appear to be necessary for successful treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. In one study, researchers found that pre-existing CD8+ T cells located at the invasive margins of tumors from patients with metastatic melanoma may predict response to therapy with the anti-PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. Patients who responded to therapy showed proliferation of the intratumoral CD8+ T cells that directly correlated with reduction in tumor size. The researchers established a predictive model based on CD8 expression at the invasive margin and validated the model in an independent group of 15 patients. Another type of immunological biomarker is the "Immunoscore"—a method of characterizing the nature and function of immune cell infiltrates into tumors based on measuring the densities of CD3+ and CD8+ cells in the tumor core and the invasive margin using immunohistochemistry. The Immunoscore was developed by Jérôme Galon, Ph.D. [Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM)] and his colleagues for use in studies of colorectal cancer. According to Dr. Galon's findings, use of checkpoint inhibitors is the logical strategy for patients with high Immunoscores. In contrast, for patients with low Immunoscores, effective immuno-oncology treatments will need to focus on getting immune cells into the tumor in the first place (e.g., by treatment with a "second-wave" immunotherapy agent) before checkpoint inhibitors can be used. Genetic and immunological biomarkers may be combined with target biomarkers and other parameters to move toward better discrimination between patients who are likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibitor treatments and those who are not. Specifically, biomarkers can be used to discriminate between "cold" and inflamed tumors. Genetic and immunological biomarkers can also be used to design therapies that can turn "cold" tumors into inflamed tumors, thus improving responses to checkpoint inhibitor therapy and other immunotherapies. For example, these biomarkers might be used to design combinations of treatments that induce immune infiltration of tumors with checkpoint inhibitors that activate or reactivate infiltrating immune cells, such as TILs. Novel agents that might induce immune infiltration of tumors are discussed in several chapters of this report. More immediately, combination therapies involving the use of older treatments or agents, followed by administration of checkpoint inhibitors, are under clinical investigation to determine whether any of these older agents might render "cold" tumors inflamed, making them susceptible to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Among these older treatments (discussed in Chapter 2) are radiation therapy (especially stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), targeted therapies, and cytotoxic chemotherapies. Approved and clinical-stage immunotherapy biologics other than checkpoint inhibitors Various chapters of this report focus on approved and clinical-stage biologics other than the checkpoint inhibitors. Most of these agents may be used as "immuno-oncology 2.0" agents, i.e., agents that promote T-cell infiltration of tumors, thus rendering them susceptible to successful treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. In addition to serving as an introduction to the report as a whole and discussing the early history of cancer immunotherapy, Chapter 1 focuses on cytokines as cancer immunotherapeutics. Interleukin-2, interferon-alpha-2a, and interferon alpha-2b have long been approved for treatment of various cancers. To this day, despite the introduction of newer immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, high-dose recombinant IL-2 (Novartis/Prometheus Laboratories' Proleukin) is the only drug so far that has produced durable, long-term responses in patients with metastatic melanoma or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. According to Patrick Ott, M.D., Ph.D. (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA), "High-dose IL-2 has a track record of patients who have been disease-free for 20 years, and we just don't know that yet with the new drugs [such as checkpoint inhibitors]." In the case of advanced melanoma, high-dose intravenous bolus IL-2 induces objective clinical responses in 15–20% of patients and durable complete responses in 5–7% of these patients. For metastatic RCC (mRCC), high-dose intravenous bolus IL-2 gives an objective clinical response rate of approximately 25% and a 7% durable complete response rate. However, high-dose IL-2 has a significant degree of toxicity. Because of its adverse effects, high-dose IL-2 therapy for cancer requires an expert, experienced team of clinicians and specialized centers. Under such conditions of care, IL-2-related toxicity can usually be easily managed. Despite its logistical disadvantages, several investigators are attempting to revive use of IL-2 in cancer immunotherapy. In the current era, it is possible to use targeted therapies as salvage agents to treat patients who do not do well with IL-2. There may also be opportunities to develop combination therapies of IL-2 with radiation or checkpoint inhibitors, and clinical trials of these combination therapies are underway. IL-2 treatment also requires only a median of one month of therapy and gives a long duration of benefit without the need for additional treatment. This is not true, for example, for treatment with cytotoxic therapies or targeted therapies. In addition to its use as a stand-alone drug, IL-2 is also used as part of certain cellular immunotherapies. Other, newer cytokine-based therapies discussed in Chapter 1 are in early-stage clinical trials. Notably, local intratumoral electroporation of a DNA plasmid that encodes human IL-12 (pIL-12) (OncoSec's ImmunoPulse) can result in systemic responses in metastatic melanoma patients. This procedure appears to induce TILs and anti-tumor immunity in both the injected tumors and in distant tumor sites. A Phase 2 trial indicates that intratumoral pIL12-electroporation therapy may prime systemic responses for checkpoint inhibitor blockade, apparently by generation of CD8+ TILs. ImmunoPulse therapy followed by treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor is therefore a potential immuno-oncology 2.0 therapy for metastatic melanoma. Other early-stage potential immuno-oncology 2.0 therapies discussed in Chapter 1 are based on the cytokines IL-10 and IL-15. In addition to discussing approved and clinical-stage checkpoint inhibitors and their mechanisms of action, Chapter 2 includes discussions of clinical-stage checkpoint inhibitor modulators, such as LAG-3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) inhibitors, TIM-3 (T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3) inhibitors, small-molecule IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) pathway inhibitors, and a small-molecule PI3K? (phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma) inhibitor. These agents are in Phase 1 or Phase 2 development. In general, they work to overcome immunosuppression and/or T-cell exhaustion, and thus may overcome blocks to T-cell activation by checkpoint inhibitors. Chapter 3 focuses on immune agonists. Immune agonist therapeutics—most of which are mAbs—target specific cell surface proteins on T cells, resulting in stimulation of T cell activity. This mechanism contrasts with that of checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to overcome blockages to T cell activity mediated by immune checkpoints. Companies are developing immune agonist immunotherapeutics principally for use in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., as immuno-oncology 2.0 agents). All of the agents discussed in this chapter are in early-stage clinical trials. Chapter 4 discusses bispecific antibody (bsAb) cancer immunotherapeutics. A bispecific Ab (bsAb) is a type of mAb. bsAbs are designed with two different variable domains that enable the Ab to bind simultaneously to two different types of targets. bsAbs used in cancer immunotherapy usually bind one target on a tumor cell and another target on a cytotoxic immune system cell, bringing the two types of cells into close proximity. This allows the immune system to act against the tumor cell. There are currently two approved and marketed bsAb cancer immunotherapeutics—catumaxomab (Neovii Biotech's Removab) and blinatumomab (Amgen's Blincyto). Catumaxomab is a rat-mouse hybrid bsAb that targets the tumor antigen epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and the T-cell surface molecule CD3. It is approved in Europe for treatment of malignant ascites in patients with EpCAM-positive cancer if a standard therapy is not available. Blinatumomab is a murine Ab-derived small bsAb that targets CD3 on T-cells and CD19 on B-cell neoplasms. It is approved under the FDA's accelerated approval program for treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. It has also been granted conditional marketing authorization in the European Union for the treatment of adults with Ph- relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL. Blinatumomab is the first anti-CD19 drug to receive FDA approval. As discussed in Chapter 6, the most advanced CAR T-cell (genetically engineered T cells bearing chimeric antigen receptors) therapies in development target CD19 and are intended for treatment of CD19+ B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. However, none of these cellular therapies is yet approved. As with other first-generation bsAbs, blinatumomab is unstable and has a short serum half-life. It must be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion over a minimum of 4 weeks. The infusion can be administered to outpatients via a minipump system. The short half-life of the agent is not due to the formation of antimouse Abs. Researchers and companies are working on technology platforms that can yield more stable bsAbs. Some companies and researchers are attempting to develop bsAb agents as alternatives to CAR T-cell therapies. These companies see bsAbs as potentially safer than CAR T cells. Moreover, bsAbs can be manufactured like other Ab-based biologics and then administered to patients with cancers specifically targeted by the bsAb. There is thus no need to isolate autologous T cells as the basis for a patient's therapy or to develop and carry out individualized manufacturing protocols, as in the case of CAR T cells. Except for catumaxomab and blinatumomab, all bsAb candidates are in Phase 1 trials. No efficacy findings have been published. Thus, it is not known whether any of these agents is likely to be approved, and it is too early to tell whether bsAbs can serve as an alternative to CAR T-cell therapies. Key issues in the bsAb area include moving away from rodent-derived Abs toward human or humanized molecules, and developing agents with improved stability and half-life in the circulation. Developers of bsAbs need to develop improved technologies aimed at producing more stable molecules. Also important are the ability to easily design and manufacture bsAbs and to rapidly redesign improved versions of agents entered into first-in-humans trials. Based on these issues, companies have developed several platform technologies for producing bsAbs, which are discussed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 focuses on therapeutic anticancer vaccines and oncolytic viruses. Efforts to develop therapeutic cancer vaccines began in the 1990s. However, the cancer vaccine field has been characterized by a long series of clinical failures, beginning in the 1990s and continuing to the present day. Researchers have been working to overcome these difficulties by using improved research methodologies and by employing advances in our understanding of immuno-oncology. In the current era, researchers have used their greater understanding of dendritic cell biology to attempt to improve the design of peptide and protein vaccines. Another important factor that has contributed to the failure of cancer vaccines is immune suppression in the tumor environment. Some researchers hypothesize that one way to overcome this immunosuppression is to administer vaccines in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. More recently, researchers have been investigating the mechanisms by which the immune system—especially TILs—recognize tumor cells and differentiate them from noncancer cells. These studies have focused on "neoantigens"—i.e., antigens that are specific for cancer cells, as opposed to normal, noncancer cells. These neoantigens are associated with somatic mutations that arise in the evolution of tumor cells. TILs—especially CD8+ intratumoral T cells—may mediate tumor regression, and this antitumor activity may be enhanced by checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Researchers therefore hypothesize that neoantigen-based vaccines may be more effective than earlier types of cancer vaccines. They further hypothesize that determination of neoantigens in tumors may provide technology platforms for the design of effective cancer vaccines. As discussed in Chapter 5, there are currently one approved and marketed therapeutic cancer vaccine and one approved and marketed oncolytic virus therapeutic. Sipuleucel-T (Dendreon/Valeant's Provenge) is a personalized dendritic cell vaccine that targets prostatic acid phosphatase. It was approved by the FDA for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in 2010 and was approved in Europe for the same indication in 2013. It is the first approved therapeutic cancer vaccine. However, sipuleucel-T has an apparently minimal effect and is very expensive. It also faces significant competition from small-molecule agents. As a result, sipuleucel-T sales—and Dendreon the company—have faltered. Dendreon filed for filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2014, and its assets were sold to Valeant in 2015. As of May 18, 2016, Valeant was looking to sell off the "laggard" Provenge, in order to ameliorate its own debt problems. Therefore, the future of sipuleucel-T remains in doubt. In 2015, the FDA approved talimogene laherparepvec (Amgen's Imlygic, also known as T-Vec), an oncolytic herpes simplex virus that expresses granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). It is approved for the treatment of melanoma lesions in the skin and lymph nodes. This oncolytic virus is injected into a single tumor, where it lyses tumor cells. It was postulated that upon lysis of tumor cells in the treated lesion, systemic immune responses are induced. There was evidence for induction of immune responses in distant tumor sites in a published Phase 1 study, and there was a trend toward improved overall survival in early results of a Phase 3 study presented at the 2013 ASCO Annual Meeting. However, as determined by completed results of the same Phase 3 study, the agent was not subsequently shown to improve overall survival or have an effect on distant metastases. Strictly speaking, T-Vec is not a cancer vaccine, since it carries no tumor antigen in its molecular structure. It is designated as an oncolytic virus therapy and is the first such agent to receive FDA approval. However, since it had been designed to immunize patients systemically against multiple tumor antigens, it is generally considered a "cancer vaccine" in scientific and market research reports. Amgen and Merck—together with their academic collaborators—have been conducting clinical studies of a combination of the oncolytic virus therapy talimogene laherparepvec and the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab. The results of a Phase 1b study presented at the 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting appeared promising. The combination therapy is now under investigation in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Other researchers are conducting clinical trials of combinations of T-Vec with another checkpoint inhibitor, ipilimumab. Chapter 5 includes discussions of several therapeutic cancer vaccines and one oncolytic virus therapeutic that are in clinical development (from Phase 1 to Phase 3). Phase 3 vaccines include Bavarian Nordic's PROSTVAC-VF and Argos Therapeutics' AGS-003. PROSTVAC-VF is being developed for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the same indication as sipileucel-T. It targets prostate specific antigen (PSA). PROSTVAC-VF is a recombinant poxvirus agent carrying genes for PSA and three costimulatory molecules. Unlike sipileucel-T, it is an "off-the-shelf" immunotherapeutic that can be manufactured as a biologic product. Phase 2 data suggests that PROSTVAC-VF may have superior efficacy compared to currently approved agents. Argos' AGS-003 is a personalized dendritic cell vaccine that is under investigation in Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with mRCC. To produce the vaccine, autologous dendritic cells are loaded with mRNA from the patient's mRCC tumor. Some of the tumor cell mRNAs encode tumor antigens that are expressed on the surfaces of the dendritic cells (in the context of MHC class II molecules); these cells also express CD40. The tumor mRNA-programmed autologous dendritic cells constitute the vaccine, which is then formulated into an intradermal injection for administration to the patient. The dendritic cells serve as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that activate T cells specific for the patient's tumor antigens. The interaction of CD40 with its ligand on activated T cells induces secretion of IL-12 by the dendritic cells. IL-12 promotes the differentiation of T cells into T helper 1(Th1) cells. The Phase 3 trial of AGS-003 is a follow-up to favorable Phase 2 data that was presented at the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting. Notably, several early-stage therapeutic cancer vaccine programs discussed in Chapter 5 are based on research designed to identify naturally processed Class I and Class II peptide epitopes for formulation into vaccines. TapImmune is developing two vaccines based on research at the Mayo Clinic designed to identify such epitopes from specific tumor antigen proteins, in one case HER2/neu (in HER2/neu+ breast cancer) and in the other case TPIV200 folate receptor alpha (in ovarian cancer and triple negative breast cancer). Neon Therapeutics' NEO-PV-01 is based on research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Center and the Broad Institute to identify naturally-processed neoantigen peptide epitopes from patient tumors using exome sequencing and predictive algorithms for MHC binding. Unlike the TapImmune products, this research is designed to identify these epitopes from multiple tumor antigen proteins. Neon is one of several recently formed cancer vaccine companies discussed in Chapter 5 that are focused on neonatigen science and technology. Among companies exploring neoantigen vaccines, the only other one that has reached the clinical stage as of 2016 is the German firm BioNTech AG. BioNTech specializes in mRNA-based neoantigen vaccines, as opposed to peptide vaccines. The company presented an abstract describing the design of the still-ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of its IVAC (individualized vaccine) Mutanome in advanced melanoma patients at the 2015 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. In September 2016 BioNTech entered into a collaboration with Genentech to develop, manufacture, and commercialize novel mRNA-based, neoantigen/neoepitope cancer vaccines based on the IVAC Mutanome technology platform. Other neoantigen vaccine companies mentioned in Chapter 5 that have not yet reached the clinic are Gritstone Oncology, ISA Pharmaceuticals, Agenus, and Caperna (a Moderna venture company). Imuno-oncology 2.0 strategies now feature prominently in therapeutic cancer vaccine and oncolytic virus therapeutic development. This is particularly true with neoantigen vaccines, which are designed to induce neoantigen-specific TILs within patients' tumors. The strategy is to use the vaccine to induce the TILs, rendering checkpoint inhibitors effective in inducing tumor regression. Based on this strategy, Neon's NEO-PV-01 vaccine is being combined with poly-ICLC adjuvant and Bristol-Myers Squibb's PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab in collaborative clinical studies in advanced melanoma, smoking-associated NSCLC, and bladder cancer. The immuno-oncology 2.0 strategy has become a general theme of cancer vaccine research and development beyond neonantigen vaccines—use cancer vaccines to render tumors inflamed, and use checkpoint inhibitors to induce regression of the inflamed tumors. Thus, there are several examples of trials of cancer vaccine/checkpoint inhibitor combinations discussed in this chapter. In some cases, cancer vaccines are being tested in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials, rather than the "traditional" approach of first getting a vaccine approved and then conducting trials of the vaccine in combination with other agents. It is possible that testing a vaccine in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in early stage clinical trials may reduce the number of failed cancer vaccines. However, whether this is true remains to be seen. Chapter 6 focuses on the use of adoptive T-cell immunotherapies for cancer. In this class of therapies, autologous or syngeneic activated T cells (which may or may not be genetically modified) are infused into patients in order to attack their cancers. Adoptive immunotherapy is also known as adoptive cell transfer (ACT). Immunotherapy with TIL cells ACT was pioneered by Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The major focus of the Rosenberg group has been TIL therapy, which involves isolation of TILs (which are really tumor-infiltrating T cells) from a patient's tumor, followed by ex vivo expansion of these cells with IL-2. The TILs and high-dose IL-2 are then infused intravenously into the patient. The infused T cells traffic to tumors and can mediate their destruction. Clinical study of TIL therapy has continued to the present day. Moreover, attempts to overcome some of the limitations of TIL therapy have resulted in the development other newer forms of ACT based on various types of genetically engineered T cells. Most studies with TIL therapy have been in advanced melanoma. The Rosenberg group presented the results of a Phase 2 trial of TIL therapy in stage 4 metastatic melanoma patients who had received preparative lymphodepletion therapy at the 2014 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). At the time of analysis, 11 of 101 patients had achieved a complete response, and 44 had achieved a partial response, for an overall objective response rate (ORR) of 54%.

In that report, we focused on the major classes of cancer immunotherapy drugs that were then emerging from academic and corporate research: immune checkpoint inhibitors, cancer vaccines, and adoptive T-cell therapies. Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4823008/ This new report includes an updated discussion of approved and clinical stage agents in immuno-oncology, including recently-approved agents. It also addresses the means by which researchers and companies are attempting to build on prior achievements in immuno-oncology to improve outcomes for more patients. Some researchers and companies refer to this approach as "immuno-oncology 2.0." The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), in its 12th Annual Report on Progress Against Cancer (2017), named "Immunotherapy 2.0" as its "Advance of the Year." Nevertheless, metastatic melanoma remains incurable. Furthermore, in many studies in advanced melanoma and other cancers, only a minority of patients have benefited from immunotherapy treatments. Researchers and companies are therefore looking for ways to build on the initial successes of the immuno-oncology field to improve outcomes for more patients, hence the need for an "immuno-oncology 2.0." Agents that are intended to improve the results of treatment with agents like checkpoint inhibitors may also be referred to as "second-wave" immuno-oncology agents. As discussed in this report, researchers have found that checkpoint inhibitors produce tumor responses by reactivating TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes)—especially CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. This key observation is perhaps the most important factor driving development of second-wave immuno-oncology strategies. As a result, researchers have been developing biomarkers that distinguish inflamed (i.e., TIL-containing) tumors—which are susceptible to checkpoint inhibitor therapy—from "cold" tumors, which are not. They have also been working to develop means to render "cold" tumors inflamed, via treatment with various conventional therapies and/or development of novel agents. These studies are the major theme of "second-wave" immuno-oncology, or "immuno-oncology 2.0." Highlights of this Report Include: - Approvals of checkpoint inhibitors - Biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitor treatments - Approved and clinical-stage immunotherapy biologics other than checkpoint inhibitors - Immunotherapy with TIL cells - Commercialization of TIL therapy - Adoptive immunotherapy with genetically engineered T cells bearing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) - Manufacturing issues with CAR T-cell therapies - General conclusions on the progress of cellular immunotherapy - Outlook for cancer immunotherapy Executive Summary Approvals of checkpoint inhibitors As discussed in Chapter 2, researchers are continuing to conduct clinical trials designed to gain approval for new checkpoint inhibitors and for new indications for already-approved agents. Notable recent developments include the 2016 approval of atezolizumab (Roche/Genentech's Tecentriq), the first PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) inhibitor to be approved. On May 18, 2016 atezolizumab was approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has worsened during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy, either before or after surgical treatment. Later, on October 18, 2016, the FDA approved atezolizumab for use in patients with metastatic NSCLC (regardless of PD-L1 expression) who have progressed during or after treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy or appropriate targeted therapy. Also in October 2016, the FDA approved the PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) inhibitor pembrolizumab as a monotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ?50%. This was after this agent met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ?50%. In contrast, monotherapy with the competing PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo) did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ?5%. This result is affecting the competition between BMS' nivolumab and Merck's pembrolizumab. In Merck's KEYNOTE-024 trial, the patient population that was treated with either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy consisted of individuals with previously untreated advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at ?50%. In contrast, BMS' CheckMate 026 trial of nivolumab as a monotherapy evaluated the drug in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at only ?5%. This difference in trial design may explain the divergent results of the two trials, rather than a potential superior efficacy of pembrolizumab over nivolumab. Nevertheless, the results of the KEYNOTE-024 trial advance the prospects of Merck's pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with high levels of PD-L1 expression, while BMS must conduct an evaluation of its study and decide what to do next. In addition to the discussions of approved checkpoint inhibitors, Chapter 2 also includes discussions of clinical stage agents in this class. These include Novartis' PD-1 inhibitor PDR001, AstraZeneca's PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab, and Merck-Serono/Pfizer's PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab. Notably, avelumab has been under evaluation in a pivotal Phase 2 trial in Merkel cell carcinoma, with favorable results reported in the 2016 ASCO annual meeting. Merck-Serono and Pfizer plan to submit the drug to regulatory authorities based on these results. Biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitor treatments The later sections of Chapter 2 discuss the role of biomarkers in checkpoint inhibitor treatments, especially in the context of "immuno-oncology 2.0." "Immuno-oncology 2.0" may involve development of novel agents, such as those discussed in this and other chapters of the report. It may also involve combining different immunotherapies, combining immunotherapies with older types of treatments and/or with new experimental treatments, or other novel approaches. The development and use of biomarkers will be key to the progress of "immuno-oncology 2.0." Biomarkers will help researchers and physicians predict responses to immunotherapy treatments. Such tests may not only spare patients the costs and adverse effects of treatments that may not help them, but may also help researchers to design optimal, "personalized" treatments. Several classes of biomarkers are in use and/or development for cancer immunotherapy, and especially for use in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. A target biomarker is a biomarker that reflects the presence of a specific molecular drug target. In the case of PD-1 inhibitors, the direct target is PD-1, and the downstream target (i.e., the ligand of PD-1 that is affected by its binding) is PD-L1. In the case of PD-L1 inhibitors, the direct target is PD-L1. Recent results from studies of first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab as a monotherapy demonstrate the potential value of PD-L1 as a biomarker in treatment of patients with PD-1 inhibitors. PD-L1 as a biomarker has also been important in clinical studies supporting the approval of the PD-L1 blocking agent atezolizumab. Researchers found that increased PD-L1 expression in the tumors of patients with urothelial carcinoma was associated with response to atezolizumab. Although patients with tumors negative for PD-L1 expression might still respond to the drug, the greater efficacy of atezolizumab in those classified as positive for PD-L1 expression suggests that the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells may help identify patients more likely to respond to treatment with the agent. Target biomarkers—especially PD-L1—are being used to define patient subsets that can productively be treated with a checkpoint inhibitor, especially in clinical trials and in approval decisions by regulatory agencies. However, these tests imperfectly discriminate between patients who can benefit from these therapeutics and those who cannot. Moreover, they are of little use in designing improved therapies that build on current checkpoint inhibitor therapies to improve patient outcomes. Genetic biomarkers are also under investigation for use in cancer immunotherapy. In immuno-oncology, genetic biomarkers are generally used to determine the likelihood that a patient's tumors possess a sufficient somatic mutation load to support a large and diverse population of CD8+ TILs, which are specific for mutation-associated neoantigens. Treatment with checkpoint inhibitors can then reactivate these TILs, resulting in effective antitumor immune responses. Examples of genetic biomarkers discussed in this report include mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency and mutation load, as determined by whole-exome sequencing. Immunological biomarkers enable direct testing to determine whether a patient's tumors contain sufficient TILs to enable successful treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. In particular, researchers have found that CD8+ TILs located at the invasive margin of a tumor (as determined, for example, by quantitative immunohistochemistry) appear to be necessary for successful treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. In one study, researchers found that pre-existing CD8+ T cells located at the invasive margins of tumors from patients with metastatic melanoma may predict response to therapy with the anti-PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. Patients who responded to therapy showed proliferation of the intratumoral CD8+ T cells that directly correlated with reduction in tumor size. The researchers established a predictive model based on CD8 expression at the invasive margin and validated the model in an independent group of 15 patients. Another type of immunological biomarker is the "Immunoscore"—a method of characterizing the nature and function of immune cell infiltrates into tumors based on measuring the densities of CD3+ and CD8+ cells in the tumor core and the invasive margin using immunohistochemistry. The Immunoscore was developed by Jérôme Galon, Ph.D. [Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM)] and his colleagues for use in studies of colorectal cancer. According to Dr. Galon's findings, use of checkpoint inhibitors is the logical strategy for patients with high Immunoscores. In contrast, for patients with low Immunoscores, effective immuno-oncology treatments will need to focus on getting immune cells into the tumor in the first place (e.g., by treatment with a "second-wave" immunotherapy agent) before checkpoint inhibitors can be used. Genetic and immunological biomarkers may be combined with target biomarkers and other parameters to move toward better discrimination between patients who are likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibitor treatments and those who are not. Specifically, biomarkers can be used to discriminate between "cold" and inflamed tumors. Genetic and immunological biomarkers can also be used to design therapies that can turn "cold" tumors into inflamed tumors, thus improving responses to checkpoint inhibitor therapy and other immunotherapies. For example, these biomarkers might be used to design combinations of treatments that induce immune infiltration of tumors with checkpoint inhibitors that activate or reactivate infiltrating immune cells, such as TILs. Novel agents that might induce immune infiltration of tumors are discussed in several chapters of this report. More immediately, combination therapies involving the use of older treatments or agents, followed by administration of checkpoint inhibitors, are under clinical investigation to determine whether any of these older agents might render "cold" tumors inflamed, making them susceptible to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Among these older treatments (discussed in Chapter 2) are radiation therapy (especially stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), targeted therapies, and cytotoxic chemotherapies. Approved and clinical-stage immunotherapy biologics other than checkpoint inhibitors Various chapters of this report focus on approved and clinical-stage biologics other than the checkpoint inhibitors. Most of these agents may be used as "immuno-oncology 2.0" agents, i.e., agents that promote T-cell infiltration of tumors, thus rendering them susceptible to successful treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. In addition to serving as an introduction to the report as a whole and discussing the early history of cancer immunotherapy, Chapter 1 focuses on cytokines as cancer immunotherapeutics. Interleukin-2, interferon-alpha-2a, and interferon alpha-2b have long been approved for treatment of various cancers. To this day, despite the introduction of newer immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, high-dose recombinant IL-2 (Novartis/Prometheus Laboratories' Proleukin) is the only drug so far that has produced durable, long-term responses in patients with metastatic melanoma or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. According to Patrick Ott, M.D., Ph.D. (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA), "High-dose IL-2 has a track record of patients who have been disease-free for 20 years, and we just don't know that yet with the new drugs [such as checkpoint inhibitors]." In the case of advanced melanoma, high-dose intravenous bolus IL-2 induces objective clinical responses in 15–20% of patients and durable complete responses in 5–7% of these patients. For metastatic RCC (mRCC), high-dose intravenous bolus IL-2 gives an objective clinical response rate of approximately 25% and a 7% durable complete response rate. However, high-dose IL-2 has a significant degree of toxicity. Because of its adverse effects, high-dose IL-2 therapy for cancer requires an expert, experienced team of clinicians and specialized centers. Under such conditions of care, IL-2-related toxicity can usually be easily managed. Despite its logistical disadvantages, several investigators are attempting to revive use of IL-2 in cancer immunotherapy. In the current era, it is possible to use targeted therapies as salvage agents to treat patients who do not do well with IL-2. There may also be opportunities to develop combination therapies of IL-2 with radiation or checkpoint inhibitors, and clinical trials of these combination therapies are underway. IL-2 treatment also requires only a median of one month of therapy and gives a long duration of benefit without the need for additional treatment. This is not true, for example, for treatment with cytotoxic therapies or targeted therapies. In addition to its use as a stand-alone drug, IL-2 is also used as part of certain cellular immunotherapies. Other, newer cytokine-based therapies discussed in Chapter 1 are in early-stage clinical trials. Notably, local intratumoral electroporation of a DNA plasmid that encodes human IL-12 (pIL-12) (OncoSec's ImmunoPulse) can result in systemic responses in metastatic melanoma patients. This procedure appears to induce TILs and anti-tumor immunity in both the injected tumors and in distant tumor sites. A Phase 2 trial indicates that intratumoral pIL12-electroporation therapy may prime systemic responses for checkpoint inhibitor blockade, apparently by generation of CD8+ TILs. ImmunoPulse therapy followed by treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor is therefore a potential immuno-oncology 2.0 therapy for metastatic melanoma. Other early-stage potential immuno-oncology 2.0 therapies discussed in Chapter 1 are based on the cytokines IL-10 and IL-15. In addition to discussing approved and clinical-stage checkpoint inhibitors and their mechanisms of action, Chapter 2 includes discussions of clinical-stage checkpoint inhibitor modulators, such as LAG-3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) inhibitors, TIM-3 (T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3) inhibitors, small-molecule IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) pathway inhibitors, and a small-molecule PI3K? (phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma) inhibitor. These agents are in Phase 1 or Phase 2 development. In general, they work to overcome immunosuppression and/or T-cell exhaustion, and thus may overcome blocks to T-cell activation by checkpoint inhibitors. Chapter 3 focuses on immune agonists. Immune agonist therapeutics—most of which are mAbs—target specific cell surface proteins on T cells, resulting in stimulation of T cell activity. This mechanism contrasts with that of checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to overcome blockages to T cell activity mediated by immune checkpoints. Companies are developing immune agonist immunotherapeutics principally for use in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., as immuno-oncology 2.0 agents). All of the agents discussed in this chapter are in early-stage clinical trials. Chapter 4 discusses bispecific antibody (bsAb) cancer immunotherapeutics. A bispecific Ab (bsAb) is a type of mAb. bsAbs are designed with two different variable domains that enable the Ab to bind simultaneously to two different types of targets. bsAbs used in cancer immunotherapy usually bind one target on a tumor cell and another target on a cytotoxic immune system cell, bringing the two types of cells into close proximity. This allows the immune system to act against the tumor cell. There are currently two approved and marketed bsAb cancer immunotherapeutics—catumaxomab (Neovii Biotech's Removab) and blinatumomab (Amgen's Blincyto). Catumaxomab is a rat-mouse hybrid bsAb that targets the tumor antigen epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and the T-cell surface molecule CD3. It is approved in Europe for treatment of malignant ascites in patients with EpCAM-positive cancer if a standard therapy is not available. Blinatumomab is a murine Ab-derived small bsAb that targets CD3 on T-cells and CD19 on B-cell neoplasms. It is approved under the FDA's accelerated approval program for treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. It has also been granted conditional marketing authorization in the European Union for the treatment of adults with Ph- relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL. Blinatumomab is the first anti-CD19 drug to receive FDA approval. As discussed in Chapter 6, the most advanced CAR T-cell (genetically engineered T cells bearing chimeric antigen receptors) therapies in development target CD19 and are intended for treatment of CD19+ B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. However, none of these cellular therapies is yet approved. As with other first-generation bsAbs, blinatumomab is unstable and has a short serum half-life. It must be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion over a minimum of 4 weeks. The infusion can be administered to outpatients via a minipump system. The short half-life of the agent is not due to the formation of antimouse Abs. Researchers and companies are working on technology platforms that can yield more stable bsAbs. Some companies and researchers are attempting to develop bsAb agents as alternatives to CAR T-cell therapies. These companies see bsAbs as potentially safer than CAR T cells. Moreover, bsAbs can be manufactured like other Ab-based biologics and then administered to patients with cancers specifically targeted by the bsAb. There is thus no need to isolate autologous T cells as the basis for a patient's therapy or to develop and carry out individualized manufacturing protocols, as in the case of CAR T cells. Except for catumaxomab and blinatumomab, all bsAb candidates are in Phase 1 trials. No efficacy findings have been published. Thus, it is not known whether any of these agents is likely to be approved, and it is too early to tell whether bsAbs can serve as an alternative to CAR T-cell therapies. Key issues in the bsAb area include moving away from rodent-derived Abs toward human or humanized molecules, and developing agents with improved stability and half-life in the circulation. Developers of bsAbs need to develop improved technologies aimed at producing more stable molecules. Also important are the ability to easily design and manufacture bsAbs and to rapidly redesign improved versions of agents entered into first-in-humans trials. Based on these issues, companies have developed several platform technologies for producing bsAbs, which are discussed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 focuses on therapeutic anticancer vaccines and oncolytic viruses. Efforts to develop therapeutic cancer vaccines began in the 1990s. However, the cancer vaccine field has been characterized by a long series of clinical failures, beginning in the 1990s and continuing to the present day. Researchers have been working to overcome these difficulties by using improved research methodologies and by employing advances in our understanding of immuno-oncology. In the current era, researchers have used their greater understanding of dendritic cell biology to attempt to improve the design of peptide and protein vaccines. Another important factor that has contributed to the failure of cancer vaccines is immune suppression in the tumor environment. Some researchers hypothesize that one way to overcome this immunosuppression is to administer vaccines in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. More recently, researchers have been investigating the mechanisms by which the immune system—especially TILs—recognize tumor cells and differentiate them from noncancer cells. These studies have focused on "neoantigens"—i.e., antigens that are specific for cancer cells, as opposed to normal, noncancer cells. These neoantigens are associated with somatic mutations that arise in the evolution of tumor cells. TILs—especially CD8+ intratumoral T cells—may mediate tumor regression, and this antitumor activity may be enhanced by checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Researchers therefore hypothesize that neoantigen-based vaccines may be more effective than earlier types of cancer vaccines. They further hypothesize that determination of neoantigens in tumors may provide technology platforms for the design of effective cancer vaccines. As discussed in Chapter 5, there are currently one approved and marketed therapeutic cancer vaccine and one approved and marketed oncolytic virus therapeutic. Sipuleucel-T (Dendreon/Valeant's Provenge) is a personalized dendritic cell vaccine that targets prostatic acid phosphatase. It was approved by the FDA for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in 2010 and was approved in Europe for the same indication in 2013. It is the first approved therapeutic cancer vaccine. However, sipuleucel-T has an apparently minimal effect and is very expensive. It also faces significant competition from small-molecule agents. As a result, sipuleucel-T sales—and Dendreon the company—have faltered. Dendreon filed for filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2014, and its assets were sold to Valeant in 2015. As of May 18, 2016, Valeant was looking to sell off the "laggard" Provenge, in order to ameliorate its own debt problems. Therefore, the future of sipuleucel-T remains in doubt. In 2015, the FDA approved talimogene laherparepvec (Amgen's Imlygic, also known as T-Vec), an oncolytic herpes simplex virus that expresses granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). It is approved for the treatment of melanoma lesions in the skin and lymph nodes. This oncolytic virus is injected into a single tumor, where it lyses tumor cells. It was postulated that upon lysis of tumor cells in the treated lesion, systemic immune responses are induced. There was evidence for induction of immune responses in distant tumor sites in a published Phase 1 study, and there was a trend toward improved overall survival in early results of a Phase 3 study presented at the 2013 ASCO Annual Meeting. However, as determined by completed results of the same Phase 3 study, the agent was not subsequently shown to improve overall survival or have an effect on distant metastases. Strictly speaking, T-Vec is not a cancer vaccine, since it carries no tumor antigen in its molecular structure. It is designated as an oncolytic virus therapy and is the first such agent to receive FDA approval. However, since it had been designed to immunize patients systemically against multiple tumor antigens, it is generally considered a "cancer vaccine" in scientific and market research reports. Amgen and Merck—together with their academic collaborators—have been conducting clinical studies of a combination of the oncolytic virus therapy talimogene laherparepvec and the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab. The results of a Phase 1b study presented at the 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting appeared promising. The combination therapy is now under investigation in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Other researchers are conducting clinical trials of combinations of T-Vec with another checkpoint inhibitor, ipilimumab. Chapter 5 includes discussions of several therapeutic cancer vaccines and one oncolytic virus therapeutic that are in clinical development (from Phase 1 to Phase 3). Phase 3 vaccines include Bavarian Nordic's PROSTVAC-VF and Argos Therapeutics' AGS-003. PROSTVAC-VF is being developed for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the same indication as sipileucel-T. It targets prostate specific antigen (PSA). PROSTVAC-VF is a recombinant poxvirus agent carrying genes for PSA and three costimulatory molecules. Unlike sipileucel-T, it is an "off-the-shelf" immunotherapeutic that can be manufactured as a biologic product. Phase 2 data suggests that PROSTVAC-VF may have superior efficacy compared to currently approved agents. Argos' AGS-003 is a personalized dendritic cell vaccine that is under investigation in Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with mRCC. To produce the vaccine, autologous dendritic cells are loaded with mRNA from the patient's mRCC tumor. Some of the tumor cell mRNAs encode tumor antigens that are expressed on the surfaces of the dendritic cells (in the context of MHC class II molecules); these cells also express CD40. The tumor mRNA-programmed autologous dendritic cells constitute the vaccine, which is then formulated into an intradermal injection for administration to the patient. The dendritic cells serve as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that activate T cells specific for the patient's tumor antigens. The interaction of CD40 with its ligand on activated T cells induces secretion of IL-12 by the dendritic cells. IL-12 promotes the differentiation of T cells into T helper 1(Th1) cells. The Phase 3 trial of AGS-003 is a follow-up to favorable Phase 2 data that was presented at the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting. Notably, several early-stage therapeutic cancer vaccine programs discussed in Chapter 5 are based on research designed to identify naturally processed Class I and Class II peptide epitopes for formulation into vaccines. TapImmune is developing two vaccines based on research at the Mayo Clinic designed to identify such epitopes from specific tumor antigen proteins, in one case HER2/neu (in HER2/neu+ breast cancer) and in the other case TPIV200 folate receptor alpha (in ovarian cancer and triple negative breast cancer). Neon Therapeutics' NEO-PV-01 is based on research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Center and the Broad Institute to identify naturally-processed neoantigen peptide epitopes from patient tumors using exome sequencing and predictive algorithms for MHC binding. Unlike the TapImmune products, this research is designed to identify these epitopes from multiple tumor antigen proteins. Neon is one of several recently formed cancer vaccine companies discussed in Chapter 5 that are focused on neonatigen science and technology. Among companies exploring neoantigen vaccines, the only other one that has reached the clinical stage as of 2016 is the German firm BioNTech AG. BioNTech specializes in mRNA-based neoantigen vaccines, as opposed to peptide vaccines. The company presented an abstract describing the design of the still-ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of its IVAC (individualized vaccine) Mutanome in advanced melanoma patients at the 2015 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. In September 2016 BioNTech entered into a collaboration with Genentech to develop, manufacture, and commercialize novel mRNA-based, neoantigen/neoepitope cancer vaccines based on the IVAC Mutanome technology platform. Other neoantigen vaccine companies mentioned in Chapter 5 that have not yet reached the clinic are Gritstone Oncology, ISA Pharmaceuticals, Agenus, and Caperna (a Moderna venture company). Imuno-oncology 2.0 strategies now feature prominently in therapeutic cancer vaccine and oncolytic virus therapeutic development. This is particularly true with neoantigen vaccines, which are designed to induce neoantigen-specific TILs within patients' tumors. The strategy is to use the vaccine to induce the TILs, rendering checkpoint inhibitors effective in inducing tumor regression. Based on this strategy, Neon's NEO-PV-01 vaccine is being combined with poly-ICLC adjuvant and Bristol-Myers Squibb's PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab in collaborative clinical studies in advanced melanoma, smoking-associated NSCLC, and bladder cancer. The immuno-oncology 2.0 strategy has become a general theme of cancer vaccine research and development beyond neonantigen vaccines—use cancer vaccines to render tumors inflamed, and use checkpoint inhibitors to induce regression of the inflamed tumors. Thus, there are several examples of trials of cancer vaccine/checkpoint inhibitor combinations discussed in this chapter. In some cases, cancer vaccines are being tested in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials, rather than the "traditional" approach of first getting a vaccine approved and then conducting trials of the vaccine in combination with other agents. It is possible that testing a vaccine in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in early stage clinical trials may reduce the number of failed cancer vaccines. However, whether this is true remains to be seen. Chapter 6 focuses on the use of adoptive T-cell immunotherapies for cancer. In this class of therapies, autologous or syngeneic activated T cells (which may or may not be genetically modified) are infused into patients in order to attack their cancers. Adoptive immunotherapy is also known as adoptive cell transfer (ACT). Immunotherapy with TIL cells ACT was pioneered by Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The major focus of the Rosenberg group has been TIL therapy, which involves isolation of TILs (which are really tumor-infiltrating T cells) from a patient's tumor, followed by ex vivo expansion of these cells with IL-2. The TILs and high-dose IL-2 are then infused intravenously into the patient. The infused T cells traffic to tumors and can mediate their destruction. Clinical study of TIL therapy has continued to the present day. Moreover, attempts to overcome some of the limitations of TIL therapy have resulted in the development other newer forms of ACT based on various types of genetically engineered T cells. Most studies with TIL therapy have been in advanced melanoma. The Rosenberg group presented the results of a Phase 2 trial of TIL therapy in stage 4 metastatic melanoma patients who had received preparative lymphodepletion therapy at the 2014 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). At the time of analysis, 11 of 101 patients had achieved a complete response, and 44 had achieved a partial response, for an overall objective response rate (ORR) of 54%.

While common, experts say these kinds of relationships raise conflict of interest concerns and must be carefully navigated. Here's a quick look at how Noseworthy, a neurologist by training, might manage his dual roles as Mayo's CEO and Merck board member. 1) How unusual it is for someone of Noseworthy's stature to serve on a pharmaceutical's board? It's not that unusual. Noseworthy will join high ranking medical professionals from Johns Hopkins, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on the Merck board. Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed 41 board members of the 50 biggest drug companies held leadership positions in American medical colleges. • Related: Dayton concerned by Mayo Clinic favoring privately insured patients Supporters of these ties say bringing people who run world renowned medical centers like Mayo Clinic together with the pharmaceutical industry can improve medicine. Drug companies, they say, can learn a lot about patient care from people like Noseworthy. And it can go both ways. In a statement, a Mayo spokesperson said that the appointment will give the hospital another lens into the "highly complex health care marketplace and to anticipate major trends in the pharmaceutical industry that may affect patients." 2) What's the concern then about a hospital CEO sitting on drug company board? Anyone who sits on the board of a drug company has a fiduciary responsibility to that company — you work for shareholders. For hospitals, where these drugs are administered and sometimes even tested in clinical trials, the relationship raises some important questions. A hospital executive who sits on a drug company board could feel pressure to get his hospital to buy the drug company's products. Hypothetically speaking, Noseworthy's presence on the board could potentially "give Merck a leg up" inside Mayo, said Dr. Eric Campbell, a Harvard Medical School professor who researches physician conflicts of interest. "It could increase the likelihood that the patients who are seen there will get Merck drugs," he said. "It could also create the impression that the Mayo Clinic is endorsing Merck." These tricky relationships aren't limited to hospital executives who sit on the boards of drug companies, he added. His research suggests that 85 percent of doctors have some form of a relationship with pharmaceutical companies. 3) What is Mayo saying about how it will handle these potential conflicts? Mayo says its board of trustees and board of governors carefully vetted the appointment and ultimately decided that the board position would raise Mayo's credibility rather than dilute it. The clinic also says a conflict of interest plan is being developed and that it will be monitored by an oversight committee. Practically speaking, Noseworthy will recuse himself from decisions involving Merck, including decisions about drug purchasing, business relationships and research initiatives. Mayo also said that Noseworthy will disclose his board membership when speaking publicly about pharmaceutical industry issues. 4) Will Noseworthy be paid? Yes, he will. His compensation for serving on the Merck board will include $110,000 in compensation and $170,000 in deferred stock per year. Mayo said this is standard practice for Merck's board members and that it adheres to Mayo policies that allow employees to be paid for board work done on personal time. Mayo says that it actually lags other prestigious hospitals that have leaders on drug and medical device company boards. So, Mayo's own Board of Trustees is interested in having more of its leaders serve in similar roles in the future. The trustees believe that these memberships will only expand the experience and insights of clinic employees.

Last Updated: 12 April 2017 Article by Tal Band S Horowitz & Co Introduction In a landmark judgment1 rendered on June 15, 2016, the Supreme Court allowed an appeal filed by The Manufacturers Association of Israel ("the Association"), but denied that filed by Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. ("MSD"), thereby determining that MSD's patent term extension ("PTE") for ezetimibe (EZETROL�, marketed in the US under the name ZETIA�), has expired. The judgment has significant importance, both with respect to the constitutionality, as well as to the purposive interpretation of the amendment of the Israeli Patents Law, 1967 back in 2006. Furthermore, the judgment contains important observations concerning the essence of the intellectual property right and its limitations, as well as classifying the pertinent legislation as retroactive, and the implications of such classification. Background Since 1998, the Israeli Patents Law allows for extension of the term of certain basic patents for an additional term not exceeding five years beyond the basic 20 year period. However, the mechanism that applies in Israel for calculating PTE is unique. In essence, PTE in Israel is linked to that granted in other reference countries (currently the U.S., Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and France) and comprises of the shortest possible term, based on the following principles: Shortest Period Principle � calculation of PTE in Israel (in terms of number of days) shall be based on the shortest extension term granted in any of the reference countries; and First to Expire Principle � PTE in Israel will expire as soon as the first reference PTE or patent in another reference country expires. It is further provided in the Patents Law that the overall period of the basic patent and the PTE granted in respect thereof shall terminate no later than 14 years from the date the first registration for marketing purposes is received in a "recognized country". As aforesaid, the additional term will not exceed five years. In 2005, MSD (then operating as Schering Corporation) obtained a PTE for an Israeli issued patent (IL110956) covering the active substance ezetimibe (EZETROL�/ZETIA�) ("the Israeli PTE"). At that time, the Israel Patent Office ("the ILPTO") did not adhere to the principle of adapting the shortest possible term for PTEs and, therefore, granted dozens of PTEs whose terms were longer than those intended by the legislator. In 2006, due to this misinterpretation guiding the ILPTO, the legislator amended the Patents Law (Amendment No. 7) and included, among others, a clarification that the shortest possible term must always be selected ("the Amendment"). According to the transitional provision of the Amendment, most of its provisions equally applied to a group of about 50 PTEs that had already been granted prior to enactment of the Amendment, provided that the basic patent on which such PTEs were granted was still in force (hence the relevant PTEs had not yet become operable at that time). In the years following the Amendment, and although its provisions applied to newly-granted PTEs, nothing was done�either by the ILPTO or by the PTE holders themselves�to curtail those 50 odd PTEs. The Proceedings Based on the Amendment, in 2013, the Association filed motions with the Registrar of Patents ("the Registrar") to curtail the term of a number of Israeli PTEs, which, as noted above, were also subject to the Amendment, including the PTE covering ezetimibe. In its motion, the Association demonstrated that the reference PTE in the U.S. (US RE 37721) had been extended by 497 days and thus, in reliance on the Amendment, asserted that the Israeli PTE, if duly extended by the same period, would expire in January 2016 and not June 2017, as originally granted. MSD argued in response that the transitional provision of the Amendment is a retrospective denial of property rights, and therefore must be construed as applying only to procedural aspects, without this affecting the term of the Israeli PTE. Alternatively, MSD asserted that the transitional provision must be declared as void, due to its incompatibility with Israel's basic law protecting property rights (i.e., that the transitional provision is unconstitutional). As a further alternative, MSD asserted that the PTE in the U.S. cannot serve as a reference, since it was granted after the grant of the Israeli PTE, and that the term of the Israeli PTE should be calculated accordingly. As a result, MSD argued that the Israeli PTE should expire only in October 2016, based on the first marketing authorization which was obtained in Germany, in October 2002. In a decision rendered in September 2014, the Registrar rejected all of MSD's arguments and accepted the Association's motion. In essence, the Registrar held that the transitional provision of the Amendment is balanced and accords with the pertinent basic law. The Registrar refused to ignore the U.S. PTE, despite it being granted after the Israeli PTE and, therefore, ruled that the Israeli PTE will expire in January 2016. In November 2014, MSD appealed the Registrar's decision to the District Court of Jerusalem. In November 2015, the District Court rendered its judgment, dismissing the majority of the appeal (with respect to the construction and constitutionality of the transitional provision of the Amendment), but allowed the appeal with respect to the alternative argument. In its ruling, the District Court noted that taking into account the fact that the reference PTE was granted after grant of the Israeli PTE, curtailing the Israeli PTE on that basis will go against the principle of certainty. Accordingly, the term of the Israeli PTE was once again extended to October 2016. Both parties filed leaves to appeal the District Court's judgment to the Supreme Court, essentially reiterating their previous positions. The Court allowed the Attorney General to join the proceedings and submit his opinion, which supported reinstatement of the Registrar's decision, i.e., accepting and adopting the Association's position. After holding an oral hearing, the Supreme Court has now rendered its written judgment, allowing the Association's appeal and denying that filed by MSD. The Court did not find any basis to MSD's assertion that the legislator intended not to consider PTEs granted after grant of the Israeli PTE, inter alia, where the cause for curtailment is based on the "shortest period principle". The Court emphasized the aspects of public health affected by the expiry of patent protection in the pharmaceutical field, as well as the incentives aimed to encourage research and development in said field. The Court also noted that the public interest supports refraining from awarding compensation which exceeds that required to preserve the incentive that was provided prior to enactment of the Amendment. The conclusion in the circumstances of the case is that maintaining the balance between public health and incentivising research and development requires that reference PTEs should be taken into account, regardless of their date of grant. In this context, the Court found irrelevant MSD's assertion that the principle of "co-termination" must apply, i.e., that the Israeli PTE should expire only at, and no earlier than, the time when the market in a recognized country has opened for competition. Specifically, MSD asserted that adhering to the principle of "co-termination" will provide patentees with a certain amount of certainty with respect to the expected expiry of the patent protection. The Court nonetheless held that although an Israeli PTE will never remain in force after the expiry of the first reference PTE in a recognized country, it is certainly possible that the Israeli PTE will expire before any other reference PTE. In a broader sense, it was explained by the Supreme Court that the principle of certainty�which constituted the ground for the District Court's ruling�was "sacrificed" by the legislator when it balanced the various competing interests. This was done in order to protect the public interest, and not to over-compensate the originator drug manufacturers at the expense of free competition, which is necessary in order to significantly reduce the prices of drugs. The Supreme Court found that a PTE, whose term is based on the shortest reference PTE amounts, in the eyes of the legislator, to reasonable compensation for the patent holder. Such compensation would therefore encompass both the time invested for getting a specific drug approved by the health authorities, as well as the de facto monopoly term which has been lost due to the availability of a "Bolar" exemption under Israeli law. With respect to MSD's appeal, it was held that the transitional provision of the Amendment cannot be defined as retroactive or retrospective. The court was uncertain if the financial implications of legislation would be considered as harming one's constitutional property rights. In any event, it was held that even if the transitional provision denies MSD's property rights, such harm was not unlawful. The Supreme Court analysed the differences between traditional property (i.e., tangible assets), where (unlawful) use of the property by others denies the owner from making use thereof and intellectual property, where unlawful use does not deny the owner the same use but mostly hinders the ability of the proprietor of the IP right to reap and maximise the economic benefits stemming from his right (to exclude others from using his invention, for example). The Court further noted that, given the fact that patent laws stand in the frontline of technology, those laws must respond promptly to various events and developments, more so than in other intellectual property legislation fields. The Court then stated that the limits of patent rights should therefore be correspondingly dynamic. In light of the above, the Court found that regularization of PTEs is flexible. As opposed to creating a strict irrevocable right, it creates a dynamic right, predisposed to befit certain changes. Comment The Supreme Court was once again faced with the need to balance between the principle of public health in the sense of access to affordable drugs, and incentivising research and development. The balance was expressed, in this case, in determining the line to be drawn between PTE protection and free competition. The Israeli legislator has been consistent in applying the principle of minimal protection under PTEs, which translates into the guiding rule that the shortest possible term for PTEs must always be selected. The Supreme Court chose to adhere to the principles laid down by the legislator and emphasized that even if the consequence of applying the rule leads to a certain amount of uncertainty among PTE holders, the balance still leans more favourably towards allowing free competition, whose ultimate aim is to improve public health. As transpires from the important ruling, this landmark decision is expected to have significant implications on both the constitutionality of amendments to the Patents Law, as well as the purposive interpretation of patent legislation in general, and PTEs in particular. In a broader sense, since the Supreme Court noted that the public interest supports refraining from over-compensating research and development in the pharmaceutical field, it is believed that aspects of public health, affected by the expiry of patent protection in said field, may be given more weight in future cases.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News Human Vaccines Market: Extensive Promotion and Marketing Strategies and Favorable Government Support Are Likely to Boost Market Growth Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 04/12/2017 — The vendor landscape of the global market for human vaccines features a markedly high level of consolidation, with the companies Merck & Co, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc., and Sanofi, Pfizer, Inc., collectively accounting for over 70% of the overall market in 2015, notes Transparency Market Research in a recent report. To outplay competitors, companies are focusing on establishing ties with national and international healthcare bodies, strengthening distribution chains, and investing funds in the development and deployment of innovative and more efficient storage and transportation techniques. Transparency Market Research states that the global human vaccines market will exhibit a promising 11.2% CAGR from 2016 through 2024, rising from a valuation of US$28.3 bn in 2015 to US$72.5 bn by 2024. Combination Vaccines to See Increased Rate of Adoption Based on the type of vaccine, the market for human vaccines has been examined in the report for conjugate vaccines, recombinant vaccines, inactivated vaccines, combination vaccines, and attenuated vaccines. Of these, the segment of conjugate vaccines contributed the bulk of revenue to the global market in 2015. Although the segment will continue to be one of the leading product varieties, the segment of combination vaccines will expand at an outstanding pace over the forecast period. From a geographical standpoint, the North America human vaccines market dominated in 2015 and is expected to retain dominance throughout the forecast period, thanks to the presence of some of the world’s leading human vaccine manufacturers. The regional market is expected to reach a valuation of US$28.0 bn by 2024. In the forthcoming years, the Asia Pacific market is expected to emerge as the region with the most promising growth opportunities. The region will exhibit a 12.5% CAGR over the report’s forecast period. High Level of Consumer Confidence about Minimal Side Effects Bolster Market’s Growth Prospects It has been established over the several decades of their use that vaccines present a significantly low risk of fatal and serious side effects. This confidence happens to be the key factors associated with the immense popularity of vaccines for the treatment of a number of diseases among consumers as well as among healthcare practitioners. Several notable healthcare organizations also recommend the use of vaccines to tackle a number of conditions and international agencies such as WHO place massive attention on the state of development of ongoing research activities in the area of human vaccines. For more information on this report, fill the form @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=16127 High Costs of Products Could Hinder Growth Prospects across Cash-sensitive Regional Markets The research, development, clinical trials involved in bringing to market a new vaccine is a highly expensive affair. Moreover, the storage and transportation of human vaccines require specialized and advanced equipment, adding to the overall cost of marketing these products. Moreover, strict regulatory hurdles involved in the process of approval of human vaccines and bulk purchases by government bodies also bring down profitability of the human vaccines market. These factors are especially more challenging in developing and less-developed economies, wherein high cost of products could lead to reduced consumption and demand. This review of the market is based on a recent market research report published by Transparency Market Research, titled „Human Vaccines Market (Vaccine Type – Conjugate, Recombinant, Inactivated, Combination, and Attenuated; Product – Pneumococcal, Influenza, Hepatitis, HPV, Meningococcal, Rotavirus, Measles, Typhoid, and Combination; Age Group – Pediatrics, Adolescents, Adults, and Geriatrics; Distribution Channel – Hospital Pharmacies and Drugstores) – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 – 2024.” About Transparency Market Research Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

A surprisingly high number of Americans have HPV. That means the market for Inovio could be big -- if the company can achieve success with its experimental drugs. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Apr 12, 2017 at 8:04AM Bad news for some can be good news for others. That could be the case with a survey the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) published last week. There was definitely some bad news about the prevalence of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) in Americans. Here's why, though, this bad news could bode well for Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:INO).  Image source: Getty Images. Survey says HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. The recently published NCHS survey showed just how common it is. NCHS talked to American adults between the 18 and 59 from 2011 through 2014. Researchers conducted interviews with a cross-section of individuals in their homes and followed up with standardized physical examinations. What did the survey find? More than 42% of American adults had genital HPV. Nearly 23% of the survey participants were infected with high-risk genital HPV, which is more likely to lead to cancer. According to the survey, non-Hispanic black Americans had the highest genital HPV rates, with 64% having some form of genital HPV and nearly 33% having high-risk genital HPV. Prevalence of oral HPV was lower, but still concerning. Over 7% of the total population was found to be infected with oral HPV. Roughly 4% had high-risk oral HPV. Potential impact for Inovio The results from the NCHS survey underscored the importance of vaccines to prevent HPV infection. However, immunization rates for HPV remain low. Around 40% of girls and 20% of boys between 13 and 17 have received one of the approved HPV vaccines sold by Merck (NYSE:MRK) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK).  Going forward, only Merck's Gardasil HPV vaccines will be available in the United States. GlaxoSmithKline announced its decision to withdraw its Cervarix vaccine from the U.S. market in October, citing "very low market demand." This action highlighted the disappointing levels of HPV immunization rates. It's possible, though, that the NCHS survey results could help educate more Americans about the risks of HPV. Merck has launched an ad campaign to encourage parents to have their children vaccinated. The high numbers of American adults with HPV found in the NCHS survey could provide a shock effect that convinces more people of the urgency of vaccination. Those results also highlight the potential market opportunity for Inovio. The company's lead product, VGX-3100, is a DNA immunotherapy that's designed to treat pre-cancerous conditions and cancers caused by HPV. Inovio also has a cervical cancer immunotherapy, INO-3112, in early-stage testing. With a significant number of Americans infected with high-risk oral and genital HPV, Inovio's experimental drugs could be needed even more than initially thought.  Where things stand now The problem for Inovio right now is that a planned late-stage study of VGX-3100 can't move forward. In October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration placed a clinical hold on the phase 3 study of VGX-3100 in treating cervical dysplasia. The FDA requested additional data pertaining to the delivery device to be used in administering the drug to patients.  Inovio CEO Joseph Kim said in March that his company was still completing its response to the FDA. Kim stated that Inovio still expected to begin the phase 3 study in the first half of this year. He also indicated that a phase 2 study evaluating VGX-3100 in treating precancerous lesions at the vulva would begin in 2017.  As for INO-3112, Inovio expects its partner, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), will soon begin a phase 2 study of the experimental drug in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab.  AstraZeneca already has several other clinical studies in progress for durvalumab as a monotherapy and in combination with other drugs.   The NCHS survey on HPV prevalence points to a potentially growing need for immunotherapies that can combat HPV-caused precancerous conditions and cancers. It remains to be seen if Inovio will be able to capitalize on this need.  Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News Krensavage Asset Management Urges Juniper Pharmaceuticals to Consider Sale of Company NEW YORK, April 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Krensavage Asset Management LLC, a 2.2% shareholder of Juniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: JNP), today publishes an open letter. James A. Geraghty Chairman Juniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 33 Arch Street Suite 3110 Boston, MA 02110 April 12, 2017 Dear Mr. Geraghty, As the fifth-largest shareholder of Juniper Pharmaceuticals(1), we implore you to quit spending shareholders’ money on failed science projects and instead consider selling the company. Juniper’s cash, supply agreement with Merck KGaA and pharmaceutical-services business suggest a potential takeover value of more than twice the company’s stock price(2). Since Juniper went public in 1988, it has spent $237 million, or almost $22 a share, on science of dubious value. Its most-recent failure, a topical lidocaine to prevent the pain of gynecological procedures, helped consume almost $17 million on research and development during the last two years. Lidocaine is a proven painkiller available in over-the-counter sunburn lotions. Yours still managed to fail. The lidocaine debacle follows Juniper’s failed bid to develop a progesterone gel, Prochieve, to prevent preterm birth.  Physicians embrace progesterone as a prophylactic against premature labor. Juniper and a partner, the former Watson Pharmaceuticals, spent almost a decade and tens of millions of dollars testing Prochieve on more than 1,000 pregnant women. Regulators in 2012 rejected the drug. Now Juniper is threatening to repeat this pattern by testing a drug that delivers progesterone via a vaginal ring. Its development likely would consume tens of millions of dollars and take at least five years while providing no guarantees of safety and efficacy. Even if Juniper’s progesterone ring were to win approval, it likely would compete with clones of an injectable progesterone approved in 2011, Makena. The prospects are slim that Juniper would ever recover its investment. Juniper also is considering the development of a vaginal ring for incontinence. At first blush, its potential tantalizes: The ring would bypass the body’s first-pass metabolism and spare the patient side effects such as dry mouth. But a competing patch and gel that also avoids first-pass side effects have generated disappointing sales, perhaps because they compete with generic pills that retail for pennies. A patch sells over the counter for $30 a month. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited abandoned its oxybutynin vaginal ring. Juniper should do the same. Juniper, with a market value less than $50 million, seems to have forgotten the difficulty small companies face promoting drugs. Management during its third-quarter earnings call on Nov. 15 said it would consider buying commercial operations. In 2003, Juniper built a 122-person sales force to promote its testosterone supplement, Striant. Its revenue totaled $14.8 million when Juniper divested it in 2011. The list of small companies that failed to launch medicines includes Dendreon Corp., and Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc. Any efforts by Juniper to develop or promote drugs likely would detract from the company’s intrinsic value, we estimate, of almost $9 a share. Juniper’s most-valuable asset, in our opinion, is its pharmaceutical-services business. We value it at more than $36 million, or $3.35 a share. Juniper in 2013 paid $27 million for the business, based in the United Kingdom. Its revenues have since grown 45%. Molecular Profiles can operate independently. It doesn’t need supervision from a team of executives in the United States. Juniper also has a supply agreement with Merck KGaA on Crinone, a progesterone approved to help women become pregnant. The Merck contract, in our opinion, probably is worth at least $3.30 a share, or twice that were Juniper to extend the Merck agreement beyond its expiration of May, 2020. Other Juniper assets include net cash of more than $2 a share. We exclude the value of $156 million of tax-loss carryforwards because we find them difficult to assess. Asset Per-Share Value Notes Net cash $2.12 Current assets less current liabilities plus deferred revenue less notes payable as of Dec. 31. Merck KGaA revenue $3.30 Assumes Merck revenue growth of 3% annually until agreement ends May 19, 2020; gross margin of 43%, and Bloomberg’s weighted-average cost of capital of 12.2%. Juniper Pharma Services $3.35 Assumes 2.8 times 2016 revenue. Juniper acquired the business for 2.95 times revenue in 2013. Sum $8.77 Assumes 10.9 million shares outstanding. Juniper management has an incentive to maintain the status quo, with its top-four executives earning $2.3 million a year and its non-employee directors earning more than $736,000 in 2015, according to the proxy. Shareholders are paying executives more than 6% of the market capitalization a year.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News High Prevalence of Infectious Diseases Drives the Global Antibacterial Drugs Market An antibacterial drug is referred to as an antimicrobial agent interfering with the growth and reproduction of bacteria that cause numerous mild to severe infections in humans and animals. Antibacterial drugs either kill or inhibit their growth. These agents possess bactericidal activity which target various parts of bacterial physiology such as protein synthesis, cell wall synthesis, nucleic acid synthesis and permeability of cell membrane, and therefore help in treating infections. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antibacterial-drugs-ma… Antibacterial drugs are being in use since the discovery of the first antibacterial in the form of penicillin in 1928, and presently a wide range of antibacterials in several formulations are commercially available and used for the treatment of various indications like pneumonia, tuberculosis, tetanus, diphtheria, diarrhea, legionellosis and other diseases. The global antibacterial drugs market has been categorized into eight segments based on their class which include: aminoglycosides, β-lactams, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, quinolones/ fluoroquinolones, macrolides, phenicols, and miscellaneous antibacterials. In 2014, β-lactams occupied the leading position with a share of 57.7% of the global antibacterial drugs market followed by the quinolones. However, these drug classes are expected to witness a decline in their market share during the forecast period due to scheduled patent expiry of key branded formulations, coupled with growing number of drug resistant bacterial strains and increasing influx of generic drugs. Hence, on account of the factors mentioned above, the global antibacterial drugs market is expected to witness slow growth during the forecast period 2015 to 2023. However, the miscellaneous antibacterials segment is expected to grow with the highest CAGR accompanied with growing demand for therapies against bacterial infections and rising geriatric populations are some of the factors that are anticipated to maintain the growth of the antibacterial drugs market. Additionally, expected commercialization of various antibacterial agents that are currently in developmental stages, such as solithromycin (Cempra, Inc.), VivaGel (SPL7013) (Starpharma Holdings Limited), surotomycin (Merck & Co.) MK-3415A (Merck & Co.) during the forecast period is also expected to profound impact on growth of this market. Asia-Pacific held the largest share of the revenue generated by the global antibacterial drugs market in 2014. This region is also expected to experience the highest growth rate during the forecast period 2015 to 2023. The major factors responsible for this region to hold leadership in this market in 2014 include presence of large number of generic manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturers in Asian countries, growing incidences of bacterial infections such as MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and tuberculosis and increasing purchasing power of the domestic population. For more information on this report, fill the form @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Moreover, developing health care infrastructure, presence of a large population base and growing geriatric population which is more prone to diseases would consequently increase the uptake of antibacterial drugs in Asia. North America held the second largest revenue share followed by Europe in the antibacterial drugs market in 2014. Market maturity, shortened product lifecycle, stringent regulatory requirements and generic infiltration are some of the factors that accounted for slow growth of this market. AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly and Company, Allergen plc, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer, Inc., and Sanofi are the major players engaged in the development, production and marketing of various antibacterial drugs. These players have worldwide presence in the pharmaceutical industry and are involved in constant competition with each other. Pfizer, Inc. was observed to be the most promising and leading player in the Antibacterial drugs market. Major customers for their antibacterial drugs include hospitals, private clinics, physicians and patients.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News Insomnia Market Research Report 2026 Global Insomnia Market: Brief Account The world insomnia market is envisaged to recoup promisingly from its drowsy growth in the past with a number of worthwhile and well-timed opportunities to take advantage of. Insomnia drugs could find an application in the treatment of Parkinson and Alzheimer’s disease as sedatives. The younger population can increase the global demand as intensively as the geriatric group with rising stress levels and persisting diseases such as cancer at the forefront. The launch of new products such as E-2006 by Eisai Co. Ltd. and Belsomra by Merck & Co. Inc. is forecasted to stimulate the market growth handsomely. Download The Full Brouchre of Report www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… The global insomnia market could be segmented according to over-the-counter (OTC) treatment, non-pharmacological treatments, and pharmacological treatments, where each category is evaluated to contribute their part toward the global growth. The researchers who have authored this report prioritize painstaking primary and secondary research to compile statistical data and other analytics of the global insomnia market. Players in the market can gain a decisive insight into the guidelines required to extend their portfolio in the right direction and achieve a tangible success in the market. Global Insomnia Market: Key Trends With the two premier categorizations of the worldwide insomnia market into play, viz. non-pharmacological treatments and pharmacological treatments, manufacturers can expect lucrative prospects from both the segments. The cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) listed under non-pharmacological treatments extends the ability of physicians to heal patients or understand their health issues in a comprehensive manner. Such treatments including hypnotherapy can be employed by doctors to take multiple approaches during the treatment of their patients. There are other treatments such as aroma music, bright light, biofeedback, acupuncture, and yoga therapies which could contribute to the growth of the non-pharmacological treatments market. Likewise, pharmacological treatments are prognosticated to lay a strong platform for the global insomnia market to find more growth prospects on the back of key segments such as OTC sleep aids and prescription sleep aids. The international insomnia market could go through a downtime period due to inferior diagnosis rate, below par patient compliance, patent erosion, and ascendancy of generic products. Howbeit, the surging incidences of insomnia and unfulfilled medical needs, for instance, the inefficiency of central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are foreseen to compensate for the probable decline in growth. Global Insomnia Market: Geographical Study For the most part of the share in world insomnia market, the Americas including North America are foretold to showcase extensive dominance while offering some groundbreaking opportunities for global players. In the U.S., the OTC treatment market is anticipated to register a higher CAGR to address its growth in the insomnia pharmacological treatment sector. The OTC sleep aids market can be classified into valerian roots, melatonin, and antihistamines. An increasing number of patients are convinced to adopt OTC sleep aids because of the infamous side effects caused by prescription drugs and low prices and easy availability of OTC treatments. The U.S. insomnia market is predicted to gain support from the rising consumption of valerian roots and melatonin, owing to their crucial advantages such as decreased stress levels and less side effects. Browse Global Strategic Business Report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/insomnia-market.html The Americas could be followed by Europe, the Middle East, and Africa on account of the augmenting interest in spreading health awareness through various programs and inflating geriatric population. The insomnia market in Asia Pacific is also looked upon as a decent opportunity for vendors to capitalize on with the elevating disposable income and upsurge in the occurrence of chronic diseases. Global Insomnia Market: Top Companies Some of the prominent companies functioning in the international insomnia market are Purdue Pharma L.P., Pernix Therapeutics, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., Sanofi, Pfizer, Inc., Meda Consumer Healthcare Inc., Merck & Co.

The Ticker Tape , TD Ameritrade   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} April 12, 2017 11:46am   Comments Share: In 2016, healthcare was the only sector in the S&P 500 (SPX) that ended the year in the red, declining 2.7% versus a positive 12% return for the SPX. However, things appear to be looking up in 2017 with the sector up 7.8% at the end of March heading into Q1 earnings—trailing only tech and consumer discretionary. Despite the sector’s performance year-to-date, or YTD, the earnings picture doesn’t seem to be as optimistic. Healthcare companies in the SPX are expected to grow earnings only 0.5% year-over-year in the first quarter, versus 9.1% for the broader index, according to FactSet Research. For the rest of 2017, FactSet expects healthcare earnings to pick up and grow 4.2% for the year versus the SPX’s estimated 9.8% earnings growth. Over the next month, we’ll see earnings from healthcare giants like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK). JNJ reports on April 18 with consensus third-party analyst estimates of $1.76 earnings per share, or EPS, on revenue of $18 billion. JNJ was one of the few major healthcare companies to beat the SPX’s return in 2016 and the stock is up about 8% since the start of the year. LLY is expected to report April 25 with consensus analyst estimates of $0.95 EPS on revenue of $5.23 billion. LLY finished 2016 down 12.7% versus the SPX’s 9.5% gain, but the stock has made up ground in 2017 and is up 14.8% since the start of the year—helped by Goldman Sachs upgrade from neutral to buy in late-2016 on its promising pipeline. Both PFE and MRK are expected to report on May 2. Q1 consensus analyst estimates for PFE are $0.67 EPS on revenue of $13.02 billion while MRK is expected to report $0.83 EPS on revenue of $9.32 billion. MRK is beating the SPX  so far in 2017, while PFE’s performance has lagged. Figure 1 below shows JNJ, LLY, PFE and MRK’s YTD performance. Politics in Focus After failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, investors might be more skeptical of House Republicans’ and President Trump’s ability to deliver on other reforms like taxes. While changes to the ACA would have varied impacts on the healthcare sector, lower corporate taxes should benefit many companies. President Trump has also hinted at a tax holiday that would allow companies to repatriate profits back to the United States at lower tax rates. This could have an outsized impact on some of the larger healthcare companies holding billions in cash overseas. Companies could use these potential tax savings to invest in growth, acquire companies, and boost buybacks and dividends. There are some concerns Washington’s focus on drug prices could negatively impact healthcare companies. Ethan Lovell, with Janus Captial Group, isn’t too worried. In an interview with Barron’s, he said “At the end of the day, the people in charge in Congress do not see drug-price controls as a solution. Elected officials would break new ground if they tried to regulate drug prices beyond the scope of the programs they control or fund through the federal budget.” Regardless of changes to drug pricing, negative scrutiny isn’t good for any company. M&A in the Healthcare Sector Mergers and acquisitions, or M&A, have been slowing down in the past several months. From December through February, M&A deal volume in Health Services and Health Technology was down roughly 21% compared to the same period a year ago, according to FactSet Research. Even though deal volume was down, deal value was up $55.66 billion. Some analysts think this trend could continue as large healthcare companies look for companies with promising drug pipelines. Right now, a lot of focus in the markets is on tax reform, but it’s impossible to say what will happen and when in terms of policy changes. The healthcare sector has rallied in 2017, but there are potential catalysts like tax reform and drug pricing scrutiny that could affect stock prices in the future.

Kombe said a patient diagnosed with HIV at an early stage can be cured by reflexology which he said does not require medicine. But Vernon Mochache, Head of Research at the National Aids Control Council, said there is still no cure for HIV. "Several scientists are still trying to find a cure for HIV but we do not have one yet," he told the Star when reached for comment on Wednesday. Reuters reported last November that scientists were taking the battle to prevent HIV to the next level with large-scale trials. They were set to start using injections to protect vulnerable groups such as gay men and women in Africa for at least two months. Further down the road, the hope is to produce matchstick-sized implants containing slow-release drugs - similar to existing under-the-skin contraceptive devices - that could offer year-long protection. Companies with drugs involved include GlaxoSmithKline, Gilead Sciences and Merck. Regarding sexual activity, Kombe said: "Men who were [sexually] inactive will regain energy and have great performance with their spouses again." The MP added that reflexology also heals people who have suffered stroke, high blood pressure, stress, kidney failure, infertility and brain tumors. He cited the case of a 60-year-old woman who gave birth in Nairobi in January by way of the technique but did not give details. Reflexology refers to the application of appropriate pressure to specific points of the feet, hands and ears. Reflexologists believe these reflex points correspond to different body organs and systems and that pressing them has a beneficial effect on the organs and a person’s general health. Kombe said he has taken time off his busy schedule to attend to patients and that hundreds, including MPs, have been cured of various ailments. “I developed interest in the therapy after suffering kidney complications for long and taking medicines that did not cure me. [I got healed after finding a reflexologist]," he said. The MP revealed this at a rally at Chamari on Tuesday and said he was in the process of training people in reflexology to create employment. Kombe learned the skill from scholar Comulus Baya who went to Japan to study organic farming and alternative technology. The scholar was additionally trained in reflexology and returned in 2012. Baya told journalists reflexology is a natural alternative to medication. “Reflexology helps reduce toxins in the body. Many people, including the elderly, are suffering and spend a lot of money on medication but are not aware of the therapy," he said. The MP said he graduated last year and embarked on the aggressive training in areas including Magarini. He said a 15-minute session in rural areas costs between Sh200 and Sh500 while from Malindi town and beyond experts charge up to Sh2,500. Trainer Dennis Ngenja said they have trained 57 people and that 33 others will graduate in July. Others in Kombe's team said many people do not know about the therapy and have been suffering silently while relying only on medicine prescribed by doctors. Last year, Kombe introduced the technique as a subject in his Hollyways Secondary School. He plans to push for the amendment of the health law for its inclusion in the curriculum. The legislator told journalists after his graduation last year that thousands of people were suffering quietly at their homes. He said the body has so many complications that require not only medication but the electronic treatment through foot rubs. Thank you for participating in discussions on The Star, Kenya.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Therapeutics Market to Gain Significant Impetus from Government Interventions of Spreading Awareness about Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy The global hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) therapeutics market is dominated by companies exhibiting high sales. However, generic manufacturers are making their presence felt in the market gradually. As per Transparency Market Research (TMR), the top three companies in the market, Sanofi S.A., Pfizer, Inc., and Merck & Co., accounted for a share of over 64.5%, which points toward a highly consolidated vendor landscape. Browse the Complete Details of this Report at: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hypertrophic-cardiomyo… Intense competition exists among the top companies in the market. These enterprises are mainly focusing on expanding and differentiating their product portfolio to enjoy sustainable growth. Demand for HCM Therapeutics Surges due to Increasing Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure “The prevalence of chronic cardiovascular ailments is fueling demand for effective treatment, which has been translating into lucrative sales opportunities for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy therapeutics,” said a lead TMR analyst. Heart diseases make one of the most common causes of death in both men and women around the world. According to TMR, the rising incidence of congestive heart failure considerably fuels demand for effective medications. This creates attractive opportunities for sales of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy therapeutics. „Besides this, successful interventions conducted across several countries to spread awareness about hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have also aided the expansion of the HCM therapeutics market,” said the TMR analyst. Furthermore, patients are now more aware about the latest medical advances, which augurs well for the market. ECG screening is the most efficient technology for diagnosing HCM. The success demonstrated by this technology has significantly contributed in fuelling demand for HCM therapeutics. Rising Penetration of Advanced Medical Devices to Threaten Market Growth Despite witnessing positive growth opportunities, the rising penetration of medical devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators in the healthcare sector has been inhibiting the HCM therapeutics market’s trajectory. Demand for gene therapy and implantable medical devices is rising as patients gain adequate knowledge about positive results offered by such advanced medical devices. The increasing acceptance of these medical devices could limit the scope of expansion for the HCM therapeutics market. Nevertheless, drugs created specifically for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are yet to find approval. Once approved, this indication will bolster sales opportunities for the market players. Additionally, due to the high prevalence of unmet medical needs across Asia Pacific and the increasing medical expenditure in the region also boosts prospects for the HCM therapeutics market. Regionally, North America holds the largest share in the global HCM therapeutics market. However, as per TMR, the market is also expected to witness strong growth in Asia Pacific and Rest of the World. The Asia Pacific HCM therapeutics market is poised to expand at 2.9% CAGR between 2015 and 2023. By drug class, the market was led by calcium channel blockers in 2014. By drug class, the calcium channel blockers is expected to dominate the market. It held over 37.4% of the HCM therapeutics market in 2014. Obtain the Sample Research PDF of this Report at: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… TMR estimates the overall value of the global hypertrophic cardiomyopathy therapeutics market at US$1.2 bn in 2014. Exhibiting a moderate CAGR of 1.4% from 2015 to 2023, the market is expected to reach US$1.3 bn by the end of 2023.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News Krensavage Asset Management Urges Juniper Pharmaceuticals to Consider Sale of Company Krensavage Analysis Suggests Juniper Assets Potentially Worth Twice Stock PriceKrensavage Implores Juniper to End Wasteful Research, Refrain from Acquiring NEW YORK, April 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Krensavage Asset Management LLC, a 2.2% shareholder of Juniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: JNP), today publishes an open letter. James A. Geraghty Chairman Juniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 33 Arch Street Suite 3110 Boston, MA 02110 April 12, 2017 Dear Mr. Geraghty, As the fifth-largest shareholder of Juniper Pharmaceuticals(1), we implore you to quit spending shareholders' money on failed science projects and instead consider selling the company. Juniper's cash, supply agreement with Merck KGaA and pharmaceutical-services business suggest a potential takeover value of more than twice the company's stock price(2). Since Juniper went public in 1988, it has spent $237 million, or almost $22 a share, on science of dubious value. Its most-recent failure, a topical lidocaine to prevent the pain of gynecological procedures, helped consume almost $17 million on research and development during the last two years. Lidocaine is a proven painkiller available in over-the-counter sunburn lotions. Yours still managed to fail. The lidocaine debacle follows Juniper's failed bid to develop a progesterone gel, Prochieve, to prevent preterm birth.  Physicians embrace progesterone as a prophylactic against premature labor. Juniper and a partner, the former Watson Pharmaceuticals, spent almost a decade and tens of millions of dollars testing Prochieve on more than 1,000 pregnant women. Regulators in 2012 rejected the drug. Now Juniper is threatening to repeat this pattern by testing a drug that delivers progesterone via a vaginal ring. Its development likely would consume tens of millions of dollars and take at least five years while providing no guarantees of safety and efficacy. Even if Juniper's progesterone ring were to win approval, it likely would compete with clones of an injectable progesterone approved in 2011, Makena. The prospects are slim that Juniper would ever recover its investment. Juniper also is considering the development of a vaginal ring for incontinence. At first blush, its potential tantalizes: The ring would bypass the body's first-pass metabolism and spare the patient side effects such as dry mouth. But a competing patch and gel that also avoids first-pass side effects have generated disappointing sales, perhaps because they compete with generic pills that retail for pennies. A patch sells over the counter for $30 a month. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited abandoned its oxybutynin vaginal ring. Juniper should do the same. Juniper, with a market value less than $50 million, seems to have forgotten the difficulty small companies face promoting drugs. Management during its third-quarter earnings call on Nov. 15 said it would consider buying commercial operations. In 2003, Juniper built a 122-person sales force to promote its testosterone supplement, Striant. Its revenue totaled $14.8 million when Juniper divested it in 2011. The list of small companies that failed to launch medicines includes Dendreon Corp., and Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc. Any efforts by Juniper to develop or promote drugs likely would detract from the company's intrinsic value, we estimate, of almost $9 a share. Juniper's most-valuable asset, in our opinion, is its pharmaceutical-services business. We value it at more than $36 million, or $3.35 a share. Juniper in 2013 paid $27 million for the business, based in the United Kingdom. Its revenues have since grown 45%. Molecular Profiles can operate independently. It doesn't need supervision from a team of executives in the United States. Juniper also has a supply agreement with Merck KGaA on Crinone, a progesterone approved to help women become pregnant. The Merck contract, in our opinion, probably is worth at least $3.30 a share, or twice that were Juniper to extend the Merck agreement beyond its expiration of May, 2020. Other Juniper assets include net cash of more than $2 a share. We exclude the value of $156 million of tax-loss carryforwards because we find them difficult to assess. Asset Per-Share Value Notes Net cash $2.12 Current assets less current liabilities plus deferred revenue less notes payable as of Dec. 31. Merck KGaA revenue $3.30 Assumes Merck revenue growth of 3% annually until agreement ends May 19, 2020; gross margin of 43%, and Bloomberg's weighted-average cost of capital of 12.2%. Juniper Pharma Services $3.35 Assumes 2.8 times 2016 revenue. Juniper acquired the business for 2.95 times revenue in 2013. Sum $8.77 Assumes 10.9 million shares outstanding. Juniper management has an incentive to maintain the status quo, with its top-four executives earning $2.3 million a year and its non-employee directors earning more than $736,000 in 2015, according to the proxy. Shareholders are paying executives more than 6% of the market capitalization a year. On April 11, the stock hit a record low.  While the company's executives continue to draw rich compensation, its investors suffer. We implore the company to act now and stop the downward spiral.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News Aerosol Therapy Market Outlook to 2024 Latest Industry Forecast Report Aerosol is suspension of liquid or solid particles in a carrier gas, which makes use of it for treatment of respiratory system related diseases. Different forms of drugs can be utilized for aerosol therapy such as solid particles, liquid particles, solutions, and suspensions. Until recently, aerosol therapy concentrated primarily on treatment of asthma and COPD for which, pressurized metered-dose inhaler device was used. However, the role of aerosol therapy is expanding beyond the initial focus. This expansion eliminated CFC-based traditional metered-dose inhalers devices. This will ultimately boost the market growth of aerosol therapy in the field of gene therapy, inhalation therapy and vaccination. Aerosol therapy is a natural and easiest way to treat asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and broncho pulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Aerosol therapy is also used to deliver insulin, vaccines of influenza and measles, and pain medications. Aerosol treatment therapy gives an excellent and cost-efficient drug delivery. This therapy is effective for patients who cannot use metered-dose inhalers; primary inhalation devices are produced that guarantee breath-actuated aerosol delivery with minimal side effects. Aerosol therapy provides a fast and non-invasive way for treatment of lung disorders as the drug is delivered at the receptor site. Effectiveness of the therapy depends on how deeply aerosol particles infiltrate into the bronchial track and where the particles are deposited. A particle size under 2μm is ideal and can permeate up to the peripheral airways. That is why most commercially available aerosol devices produce droplets of roughly this size. Read Full Report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/aerosol-therapy-market… As per the World Health Organization, about half the cases of asthma and COPD are due to hereditary weakness and the other cases are due to environmental factors. The effect of pollution is likely to intensify globally along with industrialization of areas, and increasing the number of vehicles. Current government activities and rising healthcare investments are drivers of aerosol therapy market, which would upgrade over the examination time frame.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News Immuno-Oncology Market Estimated to Flourish by 2016–2026: Persistence Market Research New York, NY — (SBWIRE) — 04/12/2017 — Potential of immuno-oncology therapies to selectively identify and attack the cancer cells which reduces the side effects is intended to take the global market for immuno-oncology to a new high in the coming future. Immuno-oncology therapies target the immune system of the body and not the tumor, by activating immune system to recognize the cancer cell and kill them by natural mechanism. These immuno-oncology therapies are becoming choice of therapy by oncologists as they provide long lasting effects such that the body can adapt to the changing behavior (resistance) of cancer cells toward immune system and improve the quality survival. Commercial immuno-oncology therapies are available against cancer types such as prostate cancer and melanoma and many other are under clinical studies. Some of the available immuno-oncology therapies include Zaltrap, Keytruda, Opdivo, Yervoy, Imlygic, Zyclara and others. Cancer treatment vaccines are currently being developed which can enhance the immune system’s response to tumor cell. Some of the FDA approved cancer treatment vaccines include Sipuleucel-T, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) etc. Global Immuno-oncology Market: Drivers and Restraints Effective mechanism of immuno-oncology therapies for the patient with poor prognosis is expected to drive the growth of immuno-oncology market. The evidences from clinical trials reveals that the effects of immuno-oncology therapies on cancer cells would last for a longer time by preparing the immune system to fight against cancer cells even after the reduction in tumor cells. Additionally the side-effects associated with immuno-oncology therapies are limited as compared to many other cancer therapies, which creates a positive impact on the growth of immuno-oncology market. The restraining factors for the immuno-oncology therapies market are high cost of treatment, lack of awareness and slower pipeline development Extensive scope of immuno-oncology agents in various cancer treatments would provide maximum share to immuno-oncology treatment in overall cancer drug market during the forecast period. This lucrative opportunities in immuno-oncology treatment would provide boost to the product development during the forecast period. The slower pace of research and development activities and capital intense investment in manufacturing are the factors extending the commercialization of immuno-oncology therapies. However, lesser side effects associated with immunological treatments and better efficacy is expecting to get positive response from the cancer specialists after commercialization of immuno-oncology therapies. Global Immuno-oncology Market: Region-wise Outlook Geographically, the global Immuno-oncology therapies market is classified into regions namely, North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific, Japan, Middle East and Africa. North America and Europe are the lucrative regions for immuno-oncology market due to their potential to invest the huge amount of money in the development of immuno-oncology therapies and availability of better reimbursement policies. Moreover, affordability for the cost of treatment is also high in North America and Europe. The global immuno-oncology market is expected to grow during the forecast period due to increasing investment by multinational companies in the cancer research Global Immuno-oncology Market: Key Players Some of the key players in global immuno-oncology market are Seattle Genetics, Inc., Genentech, Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Eisai Co. Ltd., Amgen Inc., Bayer AG, Sanofi Aventis LLC., Merck & Co., Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Dendreon Corporation and others.

Depression is a medical disorder which is related to the brain. Symptoms of depression include feeling sad and tired, lacking energy, and having difficulty enjoying routine daily activities. According to CDC, depression affects about 1 in every 5 individuals in the U.S. According to WHO (World Health Organization), at present an estimated 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression. Depression affects 10% to 15% men and about 10% to 25% of women. Download The Full Brouchre of Report www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… The antidepressants market has been segmented based on the drug classes commonly used for the treatment of various types of depressive disorders. There are different types of antidepressant drugs available in the market such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), tetracyclic antidepressants, etc. The different types of antidepressants are used in the treatment of depressive disorders. The different classes of antidepressants are as effective as each other, but some patients respond better to one antidepressant compared to another antidepressant. Side effects can also be different between these groups of antidepressants. Different types of depression disorders include dysthymic disorder, postpartum depression, psychotic depression, major or clinical depressive disorder, and seasonal affective disorder. Factors driving the antidepressants market are declining side effects and rising efficacy of drugs in various classes as well as growing geriatric population where rate of mental illness is higher. However, the overall antidepressants market growth would decrease due to patent expiry of key antidepressants, fragile pipeline of new drugs, increasing number of generic drug alternatives, and growing prevalence of treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. Browse Global Strategic Business Report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antidepressants-market… Region wise, the global fermented ingredients market is segmented into five regions; North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is the most dominant market for antidepressants due to the presence of a large patient population suffering from various types of anxiety disorders and depression. However, the antidepressants market in the U.S. is currently saturated, as several antidepressant drugs are available on prescription for the same indication. Hence, the future growth of the market would depend on introduction of efficacious drugs for new indications. Moreover, loss of patent exclusivity, market maturity, generic infiltration, and shortened drug lifecycles are the additional factors that contribute to the decline in market growth in the region. Asia Pacific is expected to witness appreciable growth due to multiple factors such as high prevalence of psychiatric disorders and rapid economic growth in countries such as China, Japan, and Australia. Additionally, positive marketing approval for innovative medicines is likely to drive the market in the near future. Currently, the market is highly fragmented and competitive in nature due to the involvement of both large and small pharmaceutical companies. AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Company, Forest Laboratories, GlaxoSmithKline plc, H. Lundbeck A/S, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer, Inc. and Sanofi S.A. are major companies operating in the antidepressants market. Majority of the market players are focusing on expanding distribution network as well as expanding geographical presence, as Asia Pacific, the Middle East& Africa, and Latin America are developing regions with an increasing prevalence of various types of depressive disorders and improving economic conditions. Differences in clinical efficacy between drugs are generally small because most modern antidepressants work through a common biological mechanism. As a result, drug makers use direct-to-consumer advertising and tweak side effect profiles in order to differentiate their products.

There is a fair amount of risk involved, should a study come back negative or a candidate not be approved. Conversely, if a drug gains FDA approval or passes a clinical trial, there can be big upside. The Trump administration has promised reforms in the health care sector, such as changing the bidding process for drugs and shortening the FDA approval process. It has yet to be seen how much headway the White House can actually make with these reforms, especially after the House of Representatives failed to vote on Trump’s repeal of Obamacare. Keep in mind that short sellers betting against big pharma are taking on an added risk. They have to pay out the ongoing high dividends on top of the cost of borrowing the shares. The March 31 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and short interest decreased in most of these selected pharmaceutical stocks. Short interest in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) fell sharply to 66.11 million shares from the previous 89.05 million. Its shares were last seen at $33.93, within a 52-week trading range of $29.83 to $37.39. The number of Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) shares short fell slightly to 17.26 million from 17.37 million in the previous period. Its shares were trading at $62.58, in a 52-week range of $53.06 to $66.80. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s (NYSE: TEVA) short interest fell slightly to 21.48 million shares, compared to the previous level of 21.87 million. Shares were trading at $32.14, in a 52-week range of $31.90 to $58.16. The sharp fall in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY) short interest was to 23.58 million shares, from the previous reading of 35.06 million. Shares were trading at $52.98, within a 52-week range of $46.01 to $77.12. The number of shares short in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) decreased to 31.82 million, compared to the previous 35.74 million. The stock was trading at $64.18, in a 52-week range of $55.06 to $68.12. Eli Lilly and Co.’s (NYSE: LLY) short interest increased to 10.37 million shares from the previous 9.35 million. The stock was trading at $85.93. The 52-week range is $64.18 to $86.72.

Apexigen's drug is a monoclonal antibody designed to activate CD40, a cellular receptor - which is suppressed in tumours - that regulates the activation of immune system cells The two companies hope that combining APX005M with PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) will remove two 'brakes' holding back the actions of antigen-presenting cells in the tumour microenvironment, and thereby restore an immune reaction against the cancer cells. "Targeting the tumour microenvironment through activation of antigen-presenting cells is a novel approach that we are excited to add to our immuno-oncology strategy as we continue to advance research for cancers with limited treatment options," said BMS' head of oncology development Fouad Namouni. The two companies are planning two studies, one that will recruit second-line metastatic NSCLC patients who have failed prior chemotherapy, and a second in metastatic melanoma patients who have failed prior immuno-oncology therapy. The agreement is the second for San Carlos-based Apexigen in many months, having agreed to combine APX005M with Merck & Co's PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in a phase I/II study involving patients with metastatic melanoma. It started clinical trials of APX005M as a monotherapy in 2015. Checkpoint inhibitors such as Opdivo and Keytruda have already started to revolutionise the way cancer is treated, but some patients do not respond and it is widely thought that the real potential of these cancer immunotherapies will be seen when they are used in combination, both with each other and with chemotherapy or targeted cancer drugs. Furthermore, drug developers are forging alliances on all sides to test their drugs in tandem and with so many trials on the go it could be years before the optimal cocktails for individual cancer types are worked out. BMS already has a swathe of such alliances in place, most recently signing a wide-ranging alliance with Incyte to combine Opdivo with its IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat in clinical trials, including phase III studies in first-line NSCLC and head and neck cancer.

Campbell Dr. William C. Campbell discussed the drug Ivermectin, which helps combat the River blindness epidemic. The 2015 winner of a Nobel Prize in the category of Physiology or Medicine spoke at the event presented by the Health Studies Institute in coordination with the global studies and health care policy programs on April 7. By James Shepherd Nobel Prize winner William C. Campbell visited Rider University to speak about the therapy he discovered that combats infections caused by roundworms. Specifically, he discussed the drug Ivermectin and how it combats Onchocerciasis, or, as it its more commonly known, River blindness. Campbell won a Nobel Prize in 2015 in the Physiology or Medicine category. The root cause of River blindness is the bite of the Black Fly. “When it bites the person the infected larvae penetrate the bite wound and get under the skin before growing into adult worms,” Campbell said.” After the larvae mature, they begin to breed on their own. It is their progeny which migrate through the skin, some of which eventually end up in the eye. A telltale sign of infection is what Campbell refers to as “a tennis ball full of spaghetti.” Small nodules appear on the skin of the infected, within which lie the baby worms which eventually migrate through the skin to various points in the body. The therapy was eventually discovered through the efforts of research on a single mouse that had been exposed to the worms and larvae. “All of our microbial drugs have been discovered empirically,” Campbell said. “So in this case it was different because we tested substances in this new mouse [test], and the essence of the assay was that we gave a mouse an unknown amount of an unknown substance that might not be there.” The drug that had originally been found had been titled Avermectin but was later improved by chemists. “But it is in my experience that our chemistry friends seem to believe that no matter how good something is, the chemists will make it better.” Avermectin was improved by chemists by hydrogenating it, therefore improving its potency and resulted in the name change to Ivermectin. Campbell brought the drug to the attention of the board of the Merck Institute for Therapeutic Research to use the drug on human subjects instead of animals. Early community testing took place in West Africa and all results pointed towards a success of the drug, which in its final form killed the larvae in the skin. When it came to the debate of how to distribute the drug, the Merck Institute decided to give the drug away for free to those who needed it for as long as they needed it in a program they called the MDP (Mectizan Donation Program.) The drug is administered yearly in pill form. Since 2010, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Guatemala River blindness has been eliminated. Campbell believes that by 2025, River Blindness will be eliminated in Brazil and Venezuela. Campbell was gifted a crystal vase by Rider University as a token of gratitude.

This process of attenuation initially gets an infectious agent and modifies it in order to make it harmless or less virulent. These vaccines are formed by raising the virus in tissue cultures that will go for less virulent strains. These vaccines are very different from those formed by killing the virus. Browse Details of the Report@ https://www.hexaresearch.com/research-report/live-attenuated-vaccines-market In an attenuated vaccine, live virus particles possessing very low virulence is initially managed. They reproduce further in slow manner. Live attenuated vaccines comprise an adaptation of the living microorganism that has been made a little feeble in the lab so that it doesn’t bring about disease. As it is known that a live constricted immunization is the nearest thing to a characteristic contamination, these vaccines are considered as great “tutors” of the invulnerable framework. They bring about solid cell and antibody reactions and frequently enduring protection with one or two dosages. It is said that attenuated vaccines cannot be employed by immunocompromised individuals. These vaccines help in initiating all the stages of the immune system and it also offers more durable immunity such that boosters are needed less frequently. Other advantages attached with it include its low cost, quick immunity, plus they are quite easy to transport or administer. It has been anticipated that an advanced live attenuated vaccine may soon gain the potential to prevent a disease. Moreover, they can also be utilized for therapeutic purposes of an existing disease.
