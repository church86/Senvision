The judgments, both issued on 7 November 2016, clarify the requirement for an "objective justification" under the so-called "BMS"-criteria. The BMS-criteria were developed by the Court of Justice of the European Union ("ECJ") in an attempt to balance the principle of free movement of goods with the protection of trade mark rights and public health considerations in the case of parallel importation of pharmaceuticals from one Member State into another. The ECJ held in Bristol-Myers Squibb (Case C-427/93) that parallel imported products could be repackaged (i) if repackaging is objectively necessary to market the product in the country of importation; (ii) if the repackaging does not affect the original condition of the product inside the packaging; (iii) if the new packaging clearly states who repackaged the product and indicates the name of the manufacturer; (iv) if the presentation of the repackaged product is not liable to damage the reputation of the trade mark or of its owner; and (v) if the importer gives notice to the trade mark owner before the repackaged product is put on sale, and, on demand, supplies him with a specimen of the repackaged product. In other words, if these five conditions are satisfied, the trade mark owner cannot legitimately object to the further marketing of a repackaged pharmaceutical. Both cases before the Supreme Court concerned the parallel importation into the Belgian market of the pharmaceutical product based on the active ingredient "losartan" which is sold in Benelux under the Benelux trade marks "Cozaar" and "Loortan", both owned by Merck Sharp & Dohme ("MSD"). First Judgment The first case concerned the parallel importation from the Italian market of "losartan" under the registered trade mark "Loortan" in a dosage form of 100 mg. In Italy, this product is only sold in packaging formats of 28 tablets, while in Belgium "Cozaar" and "Loortan" 100 mg are sold in packaging formats of 98 tablets. Pi Pharma, the parallel importer, repackaged the product into a new packaging of 98 tablets and affixed the trade mark "Cozaar". MSD claimed that Pi Pharma had infringed MSD's trade mark rights. At first instance, the President of the Commercial Court granted MSD's claims and ordered Pi Pharma to cease and desist the infringements. Conversely, the Court of Appeal of Brussels dismissed the claims of MSD. The reasoning of the Court of Appeal of Brussels echoes that of the Court of Appeal of Mons in its judgment of 14 September 2015 in a case between MSD and parallel importer Impexeco (See VBB on Belgian Business Law, Volume 2015, No. 10, p. 14, available at www.vbb.com). Finally, the case was brought before the Supreme Court. In order to assess the requirement of "objective necessity" under the first "BMS" criterion, the Supreme Court reasoned that the entire Belgian market of pharmaceuticals based on the active ingredient "losartan" in a dosage of 100 mg must be considered, rather than the Belgian market for the pharmaceutical "Cozaar 100 mg" in a packaging format of 98 tablets. In addition, the Supreme Court considered that the actual circumstances at the time of importation, including national rules and practices, must be taken into account to determine whether repackaging is necessary. Based on these considerations, the Supreme Court held that repackaging and affixing a different trade mark was objectively necessary in order to gain effective access to the Belgian market since the pharmaceutical product based on "losartan" 100 mg is solely sold by MSD in packaging formats of 98 tablets. Other packaging formats are not known by prescribing doctors or pharmacists and have not obtained reimbursement status in Belgium. Accordingly, objecting to the fact that parallel imported products of "losartan" 100 mg would be repackaged to a format of 98 tablets and sold under the trade mark "Cozaar" would result in foreclosure of the Belgian market for parallel imports. Second Judgment In the second case, Pi Pharma imported from the Polish market the pharmaceutical product based on the active ingredient "losartan" under the trademark "Cozaar" in a dosage form of 50 mg and in a packaging format of 28 tablets. The pharmaceutical product Cozaar 50 mg is sold by MSD on the Belgian market in packaging formats of 28, 56 and 98 tablets. The market share of the different packaging formats of MSD with regard to Cozaar 50 mg in the third quarter of 2012 was 2%, 9% and 89%, respectively. Pi Pharma repackaged the product into a new packaging format of 98 tablets and reaffixed on the new packaging the trademark "Cozaar". MSD claimed that Pi Pharma had infringed its trade mark rights in the verbal trade mark "Cozaar". Both at first instance and on appeal, the court dismissed the claims of MSD. For its part, the Supreme Court again held that it must be determined to what extent the imported product in the packaging of the country of exportation can be sold in the entire market of the relevant product of the country of importation. The Supreme Court found that Pi Pharma was able to sell the pharmaceutical product in a dosage of 50 mg and in a packaging format of 28 tablets in only a limited part of the Belgian market, while a packaging format of 98 tablets represented most of the demand on the Belgian market. The Supreme Court thus held once more that repackaging was objectively necessary in order to gain effective access to the entire Belgian market.

With $15 million in funding from the Foundation over five years, the Alliance aims to increase timely access to patient-centered cancer care for vulnerable and underserved populations in the United States. The following organizations have been selected based on a variety of criteria, including the technical merit of their proposed programs, their organizational capabilities and experience, relationships with community partners, and ability to promote sustainable improvements in the delivery of cancer care. Grady Health System in Atlanta, Ga.; The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md.; Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Mass.; Northwestern University in Chicago, Ill.; Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio; and The University of Arizona in Tucson, Ariz. The University of Michigan School of Nursing, in Ann Arbor, Mich., will serve as the Alliance’s National Program Office. “With 1.7 million Americans newly diagnosed with cancer each year, there is a great need to improve the quality and delivery of patient-centered care to help address the significant challenges of those facing this diagnosis,” said Julie L. Gerberding, chief patient officer, Merck and chief executive officer, Merck Foundation. “These superb program sites and the National Program Office should accelerate identification and uptake of innovations that benefit patients, improve health communications, and enhance the overall coordination of care.” Through an independent cross-site evaluation, the Foundation will evaluate the impact of the Alliance and its programs. The evaluation findings and lessons learned will be disseminated to promote best practices in patient-centered cancer care.

Copyright © 2009-2016 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., U.S.A. All rights reserved. On January 20th, NYC-based drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE:BMY) and Kenilworth, NJ-based pharmaceutical firm Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) announced that the two companies had entered into a settlement and licensing agreement resolving worldwide patent litigation over a cancer treatment. As per the announced terms of the settlement, Merck will make a one-time payment of $625 million to Bristol-Myers Squibb and will also pay future royalties through 2026 on sales of Merck’s Keytruda. Keytruda, the brand name for pembromizulab, is a treatment which has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat various forms of cancer. The cancer treatment works by shutting off a chemical pathway for programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1), which in turn improves the human body’s natural ability to fight cancer through the immune system. Merck first earned FDA approval in September 2014 to market Keytruda as a treatment for advanced melanoma. Last August, the FDA granted accelerated approval for Keytruda as a treatment for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A few months later, in October, the FDA approved Keytruda as a treatment for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Sales projections from FiercePharma indicate that sales of Keytruda as an immuno-cology therapy could grow from $605 million in 2015 up to $4.5 billion in 2020. Merck’s cancer treatment is in direct competition with Bristol-Myers’ Opvido, the brand name for nivolumab. Opvido is another immuno-cology therapy which attacks cancer by shutting down the PD-1 chemical pathway in the human body. In 2016’s second quarter, sales of Opvido far outpaced sales of Keytruda by greater than $500 million. FiercePharma’s analysis predicts that Opvido sales will grow by an even greater margin than Keytruda in the years to come, from $942 million in 2015 up to $8.4 billion by 2020. The patent infringement suit involving the cancer treatments developed by these two companies was filed last January in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (D.N.J.). The plaintiff named in the case was PDL BioPharma, a pharmaceutical firm from Incline Village, NV. PDL entered into an agreement with Bristol-Myers back in August 2008 for the global development and commercialization of the immunotherapy agent known as elotuzumab. Under the terms of the agreement, Bristol-Myers would develop and market elotuzumab-based treatments in exchange for an up-front cash payment of $30 million, additional payments of up to $480 million for development and regulatory milestones and additional payments of up to $200 million for sales-based milestones of elotuzumab in multiple myeloma and other potential oncology indications. The patent-in-suit asserted by PDL BioPharma in the case is U.S. Patent No. 5693761, titled Polynucleotides Encoding Improved Humanized Immunoglobulins. The patent, which was issued to Protein Design Labs in December 1997, protect polynucleotides encoding heavy and light chain variable regions of a humanized immunoglobulin which binds to an antigen. The technology enables an improved means for the production of humanized antibodies which are specifically reactive with strong affinity to a predetermined antigen. As PDL’s complaint notes, the technology covered by the ‘761 patent enabled breakthroughs in the process of producing monoclonal antibodies for the removal of harmful cells from the human body. Nonhuman antibodies contained sequences of amino acids which the human body identified as foreign antigens. Chimeric antibodies created through genetic engineering techniques still produced negative immune responses caused by amino acid sequences from mouse antibodies. The high antigen affinity of the humanized antibodies enabled the technology covered by the ‘761 patent to produce monoclonal antibodies which attacked antigens while reducing the negative immune system response. PDL argued that the production of Keytruda involves the humanization of a murine, or rodent-related, antibody to obtain a humanized antibody using techniques covered by the ‘761 patent. Specifically, PDL believes that Keytruda manufacturing involves first and second polynucleotides encoding variable regions of the heavy and light chains of a humanized antibody infringes upon the first claim of the ‘761 patent. PDL alleges that the infringing techniques are outlined by Merck’s U.S. Patent No. 8952136, titled Antibodies to Human Programmed Death Receptor PD-1. Additional, PDL argues that Merck has known about the ‘761 patent for more than a decade going back to a licensing agreement for the patent signed by Merck back in 2005 to secure the rights of the patent for the production of potential treatments, but the scope of that agreement doesn’t cover Keytruda. Along with the up-front cash payment settling the PDL lawusit, Merck also agreed to pay royalties of 6.5 percent of net sales of Keytruda from January 1st, 2017 and December 31st, 2023. From January 1st, 2024 through December 31st, 2016, Merck will pay royalties of 2.5 percent of net sales for Keytruda to Bristol-Myers.

Life Buy/Sell Metro Close St. John officials wary of next phase of MSD project Special to the Post-Dispatch Feb 9, 2017 (…) ST. JOHN • Officials here say they are encouraged that MSD officials have indicated they will work with the city on traffic control and safety issues during an upcoming sewer replacement project that will tear up several streets, but they remain unconvinced that the district will return the streets to their original condition afterward. Officials are miffed that streets torn up by MSD in an earlier storm water sewer project were left in worse shape than before the project started and that the district has been slow to respond to complaints about it. Police Chief/City Manager J.R. “Rusty” Morris said at Monday’s council meeting he was surprised that two MSD officials showed up at a meeting last week of city and Ritenour School District officials. He said MSD officials earlier had refused his request that they attend the council meeting. The meeting with school district officials was set after someone from the school district called the city concerned about how the upcoming project would affect operations at Marvin Elementary School, Morris said. Phase 2 of the MSD project will begin in a couple of weeks and continue most of the year. Crews will install 4,209 feet of storm sewer lines and 699 feet of sanitary sewer lines east of Woodson Road, west of Roy Avenue, north of St. Louis Avenue and south of Bobb Avenue. Slated be dug up for the installation of new lines is a stretch of Gordon Avenue adjacent to Marvin Elementary. Although the school’s address is on Woodson Road, Gordon Avenue runs parallel to Woodson and is used as a staging area for parents picking up their children. Some 700 students attend the school. Morris said city officials wanted to discuss Phase 1 issues with a Sewer District representative at a meeting MSD held Jan. 25 to tell residents what to expect with Phase 2, but he was told MSD didn’t want to talk about anything but Phase 2. MSD is going to give him a traffic plan for the second phase of the project, Morris said. “It is going to impact traffic,” he said. ”We’re going to have to shut down the street for a period of time but we can make it work.” But city officials are still concerned about the shape MSD left streets in after Phase 1. “Hopefully they know we’re still not 100 percent satisfied with the Phase 1 product,” Morris said. Public Works Director James Phillips noted that he told an MSD engineer when the agency began working on the project two or three years ago that Jonell Court and the section of Gordon Avenue are “almost brand new.” He said he specified the city wanted a “full width repair on those streets.” But recently when he mentioned it to the MSD spokesman and the contractor, “it was news to them,” Phillips said. However, Phillips said, he has a dated email about the matter from that original discussion. “We’ll see if they do it,” he said. “They seem to think, ‘Well, unless it’s in the engineering specs, we’re not going to do it.’” At the meeting last month, a division inspector with MSD said a field inspector will be checking on work and residents can call MSD or the contractor if there’s an issue. Councilwoman Mary Halaska suggested MSD’s lack of response to the city’s complaints might be because St. John is “a little North County neighborhood.” “If we lived in another zip code, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation,” she said.

His pacemaker told police… YOU WANT MORE TRUMP? BECAUSE THIS IS HOW YOU GET MORE TRUMP: … » February 10, 2017 GOOD: Doctors See Gains Against ‘an Urgent Threat,’ C. Diff. Infection rates seem to be dropping, as hospitals take infection-control more seriously. Plus: As for new treatments, experts see encouraging prospects: • In the next few weeks, the drug maker Merck will begin marketing bezlotoxumab (brand name: Zinplava), shown to reduce C. diff recurrences. A study in The New England Journal of Medicine last month reported that the drug, which uses an antibody against a C. diff toxin, reduced recurrences to 16 to 17 percent. With a placebo, the infection recurred in 26 to 28 percent of patients. The drug is expensive, at $3,800 for a one-time intravenous infusion, but Merck has said its patient-assistance program will cover Zinplava for those unable to pay. • Dr. Gerding and his team have conducted trials of an orally administered liquid containing spores of a C. diff strain that does not produce toxins or cause illness, but supplants the toxic strains. His small study of 168 patients, published in JAMA, showed that the most effective dose brought the recurrence rate down to 5 percent. (Dr. Gerding receives consulting fees from several pharmaceutical firms.) • Several dozen studies of another promising method of reducing recurrence, the gross-sounding fecal transplant, are underway at research centers. I don’t know why people are so grossed out about fecal transplants. And honestly, that looks the most promising.

Also participating were Merck Ventures (NL), Ysios Capital (ES) and Sunstone Capital (DK). Prexton, of Naarden, the Netherlands, is a biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic compounds for the treatment of central nervous system conditions. PRESS RELEASE Naarden, The Netherlands, 7 February 2017 – Forbion Capital Partners (“Forbion”), one of the leading Dutch Venture Capital firms investing in world-class healthcare technologies, today announced the closing of a Series B financing round of EUR 29 million (USD 31 million) for Prexton Therapeutics (Prexton). Prexton is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutic compounds for the treatment of Central Nervous System (CNS) conditions. Forbion and Seroba Life Sciences (IE) co-led the financing round, which includes current investors Merck Ventures (NL), Ysios Capital (ES) and Sunstone Capital (DK). Marco Boorsma (Forbion) and Alan O’Connell (Seroba) will join the Board of Prexton. The Series B funding will be used to finance two phase II studies of Prexton’s lead product, Foliglurax (formerly known as PXT002331) in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The phase II trials will start in 2017 and will take place in specialist centers in Europe and the US. PD is a devastating progressive neurological condition affecting around 6.3 million people worldwide1. The disease is caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic brain cells and the main symptoms are resting tremor, muscle rigidity (“OFF-time”) and uncontrolled movements (“Dyskinesia”). Current treatments aim to replace dopamine or to mimic its effects. Patients are administered with the dopamine precursor, L-DOPA. This treatment provides adequate symptomatic relief initially, but over time, it loses efficacy as the disease progresses and patients experience serious debilitating side effects, such as dyskinesia. Prexton’s approach is to stimulate a compensatory neuronal system that is unaffected by PD. Instead of targeting the dopaminergic system, Foliglurax activates a specific target of the glutamatergic system (mGluR4). The aim of this product candidate is to treat the motor symptoms of PD. A phase I trial with Foliglurax was successfully completed in September 2016. The results showed that Foliglurax was safe and well-tolerated at doses well above those that produce robust effects in PD primate models. “It is a testament to the potential of Foliglurax that we have successfully completed such a significant funding round from high quality investors,” said Francois Conquet, CEO of Prexton Therapeutics. “We have developed a strong package of preclinical and phase I clinical data with Foliglurax. We are now keen to begin our phase II efficacy trials and continue the development of Foliglurax as a potential new therapeutic for Parkinson’s disease.” “We have been very impressed with the science behind Foliglurax and the alternative route being explored by Prexton to treat this difficult disease. Early data is encouraging and we believe Prexton’s approach could make a significant difference to developing new treatment options for patients.” said Forbion’s Marco Boorsma. “As part of the funding round, we are helping Prexton set up operations in the Netherlands and supporting the company in starting trials. We look forward to working with the team” 1 The European Parkinson’s Disease Association: www.epda.eu.com/en/pd-info/about-parkinsons/?gclid=CPawttbG0NECFVTNGwod4RQHkA Fundraising?

Market Research Feb 09, 2017, 06:30 ET Share this article ALBANY, New York, February 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Global Pulmonary Drug Delivery Devices Market demonstrates a high degree of competition between GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, AstraZeneca Plc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Merck & Co. Inc. states a new research report by Transparency Market Research. With the top five players accounting for more than 67%, the market exhibits a largely consolidated structure. Analysts project this market to remain competitive over the forthcoming years, specifically the drug markets for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), thanks to the robust product pipelines of established drug-makers. According to the research report, the worldwide market for pulmonary drug delivery devices, which stood at US$32.2 bn in 2015, is expected to progress at a CAGR of 3.30% between 2016 and 2024 and reach US$43.05 bn by the end of the forecast period. The application of these devices is higher in the asthma segment and is expected to remain so over the next few years, thanks to the robust pipeline of drugs for the treatment of asthma. Download PDF Brochure of Research Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=873 North America to Continue to Lead Global Market  An analysis of the geographical presence of the global pulmonary drug delivery devices market has also been presented in this research report. As per the study, Europe, North America, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa are the prime regional markets for pulmonary drug delivery devices. North America, among these, is leading the global market with Europe trailing closely. The key factor behind the rise of both the regional markets is the increasing prevalence of COPD. With the technological advancements in pulmonary drug delivery devices, North America is likely to retain its position across the world with a share of more than 40% by the end of the forecast period. The markets for pulmonary drug delivery devices in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa are also projected to witness significant growth in the next few years, owing to the increasing prevalence of respiratory disorders. The rising level of awareness among consumers regarding health and wellness and the increase in the disposable income are also anticipated to propel these markets in the near future, states the research report. Rising Pool of Respiratory Disorder Patients to Fuel Market's Growth  "The rising pool of patients suffering from respiratory disorders is having the most prominent impact on the global market for pulmonary drug delivery devices," states an analyst at TMR. The alarming rise in air pollution and the increasing number of smokers, worldwide, are adding substantially to the already worsened situation of COPD patient pool, leading to a remarkable surge in the demand for these devices. Analysts expect this scenario to remain so over the period of forecast, resulting in a high demand pace for these devices. In addition to this, the market is anticipated to benefit from the increasing research and development in the treatments for asthma and COPD in the near future. However, the imminent patent expiry of blockbuster drugs and several regulatory hurdles may limit the growth of this market to some extent in the years to come, notes the research study.

The analysis showed that Cladribine Tablets reduced the annualised rate of brain volume loss - also known as brain atrophy - compared with placebo in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). In addition, the analysis found that patients with lower rates of brain atrophy showed the highest probability of remaining free from disability progression at two years. This supports existing findings that increased brain volume loss over time is associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as increased disability progression and cognitive changes, in patients with multiple sclerosis. "Evidence shows that brain atrophy in general accumulates throughout the course of multiple sclerosis and is associated with disability progression. This analysis is important because it confirms the link between reduced brain atrophy and reduced disability progression found in the CLARITY study," said Nicola De Stefano, lead author of the publication and Associate Professor of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, University of Siena. The CLARITY study was a two-year (96-week), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study of Cladribine Tablets in 1,326 people with RRMS. The CLARITY study primary (rate of relapse at 96 weeks) and key secondary endpoints (proportion of patients who were relapse free and the time to sustained progression of disability) were met. These outcomes and safety results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The brain atrophy analysis evaluated the effect of Cladribine tablets on brain volume loss (BVL) over 2 years in RMS and the association of BVL with confirmed disability progression in 1,025 (77.3%) of the patients in CLARITY. The mean percentage brain volume loss per year was significantly reduced in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (-0.56%±0.68, p=0.010, n=336) and 5.25 mg/kg (-0.57%±0.72, p=0.019, n=351) compared with patients treated with placebo (-0.70%±0.79, n=338). The risk of disability progression was also significantly lower in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.438, 0.894; p=0.010) and 5.25 mg/kg (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.406, 0.833; p=0.003) than in those treated with placebo. After adjusting for treatment group, percentage brain volume loss per year showed a significant correlation with the cumulative probability of disability progression in the overall study population (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.571, 0.787; p&lt;0.0001). "These findings reinforce and expand on the consistent and positive effect of Cladribine Tablets in improving clinically relevant outcomes, such as reducing relapse rate and disability, and further our resolve to make this investigational therapy available for patients living with RRMS," said Steven Hildemann, MD, PhD, Global Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Medical Affairs and Safety, Merck. CLARITY study design The CLARITY study was a two-year (96-week), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international study. It randomised 1,326 patients with relapsing remitting MS according to the revised McDonald criteria. Study participants were randomised to one of three different treatment groups consisting of two different dose regimens of Cladribine Tablets or matching placebo tablets (1:1:1 ratio). The primary endpoint of the CLARITY study was the relapse rate over 96 weeks. Secondary endpoints included MRI endpoints, proportion of subjects relapse-free and disability progression at 96 weeks. Lymphopenia was the most commonly reported adverse event (AE) in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets. The incidence of infections was 48.3% with Cladribine Tablets and 42.5% with placebo, with 99.1% and 99.0% rated mild-to-moderate by investigators. About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an investigational short-course oral therapy that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. In July 2016, the European Medicines Agency [EMA] accepted for review the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) of Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. The clinical development program for Cladribine Tablets includes: - The CLARITY (CLAdRIbine Tablets Treating MS OrallY) study and its extension: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients with RRMS and its two-year extension designed to provide data on the long-term safety and efficacy of extended administration of Cladribine Tablets for up to four years. - The ORACLE MS (ORAl CLadribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients at risk of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS). - The ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding Cladribine Tablets treatment to patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough disease while on established interferon-beta therapy. - PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cladribine Tablets. The follow-up will consist of over 10,000 patient years of exposure in total, with follow-up in some patients exceeding eight years at completion. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. Although many treatments exist there is a need for an effective therapy without the risks associated with continuous immunosuppression and which reduces the need for frequent switches.

Merck KGaA Cladribine Tablets Significantly Reduced Brain Atrophy in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis 09.02.2017 – 11:02 Darmstadt, Germany (ots/PRNewswire) - - Post hoc analysis of Phase III CLARITY study data recently 
  published in Multiple Sclerosis Journal showed statistically 
  significant reduction in brain atrophy in patients on a short 
  course of investigational Cladribine Tablets over two years 
  compared with patients receiving placebo   
- These findings correlated with effects on clinical progression as 
  measured by the EDSS scale, a method of quantifying disability in 
  multiple sclerosis   Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced the publication of the results of a post hoc analysis of the Phase III CLARITY study in Multiple Sclerosis Journal. The analysis showed that Cladribine Tablets reduced the annualised rate of brain volume loss - also known as brain atrophy - compared with placebo in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). In addition, the analysis found that patients with lower rates of brain atrophy showed the highest probability of remaining free from disability progression at two years. This supports existing findings that increased brain volume loss over time is associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as increased disability progression and cognitive changes, in patients with multiple sclerosis. "Evidence shows that brain atrophy in general accumulates throughout the course of multiple sclerosis and is associated with disability progression. This analysis is important because it confirms the link between reduced brain atrophy and reduced disability progression found in the CLARITY study," said Nicola De Stefano, lead author of the publication and Associate Professor of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, University of Siena. The CLARITY study was a two-year (96-week), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study of Cladribine Tablets in 1,326 people with RRMS. The CLARITY study primary (rate of relapse at 96 weeks) and key secondary endpoints (proportion of patients who were relapse free and the time to sustained progression of disability) were met. These outcomes and safety results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The brain atrophy analysis evaluated the effect of Cladribine tablets on brain volume loss (BVL) over 2 years in RMS and the association of BVL with confirmed disability progression in 1,025 (77.3%) of the patients in CLARITY. The mean percentage brain volume loss per year was significantly reduced in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (-0.56%±0.68, p=0.010, n=336) and 5.25 mg/kg (-0.57%±0.72, p=0.019, n=351) compared with patients treated with placebo (-0.70%±0.79, n=338). The risk of disability progression was also significantly lower in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.438, 0.894; p=0.010) and 5.25 mg/kg (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.406, 0.833; p=0.003) than in those treated with placebo. After adjusting for treatment group, percentage brain volume loss per year showed a significant correlation with the cumulative probability of disability progression in the overall study population (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.571, 0.787; p<0.0001). "These findings reinforce and expand on the consistent and positive effect of Cladribine Tablets in improving clinically relevant outcomes, such as reducing relapse rate and disability, and further our resolve to make this investigational therapy available for patients living with RRMS," said Steven Hildemann, MD, PhD, Global Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Medical Affairs and Safety, Merck. CLARITY study design The CLARITY study was a two-year (96-week), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international study. It randomised 1,326 patients with relapsing remitting MS according to the revised McDonald criteria. Study participants were randomised to one of three different treatment groups consisting of two different dose regimens of Cladribine Tablets or matching placebo tablets (1:1:1 ratio). The primary endpoint of the CLARITY study was the relapse rate over 96 weeks. Secondary endpoints included MRI endpoints, proportion of subjects relapse-free and disability progression at 96 weeks. Lymphopenia was the most commonly reported adverse event (AE) in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets. The incidence of infections was 48.3% with Cladribine Tablets and 42.5% with placebo, with 99.1% and 99.0% rated mild-to-moderate by investigators.

- The ORACLE MS (ORAl CLadribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase
  III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
  safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients at risk 
  of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical 
  event suggestive of MS).
- The ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in 
  Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II 
  placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety 
  and tolerability of adding Cladribine Tablets treatment to patients
  with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough 
  disease while on established interferon-beta therapy.
- PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of 
  Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine 
  Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the 
  prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy

Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. In July 2016, the European Medicines Agency [EMA] accepted for review the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) of Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. The clinical development program for Cladribine Tablets includes: The CLARITY (CLAdRIbine Tablets Treating MS OrallY) study and its extension: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients with RRMS and its two-year extension designed to provide data on the long-term safety and efficacy of extended administration of Cladribine Tablets for up to four years. The ORACLE MS (ORAl CLadribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients at risk of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS). The ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding Cladribine Tablets treatment to patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough disease while on established interferon-beta therapy. PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cladribine Tablets. The follow-up will consist of over 10,000 patient years of exposure in total, with follow-up in some patients exceeding eight years at completion. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. Although many treatments exist there is a need for an effective therapy without the risks associated with continuous immunosuppression and which reduces the need for frequent switches.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Feb 10, 2017 at 4:20PM Hope that a big drugmaker will bid to buy Tesaro (NASDAQ:TSRO) has sent this company's shares skyrocketing 40% this year. That's impressive, but there could be room to run higher. Why? Because Tesaro could be about to land its second FDA approval, and this next approval could be a biggie. Been there, done that, and doing it again Tesaro is run by Lonnie Moulder, an industry veteran with a history of biopharma M&A. In the 2000s, Moulder was the CEO of MGI Pharma, a company that successfully commercialized the chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting drug Aloxi. Moulder built Aloxi into a nine-figure top-seller before orchestrating a $3.9 billion deal to sell MGI Pharma to Eisai, a major Japanese drugmaker. Image source: Getty Images. After MGI Pharma, Moulder spent a brief stint in the top spot at Abraxis Biosciences prior to founder Patrick Soon-Shiong selling it to Celgene for $2.9 billion in 2011. Moulder also served on the board of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, which was eventually bought by Merck & Co. for $9.5 billion in 2015. Today, Moulder is attempting to catch lightning in a bottle again as CEO of Tesaro. At Tesaro, Moulder has successfully launched Varubi, an oral CINV drug he licensed from Opko Health, and he's successfully completed registration-ready clinical studies on an IV formulation of Varubi, and niraparip, a cancer drug. Best in class? If approved, the IV formulation of Varubi will open up it up to the lion's share of its addressable market, and that could be worth nine figures. That's a lot of money, but Varubi's peak sales potential may pale in comparison to niraparib. Niraparib is a PARP-inhibitor that Moulder paid Merck & Co. the bargain basement price of $7 million for back in 2012. PARP-inhibitors limit a cancer cell's ability to repair damage due to cancer treatment, and this class of drug's appears quite effective in ovarian cancer, and potentially, in breast cancer. So far, two other PARP-inhibitors have won FDA approval. The first is Lynparza, an AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) drug OK'd for use in heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer patients with BRCA mutations. The second is Rubraca, a Clovis Oncology (NASDAQ:CLVS) drug that got the FDA nod in December, and is also approved for use in heavily pre-treated BRCA positive patients. Niraparib, however, could end up leap-frogging those two therapies. About 85% of ovarian cancer patients have their disease return following platinum-based chemotherapy, and unfortunately, the amount of time between relapses shrinks over time. While Lynparza and Rubraca are approved for use after three and two prior lines of chemotherapy,respectively, niraparib maintenance therapy extended time between relapses, suggesting it could get used ahead of Lynparza and Rubraca. Furthermore, niraparib delayed disease progression in both BRCA positive and BRCA negative patients, suggesting it could be used much more widely than these other two drugs. Overall, only 15% to 20% of the 22,280 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in the U.S. annually are BRCA positive. If the FDA green lights niraparib with a label that's more favorable than Lynparza and Rubraca, it could reshape patient treatment. And, since Lynparza and Rubraca both carry six figure annual price tags, niraparib's more widespread use could translate into hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales for Tesaro. Looking ahead Global spending on cancer treatment eclipses $100 billion annually, according to IMSHealth, and that's got big pharma eager to expand their exposure to the indication, both via internal R&D and M&A. That eagerness is leading to big paydays for pure-play commercial-stage cancer drug companies like Tesaro. In 2014, AbbVie spent $21 billion to buy Pharmacyclics to share commercialization rights with Johnson & Johnson on Imbruvica, a fast-growing lymphoma and leukemia drug. And, in 2016, Pfizer spent $14 billion to share commercialization rights to the prostate-cancer drug Xtandi with Astellas. Since Tesaro owns 100% of the global rights to niraparib, and niraparib could have billion dollar blockbuster potential, it wouldn't be out of the question for Tesaro to fetch a premium in a deal. Currently, the company boasts a market cap of $10 billion. Ultimately, Tesaro's success depends on FDA approval of niraparib, and niraparib's ability to outflank other PARP inhibitors depends on its prescribing label. If the FDA balks, or the label isn't as good as hoped, then it could make Tesaro a little less appealing to a suitor. But given that there are already two PARP inhibitors on the market, and there's a big unmet need for new ovarian cancer treatments, I think this one has a good shot at a regulatory OK.

Quotes in the article Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC RBGLY ▼ 17.63 -0.52 -2.87% Mead Johnson Nutrition Co MJN ▲ 87.72 +4.67 +5.62% Bayer AG BAYRY ▲ 113.01 +0.47 +0.42% Merck & Co Inc MRK ▼ 64.15 -0.24 -0.37% The U.K. company, which owns Durex condoms and Scholl footcare, earlier this month disclosed that it was in talks with Mead after The Wall Street Journal reported on the potential deal. It will pay $90 a share in cash for the Glenview, Ill.-based company, which makes a range of nutritional products including Enfamil infant formula and the Sustagen milk supplement for children. Including debt, the deal is valued at $17.9 billion. The acquisition caps a yearslong search by Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who lost out to Bayer AG in a bidding war for Merck & Co.'s consumer business in 2014, and has since been looking to do a big deal. Reckitt's growth has slowed lately, leaving the Slough, England-based company in need of a new avenue to jump-start sales. Friday, the company reported organic revenue growth of just 3% for 2016, its weakest in over a decade. Sales have been hit by a string of issues lately, including a failed foot-care innovation, a scandal in South Korea that led to its product being delisted, disruption in India after some high value bills were taken out of circulation. Shares rose as much as 2% in early trading in London but lately were down 0.8%. Reckitt on Friday forecast 2017 like-for-like growth of 3%, which is below analyst estimates. Mr. Kapoor said Mead Johnson fits into Reckitt's consumer-health portfolio tangentially, just like its condom and foot-care brand acquisitions have in the past. "Our strategy is about healthier lives and homes," he said. "Their mission is about enabling healthier lives from the very beginning." He identified child nutrition as a solid opportunity, saying the category is projected to grow sales by 3% to 5% over the medium to long term. Mead reported net sales of $3.7 billion in 2016, down 8%. Half the company's sales came from Asia, with 17% coming from Latin America and the rest from North America and Europe. The deal will turn China into Reckitt's second-biggest market, increasing its emerging-markets footprint by two-thirds. The deal will also significantly boost the company's exposure to the U.S., which remains its No. 1 market. However, buying Mead won't necessarily be the silver bullet Reckitt is looking for. Analysts have noted few obvious synergies between the two companies beyond some distribution and head-office cuts. "This deal does have elements of desperation about it," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jeff Stent following Reckitt's initial confirmation that it was in talks to buy Mead. "Mead has zero overlap with Reckitt." The company said the Mead deal would boost per-share earnings by a double-digit percentage by the third year after closing, which Mr. Stent on Friday described as "very conservative," likely driven by low savings and the high cost of funding the deal. Reckitt forecast cost savings of GBP200 million ($249.9 million). Still, investors had cheered the deal when initially announced, which could raise Reckitt's exposure to faster growing, higher margin categories in the long term, while Mead's struggling performance lately made it a good time for an approach despite the pound's decline following Brexit. Mead's shares have fallen sharply in the past two years--as the company grappled with sluggish sales in its key Asia market--and were down 2.7% since the start of this year, before news of the deal broke. "I don't think you should read too much into the timing," Mr. Kapoor told journalists on conference call, saying Reckitt had been looking at Mead and other companies "for a number of years." Reckitt on Friday reported 1% like-for-like sales growth for 2016 in Europe and North America, and said emerging markets grew by over 8%. Net income rose 5% to GBP1.83 billion. Robey Warshaw, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and HSBC advised Reckitt. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley advised Mead Johnson.

The U.K. company, which owns Durex condoms and Scholl footcare, earlier this month disclosed that it was in talks with Mead. It will pay $90 a share in cash for the Glenview, Ill.-based company, which makes a range of nutritional products including Enfamil infant formula and the Sustagen milk supplement for children. Including debt, the deal is valued at $17.9 billion. The acquisition caps a yearslong search by Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who lost out to Bayer AG in a bidding war for Merck & Co.'s consumer business in 2014, and has since been looking to do a big deal. Reckitt's growth has slowed lately, leaving the Slough, England-based company in need of a new avenue to jump-start sales. Friday, the company reported organic revenue growth of just 3% for 2016, its weakest in over a decade. Sales have been hit by a string of issues lately, including a failed foot-care innovation, a scandal in South Korea that led to its product being delisted, disruption in India after some high value bills were taken out of circulation. Shares rose just 1.2% in early trading in London after Reckitt estimated 2017 like-for-like growth of 3%, which is below analyst forecasts. Mr. Kapoor said Mead Johnson fits into Reckitt's consumer-health portfolio tangentially, just like its condom and footcare brand acquisitions have in the past. "Our strategy is about healthier lives and homes," he said. "Their mission is about enabling healthier lives from the very beginning." He identified child nutrition as a solid opportunity, saying the category is projected to grow sales by 3% to 5% over the medium to long term. Mead reported net sales of $3.7 billion in 2016, down 8%. Half the company's sales came from Asia, with 17% coming from Latin America and the rest from North America and Europe. The deal will turn China into Reckitt's second-biggest market, increasing its emerging-markets footprint by two-thirds. The deal will also significantly boost the company's exposure to the U.S., which remains its No. 1 market. However, buying Mead won't necessarily be the silver bullet Reckitt is looking for. Analysts have noted few obvious synergies between the two companies beyond some distribution and head-office cuts. "This deal does have elements of desperation about it," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jeff Stent following Reckitt's initial confirmation that it was in talks to buy Mead. "Mead has zero overlap with Reckitt." The company said the Mead deal would boost per-share earnings by a double-digit percentage by the third year after closing, which Mr. Stent on Friday described as "very conservative," likely driven by low savings and the high cost of funding the deal. Reckitt forecast cost savings of GBP200 million ($249.9 million). Still, investors had cheered the deal when initially announced, which could raise Reckitt's exposure to faster growing, higher margin categories in the long term, while Mead's struggling performance lately made it a good time for an approach despite the pound's decline following Brexit. Mead's shares have fallen sharply in the past two years--as the company grappled with sluggish sales in its key Asia market--and were down 2.7% since the start of this year, before news of the deal broke. "I don't think you should read too much into the timing," Mr. Kapoor told journalists on conference call, saying Reckitt had been looking at Mead and other companies "for a number of years." Reckitt on Friday reported 1% like-for-like sales growth for 2016 in Europe and North America, and said emerging markets grew by over 8%. Net income rose 5% to GBP1.83 billion.

Mark Zuckerberg Isn't Only Billionaire Trying To Save Lives, So Are Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg And Ray Dalio By Marcy Kreiter @marcykreiter On 02/09/17 AT 9:44 PM Close Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn’t the only billionaire trying to eradicate diseases. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Bridgewater Associates Chairman Ray Dalio also have ponied up big bucks to eliminate such scourges as polio. Berkshire Hathaway genius Warren Buffett has donated billions. Zuckerberg and his wife, Chan, established a billion-dollar philanthropy organization in 2015 to "cure, prevent or manage all disease" by 2100 and has hired 47 scientists to begin researching and designing long-term strategies. Now the medical component, Biohub, has been funded with $50 million. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which was founded in 2000 and is the largest transparently operated privately funded foundation in the world, launched the Global Health Investment Fund in 2013 with $108 million to develop drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and “other interventions against diseases that disproportionately burden low- and middle-income countries.” Among the foundation’s partners are JPMorgan Chase & Co., GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and the Pfizer Foundation. Gates also invited fellow billionaires Bloomberg and Dalio last year to aid in the fight to eradicate polio, raising an additional $70 million for the effort. The World Health Organization reported 42 new cases of the paralytic disease last year and one new case so far this year, mostly concentrated in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria where terrorist groups have made vaccination efforts dangerous. Polio no longer is a problem in the Americas, Europe or Australia but before the vaccine was introduced in 1955, the United States reported 10,000 to nearly 29,000 cases annually. Efforts to eliminate polio have nearly succeeded. Above, a medical worker administers polio drops to an infant in Agartala, India, Jan. 18, 2015. Photo: Jayanta Dey/Reuters Related Stories WHO Confirms Cases Of Vaccine-Driven Polio Outbreak In Ukraine, Mali Malaria Helped Kill Off Roman Empire: Study The Gates Foundation also is active in the fight against malaria, a major killer of children. Nearly half the world’s population is at risk of the disease, with 212 million cases reported in 2015 and an estimated 429,000 deaths. Since 2019, malaria rates have fallen 29 percent. Buffett donated $31 billion to the Gates Foundation in 2006, in hopes the money would be used to fight AIDS. Approximately 78 million people worldwide, 1.1 million in the U.S., are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, with 2 million new cases reported in 2014. The scourge started in the last 1970s and by the end of 1985, there was at least one case in every region of the world. Genentech CEO and Apple Chairman Arthur D. Levinson heads up Calico, which uses Google’s cloud and data centers to mine data on disease and aging. Google CEO Larry Page has indicated the project’s aim is to extend human life by as much as 100 years. Among the other diseases, the Gates Foundation has targeted are enteric and diarrheal diseases, neglected tropical diseases, pneumonia and tuberculosis.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 February 2017 by Military News Global Pain Management Therapeutics Market Segments, Share, Trends 2024 By TMR With generic medicines accounting for a more than two-thirds of the global pain management therapeutics market, several small- and medium-scale generic drug manufacturers will venture in the market and make it highly saturated in the near future, states TMR in a recent report. The segment of branded pain management therapeutics features the presence of some of the leading international pharmaceutical giants, including Merck & Co, Inc. Pfizer,Inc., Endo Health Solutions, Johnson & Johnson, and Purdue Pharma LP. In the branded drugs segment, the top two companies, Pfizer,Inc. and Purdue Pharma LP, accounted for over 50% share in 2015. Over the forecast period, the overall share of the branded drugs manufacturers in the global pain management therapeutics market will further decline. “Major vendors will lose market share to emerging vendors such as Depomed, Inc. and AstraZeneca plc. and the competition in the generic drugs segment will further intensify,” quotes a TMR analyst. Download Exclusive Brochure of This Report : www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Alarming Rise in Prevalence of Chronic Diseases Emerges as High-impact Driver The number of patients suffering from chronic pain is rising at a substantial pace globally. According to the WHO, nearly 116 mn people were suffering from chronic pain in 2011 in the U.S. alone. According to another survey, one in five people in Europe suffer from chronic pain every year. The rising prevalence of chronic diseases such as a variety of cancers and diabetes further contribute to the further contributes to the number of people suffering from chronic pain, encouraging the use of pain management drugs. Medications for alleviating the pain occurring from cancer therapy and from the intrusion of cancer cells in bones and other body parts, for instance, accounted for over 28% share of the overall pain management therapeutics market’s overall valuation in 2015. Rising Geriatric Population and Favorable Regulatory Scenario to Boost Consumption of Pain Management Drugs The vast rise in the world’s geriatric population is also expected to emerge as a key growth driver for the global pain management therapeutics market from 2106 to 2024. Aged people are more prone to diseases such as arthritis, joint or bone pain, epilepsy, depression, nerve damage, diabetic neuropathy, and a variety of injuries owing to low immunity levels or gene alteration. The global population of geriatrics (people aged more than 65 years) is expected to rise to 2 bn by 2050, accounting for nearly 22% of the projected global population by then. This demographic will lead to a substantial rise in the overall global demand for numerous pain management drugs, thereby driving the global pain management therapeutics market. Additionally, favorable regulations are playing a key role in the increased rate of development, approval, and commercialization of novel molecule combinations and drug delivery techniques in the pain management therapeutics sector. The instigation of a large number of regulatory healthcare reforms, favoring development of methods for the improved diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain, will help the pain management therapeutics tread along a promising growth path in the next few years. Patent Expiries of Blockbuster Drugs and Rising Uptake of Generics Could Pose Existential Threat to Established Players Impending patent expiries of several blockbuster pain management drugs in the global market is one of the key high-impact challenges for the global pain management therapeutics market presently. Cheaper generic versions of once high-earning drugs will deal a huge blow to the overall revenues of several established vendors in the global pain management therapeutics market in the next few years. The factor will also cause a substantial decline in the overall revenues of the global market. Moreover, the rapid influx of several new vendors with generic versions of once groundbreaking medications will lead to intense competition in the market for generic drugs for pain management therapeutics. In terms of product types, the global pain management therapeutics market is presently dominated by opioids and Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS), which collectively accounted for over 52% of the market’s overall revenues in 2015. North America dominated the market, accounting for over 56% of the overall market in the same year. Browse Research Report on Pain Management Therapeutics Market: goo.gl/iHmK2z On a whole, the global pain management therapeutics market is expected to expand at a 3.7% CAGR over the period between 2016 and 2024. At this pace, the market is expected to rise from a valuation of US$60.2 bn in 2015 to US$83.0 bn by 2024.

FUER DEN INHALT IST ALLEIN DAS BERICHTENDE UNTERNEHMEN VERANTWORTLICH. * Efficacy and safety of afatinib plus pembrolizumab to be assessed in Phase II trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) of the lung * Afatinib is approved in patients with advanced SqCC of the lung whose disease has progressed after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and in patients with specific types of EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) * Boehringer Ingelheim continues to explore afatinib beyond the large LUX-Lung programme and its current indications INGELHEIM, Germany --(BUSINESS WIRE)--09.02.2017-- Boehringer Ingelheim today announced the initiation of a Phase II trial of afatinib* (Giotrif^(R)) in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda^(R)) for patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) of the lung. Benjamin Levy, MD, Clinical Director, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins Medicine at Sibley Memorial Hospital Washington DC, USA said, 'Given the complexity of tumours and their ability to evade immune destruction, combination approaches rooted in both clinical and scientific rationale are desperately needed. Bringing together two drugs, afatinib and pembrolizumab, which have each demonstrated meaningful activity and survival advantages in advanced stage squamous cell lung cancer patients, is an attractive strategy that needs to be further investigated as a treatment combination. The potential synergy in these agents will hopefully advance care and therapeutic options for this group of patients.' Afatinib is approved in the EU (Giotrif^(R)), US (Gilotrif^(R)) and other markets in patients with advanced SqCC of the lung whose disease has progressed on or after (EU label) / after (US label) treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab is approved in the US, EU, Japan and other markets for the treatment of previously-untreated patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours have high PD-L1 expression (tumour proportion score (TPS) >50%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations. Pembrolizumab is also indicated for the treatment of previously-treated patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumours express PD-L1 (TPS  ‰¥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. The trial is being conducted in collaboration with a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA (known as MSD outside the US and Canada) and the combination of afatinib and pembrolizumab studied in this trial is currently not an approved treatment regimen in the studied indication. Dr. Victoria Zazulina, Medical Head, Solid Tumour Oncology, Boehringer Ingelheim said, 'We are excited to collaborate with MSD and launch this trial, allowing us to gain further insights into the opportunities around treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Around the world, patients with this type of cancer are already benefitting from anti-PD-1 therapies and afatinib, the only oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in this indication. It is intriguing to combine both approaches in an attempt to improve the outcomes for patients with squamous lung cancer and equip physicians with new options.' The Phase II trial will include approximately 60 patients who have progressed or relapsed on or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy, and who have not previously received therapy with an anti-PD-1 therapy, a PD-L1/L2 antibody, or other checkpoint inhibitor or anti-EGFR targeted therapy. The trial aims to measure the decrease in tumour size (primary endpoint; objective response rate) and will confirm the dose of afatinib in combination with the standard dose of pembrolizumab, as well as the tolerability of this new regimen. In addition, it will evaluate anti-tumour activity in terms of disease control, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). SqCC of the lung is the second largest sub-type of NSCLC and represents approximately 20-30% of NSCLC cases. Patients with advanced SqCC of the lung typically have a poor prognosis and the median overall survival after diagnosis is around one year. Afatinib is also approved in over 70 countries for the first-line treatment of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and continues to be more broadly studied beyond the approved indications. *Afatinib is approved in more than 70 countries, including the EU, Japan, Taiwan and Canada under the brand name Giotrif^(R), in the US under the brand name Gilotrif^(R) and in India under the brand name Xovoltib^(R) for use in patients with distinct types of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Afatinib is also approved in the EU, US and other markets for the treatment of patients with advanced SqCC of the lung whose disease has progressed (on or) after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Afatinib is under regulatory review by health authorities in other countries worldwide. Registration conditions differ internationally, please refer to locally approved prescribing information.

Benjamin Levy, MD, Clinical Director, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins Medicine at Sibley Memorial Hospital Washington DC, USA said, “Given the complexity of tumours and their ability to evade immune destruction, combination approaches rooted in both clinical and scientific rationale are desperately needed. Bringing together two drugs, afatinib and pembrolizumab, which have each demonstrated meaningful activity and survival advantages in advanced stage squamous cell lung cancer patients, is an attractive strategy that needs to be further investigated as a treatment combination. The potential synergy in these agents will hopefully advance care and therapeutic options for this group of patients.” Afatinib is approved in the EU (Giotrif®), US (Gilotrif®) and other markets in patients with advanced SqCC of the lung whose disease has progressed on or after (EU label) / after (US label) treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab is approved in the US, EU, Japan and other markets for the treatment of previously-untreated patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours have high PD-L1 expression (tumour proportion score (TPS) >50%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations. Pembrolizumab is also indicated for the treatment of previously-treated patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumours express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. The trial is being conducted in collaboration with a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA (known as MSD outside the US and Canada) and the combination of afatinib and pembrolizumab studied in this trial is currently not an approved treatment regimen in the studied indication. Dr. Victoria Zazulina, Medical Head, Solid Tumour Oncology, Boehringer Ingelheim said, “We are excited to collaborate with MSD and launch this trial, allowing us to gain further insights into the opportunities around treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Around the world, patients with this type of cancer are already benefitting from anti-PD-1 therapies and afatinib, the only oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in this indication. It is intriguing to combine both approaches in an attempt to improve the outcomes for patients with squamous lung cancer and equip physicians with new options.” The Phase II trial will include approximately 60 patients who have progressed or relapsed on or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy, and who have not previously received therapy with an anti-PD-1 therapy, a PD-L1/L2 antibody, or other checkpoint inhibitor or anti-EGFR targeted therapy. The trial aims to measure the decrease in tumour size (primary endpoint; objective response rate) and will confirm the dose of afatinib in combination with the standard dose of pembrolizumab, as well as the tolerability of this new regimen. In addition, it will evaluate anti-tumour activity in terms of disease control, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). SqCC of the lung is the second largest sub-type of NSCLC and represents approximately 20-30% of NSCLC cases. Patients with advanced SqCC of the lung typically have a poor prognosis and the median overall survival after diagnosis is around one year. Afatinib is also approved in over 70 countries for the first-line treatment of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and continues to be more broadly studied beyond the approved indications. *Afatinib is approved in more than 70 countries, including the EU, Japan, Taiwan and Canada under the brand name Giotrif®, in the US under the brand name Gilotrif®and in India under the brand name Xovoltib®for use in patients with distinct types of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Afatinib is also approved in the EU, US and other markets for the treatment of patients with advanced SqCC of the lung whose disease has progressed (on or) after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Afatinib is under regulatory review by health authorities in other countries worldwide. Registration conditions differ internationally, please refer to locally approved prescribing information. Intended audiences: This press release is issued from our Corporate Headquarters in Ingelheim, Germany and is intended to provide information about our global business. Please be aware that information relating to the approval status and labels of approved products may vary from country to country, and a country-specific press release on this topic may have been issued in the countries where we do business.

By Chris Lange February 10, 2017 8:35 am EST Print Email Tweet Pharmaceutical companies usually are involved in a lengthy process in getting their drug candidates to market through clinical trials. There is a fair amount of risk involved, should a study come back negative or a candidate not be approved. Conversely, if a drug gains FDA approval or passes a clinical trial, there can be big upside. The Trump administration has promised reforms in the health care sector, such as changing the bidding process for drugs and shortening the FDA approval process. It has yet to be seen how much headway Trump can actually make with these reforms, but so far the reaction has been quite positive. Keep in mind that short sellers betting against big pharma are taking on an added risk. They have to pay out the ongoing high dividends on top of the cost of borrowing the shares. The January 31 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and short interest moves in these selected pharmaceutical stocks mostly increased. Short interest in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) decreased to 34.30 million shares from the previous 37.93 million. Its shares were last seen at $32.38, within a 52-week trading range of $28.74 to $37.39. The number of Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) shares short increased to 18.36 million from 15.95 million in the previous period. Its shares were trading at $64.39, in a 52-week range of $48.28 to $65.46. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s (NYSE: TEVA) short interest increased to 20.99 million shares, compared to the previous level of 19.98 million. Shares were trading at $32.25, in a 52-week range of $31.90 to $59.35. The short interest rise in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY) was to 13.45 million shares, compared to the previous reading of 12.18 million. Shares were trading at $51.51, within a 52-week range of $46.01 to $77.12. The number of shares short in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) decreased to 30.98 million, compared to the previous 33.44 million. The stock was trading at $60.84, in a 52-week range of $51.60 to $68.12. Eli Lilly and Co.’s (NYSE: LLY) short interest increased slightly to 10.82 million shares from the previous 10.72 million. The stock was trading at $77.70. The 52-week range is $64.18 to $83.79.

Description The Global Co-development Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2017 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the co-development deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading life science companies. This report provides details of the latest Co-development agreements announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of Co-development agreements from 2010 to 2017. There is an increasing willingness for parties to enter co-development deals; such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big product win, whereas traditional licensing deals forfeit upside for near term upfront, milestone and royalty payments. Co-development partnering allow the parties to securitize value and reduce risk, but keep a part of the potential upside should the product reach the market. Event if the licensor does not commercialize the project they can either sell those rights to the licensee partner or another partner for an amount higher than would have been achieved at an earlier stage licensing deal. There are mainly two forms of co-development deals; Either the parties agree on a certain division of ownership, or decide that one party gets the rights to commercialise the drug in a certain geographical area, and the other side gets the other geographical area rights. Typically, the ownership division applies when it is likely that the project will be licensed at a later point in time. The geographical split usually applies when the two companies are determined to commercialise the drug themselves. Another reason for co-development deals is the joint origin of a project. Drug development projects often require various scientific and technological novelties that stem from different companies. If both companies contributed to the origination of the project, then both have from the beginning a stake in the project. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner’s negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not. This report contains a comprehensive listing of Co-development deals announced since 2010 as recorded in the Current Agreements deals and alliances database, including financial terms where available, plus links to online copies of actual Co-development contract documents as submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission by companies and their partners.

In this situation, the collaborative R&D agreement governs who has permission to commercialize and what payments are due should commercialization proceed. The report provides a detailed understand and analysis of how and why companies enter collaborative R&D deals.

LONDON, Feb. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Summary The Global Co-development Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech & Diagnostics 2010-2017 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the co-development deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading healthcare companies. Description The Global Co-development Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2017 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the co-development deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading life science companies. This report provides details of the latest Co-development agreements announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of Co-development agreements from 2010 to 2017. There is an increasing willingness for parties to enter co-development deals; such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big product win, whereas traditional licensing deals forfeit upside for near term upfront, milestone and royalty payments. Co-development partnering allow the parties to securitize value and reduce risk, but keep a part of the potential upside should the product reach the market. Event if the licensor does not commercialize the project they can either sell those rights to the licensee partner or another partner for an amount higher than would have been achieved at an earlier stage licensing deal. There are mainly two forms of co-development deals; Either the parties agree on a certain division of ownership, or decide that one party gets the rights to commercialise the drug in a certain geographical area, and the other side gets the other geographical area rights. Typically, the ownership division applies when it is likely that the project will be licensed at a later point in time. The geographical split usually applies when the two companies are determined to commercialise the drug themselves. Another reason for co-development deals is the joint origin of a project. Drug development projects often require various scientific and technological novelties that stem from different companies. If both companies contributed to the origination of the project, then both have from the beginning a stake in the project. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not. This report contains a comprehensive listing of Co-development deals announced since 2010 as recorded in the Current Agreements deals and alliances database, including financial terms where available, plus links to online copies of actual Co-development contract documents as submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission by companies and their partners. Contract documents provide the answers to numerous questions about a prospective partner's flexibility on a wide range of important issues, many of which will have a significant impact on each party's ability to derive value from the deal. The initial chapters of this report provide an orientation of Co-development dealmaking and business activities. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the report, whilst chapter 2 provides an overview and analysis of the trends in Co-development as well as a discussion on the merits of the type of deal. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the structure of Co-development deals. The chapter includes numerous case studies to enable understanding of both pure Co-development deals and multicomponent deals where Co-development forms a part. Chapter 4 provides a review of the leading Co-development deals since 2010. Deals are listed by headline value. Where the deal has an agreement contract published at the SEC a link provides online access to the contract via the Current Agreements deals and alliances database. Chapter 5 provides a comprehensive listing of the top 50 most active Co-development dealmaker companies. Each deal title links via Current Agreements deals and alliances database to an online version of the full deal record, and where available, the actual contract document, providing easy access to each deal record on demand. Chapter 6 provides a comprehensive review of co-development financials for deals announced since 2010, including headline value, upfront, milestone payments and royalty rates, providing both benchmark data and access to individual deal financials. Chapter 7 provides a comprehensive and detailed review of Co-development deals organized by company A-Z, therapy, technology and industry type signed and announced since 2010 where a contract document is available. Contract documents provide an indepth insight into the actual deal terms agreed between the parties with respect to the Co-development deal. The appendices to the report includes a comprehensive listing of all Co-development deals announced since 2010. Each listing is organized as an appendix by company A-Z, stage of development at signing, therapeutic area and industry type. Each deal title links via hyperlink to an online version of the deal record including, where available, the actual contract document. The report includes deals announced by hundreds of life science companies including big pharma such as Abbott, Abbvie, Actavis, Amgen, Astellas, AstraZeneca, Baxter, Bayer, Biogen Idec, BMS, Celgene, Eisai, Eli Lilly, Gilead, GSK, J&J, Kyowa Hakko, Merck, Mitsubishi, Mylan, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi, Shire, Takeda, Teva, and Valeant, amongst many others. The report also includes numerous table and figures that illustrate the trends and activities in Co-development dealmaking since 2010.

DescriptionThe Global Collaborative R&D Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2012-2017 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the collaborative R&D deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading life science companies. This report provides details of the latest collaborative R&D deals announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully up to date with the latest information, the report provides details of collaborative R&D deals from 2012 to 2017. There has been a long standing willingness for parties to enter collaborative R&D deals. Such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big R&D win, whilst mitigating the risks of going it alone in the risky preclinical and clinical development stages. Collaborative R&D is a specific type of partnering deal whereby the parties to the deal agree to collaborate on the research and development and subsequently commercialize a compound, product or technology. There are several forms of a collaborative R&D deal; A traditional collaborative R&D arrangement whereby an owner of intellectual property (the licensor) provides access to its technology to another company (the licensee) in return for agreed payments and royalties on subscequent sales of product(s) derived from the intellectual property. In more recent times, licensing is often the outcome of a successful period of collaborative R&D on the research and development of a technology or compound, resulting in a product which can be commercialized. In this situation, the collaborative R&D agreement governs who has permission to commercialize and what payments are due should commercialization proceed. The report provides a detailed understand and analysis of how and why companies enter collaborative R&D deals. The majority of deals are multicomponent whereby the licensee retains either a right or option to license to comoercialize the resultant product of the research collaboration. There are also numerous pure licensing deals whereby the products originator takes on a development/commercialization partner in order to maximize a technologies/products prospects.

Photo/ELVIS OGINA (NAIROBI) FEBRUARY 9TH,2017 Germany wants to tap into Kenyan workforce as it sets sights on growing its private sector presence in Africa. Yesterday, the European powerhouse signed a joint declaration of intent on the establishment of the Eastern African-German University of Applied Sciences in Kenya at the second German-African Business Summit, which is being held on African soil for the first time. The Sh3 billion deal will see the Thika-based institution offer undergraduate, masters and vocational vocational-oriented academic training in close co-operation with industry players. This will be key in providing technical and blue-collar competence to service German firms seeking to set up shop in Kenya and the region. “I signed two agreements, one on the programme on TIVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) and another on setting up the German Technical University to train graduates in the market,” said Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich at the summit’s opening in Nairobi yesterday. The CS said the 400 German companies eying the country and Africa at large are set to invest about Sh27.8 billion (252 million euros) in Kenya over the next few years of bilateral trade.

Kenya has also attracted large German companies, such as Merck, BASF, Bosch, B Braun Melsungen and Daimler. LIMITED PRESENCE The German Business Association in Kenya has also doubled its membership in just two years, from 70 to about 140 companies. European countries are grappling with ageing populations and costly labour that is endemic in the developed world as well as smaller markets. Africa, on the other hand, will have the largest potential workforce in the world in the next decade with a half of the African countries now middle-income economies, similar to India and China. German firms have very limited presence in the continent and are playing catch up with China, America and Japan who have in the past few years renewed interest on the continent. The $3.73 trillion German economy which boasts of 400,000 companies, has less than 1,000 of them active in Africa. ALSO READ: German police raid homes and mosques, arrest Tunisian suspected of planning attack Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Gerd Müller said Africa needs investment more than ever since it is expected that Africa’s population will double by 2050 which will create the need for 20 million jobs annually.   SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Do you have something to add to this story?

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 February 2017 by Military News Global Vaccine Market Analysis By Type, Application- Forecast 2024 The global vaccine market is expected to reach over USD 77.5 billion by 2024, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. The presence of numerous molecules in the pipeline is anticipated to meet the demand for efficient vaccines. These include vaccines for chest infection, tuberculosis, malaria, and dengue. Most of the key players are actively leveraging on their vaccine development technologies to launch novel preventative solutions with an objective to increase their market share. For instance, Pfizer, Inc. is involved in the development of vaccines to prevent severe infections caused by Meningococcal B, Clostridium difficile, and Staphylococcus aureus. Browse a Report@http://www.orbisresearch.com/reports/index/vaccine-market-analysis-by-type-live-attenuated-vaccines-inactivated-vaccines-subunit-vaccines-toxoid-vaccines-conjugate-vaccines-dna-vaccines-by-application-infectious-diseases-cancer-autism-allergy-and-segment-forecasts-to-2024 Furthermore, the broad coalition of governments, worldwide, working to promote the awareness of vaccination benefits through immunization programs with the objective of containing the propagation of communicable diseases that are associated with high morbidity and mortality is expected to stimulate the market growth. For instance, the ‘Immunize Australia Program’ sponsors the immunization of individuals, which acts as a preventative action in preventing disease occurrence and checks rampant disease transmission thus protecting millions of Australians from severe diseases. Another program that has been involved in achieving extensive immunization coverage on the Indian continent is the National Immunization Program, a government program that has focused on taking strong preventive measures to offset vaccine-preventable diseases, particularly in children. Request a sample copy of Report @http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/106381 Further key findings from the study suggest: The inactivated vaccine type segment was estimated to have over 14.5% market share in 2015 owing to the related advantages including easy storage and transport due to the highly stable nature of these vaccines. In December 2015, Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. launched a new trivalent, inactivated polio vaccine in India. The DNA vaccine segment is presumed to be the fastest growing type over the forecast period owing to the ease of production compared to the cell-based vaccines and the promising, targeted immunization outcomes coupled with the continual developments in the biotechnology area. Other advantages associated are ease of production, long lasting immunogenicity, and no risk of reversion. The cancer application segment is expected to witness the fastest growth with a CAGR of over 11.8% in the vaccinations market majorly attributable to the need for immunization against cancer coupled with the increasing prevalence of various types of cancer, such as cervical and colorectal cancers. North America dominated the market in terms of revenue with over USD 12 billion in 2015, due mainly to the presence of extensive research and development activities and the existence of key participants of the industry in this region Asia Pacific is identified to witness a lucrative growth with a CAGR of around 10.7% during the forecast period due to the growing population base and the increasing economic growth of countries, such as China, Japan, and India. Moreover, the availability of skilled labors at a lower cost and the low manufacturing operations cost provide a platform for clinical trial outsourcing of the vaccinations under development to expedite commercialization. Leading players in this industry, among others are, Merck & Co., Inc., Emergent BioSolutions, Inc., Johnson and Johnson, Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., Novartis AG, CSL Ltd., and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Other prominent players include Abbott Laboratories, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Ltd., and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. In April 2016, VBI vaccines, Inc. entered into a collaborative agreement with Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. to employ its “Lipid Particle Vaccine” formulation technology to better the stability of the Sanofi vaccines.

Profits drive our capitalist economy. This is not limited to Wall Street, where high returns on risky investments and a degree of carelessness — among other things — drove the 2008 financial crisis. This profit motive is in everything from media to medicine, and it’s intrinsic to our capitalist economy. Pharmaceutical companies are among the worst offenders. They have massive incentives to pursue and sell drugs that people will take every day for the rest of their (hopefully long) lives. Just as razor companies want people to keep buying razor blades, pharmaceutical companies want people to keep buying drugs. Unfortunately, in the current economic climate, finding a cure for a disease is a terrible investment, regardless of its public health impact. Too many millions of dollars pour into research and development, clinical trials and production for a once-use drug. It would, frankly, leave a company penniless. Only an exorbitant price (and customers willing and able to pay over and over again), would be able to return a company’s investment. The National Institutes of Health runs the Orphan Products Clinical Trials Grant program (OOPD), which seeks to mitigate the gap between the need to cure diseases and the need for private companies to make returns on their investments. As a way to fix this problem, OOPD offers funding benefits for companies that discover new treatments for “rare” diseases (defined as diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans) that would otherwise not find funding. This has turned into an extremely viable business model. Alexion, a New Haven biopharmaceutical company founded in 1992, is a perfect example. Alexion has over 2,400 employees worldwide. In 2007, the FDA approved Soliris, Alexion’s centerpiece drug for two rare blood diseases (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome). Soliris is considered the most expensive drug in the world, costing a whopping $409,500 annually for the average patient and yielding $2.59 billion in total net sales in 2015 alone. Soliris is the first and only drug available for these rare, genetic blood disorders. And this monopoly on a cure allows and incentivizes Alexion to charge as much as it can to maximize its returns. The drug cost billions of dollars in development but only serves a community of only 8,000 Americans. And these drugs are almost always covered by insurance. High profile academics already support a similar program to the NIH’s program called the Health Impact Fund, which wants to incentivize drug companies to work on drugs that primarily affect low-income countries, such as vaccines for infectious diseases that concentrate in Africa and Asia. These diseases impact millions of people. The HIF, currently only a theoretical fund, proposes to draw on funds from governments (adjusted for national gross domestic product) as well as private individuals. Going further, the HIF would pay companies based on calculated public health impact rather than on high prices and sales. The NIH should consider expanding upon the Orphan Products Grant program and work with the model of the HIF but in addition to incentives for drugs with high public health benefit, also incentives for drugs for diseases with currently available “treatments” but not cures. Otherwise, companies with economically viable products like insulin pumps or blood testing devices have no incentive to innovate and leave profitable, functional products obsolete. These theoretical NIH grants would have to be near billions per attained “cure” drug because the top pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Gilead, Roche, Novartis, Sanofi, Merck, Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly each spend over $3 billion for R&D annually. However, with the national annual spending on healthcare at $3.35 trillion, spending in the billions to eradicate a costly disease entirely is a wise investment. And with an NIH annual budget of $30 billion in 2015 and the U.S. federal government spending at $3.69 trillion in 2015, our government would be able to supply these cure grants to pharmaceutical companies to compensate their R&D and production costs and keep prices manageable for the fortunate one-time users of the treatment. Just the promise of a cure grant so massive would spur new research projects and accelerate progress toward life-changing cures rather than just stopgap treatments. Our future doctors, scientists, entrepreneurs, government officials and investors need to consider the public good and potential to alleviate human suffering of their projects, not just easy potential profit that does not require discovery and innovation. Alexion shows how a company can be incubated out of a university (founded by former Yale physician, Leonard Bell) and bring cures to unserved patient populations and keep jobs near universities. Alexion has 1,000 of its 3,000 employees located in New Haven. Stephen Lewis is a junior in Branford College.
