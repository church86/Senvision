In its filing in the US district court of Delaware, Sanofi claims that Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. violated 10 patents held by it, including ones for its diabetes treatment Lantus and its insulin delivery device SoloStar. The French firm said it commenced the legal proceedings against Merck after the US company's filing for new drugs applications with the US Food & Drug Administration. A Merck spokeswoman was quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying, the company’s product doesn’t infringe Sanofi’s patents. Lantus accounted for nearly 20% of Sanofi's total revenues in 2015. Lantus sales in the US fell 20.5% to €4.023bn last year. In the first half of this year, Lantus sales declined another 15% to €2.38bn. In January 2014, Sanofi filed a suit against Eli Lilly and Company to defend its patents on Lantus. The companies have however entered into a settlement agreement in September 2015, under which Lilly agreed to delay the launch of its insulin product to December 2016 and pay royalties to Sanofi.

(MRK) Over Multiple Patent Infringements Merck denies the allegations Sep 19, 2016, 12:17 pm EST  |  By William White, InvestorPlace Writer     Sanofi SA (ADR) (NYSE:SNY) is suing Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) for what it claims are several instances of patent infringement. The Sanofi patent infringement lawsuit against Merck was filed on Monday in the the U.S. District Court of Delaware. The goal of the lawsuit is to keep the compay from launching its own rival version of SNY’s Lantus diabetes drug in the United States. Sanofi said that it started to take legal action after Merck submitted new drug applications to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. It claims that as many as 10 of its patents are being infringed on by the healthcare company. A spokeswoman for MRK argues that it’s products don’t infringe on SNY’s patents. Lantus is Sanofi best-selling diabetes drug. The move to stop Merck from launching its own version of the diabetes drug comes as more insulin offerings cause its revenue to decline. SNY said it expects sales from diabetes drugs, which makes up about 20% of its revenue, to continue to decline, reports The Wall Street Journal. Sanofi isn’t likely to win its lawsuit against Merck. This is due to Lantus losing its patent protection in 2015. However, the healthcare company is likely hoping to pull in some extra revenue by delaying MRK’s drug. It did the same thing with Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE:LLY) and Boehringher Ingelheim in 2014 when the two tried to launch their own diabetes drugs in the United States. SNY stock was up 1% and MRK stock was down slightly as of Noon Monday.

The suit has been prompted by Merck's filing for approval of a biosimilar version of Lantus (insulin glargine) called MK-1293 last month, and alleges infringement of 10 patents covering the drug as well as Lilly's SoloStar pen injector device. The case looks like a re-run of Sanofi's earlier lawsuit against Eli Lilly, which was settled a year ago after Lilly agreed to pay royalties to the French pharma group in exchange for a license to certain Sanofi patents. Lilly also agreed to hold off on launching its pen injector formulation of the Basaglar product - already on the market as Abasaglar in Europe - until 15 December 2016. It was free to move ahead with the launch of a vial formulation of the biosimilar, although vials are thought to represent only around a third of total Lantus sales. Lantus made more than $7bn in sales last year but is already showing the effects of competition from biosimilars and other branded basal insulin rivals such as Novo Nordisk's Levemir (insulin detemir), with sales dropping 11%. That trend continued with another 15% decline in the first half of 2016, with the falls not fully compensated by growth for longer-acting insulin glargine follow-up Toujeo. Nevertheless, every additional month of exclusivity gained in the US market limits the decline in Lantus and allows Toujeo and Sanofi's other new products such as cholesterol-lowering therapy Praluent (alirocumab) to gain ground. Merck (known as MSD outside the US), which developed its biosimilar in partnership with Samsung Bioepis, has also filed for approval of the drug in Europe.

Angola has received around 4 million tablets for mass distribution to school children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Angola is one of the most endemic countries for schistosomiasis worldwide. It is estimated that around 26% of the overall population requires treatment. Angola has been participating in the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program since 2008 and has received nearly 12 million tablets to date. “We want to contribute to eliminating the insidious worm disease in order to help infected children to take part in the economic development of their home countries. With our donation of approximately 4 million tablets to WHO for Angola approximately 1.6 million school children can be treated – covering half of the country’s school-aged population in need of treatment. This shows that we are on the right track. However, we know that we alone cannot solve the problem with our tablets,” said Eduardo Carvalho, General Manager of Merck in Angola. As part of its responsibility for society and within Health, one of its corporate responsibility strategic spheres of activity, Merck is supporting WHO in the fight against the worm disease schistosomiasis in Africa. Since 2007, more than 74 million patients, primarily school children, have been treated. To this end, Merck has donated over 340 million praziquantel tablets to WHO. Praziquantel is well tolerated and the most effective treatment to date for schistosomiasis. Merck is also supporting educational and awareness programs in Africa, developing schistosomiasis therapies for very young children and cooperating with partners in the Global Schistosomiasis Alliance.

These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Note that Merck is dropping further development of Odanacatib -- a cathepsin K inhibitor -- which had proved efficacious for fracture prevention in osteoporosis due to stroke risk. Be aware that the mechanism remains unclear, but the risk of stroke was clearly elevated among those taking odanacatib as part of the research program. ATLANTA -- Development of the investigational cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib for the treatment of osteoporosis has been stopped by study sponsor Merck, after a safety analysis found an increased risk of stroke, researchers reported here. In the double-blind base phase of the large phase III clinical study known as LOFT, which enrolled more than 16,000 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, there were 240 strokes among patients receiving odanacatib, for a significant 32% greater risk of stroke versus placebo (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.02-1.70, P=0.03), according to Michelle O'Donoghue, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. And then, in the long-term extension phase of the trial, which enrolled more than 8,000 patients, the total number of strokes was 324, giving a hazard ratio of 1.37 (95% CI 1.10-1.71, P=0.005), which was "very significant," she said at the annual meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. There also was a trend towards an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter, with a hazard ratio of 1.25 (95% CI 0.98-1.60, P=0.07) in the base phase and 1.22 (95% CI 0.99-1.50, P=0.06) during the extension phase. There had been a total of 306 atrial fibrillation or flutter events during the trial. She and her colleagues also considered whether there were subgroups of patients who were at particular risk. "We did not see any evidence on the basis of age, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, or other risk factors for stroke such as diabetes, hypertension, or prior myocardial infarction," she said. "We observed that inhibition of cathepsin K in postmenopausal women appeared to increase the risk of stroke, and also was associated with a trend for an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter. At this time, the mechanistic underpinnings to explain these findings remain unknown, but we believe warrant further investigation," O'Donoghue said. In contrast, when the study began, "preclinical data had suggested that inhibition of cathepsin K may actually interfere with or hinder atherogenesis and might promote plaque stability," she said. Beginning in 2007, the LOFT study randomized women whose T-score was -2.5 or lower at the total hip or femoral neck to 50 mg odanacatib per week or placebo. In July 2012, the data monitoring committee recommended that the study be stopped because of robust efficacy for the fracture data and a favorable benefit-risk profile, but also recommended that patients continue on treatment and that safety data collection be continued through 60 months. Following completion of the base phase of the trial, a preliminary assessment raised concerns about higher rates of some types of cardiovascular events among patients receiving odamacatib, O'Donoghue said. So the TIMI study group, an academic research organization based at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was asked to adjudicate the cardiovascular events for the LOFT program. They identified a total of 4,410 cardiovascular events and deaths and 1,100 cerebrovascular events during a mean 34.5 months of follow-up in the base period and an additional 9.7 months in the extension phase. For the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, there were 518 events during the base period, for an overall nonsignificant hazard ratio of 1.12 (95% CI 0.95-1.34, P=0.18). For all-cause mortality, there also was a nonsignificant hazard ratio of 1.13 (P=0.10). The long term efficacy data in the phase III LOFT trial were presented in a separate session at the meeting by Michael R. McClung, MD, of the Oregon Osteoporosis Center in Portland. A total of 16,071 patients had been randomized, 8,257 had entered the long term extension study, and 6,047 completed it. The study took place at 388 study sites in 40 countries. "This was a very large study," McClung pointed out. The mean age at the time of randomization was 73, and 47% had a prior vertebral fracture. Mean BMD T-scores were -2.7 at both the lumbar spine and the femoral neck. Mean follow-up was 44 months. Over the 5 years of follow-up, there were relative risk reductions of 52% for vertebral fractures, 48% for hip fractures, 26% for nonvertebral fractures, and 67% for clinical vertebral fractures (P<0.001 for all). In addition, compared with placebo, treatment with odanacatib was associated with increases in BMD of 10.9% (95% CI 10.5-11.2) at the lumbar spine and 10.3% (95% CI 10-10.6) at the total hip (P<0.001 for both). "Our results showed that odanacatib, over an interval of 5 years, significantly reduced the risk of vertebral, hip, nonvertebral, and clinical fractures. There also were substantial and progressive BMD improvements," he said. "Despite these very positive efficacy data, 2 weeks ago Merck made the announcement that because of a confirmed risk of stroke noted in the study, further development of odanacatib will not occur," McClung concluded. LOFT was sponsored by Merck. McClung disclosed financial relationships with Merck and Amgen. Reviewed by F.

Angola has received around 4 million tablets for mass distribution to school children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Angola is one of the most endemic countries for schistosomiasis worldwide. It is estimated that around 26 percent of the overall population requires treatment. Angola has been participating in the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program since 2008 and has received nearly 12 million tablets to date. “We want to contribute to eliminating the insidious worm disease in order to help infected children to take part in the economic development of their home countries. With our donation of approximately 4 million tablets to WHO for Angola approximately 1.6 million school children can be treated – covering half of the country’s school-aged population in need of treatment. This shows that we are on the right track. However, we know that we alone cannot solve the problem with our tablets,” said Eduardo Carvalho, General Manager of Merck in Angola. As part of its responsibility for society and within Health, one of its corporate responsibility strategic spheres of activity, Merck is supporting WHO in the fight against the worm disease schistosomiasis in Africa. Since 2007, more than 74 million patients, primarily school children, have been treated. To this end, Merck has donated over 340 million praziquantel tablets to WHO. Praziquantel is well tolerated and the most effective treatment to date for schistosomiasis. Merck is also supporting educational and awareness programs in Africa, developing schistosomiasis therapies for very young children and cooperating with partners in the Global Schistosomiasis Alliance. — African Media Agency, AMA —  Sep 19, 2016 @ 14:35 GMT | No Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

New York Ag News Headlines Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market to Reach $7.8 Billion by 2024 New York Ag Connection - 09/19/2016 The poultry pharmaceuticals market is dominated by Merck Animal Health and Zoetis Inc. and the two companies together accounted for over half the market in 2015. The rest of the market is, however, fragmented and is characterized by the presence of several large and small players. Transparency Market Research notes that the rivalry within the animal healthcare industry is quite high due to the existence of a large number of players and this trend is also reflected in the global poultry pharmaceutical market. "The high degree of competition ensures that poultry pharmaceutical companies maintain regular interaction and collaborations with drug retailers, governments, and poultry farmers," the author of the study states. The revenue generated by the global poultry pharmaceuticals market was pegged at US$3.7 bn in 2015 and is projected to reach US$7.8 bn by 2024, registering a healthy CAGR of 8.5% during the forecast period. Product innovation has also proven to be a successful strategy adopted by players in the poultry pharmaceutical market, TMR finds. For instance, in September 2015, Merial Animal Health globally launched its innovation in poultry vaccination technology, known as Merial Avinew. This move has strengthened Merial's position in the market. By type of product, vaccines held the leading share in the global poultry pharmaceuticals market in terms of revenue, accounting for just over 41% in 2016. Feed additive medications, on the other hand, will register an 8.8% CAGR during the forecast period, emerging as a highly lucrative product segment. Based on type of animal, chicken is the key contributor to the overall market and is likely to remain so through 2024. The segment will also register a higher growth rate than any other category. Geographically, while North America dominates the global poultry pharmaceutical market, accounting for just short of 36% in 2016, Latin America is forecast to clock in the highest CAGR of 9.2% from 2016 to 2024. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the U.S states that the demand for food is expected to double due to the increase in global population, which is projected to be around 9.1 billion by 2050. In order to cater to this ever-rising demand for food, the number of poultry farming operations and franchises has increased significantly in recent years. China, Brazil, Mexico, India, Russia, and Argentina are among the leading countries with a high growth rate in terms of poultry animal ownership. This has benefited the poultry pharmaceutical market. Apart from this, the poultry pharmaceuticals market is fueled by the growing emphasis on wellness and preventive care by veterinarians and poultry animal owners, the rising consumption of animal protein, the increasing incidence of poultry diseases, and the support from government and private organizations in the form of vaccination initiatives. In contrast, the poultry pharmaceutical market is hampered by stringent regulations, lengthy product approval periods, and limited vaccination production. The growing concerns regarding the use of antibiotics and growth promoters in animal feed are also hindering the growth of the global market. This review is based on the findings of a TMR report titled "Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market - (By Product - Drugs, Vaccines, Feed Additive, and Medication; By Animal Type - Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Goose, and Others) - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 - 2024."

They were among the industry leaders who testified Tuesday at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on agricultural consolidation. The Bayer-Monsanto deal comes as other acquisitions in the agricultural sector are pending. Dow Chemical and DuPont are midway through the regulatory process, while ChemChina and Switzerland-based Syngenta also have a proposed deal. ChemChina is operated by the Chinese government and was the only company that did not send a representative to the hearing on Capitol Hill. The original Monsanto was founded in St. Louis in 1901. Credit Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio Monsanto and Bayer representatives point to the rising cost of doing business as a key reason for the wave of consolidations. Part of that is the increasing amount of money that needs to be pumped into innovation. Monsanto says it's annual research and development costs have soared over the past 15 years from roughly $300 million to $1.5 billion. "Now I know that sounds like a big number," Robb Fraley, Monsanto's chief technology officer told the committee. "But compare that against the data and life science leaders -- like a Microsoft, or an Apple, or a Pfizer, or a Merck -- who each invest over $10 billion a year in R&D." A bigger company means a larger pot for research and development investment. It's an argument the companies likely hope will ease the concerns of farmers who contend the larger business would slow down the pace of innovation, possibly to protect existing profitable technologies. Bayer CropScience North America's president insists there will be a huge focus on innovation, if regulators approve the acquisition of Monsanto.  Jim Blome points to estimates suggesting the global population will increase by three-billion by mid-century and farmers will need to meet those food demands. "They know crop yields must increase by 60 percent," Blome told committee members. "This will not happen without continued investment in new technologies." That's also an important point for the National Corn Growers Association, which is based in Chesterfield. "In an era of declining federal and state agricultural research funding, these agribusiness research investments are vital to the future of food production," Chris Novak, the association's chief executive officer said. "Consolidation can provide farmers better access to technology through expanded research platforms," although Novak said the organization is concerned about consolidation being compounded by domestic and international regulatory hurdles. Jobs and St. Louis Committee members tried to press some of the executives on future job plans. Bayer and Monsanto representatives did not provide numbers. But they stressed the importance of St. Louis. Bayer’s Jim Blome repeated the company’s decision to move the North American and seeds headquarters to the region. They are currently in North Carolina, where Bayer says it will keep a significant presence. Monsanto’s Fraley also referred to the headquarters location as a positive for the St. Louis area including the Chesterfield research site, which is undergoing a $400 million expansion. “This will be an incredible opportunity to drive innovation.” The Bayer-Monsanto deal was announced last week. It still needs regulatory approval in the U.S. and dozens of other countries. If that happens, the acquisition could close next year.

Monsanto says it's annual research and development costs have soared over the past 15 years from roughly $300 million to $1.5 billion. "Now I know that sounds like a big number," Robb Fraley, Monsanto's chief technology officer told the committee. "But compare that against the data and life science leaders -- like a Microsoft, or an Apple, or a Pfizer, or a Merck -- who each invest over $10 billion a year in R&D." A bigger company means a larger pot for research and development investment. It's an argument the companies likely hope will ease the concerns of farmers who contend the larger business would slow down the pace of innovation, possibly to protect existing profitable technologies. Bayer CropScience North America's president insists there will be a huge focus on innovation, if regulators approve the acquisition of Monsanto.  Jim Blome points to estimates suggesting the global population will increase by three-billion by mid-century and farmers will need to meet those food demands. "They know crop yields must increase by 60 percent," Blome told committee members. "This will not happen without continued investment in new technologies." That's also an important point for the National Corn Growers Association, which is based in Chesterfield. "In an era of declining federal and state agricultural research funding, these agribusiness research investments are vital to the future of food production," Chris Novak, the association's chief executive officer said. "Consolidation can provide farmers better access to technology through expanded research platforms," although Novak said the organization is concerned about consolidation being compounded by domestic and international regulatory hurdles. Jobs and St. Louis Committee members tried to press some of the executives on future job plans. Bayer and Monsanto representatives did not provide numbers. But they stressed the importance of St. Louis. Bayer’s Jim Blome repeated the company’s decision to move the North American and seeds headquarters to the region. They are currently in North Carolina, where Bayer says it will keep a significant presence. Monsanto’s Fraley also referred to the headquarters location as a positive for the St. Louis area including the Chesterfield research site, which is undergoing a $400 million expansion. “This will be an incredible opportunity to drive innovation.” The Bayer-Monsanto deal was announced last week. It still needs regulatory approval in the U.S. and dozens of other countries. If that happens, the acquisition could close next year.

Global stock markets traded with a positive bias Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2016, a day ahead of policy statements from the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan that could go a long way to driving sentiment over the rest of the year. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Updated at 3:40 p.m. NEW YORK •  U.S. stocks inched higher Tuesday in another cautious day of trading as investors kept an eye on central banks in the U.S. and Japan. Health care and household goods companies led the way while energy companies slipped. Major market indexes were higher all day, but returned most of those gains at the close of trading. They rose just enough cancel out Monday's small losses. Drug companies helped health care stocks make some modest gains, while Exxon Mobil fell on reports it's being investigated by securities regulators. Bond yields slipped and the dollar was little changed as investors waited decisions from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. Since investors doubt the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates Wednesday, they may focus instead on the Fed's statement and a press conference led by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. "The Fed, until they raise rates, are going to be the primary focus of the markets," said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. "The only reason people may take their eye off of that is the election." The Dow Jones industrial average gained 9.79 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,129.96. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 0.64 points to 2,139.76. The Nasdaq composite picked up 6.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,241.35. On the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks fell than rose. That was the reverse of Monday, when major indexes fell but more stocks were up than down. Tuesday was the start of two-day meetings for the Fed and Bank of Japan. While investors didn't expect an increase in U.S. interest rates, the Japanese central bank is expected to take new steps to boost the nation's ailing economy. That could include an increase in its stimulus program or a further cut in the deposit rate as a way to encourage banks to lend money. Gilead Sciences gained $2.79, or 3.5 percent, to $81.78 after the hepatitis C drugmaker completed a $5 billion debt offering. Gilead said it may use the cash to make a deal, and Jefferies & Co. analyst Brian Abrahams said he thinks the company is getting close to at least one acquisition. Elsewhere, Merck rose 61 cents, or 1 percent, to $61.94. Ascena Retail Group, the parent of Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant and Dress Barn, dropped to a six-year low after the company reported weak quarterly results and gave a forecast that fell short of investor expectations. Ascena bought Ann Taylor a year ago and also struggled with discounts from competitors and shaky demand. Its stock lost $2.43, or 29.9 percent, to $5.69. Allergan, the maker of Botox, announced yet another acquisition as it agreed to buy Tobira Therapeutics. Tobira is studying drugs that treat symptoms of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a disease that triggers inflammation that can lead to cirrhosis, cancer and liver failure. Tobira stock has tumbled this year after it reported mixed results from a mid-stage trial of one of its drugs. The shares finished at $4.74 on Monday, but Allergan agreed to pay $28.35 per share upfront, and could pay another $49.84 if Tobira's drugs succeed in clinical testing, win regulatory approved, and meet sales targets. Tobira shares skyrocketed to $38.91 and Allergan fell $6.62, or 2.7 percent, to $238.67.

Monthly housing figures can be volatile and housing starts have grown this year, but the report hurt shares of homebuilders. PulteGroup gave up 58 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $19.29 and Lennar, which reported strong quarterly results, shed $1.59, or 3.5 percent, to $43.50. Hotel chains Marriott and Starwood climbed after regulators in China approved the $14.41 billion deal that will bring them together to create the world's largest hotel chain. Marriott, which is buying Starwood, said it expects to complete the deal Friday. Its stock added $1.60, or 2.3 percent, to $69.94 and Starwood rose $1.81, or 2.4 percent, to $76.90. Royal Caribbean Cruises added $2.93, or 4.5 percent, to $68.41 after the company raised its quarterly dividend to 48 cents from 37.5 cents. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 1.69 percent from 1.71 percent. The dollar rose to 101.84 yen from 101.81 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1157 from $1.1178. Benchmark U.S. crude picked up 14 cents to $43.44 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 7 cents to $45.88 a barrel in London. Exxon Mobil lost $1.29, or 1.5 percent, to $82.54 after Dow Jones reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Exxon's accounting practices and other issues. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline sank 6 cents, or 4 percent, to $1.36 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.41 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 11 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $3.05 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold gained 40 cents to $1,318.20 an ounce. Silver lost 1 cent to $19.28 an ounce. Copper added 1 cent to $2.17 a pound. France's CAC 40 slipped 0.1 percent while Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent. In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.3 percent higher. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 closed down 0.2 percent and South Korea's Kospi added 0.5 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dipped 0.1 percent.

The industry announcement coincides with a high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance as part of the UN General Assembly in New York. Companies that have signed up to the scheme include leaders in both branded and generic drug production, including Pfizer, Merck, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline and Allergan, as well as Indian drug-makers Cipla and Wockhardt. The group will work with independent experts to set new factory standards and review supply chains to ensure antibiotic waste does not enter waterways, where it can lead to the breeding of superbugs. Efforts to prevent overuse of antibiotics will involve a review of promotional activities and the implementation, by 2020, of concrete measures such as the removal of incentives to sell the drugs in larger volumes. Though the problem of drug-resistant bacteria has been a feature of medicine since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, it has grown in recent years with the emergence of infections resistant to multiple drugs, such as MRSA.

Health care and technology companies took some of the biggest losses while banks rose. Investors were indecisive as leaders of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan prepared to meet, and stocks swung several times between gains and losses. The Dow rose as much as 131 points early on, then fell as much as 30 points in the afternoon. Banks, utility companies and machinery makers rose. Bond yields edged higher and the dollar weakened. Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation with BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund, said investors don’t expect the Fed to raise interest rates. However he said investors have more questions about the Bank of Japan’s plans. “They could decide to introduce more stimulus, but it could take a lot of different forms,” he said. “One of the questions ... is not only what will they do, but what would the market like to see?” While advancing stocks far outnumbered decliners, the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 0.04 points to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite fell 9.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,235.03. The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and announce its latest decision on interest rates the following day. Banks got a boost as some investors hoped that interest rates will rise, which would allow banks to make more money from lending. JPMorgan Chase rose 37 cents to $66.19 and Wells Fargo regained 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $46.01. Technology products distributor Tech Data jumped after it said it will buy the technology solutions business of Avnet for $2.6 billion in cash and stock. Tech Data says the deal will give it operations in 35 countries. Its stock rose $15.46, or 22.3 percent, to $84.80 and Avnet gained $2.68, or 6.8 percent, to $41.89. Meanwhile, network control company Infoblox agreed to be bought by Vista Equity Partners for $26.50 per share, or $1.51 billion. It surged $3.52, or 15.4 percent, to $26.35. Despite those gains, the broader technology sector gave up an early advance and finished mostly lower. Apple, which surged last week and reached its highest price this year, lost $1.34, or 1.2 percent, to $113.58 and Intel fell 51 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $37.16. Health care stocks also lagged the market. Merck fell 95 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $61.33 after rival Sanofi said it sued company. Sanofi says Merck infringed on patents protecting its insulin drug Lantus. Eye drug maker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell $5.80, or 1.4 percent, to $402.83. Sarepta Therapeutics soared $20.79, or 73.9 percent, to $48.94 after the Food and Drug Administration granted tentative approval to its drug Exondys 51, a treatment for a type of muscular dystrophy. The drug treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness and eventually the loss of all basic movement. It usually causes death by age 25. The FDA had hesitated to approve the drug because advisers said there was little evidence it worked. Its approval is based on a study of only 12 patients, and the FDA is ordering Sarepta to run a larger study. Isle of Capri Casinos agreed to be bought by Eldorado Resorts for $23 per share, or $950 million in cash and stock. Combined, the companies own 21 casinos and race tracks. Isle of Capri stock jumped $5.11, or 30.2 percent, to $22.04 while Eldorado Resorts stock lost 41 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $13.84. Health website operator WebMD slumped after it said CEO David Schlanger is leaving the company by mutual agreement. Schlanger is being replaced by President Steven Zatz, who is in charge of WebMD’s advertising and sponsorship business. WebMD fell $2.95, or 5.7 percent, to $49.02 and it is down 27 percent since May 25. General Motors gained 75 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $31.72 after an analyst said auto sales, which are at record highs, should remain strong for several years. Analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley raised his rating on GM to “Overweight” and raised his price target to $37 a share from $29. Benchmark U.S. crude added 27 cents to $43.30 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 18 cents to $45.95 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 4 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $1.42 a gallon.

Bayer now expects annual peak sales of more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) for stroke prevention pill Xarelto, jointly sold with Johnson & Johnson, where it had previously seen about 3.5 billion. For the eye medicine Eylea, jointly developed with Regeneron, it now sees peak sales potential of more than 2.5 billion euros, up from at least 1.5 billion previously. Also underpinned by cancer drug Xofigo and pulmonary hypertension treatment Adempas, the group’s prescription drugs unit aims to increase earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), adjusted for special items, to 32-34 percent of sales in 2018, up from 30.1 percent last year. The smaller animal health unit could also slightly increase margins, Bayer said. In consumer health, previously boosted by the acquisition of brands from Merck & Co, it now sees sales adjusted for currency swings growing by between 4 and 5 percent by the end of 2018 and an adjusted EBITDA margin of about 25 percent, up from 24 percent in 2015. Bayer has “underestimated the country risk from Emerging Markets volatility”, the company said in presentation slides. It also cited “stronger business disruption than anticipated during the integration of Merck Consumer Care and Dihon in China”, referring to a Chinese non-prescription drugs unit it acquired in 2014. “2018 EBITDA guidance for Pharma and Animal Health may … offer some upside against consensus, though the consumer margin guidance may disappoint slightly,” Jefferies analysts said in a note to investors. Bayer shares were seen 1.5 percent higher in premarket trading at brokerage Lang & Schwarz, where the overall German market was seen little changed ahead of the official market open at 0700 GMT.

Teeter is as simple as it seems. It was filed this year by two hepatitis C patients against the state's Medicaid program to help the poor gain access to drugs such as Gilead Sciences Inc.'s $1,000-a-pill cure. But behind the team bringing the case is Gilead itself. While the drug giant isn't involved in the lawsuit, the company and its foundation have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the researchers, lawyers, patient advocates and medical expert who have helped build the case. Gilead said its donations have nothing to do with the legal fight. If the plaintiffs prevail, however, Gilead and other drug companies stand to make billions because Washington's Medicaid program would be forced to cover expensive treatments -- and other states may be pressured to follow suit. VIDEOS TOP JOBS With the controversy swirling around high drug costs, the case in Washington comes as the pharmaceutical industry and some pharma-backed advocates are trying to shift the debate from price to the tight-fisted insurers and bureaucrats who are denying patients life-saving drugs. The Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry lobbying group, gave members talking points in June focusing on access to drugs over their price tags. Or, as Robert Greenwald said in a 2015 PowerPoint presentation on the new class of hepatitis C drugs put it: "Reframe the response. Shift the focus from cost to cure." The presentation sought to make people aware the disease has a cure, not just that it was costly to treat, said Greenwald. He runs the Harvard Law School center that's representing the Washington plaintiffs. It's also partially funded by Gilead and other drugmakers. The Washington case illustrates a dilemma some patient advocates face: Many have few funding options beyond pharmaceutical firms, putting them in a ticklish position when criticizing prices. Gilead is the hepatitis C market leader, but rivals including AbbVie and Merck & Co. contribute to some of the same groups. "We the payers need the advocates on our side to put pressure on either the manufacturers to bring the price down or on the federal government to help find some affordability solutions," said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. "But they are not going to do that if they are beholden to the pharmaceutical industry for money." Gilead said there wasn't a quid pro quo with its grant recipients and that none of its contributions were intended for litigation against Washington state. Amy Flood, a Gilead spokeswoman, said it wasn't surprising that some grant recipients are fighting restrictions on hepatitis C drugs, which she described as "questionable policy for medications that are cost-effective, save the health-care system money and cure patients of a deadly and debilitating disease." Gilead's drugs are less expensive than treatments, such as liver transplants, that may be needed if the disease progresses. Gilead rejects the "implication that providing funding for one project or activity translates to financing, influencing or endorsing everything an organization does," Flood said in an email. "Gilead's grant program is not a commercial strategy." Brook Baker, a law professor at Northeastern University in Boston focused on international access to medicine, called it "very cynical" of Gilead to be providing money to the players involved in a lawsuit that "benefits them financially in the name of patient access." "The real issue is, with the price as high as it is, it's a budget breaker," Baker said. "Gilead has priced this in a way to wring every penny out of the system that it can." Merck's donations are "an important way to advance our mutual objectives to improve health and advance patient care," spokeswoman Doris Li said in an email. Merck's policies ensure its grants aren't promotional or "provided to induce or reward prescription of our products." AbbVie declined to comment. Sovaldi debuted in 2013 and was the first reliable hepatitis C cure. It became one of the fastest-selling drugs in history despite its price: $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment, the equivalent of $1,000 a pill. Even with discounts, it was so successful that profits for the Foster City, California-based drugmaker nearly quadrupled in 2014. Its successor, Harvoni, has a higher sticker price: $94,500. Today, Gilead boasts a market value of $104 billion, bigger than McDonald's. But the prices touched off a firestorm that engulfed the industry. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called out Gilead for criticism. A Senate investigation concluded "fostering broad, affordable access was not a key consideration in the process of setting the wholesale prices." There are more expensive drugs, but most of them treat rare disorders -- roughly 3.5 million Americans have hepatitis C, a slowly advancing liver virus that many contract from sharing needles. From 2012 to 2015 Gilead's lobbying budget more than doubled to about $3 million a year. That went to hepatitis C education and increasing drug access among government health programs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. » Next page... 2 3 Single page   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Editorial: Time for Utah conservatives to stand against Breitbartism Students are stabbed at Utah school, but 'this was not retaliatory' Crews ready for first snow, urge residents to prep, too State audit dings University of Utah athletic department over hiring, travel and equipment; probe fi Rolly: Utah girl shunned by some in Mormon ward.

Posted 20 Sep 2016 13:55 Updated 20 Sep 2016 15:10 The logo of Bayer AG is pictured at the Bayer Healthcare subgroup production plant in Wuppertal, Germany February 24, 2014. REUTERS/Ina Fassbender/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A FRANKFURT: German drugmaker Bayer said its two best-selling drugs had a higher annual peak sales potential than previously targeted, after the agreed US$66 billion takeover of Monsanto stirred criticism it might neglect its pharmaceuticals business. Bayer now expects annual peak sales of more than 5 billion euros (US$5.6 billion) for stroke prevention pill Xarelto, jointly sold with Johnson & Johnson , where it had previously seen about 3.5 billion. For the eye medicine Eylea, jointly developed with Regeneron , it now sees peak sales potential of more than 2.5 billion euros, up from at least 1.5 billion previously. Also underpinned by cancer drug Xofigo and pulmonary hypertension treatment Adempas, the group's prescription drugs unit aims to increase earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), adjusted for special items, to 32-34 percent of sales in 2018, up from 30.1 percent last year. The smaller animal health unit could also slightly increase margins, Bayer said. In consumer health, previously boosted by the acquisition of brands from Merck & Co , it now sees sales adjusted for currency swings growing by between 4 and 5 percent by the end of 2018 and an adjusted EBITDA margin of about 25 percent, up from 24 percent in 2015. Bayer has "underestimated the country risk from Emerging Markets volatility", the company said in presentation slides. It also cited "stronger business disruption than anticipated during the integration of Merck Consumer Care and Dihon in China", referring to a Chinese non-prescription drugs unit it acquired in 2014. "2018 EBITDA guidance for Pharma and Animal Health may ... offer some upside against consensus, though the consumer margin guidance may disappoint slightly," Jefferies analysts said in a note to investors. Bayer shares were seen 1.5 percent higher in premarket trading at brokerage Lang & Schwarz, where the overall German market was seen little changed ahead of the official market open at 0700 GMT.

A successful corporate acquisition should increase cost savings, boost profits, and expand markets. Unfortunately, too many do just the opposite. By Ben Levisohn Biography Sept. 17, 2016 2:27 a.m. ET Like an Olympian attempting a perfect dive, a corporate acquisition should make as little splash as possible. Too often, though, companies act like a bunch of kids playing cannonball at the pool. Deal making has slowed this year—some $2.4 trillion worth of mergers has been announced globally, off last year’s $3.1 trillion at the same time in 2015—but it has hardly disappeared.

NEW YORK — U.S. stocks wobbled and finished mostly lower Monday as investors waited for central bank meetings in the United States and Japan. Health care and technology companies took some of the biggest losses while banks rose. Investors were indecisive as leaders of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan prepared to meet, and stocks swung several times between gains and losses. The Dow rose as much as 131 points early on, then fell as much as 30 points in the afternoon. Banks, utility companies and machinery makers rose. Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation with BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund, said investors don't expect the Fed to raise interest rates. However, he said investors have more questions about the Bank of Japan's plans. “They could decide to introduce more stimulus, but it could take a lot of different forms,” he said. “One of the questions ... is not only what will they do, but what would the market like to see?” While advancing stocks far outnumbered decliners, the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.04 of a point to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite fell 9.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,235.03. The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and announce its latest decision on interest rates the following day. Banks got a boost as some investors hoped that interest rates will rise, which would allow banks to make more money from lending. JPMorgan Chase rose 37 cents to $66.19 and Wells Fargo regained 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $46.01. Technology products distributor Tech Data jumped after it said it will buy the technology solutions business of Avnet for $2.6 billion in cash and stock. Meanwhile, network control company Infoblox agreed to be bought by Vista Equity Partners for $26.50 per share, or $1.51 billion. It surged $3.52, or 15.4 percent, to $26.35. Despite those gains, the broader technology sector gave up an early advance and finished mostly lower. Health care stocks also lagged the market. Merck fell 95 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $61.33 after rival Sanofi said it sued the company. Sanofi says Merck infringed on patents protecting its insulin drug Lantus. Eye drug maker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell $5.80, or 1.4 percent, to $402.83. Sarepta Therapeutics soared $20.79, or 73.9 percent, to $48.94 after the Food and Drug Administration granted tentative approval to its drug Exondys 51, a treatment for a type of muscular dystrophy. The drug treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness and eventually the loss of all basic movement. It usually causes death by age 25. The FDA had hesitated to approve the drug because advisers said there is little evidence it works. Its approval is based on a study of 12 patients, and the FDA is ordering Sarepta to run a larger study. Isle of Capri Casinos agreed to be bought by Eldorado Resorts for $23 per share, or $950 million in cash and stock. Combined, the companies own 21 casinos and race tracks. Isle of Capri stock jumped $5.11, or 30.2 percent, to $22.04 while Eldorado Resorts stock lost 41 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $13.84. General Motors gained 75 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $31.72 after an analyst said auto sales, which are at record highs, should remain strong for several years. Analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley raised his rating on GM to “Overweight” and raised his price target to $37 a share from $29. U.S. government bond prices slipped. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.71 percent from 1.69 percent. The dollar fell to 101.81 yen from 102.42 yen. The euro rose to $1.1178 from $1.1151. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares climbed 1.5 percent and the CAC-40 in France rose 1.4 percent. Germany's DAX was 1 percent higher. South Korea's Kospi added 0.8 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.9 percent. Trading in Japan was closed for a holiday. Australia's stock market suspended trading after a couple of hours because of technical glitches. The S&P/ASX 200 finished little changed.

Infertility can transform from an acute, private distress into a harsh public stigma with complex and devastating consequences. With experts warning that infertility is a growing health problem, the crisis is chiefly culturally and socially created such that, even though it affects couples directly, it is the woman who bears the burden. An inability to have a child or to become pregnant can result in being greatly isolated, disinherited or assaulted. This may result in divorce or physical and psychological violence. Male causes Traditionally, infertility is often thought of as a female concern, but experts associated a third of cases to male problems, such as a low sperm count. Others include problems with the tubes carrying sperms, problems getting an erection, problems ejaculating, inflamed testes (orchitis) or a past bacterial infection that caused scarring and blocked tubes within the epididymis as it joins the vas. Other factors include having received medical treatment, such as drug treatment, radiotherapy or surgery, undescended testes or twisted testicles, genetic problems, diabetes and lifestyle factors, such as obesity or contact with chemicals or radiation. Recent research also confirm that male fertility declines with age, although the extent is not clear. The case of male infertility was brought to the limelight with the case of Jackline Mwende, who hails from Machakos county. Her husband chopped off her hands for failing to bear children after seven years of marriage, despite him being the root cause of the couple's inability to have children. Taita Taveta woman representative Joyce Lay, who visited Mwende in Machakos county, said infertility should never be a reason to separate, hurt or kill your partner. Lay has also come out publicly and opened up on a traumatising ordeal she underwent to become a parent by opting to use a surrogate mother. Lay revealed this during an interview on a local TV station. She recounted the trauma she suffered after going through surgery. “I went through a hysterectomy and lost my uterus. I had to get my baby through a surrogate mother, so I went through the IVF process,” she said. In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is a process where you cannot conceive naturally and use a science-assisted procedure to carry your own baby, because you have complications with your womb or do not have a uterus. The embryo is transferred to another woman. Lay, the ambassador for ‘Merck More than a Mother’ in Kenya, said there are many options available to manage infertility. 'Merck More than a Mother' is an initiative that aims to define interventions to reduce the stigma and social suffering of infertile women. It endeavours to empower them and raise awareness about male infertility and the necessity for a team approach to family building among couples across the continent. Before the interview, Lay had delivered an emotional speech during a debate on the IVF Bill in Parliament introduced by Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo. Other causes According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), lower levels of development are thought to be associated with higher levels of non-genetic and preventable causes of infertility. For instance, poor nutrition, untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs), unsafe abortion, consequences of infections caused by female genital mutilation (FGM) or child marriage, exposure to smoking, leaded petrol and other environmental pollutants can lead to infertility. A 10-year survey carried out in northern India, which studied the lives of 1,000 men, found that various lifestyle factors are major causes of decreasing sperm count. These include: tight clothing, hot tub dips and long visits to the sauna, intensive gardening and farming resulting in pesticide exposure and increased obesity rates. Studies have also shown that most men exposed to high temperature at their workplace — welders, dyers and blast furnace workers, and cement and steel factory workers — are more prone to infertility. This is because the additional environmental heat increases the temperature of the scrotum, causing a negative effect on sperm production.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) FILE - In this Oct. 8, 2014, file photo, people walk to work on Wall Street beneath a statue of George Washington, in New York. Global stock markets traded with a positive bias Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2016, a day ahead of policy statements from the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan that could go a long way to driving sentiment over the rest of the year. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks inched higher Tuesday in another cautious day of trading as investors kept an eye on central banks in the U.S. and Japan. Health care and household goods companies led the way while energy companies slipped. Major market indexes were higher all day, but returned most of those gains at the close of trading. They rose just enough cancel out Monday's small losses. Drug companies helped health care stocks make some modest gains, while Exxon Mobil fell on reports it's being investigated by securities regulators. Bond yields slipped and the dollar was little changed as investors waited decisions from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Since investors doubt the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates Wednesday, they may focus instead on the Fed's statement and a press conference led by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. "The Fed, until they raise rates, are going to be the primary focus of the markets," said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. "The only reason people may take their eye off of that is the election." The Dow Jones industrial average gained 9.79 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,129.96. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 0.64 points to 2,139.76. The Nasdaq composite picked up 6.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,241.35. On the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks fell than rose. That was the reverse of Monday, when major indexes fell but more stocks were up than down. Tuesday was the start of two-day meetings for the Fed and Bank of Japan. While investors didn't expect an increase in U.S. interest rates, the Japanese central bank is expected to take new steps to boost the nation's ailing economy. That could include an increase in its stimulus program or a further cut in the deposit rate as a way to encourage banks to lend money. Gilead Sciences gained $2.79, or 3.5 percent, to $81.78 after the hepatitis C drugmaker completed a $5 billion debt offering. Gilead said it may use the cash to make a deal, and Jefferies & Co. analyst Brian Abrahams said he thinks the company is getting close to at least one acquisition. Elsewhere, Merck rose 61 cents, or 1 percent, to $61.94. Ascena Retail Group, the parent of Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant and Dress Barn, dropped to a six-year low after the company reported weak quarterly results and gave a forecast that fell short of investor expectations. Ascena bought Ann Taylor a year ago and also struggled with discounts from competitors and shaky demand. Its stock lost $2.43, or 29.9 percent, to $5.69. Allergan, the maker of Botox, announced yet another acquisition as it agreed to buy Tobira Therapeutics. Tobira is studying drugs that treat symptoms of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a disease that triggers inflammation that can lead to cirrhosis, cancer and liver failure. Tobira stock has tumbled this year after it reported mixed results from a mid-stage trial of one of its drugs. The shares finished at $4.74 on Monday, but Allergan agreed to pay $28.35 per share upfront, and could pay another $49.84 if Tobira's drugs succeed in clinical testing, win regulatory approved, and meet sales targets. Tobira shares skyrocketed to $38.91 and Allergan fell $6.62, or 2.7 percent, to $238.67. The Commerce Department said the pace of home construction slowed down in August as fewer homes were built in the South. Monthly housing figures can be volatile and housing starts have grown this year, but the report hurt shares of homebuilders. PulteGroup gave up 58 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $19.29 and Lennar, which reported strong quarterly results, shed $1.59, or 3.5 percent, to $43.50. Hotel chains Marriott and Starwood climbed after regulators in China approved the $14.41 billion deal that will bring them together to create the world's largest hotel chain. Marriott, which is buying Starwood, said it expects to complete the deal Friday. Its stock added $1.60, or 2.3 percent, to $69.94 and Starwood rose $1.81, or 2.4 percent, to $76.90. Royal Caribbean Cruises added $2.93, or 4.5 percent, to $68.41 after the company raised its quarterly dividend to 48 cents from 37.5 cents. » Next page...

This small, flexible, plastic T-shaped intrauterine device (IUD) is not very different from others used around the world. After being placed in the uterus, it releases continuously low dosages of levonorgestrel — a progestogen — providing effective birth control for up to five years. After removal, women rapidly return to their natural fertility levels. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the device is almost as effective as sterilization and more successful in preventing pregnancy than pills and patches. Related Link: Sexual Health Month: Carafem Applauds Latest Customized Birth Control Options The long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) device will be available in the United States as of next month and is expected to take market share from other IUDs like Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (NYSE: TEVA)’s copper IUD, Paragard. However, its sales could also cannibalize those of other Bayer hormonal IUDs like Mirena and Skyla. For women looking for different options available in the United States, there’s Allergan plc Ordinary Shares(NYSE: AGN)’s Liletta, which lasts up the three years, and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK)’s vaginal ring, NuvaRing, which needs to be changed with each menstrual cycle — removed after 21 days with a new ring reinserted seven days after that.

This is part of the of the WHO campaign and this undertaking by Indian companies coincides with a high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance as part of the UN General Assembly in New York. According to the WHO, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi. It has posed a danger to the treatment of HIV. Globally, 4,80,000 people develop multi-drug resistant TB each year, and drug resistance is starting to complicate the fight against HIV and malaria, it says. The WHO also points out that the cost of health care for patients with resistant infections is higher than care for patients with non-resistant infections due to longer duration of illness, additional tests and use of more expensive drugs. Earlier this year Bloomberg reported that 85 companies including GlaxoSmithKline and Merck in the pharmaceutical, diagnostic, biotech and generic sectors, along with nine industry associations signed The Declaration on Combating Antimicrobial Resistance, announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. They were part of a large group of health-care companies that “would accelerate the development of drugs and diagnostics for “superbug” infections, trying to come up with a viable commercial model as an increasing number of bacteria become resistant to common antibiotics.” The other companies among the 13 that have signed up to the scheme include leaders in both branded and generic drug production like Merck, Novartis, Allergan and Indian drug makers Cipla and Wockhardt.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 20, 2016 9:13am   Comments Share: Related BMY Can Trump Make Your Portfolio Great Again? The Election Can't Come Soon Enough For Biotechs Aimed at driving shareholder value, uniQure shakes up business (Seeking Alpha) Expectations are for an “underwhelming subgroup analysis” when the CheckMate-026 trial is presented at the forthcoming ESMO conference, Citi’s Andrew Baum said in a report. He maintained a Buy rating on Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY), while reducing the price target from $75 to $70. Citi’s companion report named ‘Divining the Future Post CHECKMATE-026’ highlights multiple possibilities for IO market share capture in the large NSCLC lung cancer segment. The report also highlights low expectations for the CheckMate-026 PD-L1 subgroup analysis at ESMO, which is scheduled from October 7 to October 11, analyst Baum mentioned. Market Share Baum noted that the base case forecasts assumed that even if PDx/CTL4 combination data is compelling, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) would retain at least 50 percent of “the disproportionately valuable high expressor market given its anticipated superlative efficacy, low toxicity and financial expense.” The PDx/CTL4 of Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca plc (ADR) (NYSE: AZN) is assumed to equally share half of the NSCLC market in mid-stratum PD-L1 expressors. The smaller $700 million market, comprising of about 25 percent of patients with low PD-L1 expressing tumors, is assumed to be shared by Merck, Roche Holding Ltd. (OTCMKTS: RHHBY), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Bristol-Myers, the analyst added. Why Buy BMY? “Despite the earnings downgrades and the cautionary comments over near-term news flow, we continue to view BMY as undervalued on the premise that BMY’s Opdivo and Yervoy combination together with AZN durva/ tremi combination will become the gold standard first line therapy for NSCLC in the significantly majority of patients,” Baum commented.

The industry announcement coincides with a high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance as part of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Companies that have signed up to the scheme include leaders in both branded and generic drug production, including Pfizer , Merck, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline and Allergan, as well as Indian drugmakers Cipla and Wockhardt. The group will work with independent experts to set new factory standards and review supply chains to ensure antibiotic waste does not enter waterways, where it can lead to the breeding of superbugs. Efforts to prevent overuse of antibiotics will involve a review of promotional activities and the implementation, by 2020, of concrete measures such as the removal of incentives to sell the drugs in larger volumes. Though the problem of drug-resistant bacteria has been a feature of medicine since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, it has grown in recent years with the emergence of infections resistant to multiple drugs, such as MRSA.

Image: Pi Frisk/Claudio Bresciani Weighing in at 175g, composed of 18-carat recycled gold, the Nobel Prize is quite something. That’s probably why Irishman Prof William Campbell was asked to sell his. What’s the biggest difference between a scientist who has landed a Nobel Prize for their decades of work, and one who hasn’t? The former, it seems, can’t retire. “Well, life has changed dramatically,” said Prof William Campbell, Ireland’s first Nobel Prize winner for physiology or medicine, landing the accolade late last year. “I was retired before. Now I’m not.” The 86-year-old’s work led to the development of a drug called Avermectin, which has seen the creation of derivatives that have “radically lowered the incidence of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis”, according to the Nobel Foundation. ‘I keep my Nobel Prize in a locked drawer, not in a bank. The way I see it, if I have friends around I want to be able to show it off to them.’ PROF WILLIAM CAMPBELL Golden touch Now, with a big chunk of solid gold to his name, finding a place to store it is Campbell’s latest concern. Too valuable to leave out on the mantelpiece, instead he keeps it locked up, away from prying eyes and sticky fingers. “It’s safe, but I won’t tell you where it’s locked away!” the scientist, originally from Donegal, said to Siliconrepublic.com. The Nobel Prize medal, front and back. Image: The Nobel Foundation/Lovisa Engblom The medal needs to be insured, given the value of the gold, so some winners have gone on to sell their prize. Others, according to Campbell, keep it in a safe in a bank – but where’s the fun in that? “You cannot keep it on your mantelpiece the way you might expect,” he said. “It’s too valuable. It’s big, pure gold. But not just that, it has its associations and meaning and connection as well. “I keep it in a locked drawer. The way I see it, if I have friends around I want to be able to show it off.” Buy and sell Amazingly, Campbell has already been approached by people interested in auctioning off the medal, painting a picture of an odd industry that has sprung up in the shadows of the Nobel Foundation’s showpiece annual event. He has no interest in getting rid of it, not after all his hard work. Campbell shared his award with Satoshi Ōmura, with their discovery dating all the way back to 1975, making it 40 years waiting for the ultimate recognition. Campbell isn’t sure why it took so long for a prize of such esteem to land on his lap, though he suggests bureaucracy could have gone against him all of this time. “It may have been because we were part of a team and you can’t award a Nobel Prize for science to any more than three people. Perhaps they were just trying to work it out,” he said. Announcement of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine http://t.co/Wj73oAPVmI — The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 5, 2015 Storied past Campbell graduated from Trinity College Dublin in 1952, and a chance meeting between his professor and a colleague in University of Wisconsin–Madison helped set him on his path. Seeking a suggestion of a student who would best fit a place in Madison, Campbell’s name was put forward by his professor, with the Irishman soon crossing the Atlantic. After five years at Madison, Campbell graduated and, once again, a chance meeting between his professor and a colleague saw the Irishman land a job at Merck, where he stayed until 1990. It was here that Avermectin was developed, on the back of years of studying roundworms and their role in spreading the disease known as river blindness. “My interest in biology was always about parasites, parasites of all kinds,” he said. “Especially parasitic worms. Their importance in causing disease is clear.” For sheer numbers of people and domestic animals infected, studying roundworms was Campbell’s pick. “I worked on this for 17 years in total, before my first retirement,” he said. Prof William Campbell after receiving his Nobel Prize for medicine, following his studies on parasitic roundworms. Image: Nobel Media AB/Claudio Bresciani Sligo soirée Now back in Ireland for a few days, Campbell is delivering a short lecture on his award-winning work at IT Sligo tomorrow (21 September), while launching the new BSc honours degree programmes in biomedical sciences delivered by IT Sligo and Ulster University. Taking time to visit some family in Donegal, where his brother and sister still reside, Campbell is also on hand to officially open IT Sligo’s new Aurivo Auditorium. Now living in Massachusetts in the US, Campbell has two daughters and a son (none of whom followed him into the biology field), with three of his five grandchildren attending his talk tomorrow. Ireland’s 11th Nobel Prize winner, and the first in a scientific field since Ernest Walton’s work with atoms gained him recognition in 1951, Campbell isn’t sure why so few from this country receive the accolade. It’s not the sort of thing that you kind of plan for, he said, calling it “foolish” to aim specifically for the top prize. Luck of the Irish “There’s a tremendous amount of luck involved. Not just in connection with the prize, but in your career too. Your colleagues, their work, or even the meetings between people that set you on your way,” he said. Campbell and Ōmura’s Avermectin discovery is ongoing, with the drug “showing efficacy against an expanding number of other parasitic diseases”, according to the Nobel Prize organisers. In recent years, Campbell has become a research fellow emeritus at Drew University in the US, with transatlantic trips to open new courses, or for interview requests and other responsibilities meaning the 86-year-old’s work-life balance is skewing back towards the days of his youth. Still, as a Nobel Prize-winning celebrity, he’d probably not have it any other way.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Find Company: 23abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Out-licensing yes, but with a more ‘mature’ approach, says Glenn Saldanha PT Jyothi Datta   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Glenn Saldanha, Chairman and Managing Director, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals -- Paul Noronha Mumbai, Sept 20:   Glenn Saldanha does not believe that Glenmark has fallen silent on the licensing front. The next 12 to 18 months will see the company venture into out-licensing pacts with global partners to develop prospective drugs from the Glenmark stable, says Saldanha, Chairman and Managing Director. Only this time, the pacts will be approached with more “maturity”, as opposed to “doing deals for the next big cheque,” he says, reflecting on the company’s evolving strategy. “It’s more a timing issue. We’ve not slowed down in terms of work ….it’s just that we’ve been building up the pipeline,” he says, optimistic about their BEAT antibody technology platform. (The technology facilitates efficient development and manufacture of antibodies with dual specificities.) “To build a platform technology, to build capabilities, it has taken us some time to get there. But now we are at a very different place as far as research goes,” he says, explaining the perceived silence from a company that was once seen as being ahead of the pack in outlicensing products. “If I look back at our evolution, up to 2011 we were very aggressive in outlicensing. We cut seven licensing deals up to 2008…then 2010 and 11 also we did these two deals with Sanofi,” he recalls. More recently Glenmark said its contract with Sanofi (who was testing Glenmark’s GBR 900 for treating multiple sclerosis) had been terminated and Glenmark was now open to scout for new partners to relicense GBR 500, a monoclonal antibody. Without getting into details on products expected to be first off the out-licensing block, he points to oncology and immunology as sought after segments. Zetia, coming soon Another critical event on Glenmark’s radar comes up in December 2016, when the company will be able to sell its generically similar version of cholesterol-lowering drug Zetia in the US. Glenmark had settled a patent case with innovator Merck & Co on this blockbuster drug and is expected to get a period of exclusive sales on the drug. Zetia would contribute to Glenmark’s revenues into next year, says Saldanha, indicating that in the post-Zetia environment they could look at making some “bolt on” acquisitions, but nothing “transformational”. He was responding to a query on his counterparts including Sun Pharma, Lupin and Cipla going after massive acquisitions in India and overseas. “We defined our future based on products and research. ..We are at a point where we are saying that you had rather spend incremental monies on developing products rather than going and buying companies. ..that’s our perspective on acquisitions at least in the near term.” says Saldanha. The goal, he adds, is to become an innovations-led company. “That’s the strategic direction and that’s where we are placing all our bets even today.” Explaining the company’s 2014 decision to merge its speciality and generics arms, about seven years after it had demerged them (2007), he said the plan was to replicate a model that was similar to the Novartis – Sandoz model – running a generic and innovative company separately. Later though, companies changed strategy and were operating across the value chain. “The whole landscape has changed very dramatically,” he says, explaining their decision to operate on a geographic model that gives country heads greater flexibility to work across lines of businesses as opposed to being limited to a specific vertical. With the Zetia launch on the calendar, Glenmark is looking to end the year with revenues of about Rs 9,500 crore. The company currently has a debt of Rs 3,200 crore. But the management expects cash revenues from Zetia to address part of the debt repayment, as would its other measures, including rejigging the debt portfolio and equity infusion by Temasek (Singapore government’s investment arm), last year. jyothi.datta@thehindu.co.in (This article was published on September 20, 2016) Related NEWS Glenmark gets USFDA nod for skin lesion treatment gel Glenmark gets FDA nod for skin ointment Glenmark Pharma: A potent pill Companies  »  Glenmark Pharmaceutical Limited Quotes Snapshot Company Background Board of Directors Balance Sheet Profit & Loss Quarterly Results Financial Ratios Share Holding Pattern Score Board MF Holdings News Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

Gluck, and Gregory Curfman September 19, 2016 October 20 Update In our post below, we discussed the political and empirical obstacles to a congressional repeal of the ban on Medicare’s negotiating on prescription drugs. As an example of a pilot project that could generate data and be initiated without congressional action, we referenced CMS’s proposed pilot on value-based drug purchasing in Medicare Part B. (While most prescription drugs covered by Medicare are managed in Part D, certain drugs, such as those administered via infusion by physicians, are managed in Part B.) Recent events prove our point about the extremely complex and obstructive politics of drug-pricing reform. The Part B pilot has continued to receive significant backlash funded by the pharmaceutical industry and has resulted in increased Congressional scrutiny of CMMI’s activities. House Republicans have even introduced a bill (H.R. 5122) to prohibit further action on the proposed Part B pilot, even though CBO estimates that blocking the project would cost $395 million in direct spending over the next 10 years. However, H.R. 5122 is unlikely to pass, in which case CMS will likely move forward with a narrower but potentially transformative proposal on Part B drug prices. Action on Part D will probably follow a similar pattern and will require pilots that over time build the kind of strong evidence for value-based drug pricing or other reforms that will finally bust the gridlock. Original Post Despite this election season’s divisiveness, both major parties’ presidential candidates have embraced the idea of authorizing Medicare Part D to negotiate directly with drug companies to set prescription drug prices. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), which established Medicare Part D, included a ban on such negotiation. In theory, if the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) could negotiate with pharmaceutical companies, the agency could leverage its purchasing power to pay less for drugs. The idea has received considerable media attention over the past few months and has broad public support, reflected in a recent poll showing 87 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the idea. Nevertheless, if history is any guide, politics may prevent a full repeal of the ban. It took almost 40 years to add a prescription-drug benefit to Medicare — a fact that may be surprising given how much seniors spend on pharmaceuticals. A coalition of stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry, helped defeat President Bill Clinton’s failed effort at health reform, and President Obama is said to have learned from that experience. President Obama secured the support of the drug industry early in the process of enacting the Affordable Care Act (ACA), so it may not be a surprise that the ACA does not do much to address drug pricing. The political process has continued to stymie more recent efforts to make even modest changes in this direction. The candidates’ promises to repeal the ban may therefore be difficult to keep. Moreover, even if a repeal were possible, it is uncertain whether repealing the ban would be effective in lowering spending on Part D drugs. Despite the idea’s widespread support and the debate it has spurred among health policy analysts, because the proposal is untested, evidence of its efficacy is limited. This post sets out some of the political and legal history of the ban in order to explain why, once the high-minded talk of election season concludes, repeal may be unrealistic, or even unwise. We conclude with some ideas for proceeding in a more incremental and evidence-based fashion — a tried and true process of achieving health reform in the face of entrenched interests. The Political and Legal History Behind the Ban on Negotiating Drug Prices Allowing Part D to negotiate drug prices is not a new idea: President Obama supported the repeal during his 2008 campaign and has included versions of the proposal in multiple budgets. Meanwhile, other government programs that purchase drugs have been able to lower drug costs through a variety of tactics. Medicaid prices are set by law at the lower end of a discounted price or the lowest price anyone is able to negotiate. The VA negotiates prices, receives mandatory rebates, and maintains a National Drug Formulary. So why doesn’t Medicare have the ability to control its drug costs? The short answer is politics. As noted above, from its creation and through Bill Clinton’s presidency, Medicare lacked a prescription-drug benefit. It was not until 2003, under President George W. Bush, that Congress added the Part D benefit, through which Medicare pays for seniors’ prescription drugs. The enactment followed a controversial House roll call vote, which Republicans held open for several hours as party leadership maneuvered to secure enough votes for passage. One bargaining chip to attract market-oriented Republican votes was the so-called “noninterference clause”—a provision drug manufacturers had a major role in writing and getting through Congress—which banned negotiations between Medicare and pharmaceutical companies on drug prices and prevented the government from developing its own formulary or pricing structure. Instead of CMS negotiating on Part D plans’ behalf, prescription drug plans compete for enrollees and negotiate directly with manufacturers. Part D was progress, but by most accounts it was not enough. Conspicuously absent from President Obama’s signature health reform efforts were any provisions directed at reducing the prices Medicare pays for drugs. The only salient feature of the ACA as it pertains to Part D was the statute’s closing of the “donut hole,” the out-of-pocket amount seniors pay for drugs when their spending exceeds the coverage level but falls short of the catastrophic level at which benefits resume. Closing the donut hole provides more seamless coverage, thereby preventing seniors from having to choose between medication and other needs, but it does not address pricing. Closing the donut hole may actually exacerbate the problem since some patients switched from expensive specialty drugs to generics or stopped taking drugs that may be overused upon reaching the coverage gap. Congress has taken no action to repeal the ban, and that seems unlikely to change. The pharmaceutical industry’s lobbying efforts topped $231 million last year; indeed, the industry has spent more on lobbying than any other industry since 1998. It seems unlikely that a newly elected President would start his or her administration by reigniting the fight with the pharmaceutical industry that previous presidents, of both parties, have lost. The existence of other, lesser-known laws on the books further complicates the issue. Any future president will have to deal with these laws for Medicare’s drug price control efforts to be successful. The most significant of these lesser-known legal provisions originated as CMS guidance implementing the MMA and was subsequently made law in the ACA. This provision requires Part D drug plans to give access to all or nearly all drugs on the market in six protected classes—ranging from anti-retroviral drugs to antidepressants—until CMS promulgates a regulation to change the designated classes. Although originally intended to discourage drug plans from discriminating against patients with certain conditions, such as patients with HIV, this restriction has limited drug plans’ negotiating power by reducing their ability not to cover drugs that are priced above their value. These two legal provisions—the ban to help the pharmaceutical industry and the protected classes to help patients—restrict what CMS can do to control drug prices. Recent attempts to make modest changes reflect the fierceness of the politics around this issue. In 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) tried to make progress with the protected-classes provision by proposing to create a process to remove some drugs from the protected list. That effort, a much less radical change than repealing the negotiations ban, floundered due to industry and consumer backlash. The Contested Merits of Repealing the Ban on Price Negotiation Rarely have we seen a health policy issue on which there is so much apparent consensus that is backed by so little research. Although it seems intuitive that allowing Medicare to negotiate will produce savings, under both Presidents Obama and George W. Bush, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted repealing the ban would result in only minimal savings. One important reason is that Part D actually already has a negotiating mechanism: Medicare piggybacks on private plans’ incentives to reduce prices. Prescription drug plans participating in Part D bid to contract with Medicare and compete for enrollees. In order to offer competitive prices, the plans negotiate directly with drug companies — even though Medicare itself cannot. The plans are frequently successful when there are competing drugs because the plans can use exclusion of drugs from the formulary or placement of drugs on preferred or non-preferred tiers as leverage to obtain higher rebates and lower net prices. Medicare benefits from those lower drug prices. Thus, it is not clear how much repealing the ban would change things, although it is possible that Medicare could use its scale to negotiate a volume discount for unique drugs that face a less competitive market. To address the high prices of unique drugs, Richard Frank and Joseph Newhouse have suggested the strategy of negotiations followed by binding arbitration if the government and manufacturers cannot agree to a price after a fixed time period. A different concern, often raised by pharmaceutical companies, is that proposals to give Medicare Part D negotiating power could stifle innovation. Some studies suggest the pharmaceutical and biotech industry increased investments in research and development of drugs for seniors after the passage of Medicare Part D. Since drug development is expensive and an uncertain business, reductions in the potential pay-off of drugs aimed at the senior population could affect companies’ willingness to invest in those drugs. A complete repeal of the non-interference clause may not be in the immediate future, but there are other ways to implement effective negotiation. One idea in this vein that has shown promise is value-based pricing, sometimes called “pay for performance.” Under this model—which leading industry executives such as former PhRMA President and Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier support—payers and pharmaceutical companies negotiate to link prices for medicines to the actual value achieved. This approach could mitigate concerns about innovation since under this model breakthrough innovations that improve health would receive higher reimbursement than less effective medications. Practical Politics: Incremental Steps and Pilots in Value-Based Pricing Some of the most important major policy changes in health care began with pilot programs or experiments in the states. The ACA was inspired by Massachusetts’ health reform law, passed in 2006. The ACA embraces this philosophy of incremental, tested reform. The ACA has created an extraordinary number of pilot programs, and launched the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), whose mission is to test new models. A major benefit to initiating reform through pilot programs is that it can be done administratively — through CMS, acting without Congress and federal legislation. In other words, the evidence base can be constructed without worrying about the politics of congressional gridlock. It seems likely that embracing the ACA’s philosophy of testing new policies on a smaller scale will result in the most progress on the question of Part D’s negotiating power. A pilot of a partial repeal of the ban, perhaps with a value-based component, could provide the evidence base to make broader political moves possible. The ACA gives HHS powers to waive Medicare requirements for the purpose of testing models that address potentially avoidable expenditures. These tests, conducted by CMMI, include a proposed value-based project for the drug benefit in Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered by doctors and hospitals. The Part B pilot, which has been hotly contested by stakeholders, institutes innovative payment models, such as risk-sharing agreements that link payments to patient outcomes, building on the mandate of the ACA to move from blind pricing to value-based pricing. We would encourage a similar pilot for Part D that would allow the government to negotiate value-based arrangements and use a limited waiver of the ban on government formulary power as leverage in these negotiations. Other models—such as allowing Medicare to negotiate the purchase of unique drugs that lack competitors—ideally also would be tested as parallel pilots. President Obama’s recent budgets call for CMS to negotiate on prices for high-cost drugs and biologics. Of course, a pilot would have its own set of challenges. For instance, the demonstration project would need to choose specific classes of drugs to focus on and determine how value-based contracts would interact with existing prescription drug plan arrangements. One pivotal decision is whether CMS would lead central negotiations with drug manufacturers and mandate the resulting value-based arrangements for participating drug plans, or if drug plans would negotiate directly. Central negotiations have the advantage of allowing the government to track the value achieved over time, since enrollees may switch between plans during the course of the pilot, making measurement more difficult. Specific value-based arrangements might include: reference pricing, payment for results, and bundling. Reference pricing sets a benchmark price for therapeutically similar drugs and would require determining which drugs are interchangeable. Under a payment for results model, CMS would enter risk-sharing agreements with drug manufacturers to link patient outcomes to payments. Specific outcome targets would have to be identified and negotiated with drug manufacturers, and outcome data would have to be tracked and collected for each patient. Bundling pays for clinically associated products and services at a set price. Implementing this model for a specific group of patients would require integration with other parts of Medicare. Under any model, CMS would need to rigorously analyze the data and communicate its results. These challenges are not insurmountable, and policy analysis should now focus on resolving these questions. The payoff is potentially large: a demonstration project for Part D negotiation with a value-based pricing model is an achievable first step to building the evidence that will guide future action.

There are many drugs that treat chronic conditions, the outcomes of which are almost entirely dependent on the patient/user of these drugs. Value-based pricing for such drugs will most likely be erroneous at best and completely unreliable at worst. As is obvious, a large portion of Medicare drug costs can be attributed to the treatment of chronic conditions like diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, congestive heart failure, COPD. None of the above-mentioned tactics would be effective for drugs treating these illnesses. Unfortunately, the authors continue the often-failed quest to identify a centrally-controlled solution to the drug cost problem. The most effective action would be to outsource Medicare drug program to private insurers, who can negotiate costs themselves. Medicare needs to seriously move towards becoming a premium-support program. The government (with it’s political pulls) is poorly equipped to operate the country’s largest insurance company. October 20th, 2016 at 8:46 pm Roben Mata says: The recent exponential increases in rare pharmaceutical drugs has caused controversy over the past several weeks. From Martin Shkreli 5000% increase to EpiPens’ increase, It appears that the drug companies are trying to take advantage of ill patients without alternative options. It raises questions on regulations on the Drug industry. These price hikes are unheard of in other U.S. industries. I believe the media is not emphasizing the severity of this issue. If other companies continue to follow unjustified price hikes, this could lead to good health becoming unobtainable for lower class and even middle class families. If there’s strict monitoring over the stock market, there should be monitoring over the industry that protects the health of the people. The FDIC has strict monitoring such as the Bank Merger Act that prevents banks from creating monopolies. There needs to be an organization that oversees price changes with pharmaceutical companies similar to the FDIC and the stock exchange. People’s lives should not be prioritized over greed. By Order of the Board of Directors, July 7, 1998. “Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.” FDIC Law, Regulations, Related Acts. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Sept. 2016. September 21st, 2016 at 1:25 pm Spike says: If Big Pharma has such a huge stake in opposing the repeal of the ban on negotiation, they surely must have a trove of data that show the effect on their profits. Otherwise, why fight so vehemently? Most modern countries allow price negotiation, have lower drug prices, and still have pharmaceutical companies that make money. As for innovation, repackaging old drugs and racheting up their price is hardly innovating, more like taking candy from babies, but in this case the innocents die.

While few expect Federal Open Market Committee to announce a rate hike this week, most bet they will do so later this calendar year. “Fears about the Fed increase and then dissipate, and all you can do is try to follow that news flow,” lan Higgins, chief investment officer at Coutts & Co in London, told Bloomberg. “The Fed is very aware of what the market is looking for and hopefully we’ll get no policy shock.” In 3.10pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.01 percent higher. In 2.55pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3 percent. "The market has been all over the place. It’s been driven by the threat of higher interest rates," Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, told Reuters. "Most people feel the most unloved bull market in recent memory will be cut off at the knees by higher interest rates and the Fed is certainly threatening that in the near term.” The Dow moved higher as advances in shares of 3M and those of Boeing, recently trading 1.2 percent and 1.1 higher respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Merck and those of Intel, down 1.3 percent and 1 percent respectively. Some are keen for the Fed to move now. "Let's get on with it already," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Reuters. "It will cause some challenges to the market but I think that is healthy in context of a normal business cycle. It will increase the cost of capital, and flush out some riskier assets in the short term. But that is probably the right thing to do." Meanwhile, a report showed that a gauge of US home builder sentiment in September climbed to the highest level in almost a year, according to the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo. “As household incomes rise, builders in many markets across the nation are reporting they are seeing more serious buyers, a positive sign that the housing market continues to move forward,” NAHB Chairman Ed Brady, a home builder and developer from Bloomington, Illinois, said in a statement. “The single-family market continues to make gradual gains and we expect this upward momentum will build throughout the remainder of the year and into 2017.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a gain of 1 percent from the previous close. Germany’s DAX index rose 1 percent, France’s CAC 40 index climbed 1.4 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index increased 1.5 percent.

Early gains were fueled by rising commodity prices, especially by the rebound in crude oil prices. Crude oil prices rose back above $43 a barrel after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Sunday that a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC countries to stabilize oil markets could be announced this month. The upward move was tempered by the overall attitude of caution among investors ahead of the Bank of Japan and Federal Reserve announcements on Wednesday. Investors are speculating that the Bank of Japan will probably cut its rates on some bank reserves further below zero. However, recent soft economic data has led most analysts to predict that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged, but the central bank could still surprise the markets. U.K. financial institutions stand to lose their "passporting" rights, which allows them to operate free across Europe, if the country opts for a radical exit from the EU, European Central Bank policymaker and Bundesbank Chief Jens Weidmann said. In a joint interview given to several European newspapers, including the British daily Guardian and the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, and published Monday, Weidmann said, "Passporting rights are tied to the single market and would automatically cease to apply if Great Britain is no longer at least part of the European Economic Area(EEA)." Passporting rights are crucial for British financial institutions, many of whom operate from London and provide services across the EU. These rights eliminate the need for individual licenses to operate in different European countries. The "hard" Brexit route touted by some Conservatives aims to sever all trading ties with the EU and end free movement between the country and the remaining 27 members. Losing passporting rights could deal a severe blow to London's status as a financial services hub and many institutions would consider relocating their headquarters, Weidmann said. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 1.03 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chip stocks increased 1.13 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, added 1.04 percent. The DAX of Germany climbed 0.95 percent and the CAC 40 of France rose 1.43 percent. The FTSE 100 of the U.K. gained 1.54 percent and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.80 percent. In Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank dropped 2.38 percent to extend Friday's losses on concerns over its fragile finances. ThyssenKrupp increased 2.66 percent and Salzgitter added 3.30 percent. In Paris, food services and facilities management group Sodexo rose 2.45 percent after an upgrade by analysts at Raymond James Financial Inc. Sanofi advanced 0.90 percent. The pharmaceutical giant has filed a patent infringement suit against Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp in the United States alleging infringement of ten patents. In London, Rolls Royce Holdings advanced 1.73 percent on reports that it is reducing more than 200 positions from its middle management.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 12:35 AM, September 20, 2016 Updated: 8:05 AM, September 20, 2016 NEW YORK - British Prime Minister Theresa May met business chiefs from firms including Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, IBM <IBM.N> and Amazon.com <AMZN.O> on Monday in an attempt to reassure investors after her country's shock vote to leave the European Union. The June 23 vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise, triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar. "Every working day in the United Kingdom one million people wake up and go to work for an American company. And every day in the United States one million people wake up and go to work for a UK company," May told the business leaders. "So you see there is reciprocity," said May, who is in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly. "The UK is going to be out there. We will be looking ‎for business. And ladies and gentlemen, please feel free to invest in the UK." May said that she wanted to hear what issues business leaders wanted addressed in the Brexit negotiations, which she said would yield a good deal in the trade of goods and services with the EU. Chief executives from AECOM <ACM.N>, Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, BlackRock <BLK.N>, Merck & Co <MRK.N>, Sony Pictures and United Technologies Corp <UTX.N> also attended the meeting. The head of Thomson Reuters <TRI.TO>, the parent company of Reuters News, also attended. May first had a closed meeting with major investors and Wall Street banks before addressing dozens of other executives at a wider reception. Despite warnings before the vote that Brexit would shatter economic confidence, some positive economic data and SoftBank's $32 billion takeover of Britain's technology company ARM have stoked the perception that Britain could prosper outside the EU. Still, May and her ministers admit they need to reassure investors from the United States, Japan, China and India that the United Kingdom and London, the only financial capital to rival New York, are still good places to make money. The United States is the largest single inward investor into Britain, which currently attracts far more foreign direct investment than any other EU member. When asked what they wanted to hear from May, one business leader at the meeting who asked not to be named said: "Reassurance." "BREXIT MEANS BREXIT" Some investors have called for clarity about how much access foreign companies based or operating out of Britain will have to the European market, a concern for some U.S. banks and manufacturers which sell into the EU from Britain. Other issues include when and how Brexit will happen. May, who has repeatedly pledged that "Brexit means Brexit", has so far said only that she will not trigger the formal EU divorce process before the end of this year. "‎We will be getting the right deal for the United Kingdom and that is the right deal in terms of trade in goods and services because we recognize the importance of both," May said. "At the same time we want to scope out new deals around the world to further liberalize trade between the UK and other partners around the world," she added. U.S. President Barack Obama said this month that he wanted the Brexit process to be resolved in the least disruptive way possible, though both France and Germany face elections next year which could complicate the Brexit negotiations. Before the vote, some U.S. companies had warned that Brexit would complicate their lives and could cost jobs. Those included JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has 16,000 staff based in Britain. British companies reduced their investment plans in the month after Britain voted to leave the EU, a survey by Lloyds Bank showed on Monday, a further sign the decision is likely to have a lasting impact on the economy. Last month, the Bank of England left its forecast for British growth this year steady at 2.0 percent but cautioned that there might be little growth in the second half and sharply downgraded its forecast for 2017 to just 0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent. "What I really wanted to talk to you about tonight is just very simply to say this: Britain is open for business," May said.

("Embryotech") completed on September 15, 2016 (the "Acquisition"). The acquired assets were comprised of approximately $1.1 million in tangible assets (including inventory, business customer accounts receivable, property and equipment) as well as various material intangible assets (including trademarks, trade secrets/proprietary processes, customer lists and goodwill). The purchase price was determined following arm's length negotiations taking into account historical and expected revenue and EBITDA in addition to various inputs such as the estimated value of the tangible and intangible assets, historical and projected cash flows and other relevant considerations. As disclosed in the September 16 Press Release, the Acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2016 and 2017. In addition to the projected impact on revenue and EBITDA discussed in the September 16 Press Release, the Acquisition is expected to increase 2017 net income by approximately US$1.0 million, representing an increase of over 100% (vs. last 12 months actuals). The Acquisition was an arm's length transaction and was completed under the expedited acquisition process of the TSX Venture Exchange.

The disclosure of such financial information was included in the September 16 Press Release and this press release to provide shareholders with additional context regarding the potential impact of the Acquisition on the Company's financial position and operations and should not be used for any other purpose. The disclosure of such information was approved by management prior to its dissemination. This information is based on current expectations that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, including those risks and uncertainties contained in filings made by the Company with the Canadian securities regulators (which filings are available at www.sedar.com).  Actual results might differ materially from results suggested in any forward-looking statements. The Company will update any forward looking information included in the September 16 Press Release and this press release as required by applicable law. Additional information about the Acquisition, including details with respect to the value of any tangible and intangible assets forming part of the acquired assets, will be included in a business acquisition report to be filed by the Company on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) within 75 days of closing. A third party valuation is currently in process to assist the Company with such disclosure and will be completed prior to the filing of the business acquisition report.

"There was a perception that this was something that came out of the blue and was completely off strategy," Mr. Baumann said of the Monsanto deal. "Just to set the record straight, we were crystal clear, in Sept 2014, that our objective is to build our life-sciences portfolio," based on health care and agriculture, he added. Mr. Baumann's comments came less than a week after Bayer announced an agreement to acquire Monsanto for $128 a share, following months of haggling between the two companies. Bayer first launched its bid for Monsanto in May, taking investors and analysts by surprise, and worrying some that Mr. Baumann would shift the company too far away from its core pharmaceuticals division. The agreed deal would mean crop science would comprise around half of overall revenue, compared with 30% in 2015, while health care would make up the other half. In an apparent concession to concerned investors, Mr. Baumann underscored the central role of pharmaceuticals for Bayer's future growth. The company expected "significant" improvement in sales and profitability at the pharmaceuticals division, driven by recently launched blockbuster drugs, he said. Bayer now sees a combined peak annual sales potential for those products--including blood thinner Xarelto and eye medicine Eylea--of more than EUR10 billion ($11 billion), up from a previous forecast of EUR7.5 billion. Mr. Baumann also said he was "very confident" about the company's pipeline of new drugs. Six of the product candidates have combined sales potential of at least EUR6 billion, he said. Those include drugs for chronic heart failure, kidney disease and prostate cancer. Analysts at Jefferies said the new midterm targets offer a "marginal upside," while analysts at Warburg said that the initial announcements confirmed their "positive expectations." Bayer shares were up 1.4% in early morning trading. At the crop-science division, Mr. Baumann said Bayer was targeting a clean earnings margin of more than 30% three years after the closing of the Monsanto acquisition, compared with a pro forma margin of 27% in 2015. Mr. Baumann also said Bayer had a "record" of successfully integrating and separating acquisitions and divestitures. As part of Bayer's life sciences strategy, Mr. Baumann's predecessor, Marijn Dekkers, acquired Merck & Co.'s over-the-counter drug business for $14 billion and spun off the company's $10 billion specialty plastics business, now known as Covestro AG. Bayer and Monsanto have said they expect their deal to close by the end of 2017.

The industry announcement coincides with a high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance as part of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Companies that have signed up to the scheme include leaders in both branded and generic drug production, including Pfizer, Merck, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline and Allergan, as well as Indian drugmakers Cipla and Wockhardt. The group will work with independent experts to set new factory standards and review supply chains to ensure antibiotic waste does not enter waterways, where it can lead to the breeding of superbugs. Efforts to prevent overuse of antibiotics will involve a review of promotional activities and the implementation, by 2020, of concrete measures such as the removal of incentives to sell the drugs in larger volumes. Though the problem of drug-resistant bacteria has been a feature of medicine since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, it has grown in recent years with the emergence of infections resistant to multiple drugs, such as MRSA.
