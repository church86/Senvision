Merck said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would decide by May 10 whether to approve the Keytruda combination therapy, sending the drugmaker's shares more than 3 percent higher. "This comes as an important surprise because if FDA approves the application, Merck would suddenly be catapulted ahead of all other (immunotherapy) competitors who are also pursuing competing combination regimens of their own," Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note, mentioning Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca. Merck had not previously indicated that it was close to filing for the combination therapy. Industry analysts had been looking for this news toward the end of the year. Keytruda alone is already approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced lung cancer in patients whose tumors have a high level of PD-L1 expression, the protein that the drug targets to help the immune system fight cancer. This first application for Keytruda in combination with another medicine would include patients with metastatic or advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of PD-L1 expression level, opening up a much larger market for the medicine. Patients with high PD-L1 expression account for only about a quarter of all lung cancer patients. Evercore ISI estimated the market for first-line lung cancer for all patients could be as high as $14 billion. "While Merck is unlikely to durably penetrate this entire population, especially with multiple competing regimens on the horizon, an approval in May would give them a significant first-mover advantage," Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote. Keytruda is already also approved to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest of skin cancers, and head and neck cancers. Merck shares rose to $62 in extended trading from a New York Stock Exchange close at $59.92.

Morgan Healthcare Conference. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jan 10, 2017 at 7:23AM Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) didn't have to wait for its presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Monday to make investors happy. Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Incyte announced earlier in the day that a combination of epacadostat and Keytruda would advance to pivotal studies in four additional types of cancer. This news, combined with additional information from Incyte CEO Herve Hoppenot during his J.P. Morgan presentation, appear to make the biotech's prospects brighter than ever before. Image source: Getty Images Epacadostat/Keytruda combo  The announcement that the epacadostat/Keytruda combo would advance to additional late-stage studies spurred Incyte's stock by over 9%. Why such excitement? A look at what the targeted indications are provides the answer. Epacadostat and Keytruda are already in a late-stage study focusing on the treatment of advanced melanoma. Now, Merck and Incyte will move forward with pivotal studies targeting non-small-cell lung cancer, renal-cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, and squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The prevalence of these types of cancers means that the market opportunity for epacadostat is now significantly higher than if it only gained approval for melanoma. The potential to be joined at the hip even further with Keytruda is huge. Merck appears to be on a clear trajectory to become the dominant player in the solid-tumor arena with its anti-PD-1 therapy. Combining Keytruda with the possible anti-tumor capabilities of epacadostat could be an even more effective strategy for fighting cancer than either drug as a standalone treatment.   Higher ceiling Incyte had even more good news on Monday. Hoppenot said the biotech now anticipates peak annual revenue of $2 billion for Jakafi. Previously, Incyte had projected peak sales for the drug of around $850 million. This upward revision stems from a couple of factors. First, Hoppenot said frankly that "competition for Jakafi has not been very successful." Second, Incyte is very encouraged about the prospects for the JAK inhibitor in treating graft-versus-host-disease, a frequent complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplants. While the improved guidance for Jakafi wasn't surprising to investors, it's always good to hear the company acknowledge that the ceiling is considerably higher. Even better, Incyte's new peak sales target doesn't include another potential indication: A late-stage study of Jakafi in treating essential thrombocythemia is also scheduled to begin in the near future. Major potential catalysts Incyte also has other potential catalysts in 2017. At the top of the list is the expected launch by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) of baracitinib in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Incyte partnered with Lilly in 2009 on the development of the JAK inhibitor. The biotech stands to receive $165 million in milestone payments if approved in the U.S. and Europe. plus tiered royalties of up to 20% on global sales of the drug. Hoppenot also mentioned additional clinical trials for baracitinib as potential catalysts for Incyte. A late-stage study evaluating the drug in treating psoriatic arthritis should begin in 2017. Results from a phase 2 study for treatment of atopic dermatitis are expected this year as well. In addition, Incyte has other possible catalysts on the way. Hoppenot highlighted the potential for INCB54828 in targeting FGFR alternations in cancer cells. Incyte expects to report data from dose escalation studies of the pipeline candidate in 2017. Dose escalation data from other experimental cancer drugs are also anticipated later in the year.  Bright future indeed Because of its tremendous success with Jakafi and strong pipeline, Incyte is often mentioned as a potential acquisition target. I suspect the latest news will only fuel the flames of speculation. However, Incyte doesn't need to be acquired for its stock to continue to perform well. The biotech's fortunes will no doubt improve in 2017 with Jakafi's momentum and an expected successful launch of baracitinib. Incyte's future looked bright in 2016. Now it's even brighter.

The healthcare tech start-up backed by Unicorn India Ventures and Patni Group’s Currae Healthtech Fund will provide Merck with clear visibility of market inventory and ensure availability of its products within the warehouses and markets. The platform will help Merck avoid stock-out scenarios, thus, significantly reducing loss of sales. Speaking to DNA Money, Pharmarack Technologies P Ltd CEO Pradyumn Singh said the company will be automating the entire sales order operations of the pharma giant’s pan India distributors network. “Our fully automated platform will enable MSD replace the current sales order process, which is manual and complex,” said Singh, adding that Merck is the start-up’s first MNC client. The Pharmarack SaaS platform was initially only made available to pharmaceutical industry distributors (carrying and forwarding agents) and could be accessed on mobile (iOS, Android and Microsoft) as well as desktop (through its website). Merck, which currently has 2,000 distributors, will now use the platform to automate the orders placing process for medicines which were earlier possible only via a company representative. The manual system of receiving orders and processing them, Singh said, gives rise to many inefficiencies, time-consuming delays and repetitive process. “Our SaaS-based platform will benefit Merck and its distributors by enabling them to place an order online and immediately get a confirmation of the shipment along with other details like size and delivery of shipment, thus, helping the distributors plan their supply chain efficiently and well in advance,” he said. The start-up is currently in negotiations with a few other pharmaceutical companies for a similar arrangement and is likely to close the talks in a few months from now. In terms of existing users, the company already has 650 distributors and 10,000 pharmaceutical retailers on board.

Five years after marriage, she was yet to conceive. She was  subjected to dehumanising treatments by her husband’s family. Nkemdili’s mother-inlaw suddenly became a thorn in her flesh, daily raining abuses on her, calling her all sorts of names, and even accusing her of being a witch that eats up the babies in her womb. That’s not all. At other times, Nkemdili’s mother-inlaw accused her of ruining her womb.  This went on and on for years, that Nkemdili’s husband became pressurised by the mother to get a second wife for himself. The claims were that Nkemdili was to be blamed for her inability to conceive. However, on the advice of a neighbour, Nkemdili and her husband, sought medical attention, and lo and behold, it was discovered that it had not all been Nkemdili’s fault but her husband’s, as he was diagnosed to have low sperm count. Today, there are millions of Nigerian women suffering these forms of dehumanisation due to their inability to conceive, and in most cases, the fault is usually laid on their doorsteps, without the slightest knowledge that the men could be the cause of the problems. A recent statistics by the World Health Organisation showed that  more than 180 million couples (1 in every 4 couples) in developing countries suffer from primary or secondary infertility. WHO says infertility in Africa is caused by infections in over 85 percent women compared to 33 percent worldwide which emphasize the importance of prevention programmes in Africa. It’s against this backdrop that world’s foremost pharmaceutical and chemical company, Merck, launched in Nigeria, its “Merck More than a Mother” initiative aimed at combating infertility and the stigmatization associated with it in Nigeria. The launch which took place first in Lagos and then in Abuja, brought together women leaders, policy makers, parliamentarians, academics, fertility experts among others to chart the way forward towards combating, identifying and implementing strategies to improve access to effective, safe and regulated fertility care in Nigeria and to define interventions to decrease social suffering arising from infertility and childlessness. The mind-engaging discussion at the launch included  panelists the Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Senator Lanre Tejuosho; member, Parliament of Kenya, Hon. Joyce Lay; President, Africa Fertility Society, AFS, Professor Oladapo Ashiru; former President, International Federation of Fertility Societies, IFFS, Prof. Joe Simpson, President, Nigeria Reproductive Society, Dr. Faye Iketubosin;  Head, Intercontinental Region, Merck, Yiannis Vlontzos; amond a host of others. Experts speak Speaking at the launch, in Lagos, Chief Social Officer, Merck, Dr. Rasha Kelej, said the “Merck More than a Mother” initiative is imperative in Africa as the consequences of infertility are much more dramatic in developing countries and can create more wide ranging social and cultural problems compared to Western societies, particularly for women. Kelej said: “A central difficulty associated with infertility is that it can transform from an acute, private distress into a harsh, public stigma with complex and devastating consequences. “In some cultures, childless women still suffer discrimination, stigma and ostracism. An inability to have a child or to become pregnant can result in being greatly isolated, disinherited or assaulted. This may result in divorce or physical and psychological violence. “Through the “Merck More than a Mother” initiative, all stakeholders together including women leaders, policy makers, parliamentarians, academia, fertility experts, community and media will challenge the perception of infertile women, their roles and worth in the society, both within and beyond the medical profession in order to achieve a systemic shift in the current culture of gender discrimination in the context of fertility care in African societies and address solutions for change of mindset and upgrading the health care services.” On his part, Senator Tejuosho affirmed that the stigmatization of women and mothers who have infertility challenges, require the much needed attention, saying. “It’s a fact that out of four Nigerian couples, we have a couple with infertility challenges. This statistics means that infertility needs urgent attention and we need to focus on how we can make health institutions accessible for infertility management. “Most importantly, there is a lot of stigma against women with infertility challenges in Nigeria. We want to stop it. We also want to increase the advocacy against the notion that it’s only the women that suffer infertility. People must know that 50 percent of infertility issues are caused by men.” Similarly, Infertility Advocate and Member, Kenyan Parliament, Hon. Joyce Lay disclosed that what inspired her to lead the campaign against stigmatizing women with infertility issues in Kenya and Africa was because she had a personal experience, having had difficulty having a child after she got married. Lay said: “Lack of information as well as lack of access to better medical and healthcare services contributes largely to cases of infertility in Africa. As a member of parliament, I discover in Africa, governments commit funds in the budget for family planning programmes, but none for infertility. So, I have used this opportunity to ensure that the Kenyan government come on board to realize that infertility is a big problem and we all must be involved.”   Okogba View all posts by Okogba → Previous Post Conjoined twins share single body, two heads in Mexico Next Post Red meat intake linked to common bowel condition Disclaimer Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.

The campaign is championed by Aisha Buhari, wife of President Muhammadu Buhari. The launch held in Abuja, Nigeria is in partnership with Senate Committee on Health; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development and Future Assured organization. Merck More than a Mother continues its commitment to break stigma around infertility and empower infertile women by improving access to information, education, healthcare and change of culture and mind-set to de-stigmatize infertility. In her address, Mrs. Buhari pledged her support and the support of Nigerian governors’ wives in the implementation of Merck More than a Mother’s activities in Nigeria focusing on eliminating infertility stigma and creating awareness and providing information and education on causes of infertility; facilitating access to healthcare; and economic and social empowerment of infertile women. The Nigerian women leaders also supported the empowering of infertile women who form a vulnerable part of the population. Infertile women in Nigeria and many other African countries who can no longer be treated have been empowered socially and economically to lead independent and happier lives through Empowering Berna initiative. Empowering Berna is part of Merck More than a Mother campaign. Helen Phillip, a Nigerian woman from the North, shared her story of suffering from infertility stigma and expressed her gratitude to the support Merck more than a Mother provided her through establishing new business so that she could become an independent productive member in her community.

Women have not been coming out openly because they are traumatized. With this campaign we will encourage them to speak out and we pledge our support and collaboration,” Aisha Alhassan, Nigeria’s minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, said. “Merck More than a Mother campaign is a great initiative to break the stigma around infertility and to empower an unprivileged category of women in Africa, women who suffer infertility. Infertile women have been neglected, mistreated and discriminated because they cannot bear a child, yet 50% of infertility is due to male factors. We can together improve access to education, information, awareness, health care and change of mind-set and culture to stop these women’s suffering,” Rasha Kelej, chief social officer, Merck Healthcare, said. Isaac Adewole, minister of Health, said: “We are responsible for policy at the Ministry level and this is where we can make a difference in improving access to fertility care in Nigeria. We will work through training institutions we are responsible for to strengthen fertility management by making it a sub-specialty. We will also as a Ministry work with private sector, the Senate and the National Assembly to improve governance and quality of care to provide standards to protect infertile men and women seeking treatment.” Merck More than a Mother was first implemented in Kenya in 2015 followed by Uganda, Cote d’Ivoire, Central African Republic and Nigeria. —  Jan 9, 2017 @ 18:40 GMT | No Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 09, 2017 11:40am   Comments Share: Related ZIOP Ziopharm Traders Got A Little Too Excited Watch These 5 Huge Call Purchases In Tuesday Trade Benzinga recently had the chance to speak with ZIOPHARM Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ: ZIOP) CEO Dr. Laurence James Neil Cooper about the upcoming JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, partnerships with Intrexon Corp (NYSE: XON) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and whether shareholders should be concerned about the company’s rising expenses. JPMorgan Conference Cooper will be presenting at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference on Wednesday. Cooper said that his presentation at the conference will focus on the cancer side of Ziopharm’s gene therapy research. Ziopharm’s viral therapy program involves using engineered adenovirus to control delivery of a cytokine called interleukin 12, or IL-12. “We have essentially completed the Phase 1 trial,” Cooper told Benzinga. “We expect to be at the FDA to discuss that trial and the next steps, and we are anticipating that we’re going to be a Phase 3 company next year.” Cooper added that a pivotal trial for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) could be a banner moment for Ziopharm. “I can’t promise, but all the indications are going in that direction,” he said. Strategic Partnerships Last year, Ziopharm renegotiated a long-standing partnership with Intrexon for an 80/20 split of unpartnered programs in favor of Ziopharm. “We renegotiated out relationship with Intrexon for the purposes of essentially looking more like a biotechnology company, in other words a company that if somebody is interested in us, I am not saying they are, but if they were interested in us, they would essentially be able to understand the relationship with Intrexon as a partner with us,” Cooper clarified. In addition, Merck has partnered with Ziopharm and selected a pair of undisclosed CAR targets, a project about which Cooper says he is “very happy at the moment.” R&D Spending Cooper noted that Ziopharm has made a conscious decision to ramp-up its spending in recent quarters. “We needed to complete essentially the adenoviral trial to get to the FDA so we could turn the corner and be in the pivotal trials,” Cooper told Benzinga. “So our cash position supports all of that, supports our ability to take on the registration trial.” However, Cooper acknowledged that the cash won’t last forever. When asked about the possibility of raising cash in the coming quarter, Cooper said the company will explore all options. “We may or may not. We have not made a decision about that,” he said, adding that partnering some of the programs, such as the NK cell program or the adenoviral program, could also help solve any cash issues. Looking Ahead When Benzinga asked what investors have in store in coming quarters, Cooper said he is hoping to provide shareholders with some important updates. “We are really looking forward to being able to update the Street about our adenoviral program with GBM. If we can get this essentially through the next period of regulatory review, we have a complete shot on goal to make a drug and commercialize it,” he said. In addition to the adenoviral trial, Cooper said Ziopharm will continue to explore the viability of its TCR program and its NK cell programs in 2017.

The launch held in Abuja, Nigeria is in partnership with Senate Commission on Health; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development and Future Assured organization. Merck More than a Mother continues its commitment to break stigma around infertility and empower infertile women by improving access to information, education, healthcare and change of culture and mind-set to de-stigmatize infertility. Her Excellency Mrs. Buhari pledged her support and the support of Nigerian Governors’ wives in the implementation of Merck More than a Mother’s activities in Nigeria focusing on eliminating infertility stigma and creating awareness and providing information and education on causes of infertility; facilitating access to healthcare; and economic and social empowerment of infertile women. The Nigerian women leaders also supported the empowering of infertile women who form a vulnerable part of the population. Infertile women in Nigeria and many other African countries who can no longer be treated have been empowered socially and economically to lead independent and happier lives through Empowering Berna initiative. Empowering Berna is part of Merck More than a Mother campaign. Helen Phillip, a Nigerian woman from the North shared her story of suffering from infertility stigma and expressed her gratitude to the support Merck more than a Mother provided her through establishing new business so that she can become an independent productive member in her community.

Women have not been coming out openly because they are traumatized. With this campaign we will encourage them to speak out and we pledge our support and collaboration,” said Hon. Aisha Alhassan, Nigeria’s Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development.  “Merck More than a Mother campaign is a great initiative to break the stigma around infertility and to empower an unprivileged category of women in Africa, women who suffer infertility. Infertile women have been neglected, mistreated and discriminated because they cannot bear a child, yet 50% of infertility is due to male factors. We can together improve access to education, information, awareness, health care and change of mind-set and culture to stop these women’s suffering,” said Dr. Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. Prof. Isaac Adewole Hon. Minister of Health emphasized: “We are responsible for policy at the Ministry level and this is where we can make a difference in improving access to fertility care in Nigeria. We will work through training institutions we are responsible for to strengthen fertility management by making it a sub-specialty. We will also as a Ministry work with private sector, the Senate and the National Assembly to improve governance and quality of care to provide standards to protect infertile men and women seeking treatment.” Merck More than a Mother was first implemented in Kenya in 2015 followed by Uganda, Cote d’Ivoire, Central African Republic and Nigeria.

research-driven patient care - Collaboration to accelerate development of investigational oncology/immuno-oncology compounds News provided by EMD Serono Jan 09, 2017, 08:00 ET Share this article ROCKLAND, Mass., Jan. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- EMD Serono, the healthcare business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany in the U.S. and Canada, and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center today announced a three-year strategic collaboration, with the aim of more quickly advancing the development of investigational cancer therapies in four cancers – breast, colorectal, glioblastoma and leukemia. "This collaboration illustrates our commitment to delivering meaningful value to patients by rapidly progressing our immuno-oncology pipeline, focusing on the identification of innovative biomarkers, together with our partner, the prestigious MD Anderson Cancer Center," said Belén Garijo, CEO Healthcare and Member of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. Continue Reading Belen Garijo, CEO Healthcare and Member of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center logo Ronald DePinho, M.D., president, MD Anderson EMD Serono will be the first company to gain access to the Adaptive Patient-Oriented Longitudinal Learning and Optimization Platform (APOLLO) – MD Anderson's research platform that standardizes the long-term collection of patients' medical history and data derived from tissue samples in order to better understand the biology of cancer and accelerate research-driven patient care. The collaboration will encompass both biomarker-focused pre-clinical research and clinical trials in specific tumor types aimed at identifying biomarkers of response and resistance and developing a better understanding of the disease biology. The collaboration will enhance the value of EMD Serono's future oncology/immuno-oncology pipeline, with a goal of multiple registrational studies in novel indications in the next two to three years. Data from APOLLO will be used to match a number of investigational compounds to select tumor types for potential development and collaboratively design biomarker-driven pre-clinical and clinical studies at MD Anderson evaluating the potential therapeutic effect of the compounds – alone or in combination. APOLLO was developed by MD Anderson as part of its Moon Shots Program, an ambitious effort to reduce cancer deaths by more rapidly developing and implementing advances in prevention, early detection and treatment based on scientific discoveries. "Our goal when establishing the APOLLO research platform was to enable innovative solutions such as this collaboration between academia and industry to help accelerate clinical advances for the benefit of all cancer patients," said Ronald DePinho, M.D., president, MD Anderson. "This joint effort supports our mission to end cancer by addressing some of the greatest challenges in oncology today." Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany is committed to exploring an array of targets, and taking creative scientific approaches to developing novel therapies for hard-to-treat cancers. The strength of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany's promising oncology development program and growing presence in the immunotherapy space demonstrates how the company is re-imagining the way cancer care is delivered.

Incyte and Merck to Advance Clinical Development Program Investigating the Combination of Epacadostat with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Additional pivotal studies evaluating Incyte’s IDO1 inhibitor in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with non-small cell lung, renal, bladder and head and neck cancers expected to start in 2017 Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Small Preview Thumbnail January 09, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time WILMINGTON, Del. & KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Incyte Corporation (Nasdaq:INCY) and Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the decision to advance the clinical development program investigating the combination of epacadostat, Incyte’s investigational oral selective IDO1 inhibitor, with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy. With the expansion of the clinical development program, the companies plan to initiate pivotal studies of epacadostat in combination with KEYTRUDA in four additional tumors: non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Presentations of data from the ongoing studies of epacadostat in combination with KEYTRUDA, which support this decision, are expected at upcoming medical meetings. “We are very pleased to announce the decision with Merck to initiate additional Phase 3 studies that will further evaluate the clinical utility of epacadostat in combination with KEYTRUDA,” said Steven Stein, M.D., Incyte’s Chief Medical Officer. “Data from across the ECHO development program for epacadostat continues to be accrued, including from the ECHO-202 Phase 2 cohorts in combination with KEYTRUDA which support the decision to move forward into pivotal studies beyond melanoma. We look forward to initiation of these new Phase 3 trials as we seek to help improve clinical outcomes for patients with these cancers.” “The expansion of our clinical trial program with Incyte is an important component of our comprehensive approach to investigating the potential for KEYTRUDA in combination with promising compounds, such as epacadostat, to help make a difference in the lives of people with these cancers,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president, head of clinical development, and Chief Medical Officer, Merck Research Laboratories. About ECHO The ECHO clinical trial program was established to investigate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat as a core component of combination therapy in oncology. Ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating epacadostat in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors collectively plan to enroll over 900 patients in a broad range of solid tumor types as well as hematological malignancies. ECHO-301 (NCT02752074), a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating pembrolizumab in combination with epacadostat or placebo for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, is also underway. ECHO-301 was initiated in June 2016 and initial data from this study are expected to be available in 2018. About Epacadostat (INCB024360) Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a key immunosuppressive enzyme that modulates the anti-tumor immune response by promoting regulatory T cell generation and blocking effector T cell activation, thereby facilitating tumor growth by allowing cancer cells to avoid immune surveillance. Epacadostat is a first-in-class, highly potent and selective oral inhibitor of the IDO1 enzyme that reverses tumor-associated immune suppression and restores effective anti-tumor immune responses. In single-arm studies, the combination of epacadostat and immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown proof-of-concept in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In these studies, epacadostat combined with the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab or the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab improved response rates compared with studies of the immune checkpoint inhibitors alone. About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single use vial. KEYTRUDA Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC occurring in 28 (15%) of 192 patients with HNSCC, including Grade 3 (0.5%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and betablockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA.

KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of 682 patients with metastatic NSCLC. The most common adverse event resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 20% of patients and at a higher incidence than with docetaxel) were decreased appetite (25% vs 23%), dyspnea (23% vs 20%), and nausea (20% vs 18%). KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of 192 patients with HNSCC. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC, with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3 or 4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. Safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA have not been established in pediatric patients.

Merck said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would decide by May 10 whether to approve the Keytruda combination therapy, sending the drugmaker's shares more than 3 percent higher. "This comes as an important surprise because if FDA approves the application, Merck would suddenly be catapulted ahead of all other (immunotherapy) competitors who are also pursuing competing combination regimens of their own," Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note, mentioning Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca. Merck had not previously indicated that it was close to filing for the combination therapy. Industry analysts had been looking for this news toward the end of the year. Keytruda alone is already approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced lung cancer in patients whose tumors have a high level of PD-L1 expression, the protein that the drug targets to help the immune system fight cancer. This first application for Keytruda in combination with another medicine would include patients with metastatic or advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of PD-L1 expression level, opening up a much larger market for the medicine. Patients with high PD-L1 expression account for only about a quarter of all lung cancer patients. Evercore ISI estimated the market for first-line lung cancer for all patients could be as high as $14 billion. "While Merck is unlikely to durably penetrate this entire population, especially with multiple competing regimens on the horizon, an approval in May would give them a significant first-mover advantage," Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote. Keytruda is already also approved to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest of skin cancers, and head and neck cancers. Merck shares rose to $62 in extended trading from a New York Stock Exchange close at $59.92.

Bypassing sporting stadiums and race-car tracks, Biden’s first official stop in the world’s sporting capital was to open a A$1 billion ($737 million) cancer center. As head of America’s cancer “moonshot” initiative, and having lost his son Beau to brain cancer, Biden has spent the last year of his term exploring ways to “end cancer as we know it.” That his quest took him 10,000 miles to the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre is an endorsement of Australia’s medical-science prowess and a new plan to expand its reach. Joe Biden in Melbourne. Photographer: Tracey Nearmy/Pool via Getty Images Mining has been the growth engine for Australia’s economy for years. As demand for the nation’s mineral resources declines, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is boosting life-science research funds, offering tax breaks and wooing international talent to exploit the scientific capital that’s enabled the country to claim more than a dozen Nobel laureates. “We were collecting pieces of intellectual property and just handing it over – ‘here you are’ – to investors,” recalls Amanda Caples of her time working in drug development in Melbourne in the early 2000s. At the time, the life sciences industry was following mining’s path of “digging it up and selling it,” she said. Shifting Aspirations Now, as lead scientist in Victoria, the state of which Melbourne is the capital, Caples has seen “a shift in aspirations,” she said. “We’re adding the ‘on-shore processing’” by advancing research beyond the discovery stage. Doing so requires funds that often eluded inventors. Cervical cancer vaccines, for example, rely on groundbreaking research on the human papilloma virus from doctors in Brisbane, who collaborated with Melbourne-based CSL Ltd. on early studies. The shots were taken through late-stage clinical tests and commercialized abroad by pharmaceutical giants Merck & Co. and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Turnbull, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, aims to avoid missing such money-making opportunities with the launch this month of A$250 million for a Biomedical Translational Fund. The funds were allocated in December to three venture capital firms:  Brandon Capital Partners, OneVentures Management and BioScience Managers. The investments will help companies take their promising treatment candidates further along the three-stage clinical trial process instead of being forced to license them at early development stages to companies with more money, said Chris Nave, managing director of Melbourne-based Brandon Capital. Nave’s fund received close to half of the government’s allocation -- A$115 million -- which is being matched by its pension fund investors. ‘It’s transformative’ “For the first time, the Australian biotech industry has access to sufficient amounts of capital to support late stage development,” said Nave, a former scientist who switched to helping universities garner funding from external investors. “It’s transformative.” “There’s a real opportunity that the next Genentech or Amgen will be built in Australia,” Nave said, referring to the U.S. biotechnology giants. The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne. Source: Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre The nation is good at generating science-based intellectual property, for which there are few local competitors at least for now, he said. “We’re not all walking down the same corridors, fighting for deals here," he added. The same advantage is felt at the headquarters of CSL, Asia-Pacific’s biggest drugmaker by market value, which is located across a park from the cancer center Biden opened in Melbourne’s medical precinct. “In some respects I’m the big fish here - if somebody has something they come to me," said Paul Perreault, CSL’s chief executive officer, referring to researchers presenting the company with their discoveries. “If I was in the U.S., there are so many competitors, it might be like CS-who?” Penicillin to Pacemakers New inventions are becoming more important in a country whose scientific feats include pioneering the medical use of penicillin, spray-on skin, electronic pacemakers, the bionic ear, and the ultrasound scanner. A 25-year economic expansion has faltered in recent years amid the collapse of a once-in-a-century mining boom, prompting Turnbull to turn instead to an “ideas boom” for growth. An example Deborah Rathjen, managing director of Bionomics Ltd., gives suggests that protecting intellectual property rights attached to those ideas may be a bigger challenge for Australian researchers. In 1989, she and a colleague applied for a patent for the world-beating discovery of how an inflammation-signalling protein called tumor necrosis factor worked and how it could be countered with an antibody – a finding that later led to the development of arthritis and autoimmune treatments Humira and Remicade, whose combined sales top $20 billion a year. When drug developers sought to challenge that patent, Rathjen asked Peptech to defend it. ‘Business Savvy’ Senior management initially balked at wrangling with the pharmaceutical gorillas behind the medicines, prompting a boardroom showdown in which Rathjen pledged to fund the lawsuit herself. Peptech finally agreed to pursue the matter and won, eventually earning hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties, she said. It was an example of almost being defeated by “groups with much more business savvy,” Rathjen said in a phone interview from Adelaide. “We needed someone to champion it, and realized we could make a lot of money out of this – investing in research, patent filings.” Tenacity has served Rathjen well. Excited by her experience at Peptech, she accepted an offer to run Bionomics in June 2000, about six months after the biotech company debuted on the Australian Stock Exchange following a A$7 million initial public offering. Bionomics now has a market capitalization of A$180 million, a potential bowel-cancer therapy in early stage patient studies, and strategic partnerships with Merck for promising therapies for pain and cognition. While local health care indexes have outperformed the bourse’s benchmark in the past decade -- buoyed in part by the rise in CSL’s share price -- valuations are still lower than global counterparts. Click here for a story on how CSL Ltd. has risen to become the most valuable drugmaker in Asia-Pacific. Arbitraging Assets George Syrmalis is the founder and chief executive officer of The iQ Group, which invests in early research stage startups in Australia, with the intention to help them trade their shares domestically. Post ASX listing and once the company attains significant research milestones, they cross-list the company on NASDAQ in the U.S. This usually results in a higher valuation of the asset, Syrmalis said. By his estimates, early-stage Australian assets are discounted by about 30 to 50 percent compared to similar investments in the U.S., he said. That differential may narrow, thanks to advocates of Australian medical research, like Biden. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

Ogg January 10, 2017 7:45 am EST Print Email Tweet With 2017 well underway, the investing community needs to consider what happened in 2016, and they need to consider beyond the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) hitting 20,000 for what may come ahead. The Dow rose 13.4% to 19,762.60 in 2016, outperforming a 9.5% rise in the S&P 500 and a 7.5% gain for the Nasdaq. This ended up being quite close to the 19,700 bull/bear projection from the start of 2016 — and now investors should consider why the same methodology is pointing to the Dow rising about 8.4% to 21,422. What matters with the post-election rally at its sails on and the pro-business policies expected under a Trump presidency is that 2017 could be another solid year for equity investors. The DJIA bull-bear projection of 21,422 would be short of the preliminary look of 22,000 seen at the end of December, but another 8.4% gain likely would be more than welcome. Investors are already expecting two or three rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2017. The 10-year Treasury went out with a yield of 2.44% in 2016, and the 30-year Treasury closed out 2016 with a yield of 3.06%. On the last day of 2015, the 10-year yield was 2.27% and the 30-year yield was 3.01%. Still, the lows of the year were 1.34% for the 10-year and 2.1% for the 30-year. On top of tax reform and overseas cash repatriation, companies are expected to benefit from lower regulatory spending. All of this, along with an “America first” mentality, are expected to add up to higher earnings for companies in 2017. Also a climate is being set for higher dividends and continued share buybacks, if hundreds of billions of dollars were to magically be brought back into America. One thing that ought to be kept in mind is that investors should not expect the post-election rally to continue in a straight line all year. That post-election rally was too big to ignore, but it is very likely that some of the gains for the start of 2017 were pulled into late 2016, based on how explosive that rally was. As a reminder, markets sold off steadily at the start of 2016 after the late 2015 gains stole from the coming year. At one point in early 2016, the S&P 500 Index was down far more than the 10% threshold to mark a correction. Also, a year ago it was the case that analysts were calling for S&P 500 earnings to rise almost 10%, only to find earnings remain flat. The S&P was also valued at roughly 17 times forward earnings at the end of 2016, a more lofty valuation than most investors would prefer. So, we are past the 19,700 mark, and Dow 20,000 may just be a mental line. This 21,422 Dow target for 2017 is derived using the 12-month price target consensus (mean) from Thomson Reuters using the bullish and bearish targets. We then add in the dividend yield at the end of each year, without considering dividend hikes expected in the coming year, for a snapshot total return calculation for each of the 30 Dow components. We then average out the expected total return of all 30 Dow components, without using the weighting of each component, and that is used to calculate the expected return. The assumption is that analysts will not get each Dow target right, but if you give them 30 tries and use an average then they can get their calls right. Before getting into 8.4% projected upside for stocks, there are some risks that must be considered. First and foremost, the Dow’s rally from November 9 to December 30 was so large that it may have stolen some of 2017’s gains. Stocks tied to financial, energy, infrastructure and consumer goods rallied so much that some tempering of real upside expectations seems merited. Washington, D.C., also has a history of infighting that makes some of the upside in various proposed policy changes priced for perfection, and perfection and politics rarely is the outcome. Earnings growth could be short of expectations, and there are still mixed economic reports on just how strong growth can be. Is 3% to 4% GDP growth realistic over and over after seven years of recovery? Currency risk from a strong dollar and the poor economic trends of many key growth economies (China, Russia, India, Brazil and more) could also be a combined double-whammy for many of the top Dow stocks in 2017 as they are exporters and rely heavily on international opportunities. 24/7 Wall St. has featured nine of the 30 Dow stocks that should be the basis for propelling the Dow toward that 21,422 target in 2017. Not all of them are the highest weightings in the index, because the Dow uses a stock price-weighted methodology rather than a market cap weighted methodology used by more virtually all modern indexes. What needs to be considered is that these nine Dow components are representative of broader groups that should see their valuations bleed over into peers and rivals if they match the expected performance. These are the nine Dow stocks that will be needed to drive the Dow higher in 2016. Apple Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) generated a return of 12.5% in 2016, with the stock ending the year at $115.82 a share. Apple’s consensus analyst target price of $131.96 at the end of 2016 would imply simple upside of 13.9%, but its 2.0% yield would make for an implied total return of 15.9%, if the analysts get 2017 more accurate than they predicted for 2016. Apple shares have a 52-week trading range of $89.47 to $118.69, and the market cap is $622 billion. The dividend yield is 1.9%. Apple’s upside most likely will depend on the next iteration of the iPhone. That will come later in the year, and we would note that Apple’s upside expectation is far more muted in 2017 than it was for 2016.

Soon, everyone else will get a chance. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jan 9, 2017 at 8:22AM You might be too busy to pay much attention to every tiny biotech that goes public. There's one initial public offering (IPO) coming up, though, that I think you'll want to keep your eyes on. Jounce Therapeutics filed a few days ago for an IPO in 2017. Any company that Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) is willing to invest in big-time is one that is worth watching.  Image source: Getty Images. What Celgene liked Jounce has a grand total of one candidate in clinical testing -- experimental cancer drug JTX-2011. And it's only in early-stage development. JTX-2011 has enough potential, though, that Celgene paid the small biotech $225 million up front and bought a $36 million stake in the company. The deal also includes an option for Celgene to license up to four other immunotherapies. What's the attraction for JTX-2011? It's a monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates a protein known as ICOS (which is a lot easier to say than its full name -- inducible T-cell co-stimulator). ICOS is found on the surface of white blood cells produced or processed by the thymus gland (called T cells) that are found in many solid tumors. Jounce thinks that JTX-2011 can amplify the immune response in "good" T cells within a tumor while reducing the number of "bad" T cells. This double whammy just might prove effective at fighting cancer. In pre-clinical testing, Jounce found that JTX-2011 stimulates a significant T cell immune response against solid tumors. The biotech currently has a phase 1/2 clinical study in progress with safety data expected in the first half of 2017 and preliminary efficacy data in the second half of the year. For precision medicines like Jounce's JTX-2011 to be most effective, the patients that can benefit from the drugs need to first be identified. Celgene really liked that Jounce has a way to prioritize targets and potential predictive biomarkers to match the right therapy to the right patients. Jounce calls its approach for accomplishing this its "Translational Science Platform." This platform allows the biotech to profile the immune cellular and molecular characteristics of human solid tumors. The biotech thinks that this biomarker-driven approach will ultimately enable it to develop companion diagnostics for its therapies. Combinations on the way Jounce's clinical study is evaluating JTX-2011 as a stand-alone treatment and in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) Opdivo. Jounce also has plans to test its lead candidate with its own anti-PD-1 antibody, JTX-4014, at some point down the road. JTX-4014 is currently in pre-clinical testing. While JTX-2011 is only being evaluated in combination with Opdivo right now, there's no reason to think Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug is the only potential combo partner. Jounce stated in its IPO filing that it intends to explore use of JTX-2011 in combination with "other future product candidates." I'd put Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda high on the list. Keytruda has already demonstrated better efficacy than Opdivo as a first-line treatment of lung cancer in clinical studies. Merck is moving ahead with clinical studies of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy and several other drugs. JTX-2011 should be a good fit as well. A good bet? There's an old saying that you don't bet on the horse -- you bet on the jockey. In Jounce's case, I'd say the horse and the jockey(s) could be good bets.  One of Jounce's founders is James Allison. Dr. Allison is currently chairman of immunology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the leading cancer research centers in the world. He was one of the first scientists to identify the T cell receptor and is recognized as one of the pioneers of cancer immunotherapy. Allison's research helped lead to the development of Bristol-Myers Squibb's blockbuster CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor Yervoy. The company's CEO, Richard Murray, came from Merck. Murray most recently served as Merck's senior vice president of biologics and vaccine research. Chief scientific officer Deborah Law also came from Merck, where she served as vice president of therapy area biology for immunology, oncology, and immunomodulators. It wouldn't be surprising if those Merck connections help open doors for combo studies with Keytruda. Jounce's IPO hopes to raise $75 million. That shouldn't be hard to do. The biotech already has over $271 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, boosted largely by the Celgene deal. If there's one biotech IPO to watch in 2017, I think Jounce is it.  Keith Speights owns shares of Celgene. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Celgene.

Julia Bradshaw 9 January 2017 • 12:04am The pharmaceuticals industry is set for a surge in deal-making this year, as companies under pressure from weak drugs pricing and higher costs take advantage of low valuations and a tax-friendly political climate in the US to bolster faltering sales growth. Even those with solid growth prospects may pursue M&A, leading to a sharp rise in the value of deals this year, according to a report from EY. “This could be a banner year for deal-making, as industry and political forces converge,” said Pamela Spence, a co-author of the report. “From a macro perspective, there was pent-up demand for deals in a holding pattern going into the US presidential election, but the deal chatter in the waning weeks of 2016 indicate much firepower could soon be unleashed in 2017.” Global pharmaceutical firms have navigated choppy waters in recent years. Spiralling R&D costs have eroded margins while blockbuster drugs have lost their patents, hitting profit growth. Drugs pricing and reimbursement have becoming thorny issues for Big Pharma Meanwhile, pricing pressure in the US and stricter reimbursement rules from health authorities in other countries have piled further pressure on the likes of Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline. Political uncertainty in the US in the run up to the presidential elections weighed further on the valuations of these companies. That meant that the value of M&A deals in the sector fell to $273.7bn (£222bn) last year, a far cry from the $392.4bn recorded in 2015, according to figures from Mergermarket. “Biotech and big pharma valuations fell steadily throughout the year,” the EY report said. "This trend may offer further clues to 2017’s outlook. The last time biopharma valuations experienced such acute declines was during the 2008 financial crisis. This pronounced downturn was quickly followed by a handful of 2009 megadeals.” Indeed, 2009 was the year in which Pfizer bought Wyeth, Roche bought Genentech, and Merck acquired Schering-Plough. “So there’s a precedent for big pharma ramping up deal-making in 2017, and potentially dominating M&A share for several years,” said the report. Expectations that Donald Trump’s administration will relax corporate tax rates and allow US companies to repatriate the billions of dollars worth of cash stockpiled overseas at a low, one-off charge, will give US pharmaceuticals a huge amount of firepower with which to pursue acquisitions to bolster growth. Like him or not, his tax policies are favoured by corporates Jeffrey Greene, one of the report’s authors, said: “You tend to see companies acting in advance of regulatory changes, rather than waiting, so I think we will see a few very large deals greater than $20bn or so. "It's likely that we will have more mega mergers among the top 25 pharmaceutical companies in the world, but there will be deals all the way down the spectrum." Ms Spence also expects a wave of divestitures, where companies sell off parts of their business, as well as further asset swaps, in a similar vein to the one carried out by GlaxoSmithKline and Swiss drugs giant Novartis in 2015. “There will also be several smaller, specific straight bolt on acquisitiosn that fuel the R&D pipeline, which tend to go under the radar, as well as further joint ventures between pharma and technology companies, such as Alphabet which did a deal last year with GSK.” This year could also herald a spate of M&A from cash-rich Asian companies looking to gain a foothold in US and European markets. The Chinese are eyeing up western pharmaceutical assets “I think we will see acquisitions from Asia inbound to the US and Europe,” Ms Spence said. “But because of the nature of the capital, which is mostly private equity, it is difficult to estimate how much funding there is for inorganic growth, but it’s certainly an area to watch.” She added: “I see this as a potential tipping point. Companies have been cautious over last 18 months, especially big pharma, but they know which assets they want and it is going to be a first mover advantage.

Fresh all-time highs for the Nasdaq came as the Dow industrials failed to reach the psychologically significant level of 20,000 again, amid otherwise tepid enthusiasm for equities ahead of a news conference from President-elect Donald Trump set for Wednesday—his first since being elected on Nov. 8. But the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.48%  shined, finishing up 20.00 points, or 0.4%, at 5,551.82, for the sixth straight day in the green and marked its longest streak of all-time highs since Dec. 27, 1999, according to Dow Jones data. Meanwhile, The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.18%  ended at its flattest level in years, unchanged from Monday at 2,268.90. The broad-market gauge had been up by as many as 10 points earlier in the session. Five of the 11 main sectors closed lower, bookended by a 1.3% decline in the real-estate sector and a 0.4% gain in consumer-discretionary stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% which had traded up by as many as 70 points and within 43 of breaching the 20,000 mark earlier in the session, closed down 31.85 points, or 0.2%, at 19,855.53. Shares of Merck & Co. MRK, +0.21%  and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.01%  dragged on the benchmark. Beyond, Trump’s comments, which could add clarity to his legislative agenda, market participants are awaiting the kick off earnings season for some support for the recent rally in U.S. stocks. The market is looking for confirmation of stock valuations at current levels, and the only way to get that will be upbeat earnings, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Some of evidence of pre-Trump news conference jitters were on display in the dollar DXY, +0.02% which pulled back somewhat on Wednesday. The greenback was up about 0.1% against major currencies. The dollar has been rising on hopes that the new administration’s fiscal stimulus will boost the economy, but some analysts believe that bet may have been pushed too far, too fast. “In the near term, there are a lot of things to worry about. For example, we might hear some chatter from the corporations about the sharp rise in the dollar, which will have an impact on their earnings in the next few quarters,” said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. Ogg, however, isn't worried about stock markets over the next few years, in part because of expected deregulation.

Therefore, the upside risks prevail in the U.S. markets,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, in a note to investors. Read: Here’s why Trump’s inauguration could mark a near-term top for stocks “Basically Friday, we have two bank stocks coming up, and if they beat expectations both top and bottom line, I think we could see the Dow finally hit that 20,000 mark,” said Cardillo. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.53% and Bank of America Corp. BAC, +0.39% among banks due to report Friday, closed up 0.3% and 1.7%, respectively. Economic docket: No major economic reports were released Tuesday. The National Federation of Independent Business said its optimism index jumped 7.4 points to 105.8, the strongest reading since 2004. November job openings rose as did the number of people quitting jobs while wholesale inventories for November jumped 1%. Stocks to watch: Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.

Pharma Two charts capture the dark mood around Big Pharma in 2017 By Arundhati Parmar Post a comment / Jan 10, 2017 at 12:59 PM Shares66 Big Pharma is toast this year. Or at least that’s what these two charts from a small sample of attendee responses at a breakfast reception Tuesday during the ongoing J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference reveal. While the survey captured real-time responses of 30-plus people, it is a snapshot of the sentiment surrounding large pharmaceutical companies and their prospects in the next 12 months. Here’s what Mark Lubkeman, senior partner and managing director of BCG, the consulting firm hosting the reception asked a panel of medtech and pharma executives and the gathered audience: Which healthcare sector do you expect to show the best value creation in 2017? And here’s how the audience responded: Notice the 0% growth in pharma for this year. “Classic pharma companies are in trouble,” Lubkeman said to audience laughter as results of the real-time survey showed up. The next question was: Which healthcare sector do you expect to show the worst value in 2017? Here’s the chart that shows most people in the room were down on healthcare providers followed by large pharma companies. The panel chimed in with one large pharmaceutical company executive displaying wry humor. “I would like to thank everybody for their confidence in Merck & Co. – duly noted,” said Sunil Patel, vice president and head of corporate development at Merck, and the audience once again guffawed. Then, on a more serious note, Patel proceeded to describe the challenges ahead for this sector in 2017 and beyond. “I do think all the Big Pharmas will probably going to be challenged. Next year (read 2017) we might have a little bit of growth, but over the next two to three years”… he trailed off. Patent cliffs are looming, he pointed out. For Merck they involve Vytorin and Zetia, both cholesterol drugs. “The biosimilars are going to start rolling in and so you are going to see Big Pharma challenged for growth,” Patel said. He did, however, point out that even despite the challenges there are pockets of opportunity. “If you are in the I/O (immuno-oncology), you have a unique opportunity to see some growth,” Patel noted, adding that these assets involve a lot of “R&D burn.” And so how do you get the growth given that traditional revenue streams are drying up and high-quality drugs like I/O products eat up a lot of cash. “So then the corollary becomes, ‘what do you do to fix it’ and that’s when you pay too much for a biotech company,” Patel declared confirming the notion that biotechs are going to see good growth this year. And deal flow has already begun with Takeda announcing Monday that it is buying Ariad Pharma for $4.7 billion, or $24 per share. And Johnson & Johnson is attempting to buy Swiss biotech firm Actelion after initial discussions failed. Photo: Herianus, Getty Images Shares66 Topics #JPM17, Big Pharma, J.P.

Adimab Provides Annual Update on 2016 Partnerships and Milestones - 16 New Partner Agreements Signed - - Over 40 Milestones Achieved - - Multiple Partner Programs Advance in Clinical Trials - January 10, 2017 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time LEBANON, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Adimab, LLC, the global leader in the discovery and optimization of fully human monoclonal and bispecific antibodies, today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements with nine new companies in 2016. In addition, Adimab announced the expansion of seven of its current partnerships and the achievement of over 40 technical and development milestones across multiple existing collaborations. Over the past eight years, Adimab has entered into over 40 partnerships for the discovery of therapeutic IgGs and bispecific antibodies, generating in excess of 150 therapeutic programs using the Adimab platform. The most advanced program is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. New alliances for 2016 include collaborations with Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Iconic Therapeutics, Tizona Therapeutics, Scholar Rock, and iTeos Therapeutics, among others. In addition, Adimab expanded its partnerships with Innovent Biosciences and Jounce Therapeutics, and several others. “We are focused on being a premier technology company, not a product company,” commented Guy Van Meter, Vice President of Business Development at Adimab. “Our success is entirely dependent upon the success of our partners and, therefore, every program is very important to us. Speed is a critical aspect for many of our partners, but identifying a therapeutic lead that provides a competitive advantage is even more important.” “At Adimab, we are committed to continually improving and expanding our technical offering to provide the best antibody discovery platform in the industry,” added Tillman Gerngross, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Adimab. “We want our partners to have solutions for all of their therapeutic approaches so that Adimab is the partner of choice in turning their biological insights into transformative drugs.” Adimab also announced that it achieved over 40 technical and development milestones in 2016 with Merck, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Kite Pharma, Surface Oncology, GSK, and several others. Adimab partners exercised a total of 13 commercial licenses in 2016, in addition to Mersana and Innovent filing INDs and Arsanis advancing its lead program into Phase 2 clinical trials. “Adimab was able to rapidly identify and screen a large number of antibodies that interact with HER2 in unique ways; this allowed us to select a lead antibody with superior ADC properties. XMT1522, our lead program, is comprised of this antibody conjugated to our highly differentiated Dolaflexin ADC platform, and has shown superior efficacy and tolerability in a broad range of pre-clinical models,” said Anna Protopapas, Chief Executive Officer of Mersana Therapeutics. ”Phase 1 trials for XMT1522 are ongoing.” “We have pursued numerous programs with Adimab and have experienced excellent success. Our anti-PD1 program has initiated clinical trials in 2016, a mere two years after completing our campaign with Adimab,” added Michael Wu, Chief Executive Officer at Innovent. “The speed of the Adimab technology has helped Innovent rapidly develop multiple products.” Adimab has established antibody discovery collaborations with many leading pharmaceutical companies, such as Merck, Novo Nordisk, Biogen, GSK, Roche, Novartis, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Celgene, Gilead, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Takeda and Sanofi. In addition, Adimab has partnered with several smaller publicly traded companies, such as Acceleron, Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Kite, Five Prime, as well as leading venture-backed companies including Jounce, Mersana, Alector, Arsanis, Surface Oncology, Potenza, Tizona, Tusk and several academic institutions such as Memorial Sloan Kettering and MD Anderson. The Adimab antibody discovery and optimization platform has also been internalized by several larger pharma partners; Adi-inside partners include Merck, Novo Nordisk, Biogen and GSK. About Adimab Adimab’s integrated antibody discovery and optimization platform provides unprecedented speed from antigen to purified, full-length human IgGs. Adimab offers fundamental advantages by delivering diverse panels of therapeutically relevant antibodies that meet the most aggressive standards for affinity, epitope coverage, species cross-reactivity and developability. Adimab enables its partners to rapidly expand their biologics pipelines through a broad spectrum of technology access arrangements. For more information, visit http://www.adimab.com.

The expansion, which includes the opening of two new process development centers in the U.S. and China, follows the commercial success of Merck's biodevelopment center in Martillac, France. The two new units will be located in close proximity to customers in the Shanghai and Boston metropolitan areas. Each will provide a full range of process development capabilities and services. This includes cell line development services, both upstream and downstream process development, as well as non-GMP clinical production. "We are seeing an increasing global demand for end-to-end process development solutions and Merck offers a one-stop shop for biopharma customers," said Udit Batra, Member of the Merck Executive Board and CEO, Life Science. "This expansion reinforces our position as the premier supplier of all process development and clinical stage manufacturing solutions, materials and services needed for the production of biologics. This is a strategic, high-potential investment for Merck specifically designed to meet customer needs on three continents." Merck's biodevelopment center in Martillac, France, is a fully operational single-use, GMP facility for manufacturing clinical stage batches. Equipped with a full suite of Merck technologies, including the 2000 liter single-use Mobius ® bioreactor, Martillac offers biopharma companies a complete solution to support their clinical development programs. Merck's end-to-end offering delivers important benefits and addresses key challenges for biopharmaceutical companies at all stages of molecule development and commercialization in any geography. In addition to the Mobius ® bioreactor, the end-to-end portfolio includes solutions such as Lynx ® CDR, Viresolve ® Process Area Modules, Pellicon ® and Centinel™ Intelligence Virus Defense. Early-stage companies with limited resources and infrastructure benefit from a partner with strong expertise and experience developing processes and GMP clinical manufacturing to help accelerate early clinical development programs. Companies in more advanced stages need to overcome the challenges of moving from late phase clinical development into commercial manufacturing, accelerating availability of affordable life-enhancing drugs.

"Those are illness that could bankrupt our society if we don't get good solutions to them," he said in an interview with CNBC's "Closing Bell." The pharmaceutical industry has come under scrutiny for the cost of prescription drugs, with President-elect Donald Trump vowing to do something to bring down prices. Frazier said Merck has tried to take a "responsible approach" to pricing. "Affordability is critical so that patients have access to medicines. At the same time, it's also important that we have the kind of incentives that allow us to do the kinds of studies that we need to do to go after these diseases like Alzheimer's," he said.

Jan 09, 2017, 16:05 ET Share this article SAN DIEGO, Jan. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: HALO), a biotechnology company developing novel oncology and drug-delivery therapies, today provided program updates and its annual financial guidance at the 35th annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference. "We enter the year with strongly supportive data from our HALO 202 study in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients and momentum in our HALO 301 global registration trial for our investigational new drug PEGPH20 in a similar, targeted HA-High patient population," said Dr. Helen Torley, president and chief executive officer. "In 2017 we expect to make continued progress demonstrating the pan-tumor potential of PEGPH20, as we also focus on near-term catalysts in our revenue-generating ENHANZE™ platform, including the potential approval of rituximab SC in the U.S. and progressing other partnered programs in the clinic." In addition to HALO 301, the company has ongoing studies of PEGPH20 in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in gastric and non-small-cell lung cancer patients and in collaboration with Eisai in combination with HALAVEN® (eribulin) in breast cancer patients. Two new studies exploring four tumor types are planned to start in 2017 as part of a recently announced clinical collaboration with Genentech. Under the collaboration, Genentech will evaluate PEGPH20 in combination with its anti-PDL1 TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab) in pancreas and gastric cancer and Halozyme will evaluate the same combination in gallbladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. Halozyme has also been included in an innovative, patient-centered clinical trial planned for initiation in 2017 called Precision Promise, led by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. In the Halozyme ENHANZE™ platform business, the company announced in November 2016 that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted Genentech's Biologics License Application for a subcutaneous formulation of rituximab in multiple blood cancer indications with an action date in June. This is a co-formulation with Halozyme's proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme (ENHANZE platform), approved and marketed under the MabThera® SC brand in countries outside the U.S. In addition, Halozyme plans in 2017 to support ongoing development of subcutaneous formulations for Roche's PERJETA® and Janssen's DARZALEX®, work with existing ENHANZE platform partners to advance development of additional licensed targets, and seek to sign new global licensing and collaboration agreements. The company also provided financial guidance for 2017 of: Revenue of $115 million to $130 million, excluding revenue from any new ENHANZE global collaboration and licensing agreements that may be signed during the year. The company expects to report $20 million in 2016 revenue for reimbursed partner R&D expenses that will not recur in 2017; Operating Expenses of $240 million to $250 million, supporting the ongoing Phase 3 study in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients and the continued execution of clinical programs to study the pan-tumor potential of PEGPH20; Year-end cash balance of $100 million to $110 million. Dr. Torley will present at 3 p.m. PST, Jan. 9 at the conference. Her presentation will be webcast through the "Investors" section of www.halozyme.com, and a recording will be made available for 90 days following the event. To access the live webcast, please log on approximately fifteen minutes prior to the presentation to register and download any necessary audio software.

Safe Harbor Statement In addition to historical information, the statements set forth above include forward-looking statements concerning the Company's future expectations and plans for 2017, timing and results of clinical trials, the development and commercialization of product candidates and the potential benefits and attributes of such product candidates (including, without limitation, statements concerning the possible activity, benefits and attributes of PEGPH20, the possible method of action of PEGPH20, its potential application to improve cancer therapies and statements concerning future actions relating to the development of PEGPH20).  These statements also include forward-looking statements concerning the possible activity, benefits and attributes of ENHANZE™, the possible method of action of ENHANZE, its potential application to aid in the dispersion and absorption of other injected therapeutic drugs, the number of collaborative targets actually chosen, the product development efforts of our ENHANZE partners, whether such products are ultimately developed or commercialized, whether milestones triggering milestone payments will be achieved, and statements concerning facilitating more rapid delivery of injectable medications through subcutaneous delivery.  The forward looking statements also include the Company's expected financial outlook for 2017 and statements concerning expectations for 2016 revenue for reimbursed partner R&D expenses.  These forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are typically, but not always, identified through use of the words "believe," "enable," "may," "will," "could," "intends," "estimate," "anticipate," "plan," "predict," "probable," "potential," "possible," "should," "continue," and other words of similar meaning. Actual results could differ materially from the expectations contained in forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including unexpected expenditures and costs, unexpected fluctuations or changes in revenues from collaborators or product sales, audited 2016 financial results differing from the financial results stated above, unexpected clinical trial delays or results, including enrollment delays, unexpected results or delays in development and regulatory review, regulatory approval requirements, unexpected adverse events and competitive conditions. These and other factors that may result in differences are discussed in greater detail in the Company's most recent Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

While you were sleeping: Oil weighs on Dow Margreet Dietz Tuesday January 10, 2017 Share Play NBR radio on The Dow and S&P 500 fell from record highs as energy stocks moved lower with the price of oil, while the Nasdaq hit a fresh high and US Treasuries strengthened.  Wall Street was mixed In 1.20pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 percent, while, in 1.05pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index inched 0.1 percent lower. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.3 percent as of 1.20pm. It touched a record high 5,541.08. In the Dow, declines in shares of Exxon Mobil and those of Chevron, down 2.1 percent and 1.2 percent respectively, outweighed advances in shares of Merck and those of DuPont, recently up 1.15 percent and 1.2 percent respectively. Energy stocks declined with the price of oil amid an increase of US drilling.  Even so, optimism remains that Wall Street will continue to scale fresh record highs. "Our view about the Dow [hitting] 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," Matt Jones, US head of equity strategy at JP Morgan Private Bank in New York, told Reuters. Meanwhile, investors flocked to the perceived safety of US Treasuries, pushing yields on the 10-year note four basis points lower to 2.38 percent. Shares of VCA soared after Mars said it agreed to buy the pet healthcare provider with about 800 animal hospitals in the US and Canada, for about US$7.7 billion to grow its pet business.  Privately-held Mars will acquire all of the outstanding shares of VCA for US$93 per share, or a total value of about US$9.1 billion including US$1.4 billion in outstanding debt, the McLean, Virginia-based company said in a statement. Shares of VCA soared 28 percent to US$90.60 as of noon trading in New York. “VCA is a leader across pet health care and the opportunity we see together—for pets, pet owners, veterinarians and other pet care providers —is tremendous,” Mars Chief Executive Officer Grant Reid said in a statement. “Together, we will be able to provide even greater value, better service and higher quality care to pets andpet owners.”  In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.5 percent drop from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index declined 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index slid 0.5 percent. However, the UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.4 percent as exporters benefitted from a weakening pound, declining more than 1 percent against the greenback, amid concern about the UK’s Brexit strategy following comments by Prime Minister Theresa May. "The market just takes the most negative view—it assumes that because May is keeping her cards as close as possible to her chest, there is no plan for Brexit and that we're going to 'hard Brexit' out of the EU," BMO Capital Markets currency strategist Stephen Gallo told Reuters.

The law — House Bill 2 (HB2) — has incited a state-wide civil liberties battle. Here is the timeline of the so-called "bathroom bill." Ali Rizvi, Nicole L. Cvetnic and Sohail Al-Jamea / McClatchy The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) civil rights organization, and Equality NC, the statewide organization working to secure equal rights and justice for LGBTQ North Carolinians, and other civic leaders held a press conference on, Monday, Sept. 19, 2016 at the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center. Some companies that opposed House Bill 2 contributed money to the campaigns of lawmakers who voted for the law and the governor who signed it. John D. Simmons jsimmons@charlotteobserver.com 1 of 2 i By Jim Morrill and Gavin Off jmorrill@charlotteobserver.com goff@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Nearly 200 companies joined the fight last year against North Carolina’s House Bill 2, signing on to public protests and affirming their commitment to LGBT rights. But some of those same companies, mainly through their political action committees, contributed money to the campaigns of lawmakers from both parties who voted for the law and the governor who signed it. PACs representing a half-dozen companies gave almost $200,000 to North Carolina lawmakers who voted for HB2, according to an Observer analysis. Some support was less direct. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which criticized HB2, gave $600,000 to the Republican Governors Association. The RGA in turn spent $3.6 million on behalf of former GOP Gov. Pat McCrory. Pfizer also gave $170,000 to a GOP group that spent almost a million dollars to re-elect Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a vocal HB2 supporter. When it passed last March, HB2 created a national backlash. Critics said the law, which requires transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate in government buildings, discriminates against the LGBT community. Many companies took a stand in protest. [List of companies supporting, opposing HB2] To be sure, many PACs and executives who publicly opposed HB2 also gave to Democrats and McCrory’s opponent, Roy Cooper. And companies, like individuals, have multiple interests. Bank of America’s PAC, for example, gave $2,000 to GOP and Democratic caucuses in the House and the Senate. “We interact on a bipartisan basis with public officials on a range of topics,” said a bank spokesman, Dan Frahm. “And we have been public and consistent with our support for repeal of HB2.” Gay rights advocates say contributors should consider a candidate’s stand on HB2. “We strongly encourage companies committed to leading the way forward to include LGBTQ legal equality among the priorities they consider when they’re supporting candidates,” said Stephen Peters, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest gay rights group. One Charlotte transgender activist criticized the donations. “That’s hypocritical if they say they’re supporters,” said Erica Lachowitz. Pfizer’s contributions Last spring the HRC released a list of 130 companies and CEOs opposed to the law. Most of those companies – including prominent names such as Starbucks, Facebook, Apple, IBM and Kellogg’s – have no PACs registered in North Carolina and don’t routinely get involved in N.C. campaigns. Among those that do, a half-dozen PACs had given $192,000 to McCrory and Republican lawmakers who voted for HB2 through September, the last reports available. Final reports are due this month. New York-based Pfizer, which has a manufacturing plant in Sanford, gave $25,000 to GOP lawmakers through its PAC in addition to the company’s contributions to the RGA and the Republican State Leadership Committee. The RSLC spent $850,000 on behalf of Forest. “We contribute to policymakers from both sides of the aisle based on their stance on issues that impact patient access to innovative medicines and vaccines,” said spokeswoman Sharon Castillo. “Our contributions are not based on a policy maker’s position on any social, religious or political issue. To suggest otherwise is both inaccurate and misleading.” Wells Fargo’s PAC gave at least $61,700 to lawmakers who supported HB2. Asked about the contributions, Wells offered a statement saying, “Gov. McCrory and other elected officials were well aware of our opposition to HB2.” PACs for Merck, Pepsico and Time Warner Cable also gave to McCrory or lawmakers who voted for HB2. ‘Multiple interests’ The PAC for Merck, which has two state manufacturing facilities, gave McCrory and GOP lawmakers at least $41,000. Chairman and CEO Kenneth Frazier signed the HRC’s letter protesting HB2. “Our company is committed to participating constructively and responsibly in the political process,” Merck spokeswoman Lanie Keller said in a statement. “The PAC supports legislators from both major parties who understand and appreciate the work we do … “Our chairman and CEO … joined corporate leaders across the country in signing open letters that urge lawmakers in North Carolina to repeal HB2, because it sanctions discriminatory practices.” The Observer also looked at contributions through September from employees of the roughly 185 companies that publicly denounced HB2. Workers for at least 33 companies donated to North Carolina’s Republican Party or party leaders after the bill was signed. McCrory received more than $54,000, the Observer found. Employees making donations ranged from secretaries and accountants to professors and social workers. Some were retired. Workers at 65 of the companies gave to Cooper or the Democratic Party. Cooper received some $313,000 and the party, $344,000. Individuals give money for reasons of their own, including their party affiliation. Companies also give for a variety of reasons. For many it’s access. Campaign contributions typically flow to those in positions of power. “(Companies) have multiple interests,” said Eric Heberlig, a political scientist at UNC Charlotte. “If they think Republicans are going to be more helpful to them on taxes or regulations they still have an incentive to support them, even if they disagree on social issues or things like HB2.” HB2 has been blamed for the loss of jobs, sporting events and millions in lost visitor spending. Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality NC, said companies and their PACs should see the law as an economic issue. “Doing business in a state like North Carolina is that much harder when candidates actively work against LGBT equality,” he said. Staff writer Deon Roberts contributed. Contributions Some PACs whose affiliated companies publicly opposed HB2 contributed to N.C. Republican lawmakers who passed it and to former Gov. Pat McCrory. Here are some, along with company executives who signed an open letter from the Human Rights Campaign protesting the law.

Soon, everyone else will get a chance. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jan 9, 2017 at 8:22AM You might be too busy to pay much attention to every tiny biotech that goes public. There's one initial public offering (IPO) coming up, though, that I think you'll want to keep your eyes on. Jounce Therapeutics filed a few days ago for an IPO in 2017. Any company that Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) is willing to invest in big-time is one that is worth watching.  Image source: Getty Images. What Celgene liked Jounce has a grand total of one candidate in clinical testing -- experimental cancer drug JTX-2011. And it's only in early-stage development. JTX-2011 has enough potential, though, that Celgene paid the small biotech $225 million up front and bought a $36 million stake in the company. The deal also includes an option for Celgene to license up to four other immunotherapies. What's the attraction for JTX-2011? It's a monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates a protein known as ICOS (which is a lot easier to say than its full name -- inducible T-cell co-stimulator). ICOS is found on the surface of white blood cells produced or processed by the thymus gland (called T cells) that are found in many solid tumors. Jounce thinks that JTX-2011 can amplify the immune response in "good" T cells within a tumor while reducing the number of "bad" T cells. This double whammy just might prove effective at fighting cancer. In pre-clinical testing, Jounce found that JTX-2011 stimulates a significant T cell immune response against solid tumors. The biotech currently has a phase 1/2 clinical study in progress with safety data expected in the first half of 2017 and preliminary efficacy data in the second half of the year. For precision medicines like Jounce's JTX-2011 to be most effective, the patients that can benefit from the drugs need to first be identified. Celgene really liked that Jounce has a way to prioritize targets and potential predictive biomarkers to match the right therapy to the right patients. Jounce calls its approach for accomplishing this its "Translational Science Platform." This platform allows the biotech to profile the immune cellular and molecular characteristics of human solid tumors. The biotech thinks that this biomarker-driven approach will ultimately enable it to develop companion diagnostics for its therapies. Combinations on the way Jounce's clinical study is evaluating JTX-2011 as a stand-alone treatment and in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) Opdivo. Jounce also has plans to test its lead candidate with its own anti-PD-1 antibody, JTX-4014, at some point down the road. JTX-4014 is currently in pre-clinical testing. While JTX-2011 is only being evaluated in combination with Opdivo right now, there's no reason to think Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug is the only potential combo partner. Jounce stated in its IPO filing that it intends to explore use of JTX-2011 in combination with "other future product candidates." I'd put Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda high on the list. Keytruda has already demonstrated better efficacy than Opdivo as a first-line treatment of lung cancer in clinical studies. Merck is moving ahead with clinical studies of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy and several other drugs. JTX-2011 should be a good fit as well. A good bet? There's an old saying that you don't bet on the horse -- you bet on the jockey. In Jounce's case, I'd say the horse and the jockey(s) could be good bets.  One of Jounce's founders is James Allison. Dr. Allison is currently chairman of immunology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the leading cancer research centers in the world. He was one of the first scientists to identify the T cell receptor and is recognized as one of the pioneers of cancer immunotherapy. Allison's research helped lead to the development of Bristol-Myers Squibb's blockbuster CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor Yervoy. The company's CEO, Richard Murray, came from Merck. Murray most recently served as Merck's senior vice president of biologics and vaccine research. Chief scientific officer Deborah Law also came from Merck, where she served as vice president of therapy area biology for immunology, oncology, and immunomodulators. It wouldn't be surprising if those Merck connections help open doors for combo studies with Keytruda. Jounce's IPO hopes to raise $75 million. That shouldn't be hard to do. The biotech already has over $271 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, boosted largely by the Celgene deal. If there's one biotech IPO to watch in 2017, I think Jounce is it.  Keith Speights owns shares of Celgene. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Celgene.

Note that taken together, results from two trials failed to make a case for further investigation of cetuximab in combination with chemoradiation for anal cancer, according to the authors of an accompanying editorial. Patients with high-risk squamous cell anal cancer had a moderate reduction in locoregional failure but a substantial increase in toxicity with the addition of cetuximab (Erbitux) to standard chemoradiation, a multicenter clinical trial showed. A fourth of patients had locoregional failure at 3 years, as compared with an expected rate of 35% derived from historical data. A third of the 61 patients had grade 4 toxicity, and three treatment-related deaths occurred, reported Joseph A. Sparano, MD, of Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, and colleagues. "Although these findings suggest that the addition of cetuximab to chemoradiation therapy for anal cancer may reduce locoregional failure rates, toxicity was substantial, and locoregional failure still occurs in approximately 20%, indicating the continued need for more effective and less toxic therapies," they wrote online in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. "Although cetuximab improved clinical outcomes when added to radiation therapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, similar benefit was not observed when cetuximab was added to cisplatin plus radiation therapy in this population, suggesting that the evaluation of cetuximab plus radiation therapy without chemotherapy may also be considered an option in future trials." A small multicenter trial of patients with HIV-associated anal cancer, conducted by Sparano, Madhur Garg, MD, also of Montefiore, and colleagues, demonstrated a 3-year locoregional failure rate of 42% with the addition of cetuximab to chemoradiation, and a fourth of the patients had grade 4 toxicity. Taken together, the two trials failed to make a case for further investigation of cetuximab in combination with chemoradiation for anal cancer, according to the authors of an accompanying editorial, who also noted that chemoradiation is not standard of care for anal cancer. "The toxicity and 5% death rate in both studies will deter both wider adoption and further testing in larger phase III trials, despite the modestly encouraging locoregional failure rate," said Rob Glynne-Jones, MD, and Mark Harrison, MD, of the Center for Cancer Treatment and Mount Vernon Hospital in Northwood, England. "Future trials should be specifically designed for patients with both human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative and HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the anus, stratified according to smoking habit and different TNM staging, and ideally should have different therapeutic goals," Glynne-Jones and Harrison added. "Successful validation of these approaches will allow for more effective selection of individualized treatment of patients, in both the context of routine care and clinical trials." Sphincter-sparing definitive chemoradiation offers a potential to cure squamous cell anal cancer. However, about a third of patients have locoregional failure, which is associated with significant morbidity, risk of distant recurrence, and mortality, the authors noted. The rationale for evaluating cetuximab in anal cancer came from observations that the EGFR inhibitor enhances radiation therapy activity in HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. About two-thirds of anal cancers occur in HPV-positive individuals. Sparano's group reported findings from a phase II cooperative group trial involving immunocompetent patients with stage I-III squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal. After accrual of 28 patients, investigators revised eligibility criteria to limit enrollment to patients with high-risk stage II, IIIA, or IIIB disease. The trial had a primary objective of locoregional failure, and investigators hypothesized that the addition of cetuximab would reduce the failure rate at 3 years by 50% as compared with a historical 3-year locoregional failure rate of 35%. Two-thirds of the patients had stage III disease, and most had other high-risk features. Women accounted for 80% of the study population. The results showed a 3-year locoregional failure rate of 23% (95% CI 13-36%, P=0.03) by binomial proportional estimate, using the prespecified endpoint. A post hoc Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded an estimated 3-year locoregional failure rate of 21%. The progression-free and overall survival at 3 years were 68% and 83%, respectively. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events among 62 patients who received at least one dose of treatment were diarrhea (68%, all grade 3), neutropenia (50%, 24% grade 4), nausea (32%), dehydration (32%, all grade 4), and hypokalemia (24%). The type and frequency of adverse events were generally similar between the first 28 patients and the 34 enrolled after the modification of eligibility criteria. The trial of HIV-associated anal cancer involved 45 patients with stage I-III disease. All patients received cetuximab concurrently with cisplatin-fluorouracil chemotherapy, along with irradiation of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes. As in the trial of immunocompetent patients, investigators hypothesized that the addition of cetuximab would reduce locoregional failure by 50% at 3 years. The binomial proportional estimate of locoregional failure was 42%. Post hoc Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded a 3-year estimate of 20%. In addition to a 26% incidence of grade 4 toxicity, two (4%) treatment-related deaths occurred. The study of by Garg's group was supported by the National Cancer Institute and the NIH.

And in 2016, only 36 biotech and pharmaceutical companies went public in the U.S., compared with 68 in 2015 and a record 85 in 2014. The long drought comes ahead of the health care industry’s biggest gathering of companies and investors, the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, which began Monday. The week before the massive conference typically serves as a launchpad for fresh offerings. This year? Nothing. “Biotech had a difficult year generally from a performance perspective, and so a bunch of the generalists have exited the market and money’s become much tighter,” said Bryan Roberts, a partner at Venrock, a technology and health care venture capital firm with about $3.1 billion under management. “When people’s comfort with risk goes down, IPOs are one of the first things to fall off the edge of the cliff.” There are several reasons at play. The market has been in a slump: The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index of 164 companies was down 22 percent in 2016, the first yearlong losing streak since 2008 and the worst year since 2002. And with a new president taking office and promising to cut taxes and overhaul the health care system, bankers and investors may be choosing to wait and see. “I think in the 2014 to 2015 period we were a bit spoiled as an industry,” said David Sabow, a managing director at Silicon Valley Bank. “After two consecutive years of a very liquid market, we thought that may be the new normal, but 2016 showed us that was not the case.” Only $444.1 million was raised in U.S.-listed biotechnology and pharmaceutical IPOs during the fourth quarter of 2016 and seven companies went public, according to Bloomberg data. In 2016, seven U.S. biotechnology and drug companies announced their intent to go public in the first eight days of the year. Not a single one has raised their hand so far this January. Bruce Booth, a partner at investment firm Atlas Venture, said he’s not worried about that holdup. “If the ‘new normal’ is a steady flow of 25-plus biotech IPOs each year, that would be a sign of a very healthy, maturing sector,” Booth said. “We should start to see a few IPOs by the end of January or early February. I’d anticipate four to five of them by the end of February.” Booth’s fund, which manages around $700 million, has investments in gene-editing firm Intellia Therapeutics Inc. and cancer drugmaker Unum Therapeutics Inc. There could also be a pickup thanks to the broader stock market surge that has followed President-elect Donald Trump’s election victory. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is up 6.4 percent since the Nov. 8 election day. “CEO confidence is a critical factor in driving M&A,” said Richard Landgarten, Barclays PLC’s head of health care and real estate banking. “Right now they feel good about the stock market broadly and, for example, the potential for pro-business tax reform from the new administration.” Several biotech names have been floated for 2017 IPOs, including Jounce Therapeutics and Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, which have announced their intention to go public in the coming year without giving an exact date. IPOs could also be prodded if takeovers increase in the industry. Big drugmakers have been sitting on cash left overseas, waiting on potential tax reform from Trump and Republicans in Congress. They’ve promised to lower rates, which could help repatriate $98 billion of overseas cash among large pharmaceutical companies, according to Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford. Johnson & Johnson has about $40 billion overseas, followed by Merck & Co. with about $20 billion, then Pfizer with nearly $15 billion, according Holford’s Nov. 9 note to clients. Some of that money will stay invested abroad, and the rest could be brought back for potential acquisitions. “The smartest money in this space is watching the first 100 days” of the Trump administration, said Sabow. Andy Weisenfeld, a partner at health care investment banking firm MTS Health Partners LP, said he expects 2017 to be similar to 2016, with drugmakers letting smaller biotechs take the risks of research and development, then stepping in to snap up experimental products once they’ve proved themselves. “Prices for the better targets might go up, but if something hasn’t been de-risked, I think for the most part these companies would rather pay more and have it de-risked than pay real money and have it fail,” Weisenfeld said.

The financial sector fell 0.8 percent today. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. ASSOCIATED PRESS THE BLADE Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 today and helped stall the Dow's pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P's energy sector dropped 1.5 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. THE BLADE Enlarge | Buy This Image RELATED: Searchable stock index Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. “People are waiting for more information. We're waiting for political news, we're waiting for earnings. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we'll see some movement,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector fell 0.8 percent today. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “There is some hope we'll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first," said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs’ 0.8 percent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine's 0.9 percent drop and Exxon Mobil's 1.7 percent decline. The Dow had come tantalizingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. “Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when,” said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 percent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 percent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 percent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P's health sector was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq's biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals, which closed up 72.9 percent on a $5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 percent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug program with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges today compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

According to an Onvia press release, Mann will help accelerate the company’s growth in the coming years. “With the improved domestic economy and the incoming administration’s focus on accelerated infrastructure spending, Onvia is truly poised to expand its growth and leadership at the core of this B2G market,” D. Van Skilling, Chairman of Onvia’s Board of Directors, said in a press release. “With Russ at the helm, Onvia’s next years will be extraordinary.” Mann’s resume includes his previous position as CMO and senior vice president of e-commerce at Bellevue, Wash., based Outerwall as well as one year as the CMO of workplace automation company Nintex.

I’m excited to join Tableau on its mission.” “I’m delighted that Hilarie is joining Tableau on our mission to help people see and understand data,” Adam Selipsky, President and CEO at Tableau, said in the release. “Hilarie’s sales and marketing experience at leading SaaS companies and experience in bringing analytics technologies to IT markets will be great assets for Tableau as we work to bring data to more people at organizations all over the world.” Richard Henriques.

He is currently a senior fellow at the Center for High Impact Philanthropy and Wharton Social Impact at the University of Pennsylvania. Nativis’ technology uses ultra- low radio frequency energy to stimulate a cell’s metabolic pathways, which could potentially be used as a drug- and radiation-free therapy for cancers, among other diseases. The company is currently testing the device in brain cancer patients. “It is an honor to join Nativis’ diverse board of scientific and executive leaders. I believe that the company’s technology presents a unique opportunity for the treatment of cancers and other serious diseases,” Henriques said in a statement. “As the company advances and further develops its technology, I look forward to leveraging my experience from the Gates Foundation and Merck to help guide Nativis to a successful future.” David McShea.

These types of organizations exist for start-ups, but are few and far between for entrepreneurs who face common issues related to leading and growing their businesses.” Clare McGrane is a GeekWire reporter who covers life sciences, biotechnology and general assignment technology stories, in addition to producing the GeekWire radio show and podcast.

This report list all the medicine in clinical trial and their design and the population recruited.     Spread the Word Listed Under Tags: • Global Essential Oil Market • Pure Essential Oils • World Essential Oils Industry: • Medical Location: • Mumbai - Maharashtra - India Subject: • ReportsMUMBAI, India - Jan. 10, 2017 - PRLog -- Sales of Hepatitis C crossed ~$10bn in 2014 proving that treatments for liver disease could become mega-blockbusters and Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH) is expected to be equally lucrative. Improved diagnosis rate and change in treatment guidelines along with defined clinical trials endpoint are the concerns for the emerging therapy. US FDA is expected to release guidelines for the clinical trial in CY16 and this should accelerate the development of the targeting NASH. NASH is the progressive form of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease – NAFLD. While NASH can reverse itself, in many cases, the resulting liver scarring causes a patient's liver to harden and failure to work properly. It is estimated that NASH affects 2 to 5% of the US population. Other developed countries such as Europe and Japan also have similar or higher incidence of NASH disease. Due to the varying physical and metabolism traits across various geographies, development  for Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis(NASH) is facing difficulty. In Japan, the prevalence of NASH is rising although the population is not typically overweight. Countries like India and China with bigger population and changes in lifestyles face a greater risk of NASH along with other lifestyle diseases like Diabetes and Cardiovascular related complexities. As per the US Association of Liver Disease, of those who develop NASH, ~15-25% will progress to end stage liver disease (ESLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over 10-20 years. Today, 1/3rd of Liver transplants and HCC are caused by NASH and the total cost burden of this on US is over ~$5 billion per year.

REUTERS/Andrew KellyMore By Sinead Carew (Reuters) - Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow's pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P's energy sector <.SPNY> dropped 1.5 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. [O/R] Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. "People are waiting for more information. We're waiting for political news, we're waiting for earnings. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we'll see some movement," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector <.SPSY> fell 0.8 percent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is some hope we'll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first," said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs' 0.8 percent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine's 0.9 percent drop and Exxon Mobil's 1.7 percent decline. The Dow had come tantalisingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 percent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 <.SPX> had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 percent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 percent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P's health sector <.SPXHC> was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance.

Home Industry Morgan Stanley rates Sun Pharmaceutical Industries ‘Equal-Weight’ Morgan Stanley rates Sun Pharmaceutical Industries ‘Equal-Weight’ Sun announced that its NCE drug Seciera has met phase 3 primary and secondary endpoints (in a study of 744 dry eye patients). By: Morgan Stanley | Published: January 10, 2017 6:09 AM Sun continues to bolster its specialty pipeline—Tildrakizumab (Merck), Odomzo (Novartis), MM-II (Moebius), Seciera (Ocular), Elepsia/Xelpros (SPARC), BromSite/DexaSite (Insite), Absorica (Ranbaxy), and Dusa drug products. Sun announced that its NCE drug Seciera has met phase 3 primary and secondary endpoints (in a study of 744 dry eye patients). Seciera is a patented, novel, clear, preservative-free, aqueous solution. Seciera is being developed by Ocular Technologies, a company recently acquired by Sun. It agreed to pay $40 million upfront, plus contingent development milestones and sales milestones as well as tiered royalties on sales of Seciera. Sun aims to commercialise this product in global markets including the US, Europe, and Japan, as well as several emerging markets. Clinical differentiation: The company has not yet disclosed the Phase III trials data (plus, it was not a head-to-head trial versus Restasis). Therefore, it is difficult to assess the medical benefits versus available drug options. However, according to Sun, Seciera is differentiated by early demonstration of efficacy (12 weeks) versus other approved dry eye drugs in the same class. We note that Xiidra has a faster onset of action (roughly 2 weeks, according to Shire). After 12 weeks of treatment, Seciera showed statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, Schirmer’s score (a measurement of tear production) (p<0.0001). Adverse events reported in the trial were mild to moderate in nature and similar to those of other approved drugs in the category. Sun will continue to analyse the data and present findings at upcoming medical conferences. Roadmap ahead: Sun plans to discuss the Phase III data with the FDA to assess if more clinical work is required for this product. To note, historically, a few drug candidates have been discontinued in the regulatory pathway because data were insufficient to convince the FDA. Assuming all goes well for Sun, the company could file an NDA for Seciera in FY18 and launch the product in FY19. Sales ramp-up could take 2-3 years. In addition, based on clinical trials.gov, it is conducting more clinical studies. Completion is expected in June 2017. According to management, the global dry eye market is estimated to reach $5 bn by 2020. Our View: Sun continues to bolster its specialty pipeline—Tildrakizumab (Merck), Odomzo (Novartis), MM-II (Moebius), Seciera (Ocular), Elepsia/Xelpros (SPARC), BromSite/DexaSite (Insite), Absorica (Ranbaxy), and Dusa drug products. We remain EW on Sun in view of a slow earnings ramp-up (as gGleevec erodes and competitive intensity rises for the Taro portfolio), distant and modest upside from upcoming specialty portfolio, and full valuation. You May Also Want To Watch: Valuation methodology: Our price target of R762 is our base case scenario value, derived by applying a target multiple of 20x (~5%-10% discount to the large-cap industry average P/E) to our September 2018 EPS estimate of R38.1. This is in view of higher single-product profit concentration and slower base business sales growth progression due to US approval delays. We cite the following reasons to support our 20x target multiple: (i) FDA issuance of a warning letter at the Halol plant, leading to delay in new product approval. There could also be collateral damage in terms of brand equity with various stakeholders including customers in the US. (ii) Delay in the evolution of specialty business, especially the two lead candidates from SPARC (Elepsia XL and Xelpros) which are filed from Halol. (iii) Loss of some opportunities in the US due to now delayed ANDA approvals. (iv) Higher single-product dependence for near-term earnings growth. The aforementioned we cite versus (i) Solid base business, especially its domestic market leadership in chronic ailment therapies. This is being replicated in other emerging markets. (ii) Longer-term mid-teens US growth outlook driven by its portfolio of ~160 ANDAs pending FDA approval. (iii) New growth levers—SPARC, specialty products, Ranbaxy synergies, MK-3222. (iv) Sizable and growing net cash on the balance sheet, which could unlock value via inorganic means. (v) Deepening leadership team (Israel Makov, Kal Sundaram), which underlines Sun’s aspirations to continue to grow globally and profitably. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Reuters Published Monday, Jan. 09, 2017 4:14PM EST Last updated Monday, Jan. 09, 2017 5:15PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s benchmark stock index finished lower on Monday as energy stocks fell with tumbling oil prices, and financial, telecom and industrial stocks also weighed on the market. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index ended down 107.10 points, or 0.69 per cent, at 15,388.95. Two stocks declined for every gainer. The most influential movers on the index included some of its biggest oil and gas producers, with the energy group down 2.5 per cent overall as oil prices fell on fears that record Iraqi crude exports and growing U.S. output could undermine OPEC’s efforts to reduce supply. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd fell 3.1 per cent to C$41.82, and Suncor Energy Inc lost 1.4 per cent to C$43.49. Seven Generations Energy slumped 9.1 per cent to C$27.06 after reporting lower-than-expected production in the fourth quarter. “A lot of momentum was in that name. ... It was really being pushed in the broker channels. It probably ran a little bit ahead of itself,” said Bryden Teich, a portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management. The financials group, which accounts for 35 per cent of the index weight, lost 0.5 per cent, with Brookfield Asset Management Inc off 1.3 per cent at C$43.56 and insurer Sun Life Financial Inc down 1.5 per cent at C$51.46. Industrials and telecoms both lost 0.8 per cent. On the positive side, Quebecor Inc rose 2 per cent to C$38.12 and Shaw Communications Inc added 1.9 per cent to C$22.77 after RBC upgraded its view of the two cable companies’ stock. RBC also raised its view on exchange operator TMX Group Ltd , while downgrading telecom companies Rogers Communications Inc and BCE Inc as well as mortgage lender Home Capital Group Inc. TMX advanced 3.5 per cent to C$75.60, Rogers declined 1.5 per cent to C$51.40, BCE lost 1.1 per cent to C$57.94, and Home Capital shed 2.4 per cent to C$30.54. Canadian companies are more optimistic about sales as demand picks up and they plan to boost investment and hiring, but businesses are uncertain about U.S. protectionism, and the labor market shows signs of substantial slack, the Bank of Canada said on Monday. Oil drop stymies Dow’s march to 20,000; health stocks boost Nasdaq Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow ‘s pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P’s energy sector dropped 1.5 per cent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 per cent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. “People are waiting for more information. We’re waiting for political news, we’re waiting for earnings. There’s a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we’ll see some movement,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector fell 0.8 per cent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 per cent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 per cent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “There is some hope we’ll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first,” said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs’ 0.8 per cent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine’s 0.9 per cent drop and Exxon Mobil’s 1.7 per cent decline. The Dow had come tantalizingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. “Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when,” said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 per cent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P’s health sector was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. <MRK. N> the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq’s biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals, which closed up 72.9 per cent on a $5.20-billion buyout deal with Japan’s Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 per cent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug program with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Petroleum-linked shares tumbled on Monday (Jan 9) on lower oil prices as the Dow pulled back from its campaign to hit 20,000 points. US stocks opened the week on a generally downcast note, with the Nasdaq edging up, but the Dow and S&P 500 retreating. "I think that people are having a hard time justifying going dramatically above 20,000 in the Dow because of what it would represent in terms of valuation," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 76.42 points (0.38 per cent) to close at 19,887.38. The broad-based S&P 500 fell 8.08 points (0.35 per cent) to 2,268,90, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index rose 10.76 points (0.19 per cent) to 5,531.82, a new closing record. Petroleum-oriented companies ExxonMobil, Halliburton and Apache all lost one per cent or more as oil prices fell sharply on questions about the effectiveness of an OPEC deal to cut output. Pharmaceutical stocks mostly pushed higher, with Merck, Amgen and Mylan all climbing by more than one percent. Utility company Entergy shed 2.9 per cent after it announced a deal with state officials to close the Indian Point nuclear power plant near New York. The company will take a US$2.4 billion charge in the fourth-quarter due to the move. Veterinary and pet-care company VCA surged 28.3 per cent after it announced a deal to be acquired by privately-held Mars for US$9.1 billion. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter “Biotech had a difficult year generally from a performance perspective, and so a bunch of the generalists have exited the market and money’s become much tighter,” said Bryan Roberts, a partner at Venrock, a technology and health-care venture capital firm with about $3.1 billion under management. “When people’s comfort with risk goes down, IPOs are one of the first things to fall off the edge of the cliff.” There are several reasons at play. The market has been in a slump: the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index of 164 companies was down 22 percent in 2016, the first yearlong losing streak since 2008 and the worst year since 2002. And with a new president taking office and promising to cut taxes and overhaul the health-care system, bankers and investors may be choosing to wait and see. ‘A Bit Spoiled’ “I think in the 2014 to 2015 period we were a bit spoiled as an industry,” said David Sabow, a managing director at Silicon Valley Bank. “After two consecutive years of a very liquid market, we thought that may be the new normal, but 2016 showed us that was not the case.” Only $444.1 million was raised in U.S.-listed biotechnology and pharmaceutical IPOs during the fourth quarter of 2016 as seven companies went public, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In 2016, seven U.S. biotechnology and drug companies announced their intent to go public in the first eight days of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Not a single one has raised their hand so far this January. Bruce Booth, a partner at investment firm Atlas Venture, said he’s not worried about that holdup. “If the ‘new normal’ is a steady flow of 25-plus biotech IPOs each year, that would be a sign of a very healthy, maturing sector,” Booth said. “We should start to see a few IPOs by end of January or early February. I’d anticipate four to five of them by the end of February.” Booth’s fund, which manages around $700 million, has investments in gene editing firm Intellia Therapeutics Inc. and cancer drugmaker Unum Therapeutics Inc. Trump Bump There could also be a pickup thanks to the broader stock market surge that has followed President-elect Donald Trump’s election victory. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is up 6.4 percent since the Nov. 8 election day. “CEO confidence is a critical factor in driving M&A,” said Richard Landgarten, Barclays Plc’s head of health-care and real estate banking. “Right now they feel good about the stock market broadly and, for example, the potential for pro-business tax reform from the new administration.” Several biotech names have been floated for 2017 IPOs, including Jounce Therapeutics and Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, which have announced their intention to go public in the coming year without giving an exact date. IPOs could also be prodded if takeovers increase in the industry. Big drugmakers have been sitting on cash left overseas, waiting on potential tax reform from Trump and Republicans in Congress. They’ve promised to lower rates, which could help repatriate $98 billion of overseas cash among large pharma companies, according to Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford. Cash Waiting Johnson & Johnson has about $40 billion overseas, followed by Merck & Co. with about $20 billion, then Pfizer with nearly $15 billion, according Holford’s Nov. 9 note to clients. Some of that money will stay invested abroad and the rest could be brought back for potential acquisitions. “The smartest money in this space is watching the first 100 days” of the Trump administration, said Sabow. Andy Weisenfeld, a partner at health-care investment banking firm MTS Health Partners LP, said he expects 2017 to be similar to 2016, with drugmakers letting smaller biotechs take the risks of research and development, then stepping in to snap experimental products once they’ve proven themselves. “Prices for the better targets might go up, but if something hasn’t been de-risked, I think for the most part these companies would rather pay more and have it de-risked then pay real money and have it fail,” Weisenfeld said.

The A-Z of investments in 2016 JSE can benefit from curb in Zuma's power - money managers   Francisco - Moderna Therapeutics, one of the best-funded private biotechnology companies in the US, unveiled its long-secret research and development pipeline on Monday, including experimental vaccines, cancer treatments and a cardiovascular therapy. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based start-up has about $1.3bn in cash on hand from investors, pharmaceutical partners and government grants, according to a presentation on Monday at the JP Morgan Chase & Company. Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. It’s privately valued at about $5bn, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the matter wasn’t public. Moderna’s treatments are based around the idea of using genetic instructions to turn a patient’s own cells into miniature drug making factories. Given by injection or intravenously, the therapies encode fragments of genetic instruction using what’s known as messenger RNA. That code then instructs cells to make proteins to fight a disease or infection. Part of investors’ interest is the potential at Moderna and companies like it to create a whole new industry of drugs using the techniques. The company’s unveiling comes at a time of great excitement - and caution - in the sector. Venture investors have put more than $1.5bn every quarter into biotech start-ups since the end of 2014, according to data compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Yet the industry has faced criticism over how new treatments are priced, and skepticism of breakthrough claims has risen following the discrediting of medical diagnostics company Theranos. Easier, cheaper Messenger RNA is relatively quick to create and can be easily mass-produced, and the hope is that mRNA therapies will be faster, cheaper alternatives to traditional biotechnology drugs, which are typically grown in labs or harvested from living organisms. "It’s almost plug-and-play," said Rick Bright, director of the US government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, also known as BARDA. The agency, which develops countermeasures to bioterrorism, gave Moderna funding because it sees the platform as potentially being a fast responder in an emergency situation. “All you need is a sequence from a part of the virus you want to make, drop it into the basic machinery, and you could rapidly have dozens of vaccines,” Bright said. High promise It sounds simple, but to succeed Moderna will have to demonstrate that it can accurately target specific cells in different organs in the body. Moderna is working on the eye, lungs, joints and even the brain, said chief executive officer Stephane Bancel, though those programs are still in early research stages.   The company, which was was created in part by venture capital firm Flagship Pioneering, has financing to cover "three to four years" of operations and won’t seek an initial public offering this year, Bancel said. Its most advanced assets are for two strains of flu, H10N8 and H7N9, and the treatments are in early-stage human studies, the company said Monday. Both strains have barely affected humans at this point, but they have pandemic potential. "It’d be nice to have one ready to go," said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Normally, however, pharmaceutical companies don’t prepare vaccines ahead of time because there isn’t a market for them. "I’m not sure what their business plan would be," he said. Bancel said they picked the two influenzas because they’re good proof-of-concept cases with clear paths to approval by drug regulators. The company says it’s also working on vaccines for Zika, Chikungunya, human metapneumovirus and cytomegalovirus. Zika effort BARDA is backing a Zika vaccine the company is developing and Bright said he’s enthusiastic, but cautious about the potential. "There is no major safety concern," he said, "but because we have limited experience, we have to tread cautiously with the unknown." In cancer, Moderna has a previously disclosed collaboration with Merck & Company to develop personalized cancer vaccines. On Monday, it revealed two additional targets that are meant to help a patient’s immune system attack tumors, which often have developed ways of evading the body’s defences. The two targets are known as OX40L and IL-12. "The IL-12 can turn a cold tumour hot, and the OX40L decorates the tumour like a Christmas tree," said Bancel, making them vulnerable to attack. None of the cancer treatments have started human studies. Finally, Moderna is collaborating with London pharma giant AstraZeneca to develop an injection intended to stimulate blood vessel creation and improve blood supply in patients who have suffered heart failure or a heart attack. That program has started its first study in humans.Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Follow Fin24 on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Oil drop stymies Dow’s march to 20,000; health stocks boost Nasdaq Reuters comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Jan 9:   Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow’s pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected US policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P’s energy sector dropped 1.5 per cent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and US output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the January 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 per cent since the November 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. “People are waiting for more information. We’re waiting for political news, we’re waiting for earnings. There’s a lot ofuncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we’ll see some movement,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector fell 0.8 per cent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 per cent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how US companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 per cent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “There is some hope we’ll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first,’’ said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs’ 0.8 per cent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine’s 0.9 per cent drop and Exxon Mobil’s 1.7 per cent decline. The Dow had come tantalisingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. “Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter ofif, but a matter of when,” said Matt Jones, US head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.42 points or 0.38 per cent at 19,887.38, the S&P 500 had lost 8.08 points or 0.354856 per cent to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.76 points or 0.19 per cent to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P’s health sector was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co., the leading boost, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the biggest percentage gainer, with a4.4 per cent jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq’s biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals, which closed up 72.9 per cent on a $5.20-billion buyout deal with Japan’s Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 per cent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug programme with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges on Monday compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.
