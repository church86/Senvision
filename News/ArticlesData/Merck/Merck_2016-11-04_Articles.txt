They won Best Trade Stand & The Innovation Award for Technology for Bovilis.ie 09:06 Friday 04 November 2016 0 Have your say A new web-based tool that enables veterinary practitioners to develop a customised vaccination calendar as part of the herd/flock health plans for their dairy, beef and sheep farmer clients has been developed by MSD Animal Health. Developed by Dr William Minchin, ruminants marketing manager and Sharon Magnier, veterinary advisor, with MSD Animal Health, the facility, which is the first of its kind, is available on the company’s dedicated animal health website www.bovilis.ie. Dr William Minchin MSD Animal Health receives the award for Best Trade Stand from Catriona Buckley of The Irish Examiner at the National Dairy Show 2016 held in Millstreet Co Cork Dr William Minchin said: “We believe this new facility will be of great assistance to vets and farmers in ensuring the most effective and compliant disease prevention strategies. “Many farmers forget to boost with vaccines or use products at inappropriate times for their production system. This web-based tool will ensure they have a permanent reminder of the critical dates for vaccinating against a broad range of cattle and sheep diseases.” How it works The new tool is very simple to use. All users are required to do is: Seamus Crowley (National Dairy Show), Minister Michael Creed (Department of Agriculture), Dr William Minchin MSD Animal Health, Catriona Buckley (Judge) The Irish Examiner, T J Duffy MSD Animal Health and Mrs Josephine Kiely (Judge) during the presentation of Best Trade Stand award at the National Dairy Show 2016 held in Millstreet Co Cork r Enter the farm enterprise information. r Select the diseases against which protection is required. r Provide the user’s contact details. Using a wide range of algorithms that are built into the facility, a customised calendar is then developed. Dr William Minchin (Marketing Manager MSD Animal Health), Fergal Morris (Ruminant Business Unit Director MSD Animal Health), Minister Michael Creed, Cara Sheridan (Veterinary Advisor MSD Animal Health), Mairead Pigott (President of Veterinary Ireland) and T J Duffy (Associate Product Manager MSD Animal Health) during the presentation of Best Stand Award at the National Dairy Show 2016 held in Millstreet Co Cork A text message is sent seven days before each vaccine booster is due. Where an email address is given in the contact details, a reminder email is also sent. The full calendar is also emailed to the user. This can be printed off and used as a reminder of the critical vaccination dates. There is no cost for the service. Jason Webb (National Dairy Show), Fergal Morris (MSD Animal Health), Seamus Maguire (MSD Animal Health), Dr William Minchin (MSD Animal Health), Niall ORegan (Innovation Awards Judge), T J Duffy (MSD Animal Health) and Cara Sheridan (MSD Animal Health) during the presentation for Innovation in Technology award which MSD Animal Health won for their new vaccination reminder service as a plug in tool on Bovilis.ie at the National Dairy Show 2016 held in Millstreet Co Cork While currently built for vaccines, the intention is to expand the tool for use in parasiticide treatments and routine farm husbandry. This innovation is part of a comprehensive campaign by MSD Animal Health to highlight the importance of disease prevention in order to enhance productivity in farming while also reducing antibiotic use in food producing animals. Use of vaccines to prevent disease has increased more than three-fold over the past decade and MSD is the largest supplier of preventative vaccines on the Irish market. With increasing numbers of farmers moving towards multiple disease prevention protocols, this new online tool will simplify routine vaccination, leading to healthier, more productive animals and more sustainable production systems.

ALSO READ Merck announces change in directorate Merck to hold board meeting Merck to hold board meeting Merck gains after good Q1 result Merck directors Brijesh Kapil and Ali Sleiman resign By Deena Beasley (Reuters) - Two prominent U.S. lawmakers on Thursday called on federal antitrust regulators to probe whether Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly and Co, Merck & Co Inc and Novo Nordisk A/S colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. The request by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings follows a similar letter they sent last fall calling for an investigation into 14 drug companies over price increases of generic drugs. U.S. prosecutors could file the first charges by the end of the year in their subsequent criminal investigation of generic drugmakers over suspected price collusion, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. (http://bloom.bg/2e6cZjF) A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. In their latest letter to the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, Sanders, an independent, and Cummings, a Democrat, raised questions about skyrocketing prices for insulin, and included a chart showing that many of the price spikes appeared to occur in tandem. They noted that the original patent on insulin, a hormone used by diabetics to control blood sugar levels, expired 75 years ago. Sanofi spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said in an emailed statement that "Sanofi sets the prices of our treatments independently." Novo Nordisk also said it sets prices "independently" and said it stands by its business practices. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company does not make insulin. Merck makes other products to treat diabetes. Eli Lilly, in an email, said it strongly disagrees with the accusations in the letter. "The insulin market in the U.S. is highly competitive," the pharmaceutical company said. Shares of several generic drugmakers fell on Thursday after the report of pending Justice Department charges. Mylan N.V. closed down 6.9 percent, Allergan Plc fell 4.5 percent and Endo International Plc dropped 19.5 percent. Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc Ltd, which recently acquired Allergan's generics business, fell 9.5 percent. "We do not think the major generic companies have likely participated in significant pricing collusion," A/B Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in a research note. Several generic drugmakers, including Mylan, Allergan, Endo and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, had previously disclosed that they were subpoenaed in connection with the antitrust investigation by the Justice Department. Bloomberg said the probe spans more than a dozen companies and about two dozen drugs, citing people familiar with the matter. Impax Laboratories Inc said earlier this year that the Justice Department had requested information on four drugs: blood pressure pill digoxin, asthma drug terbutaline sulfate, prilocaine/lidocaine cream and calcipotriene solution, which is used to treat psoriasis. A spokesman from Teva said the company "is not aware of any facts that would give rise to an exposure to the company with respect to these subpoenas." Officials at Endo and Lannett Company Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Aggressive drug pricing has come under intense scrutiny after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted her intent to tackle high prices last year. An August report from the Government Accountability Office found that more than 300 of 1,441 generic drugs analyzed had at least one price increase of 100 percent or more between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2015. In February, Sanders and Cummings asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' enforcement arm to investigate generic drug price increases. Recent price hikes that have drawn fire included Turing Pharmaceuticals' decision in 2015 to raise by 5,000 percent the price of a decades-old treatment for a dangerous parasitic infection. Generic drugmakers, possibly reacting to the political headwinds, reined in price hikes this year. Guggenheim Securities, citing polling of generic drugmakers, last month estimated that overall U.S. generic drug prices would dip by a percentage in the mid-single digits this year. The price erosion has been felt by drug wholesalers like McKesson Corp and Amerisource Bergen Corp, which rely on price fluctuations for part of their profit margins.

REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File PhotoMore By Deena Beasley (Reuters) - Two prominent U.S. lawmakers on Thursday called on federal antitrust regulators to probe whether Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly and Co, Merck & Co Inc and Novo Nordisk A/S colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. The request by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings follows a similar letter they sent last fall calling for an investigation into 14 drug companies over price increases of generic drugs. U.S. prosecutors could file the first charges by the end of the year in their subsequent criminal investigation of generic drugmakers over suspected price collusion, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. (http://bloom.bg/2e6cZjF) A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. In their latest letter to the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, Sanders, an independent, and Cummings, a Democrat, raised questions about skyrocketing prices for insulin, and included a chart showing that many of the price spikes appeared to occur in tandem. They noted that the original patent on insulin, a hormone used by diabetics to control blood sugar levels, expired 75 years ago. Sanofi spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said in an emailed statement that "Sanofi sets the prices of our treatments independently." Novo Nordisk also said it sets prices "independently" and said it stands by its business practices. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company does not make insulin. Merck makes other products to treat diabetes. Eli Lilly, in an email, said it strongly disagrees with the accusations in the letter. "The insulin market in the U.S. is highly competitive," the pharmaceutical company said. Shares of several generic drugmakers fell on Thursday after the report of pending Justice Department charges. Mylan N.V. closed down 6.9 percent, Allergan Plc fell 4.5 percent and Endo International Plc dropped 19.5 percent. Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc Ltd, which recently acquired Allergan's generics business, fell 9.5 percent. "We do not think the major generic companies have likely participated in significant pricing collusion," A/B Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in a research note. Several generic drugmakers, including Mylan, Allergan, Endo and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, had previously disclosed that they were subpoenaed in connection with the antitrust investigation by the Justice Department. Bloomberg said the probe spans more than a dozen companies and about two dozen drugs, citing people familiar with the matter. Impax Laboratories Inc said earlier this year that the Justice Department had requested information on four drugs: blood pressure pill digoxin, asthma drug terbutaline sulfate, prilocaine/lidocaine cream and calcipotriene solution, which is used to treat psoriasis. A spokesman from Teva said the company "is not aware of any facts that would give rise to an exposure to the company with respect to these subpoenas." Officials at Endo and Lannett Company Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Aggressive drug pricing has come under intense scrutiny after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted her intent to tackle high prices last year. An August report from the Government Accountability Office found that more than 300 of 1,441 generic drugs analyzed had at least one price increase of 100 percent or more between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2015. In February, Sanders and Cummings asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' enforcement arm to investigate generic drug price increases. Recent price hikes that have drawn fire included Turing Pharmaceuticals' decision in 2015 to raise by 5,000 percent the price of a decades-old treatment for a dangerous parasitic infection. Generic drugmakers, possibly reacting to the political headwinds, reined in price hikes this year. Guggenheim Securities, citing polling of generic drugmakers, last month estimated that overall U.S. generic drug prices would dip by a percentage in the mid-single digits this year. The price erosion has been felt by drug wholesalers like McKesson Corp and Amerisource Bergen Corp, which rely on price fluctuations for part of their profit margins.

"The ones that are really serious about research, they are going to pay off big time, very big," he said in an interview with "Power Lunch." Specifically, Merck has the right game plan and names like Amgen and Gilead Sciences have done well, although they've been hit recently, the Harvard Business School senior fellow and CNBC contributor noted. The industry has faced sharp criticism about its drug pricing practices. Notably, Mylan has faced Congressional scrutiny over the price hike on its anti-allergy device, EpiPen. Several other companies are under the microscope, as well. Getty Images This week, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings called on federal antitrust regulators to prove whether Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly, Merck and Novo Nordisk colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. The request follows a similar letter they sent last fall calling for an investigation into 14 drug companies over prices increases of generic drugs. The Department of Justice could file charges by the end of the year in its subsequent criminal investigation of generic drugmakers over suspected price collusion, according to Bloomberg. The uproar has taken its toll on the sector, with the key biotech ETF down more than 25 percent in 2016. George said the drug companies can't continually jack up prices and are not in business just to serve shareholders. They are in business to serve consumers, he noted. If they do that well, he believes profits will follow. "The key to making money in pharma is very straightforward," George said. "It is through innovation, through breakthroughs." David Maris, specialty pharmaceutical analyst with Wells Fargo, believes the pricing debate is only in its early stages. He agrees that collusion should certainly be addressed, and companies who raise prices too much should be looked at. However, Maris said the public should not lose sight of the fact that pharma is the best industry in America, employing 4.5 million people. "The pharmaceutical industry actually spends more in R&D than both the aerospace and the tech industry combined. So you go after these, what might happen is … fewer innovations," he told "Power Lunch." — Reuters contributed to this report.

Novo Nordisk also said it sets prices "independently" and said it stands by its business practices. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company does not make insulin. Merck makes other products to treat diabetes. Eli Lilly, in an email, said it strongly disagrees with the accusations in the letter. "The insulin market in the U.S. is highly competitive," the pharmaceutical company said. Shares of several generic drugmakers fell on Thursday after the report of pending Justice Department charges. Mylan N.V. closed down 6.9 percent, Allergan Plc fell 4.5 percent and Endo International Plc dropped 19.5 percent. Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc Ltd, which recently acquired Allergan's generics business, fell 9.5 percent. "We do not think the major generic companies have likely participated in significant pricing collusion," A/B Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in a research note. Several generic drugmakers, including Mylan, Allergan, Endo and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, had previously disclosed that they were subpoenaed in connection with the antitrust investigation by the Justice Department. Bloomberg said the probe spans more than a dozen companies and about two dozen drugs, citing people familiar with the matter. Impax Laboratories Inc said earlier this year that the Justice Department had requested information on four drugs: blood pressure pill digoxin, asthma drug terbutaline sulfate, prilocaine/lidocaine cream and calcipotriene solution, which is used to treat psoriasis. A spokesman from Teva said the company "is not aware of any facts that would give rise to an exposure to the company with respect to these subpoenas." Officials at Endo and Lannett Company Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Aggressive drug pricing has come under intense scrutiny after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted her intent to tackle high prices last year. An August report from the Government Accountability Office found that more than 300 of 1,441 generic drugs analyzed had at least one price increase of 100 percent or more between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2015. In February, Sanders and Cummings asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' enforcement arm to investigate generic drug price increases. Recent price hikes that have drawn fire included Turing Pharmaceuticals' decision in 2015 to raise by 5,000 percent the price of a decades-old treatment for a dangerous parasitic infection. Generic drugmakers, possibly reacting to the political headwinds, reined in price hikes this year. Guggenheim Securities, citing polling of generic drugmakers, last month estimated that overall U.S. generic drug prices would dip by a percentage in the mid-single digits this year. The price erosion has been felt by drug wholesalers like McKesson Corp and Amerisource Bergen Corp, which rely on price fluctuations for part of their profit margins.

Nigeria’s federal health officials joined local dignitaries and officers of The Carter Center and other organizations in Gidan Gimba, Karu LGA, Nasarawa State, Nigeria, to celebrate the achievement. The observance was held in Nigeria because 42 percent of the Carter Center-assisted treatments have been administered through numerous Center health programs there. The next largest number of NTD drugs has been distributed in Ethiopia, to combat trachoma, river blindness, and lymphatic filariasis. "The Carter Center health programs have pioneered eradication, elimination, and control of neglected tropical diseases for more than a quarter-century," said Ambassador (ret.) Mary Ann Peters, the Carter Center’s chief executive officer. “We have seen, time and again, that people at the grass-roots level can improve their own lives dramatically when they have access to the appropriate tools and knowledge. Among the most important of these tools are safe and effective donated medicines, together with health education and community ownership of the distribution process.” Founded by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, The Carter Center partners with ministries of health and community volunteers to distribute medication and health education aimed at eliminating river blindness, blinding trachoma, and lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), and controlling schistosomiasis and intestinal worms. Nigeria’s Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health, Mrs. Binda Adamu Bello, welcomed Peters, along with Dr. Dean Sienko, the Center’s vice president of health programs; Dr. Frank Richards, director of the Center’s river blindness, lymphatic filariasis, and schistosomiasis programs; Craig Withers, senior director of international support; and Dr. Emmanuel Miri, Nigeria country representative for The Carter Center. Also on hand for the celebration were former Nigeria Head of State General Yakubu Gowon; Sir Emeka Offor, Founder of the Sir Emeka Offor Foundation and Carter Center’s Special Emissary for River Blindness; former ambassador Howard Jeter; Ben Nwobi, resident program advisor for RTI International and the USAID’s ENVISION project in Nigeria; Michael T. Harvey, USAID mission director; Dr. Rex Mpazanje, acting World Health Organization country representative; and Chris Ogoshi, NGDO Coalition Chairman. “The Federal Ministry of Health is pleased to be part of this celebration of our long and successful partnership with The Carter Center,” Bello said. “The whole of Nigeria’s productivity is affected when some suffer. The people of Nigeria deserve the best health possible and, together with the villages and our other faithful partners, we are achieving it.” To commemorate the half-billion treatments with which The Carter Center has assisted, Bello administered a dose of ivermectin, used to treat river blindness (onchocerciasis); Peters administered a dose of praziquantel, which treats schistosomiasis; and community drug distributor Mr. Yusuf Maikeffi gave a dose of albendazole, which controls intestinal worms (soil-transmitted helminths). All three medications can be administered together safely and effectively. Jude Musa, a 13-year-old boy who loves football and drumming, swallowed all three treatments with a sip of water and a smile. Jude said he previously had blood in his urine, a symptom of schistosomiasis, but it returned to normal after he started receiving praziquantel every year from Maikeffi. "If you take this medicine, it will help you," Jude, one of six children of a retired police officer, told his neighbors. He said some of his friends had been infected with worms, but got better with Maikeffi's care. In his role as Gidan Gimba's trained community drug distributor (CDD), Maikeffi serves about 200 people. Some have reported improved vision, and he’s observed a reduction in vision issues in his village since he began distributing treatment. He attributes the improvement to a reduction in river blindness. "I enjoy being a CDD because it is important to me to help protect my community," said Maikeffi, the father of six children, ranging in age from 5 to 20. Maikeffi is one of 80,000 community-based volunteers and health workers dedicated to improving health in the Carter Center-assisted areas of Nigeria. Ivermectin is donated under the brand name Mectizan® by pharmaceutical company Merck (MSD). Albendazole is donated by GSK. Praziquantel is donated by Merck KGaA. The 500 million treatments also include programs that address trachoma (azithromycin, donated by Pfizer) and lymphatic filariasis (a combination treatment of Mectizan and albendazole). About half of the 500 million doses being celebrated have gone toward combatting the effects and spread of river blindness. Together with the ministries of health, the Center already has helped to eliminate the parasitic disease from Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Guatemala, as well as key locations in Sudan and Uganda. The Carter Center’s river blindness program in Nigeria operates a state-of-the-art laboratory at its headquarters in Jos to support national onchocerciasis elimination assessments. The Center also supports the work of the Nigerian National Onchocerciasis Elimination Committee, which advises the federal minister of health. Blinding trachoma and lymphatic filariasis were recently eliminated from this part of Nigeria by Carter Center-assisted programs, further evidence of the effectiveness of the efforts being celebrated. Additionally, Nigeria, once the most Guinea worm-endemic country in the world, eliminated that disease and achieved WHO certification in 2013. The Center and partners are nearing completion of the goal to globally eradicate Guinea worm disease; this is being accomplished by behavioral change, without medication or vaccine. About the Diseases Lymphatic filariasis is caused by thin worms transmitted to humans by the bites of mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions. These worms live in, and cause blockage of, the lymphatic system that normally returns fluids in human extremities to the circulatory system. This blockage results in fluid collection in the tissues (most commonly the legs and genitalia), severe swelling, and periodic fevers from bacterial infections of the collected fluids. A long-standing infection with lymphatic filariasis results in an irreversible condition called elephantiasis, in which there is a marked enlargement and hardening of the skin so that it resembles that of an elephant. Approximately 120 million people are infected by lymphatic filariasis, and 1.1 billion are at risk of infection. The Carter Center LF Elimination Program currently operates in Ethiopia and Nigeria. In addition, The Carter Center's Hispaniola Initiative works with the ministries of health in Haiti and the Dominican Republic to accelerate the elimination of malaria and lymphatic filariasis from the countries' shared island, Hispaniola. Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is a parasitic disease that afflicts the rural poor. It is caused by a worm that is spread from person to person by the bites of Simulium black flies that breed in rapid-flowing rivers and streams. The disease can cause intense itching, eye damage, and irreversible blindness, reducing an individual's ability to work and learn. Worldwide, an estimated 120 million people are at risk of being infected and 270,000 have been blinded by the disease, mostly in Africa. In addition to Africa and Latin America, onchocerciasis also affects Yemen. As many as 50 million Nigerians are at risk of contracting river blindness. The Carter Center also works with the governments of Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Brazil, and Venezuela to eliminate transmission of the disease. Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharziasis or "snail fever," is a waterborne parasitic infection that damages internal organs. The most common symptoms are blood in urine and/or feces and an enlarged liver, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weakness, and anemia. In terms of socioeconomic and public health impact, schistosomiasis is second only to malaria as the most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries. Nigeria is the most endemic country for schistosomiasis, with approximately 20 million people — mostly children — needing treatment. The Carter Center’s Schistosomiasis Control Program operates in seven states in Nigeria. Trachoma is a bacterial eye infection found in poor, isolated communities lacking basic hygiene, clean water, and adequate sanitation. It is easily spread from person to person through eye-seeking flies, and by hands and clothes. Repeated infection leads to scarring and inward turning of the eyelid — a very painful condition called trichiasis — eventually causing blindness if left untreated. Trachoma can be found in over 50 countries, most in Africa and the Middle East, and a few countries in the Americas and Asia. Globally, 200 million people are at risk for trachoma, and over 3.2 million are at immediate risk for blindness from trichiasis. The Carter Center’s Trachoma Control Program operates in Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda. In 2008, the Center helped Ghana eliminate blinding trachoma. Partners Many generous foundations, corporations, governments, and individuals have made these accomplishments possible through the years, including major support from Abbott; Alwaleed Philanthropies; BASF Corporation; Chevron Corporation; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Carlos Slim Foundation; Clarke Mosquito Control; GSK; Conrad N. Hilton Foundation; Izumi Foundation; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Johnson & Johnson; John J. Moores; A.G. Leventis Foundation; Lions Clubs International Foundation; Merck; Merck KGaA; OPEC Fund for International Development; Pfizer Inc; RTI International; Sightsavers; Sir Emeka Offor Foundation; and United States Agency for International Development. Key implementing partners include the ministries of health in endemic countries, World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), UNICEF, the Task Force for Global Health, UNICEF, and various university partners. In Nigeria the Center currently enjoys major support from RTI/ENVISION, USAID, and the Sir Emeka Offor Foundation. **Contact: **Emily Staub, Emily.Staub@cartercenter.org Ongoing Primary countryWorld Other countries Brazil Colombia Ethiopia Ghana Guatemala Mali Niger Nigeria South Sudan Sudan Uganda Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) Theme: Contributions Health Content format: News and Press Release Language: English Home Updates Countries Disasters Topics Organizations Jobs Training About Us Help ReliefWeb Informing humanitarians worldwide.

Drug companies and a pharmaceutical industry trade association based outside the state have provided 86 percent of the $109 million raised to defeat Proposition 61. The measure would limit the price California pays for prescription drugs. Two New York-based pharmaceutical firms, Pfizer and Merck, and New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson have each contributed more than $9 million. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is based in Los Angeles, has provided $16.7 million of the nearly $17 million raised for Proposition 61. The California Nurses Association has given $56,000. Plastic bag and other plastics manufacturers outside California have contributed 99 percent of the money raised — over $6 million — against Proposition 67 and for Proposition 65. Proposition 67 would ban the use of plastic bags; Proposition 65 would direct proceeds from the sale of carryout bags to a state-run environmental fund, a move opposed by grocers and environmental groups. Supporters of Proposition 67 have raised over $1.8 million; more than 80 percent of that money has come from individuals and groups in the state, including environmental organizations and the California Grocers Association. Proposition 65 has no financial opposition. While Californians have provided nearly 60 percent of the $24 million raised to support Proposition 64, a measure that would legalize marijuana use, the No campaign has relied heavily on out-of-state contributions. One person — Julie Schauer, a Pennsylvania retiree — has given almost $1.4 million to fight the initiative. Contributions from outside California make up 85 percent of the $1.6 million raised to defeat the measure. Methodology: MapLight analysis of contributions to committees supporting or opposing ballot measures using data available from the California Secretary of State as of Nov. 2, 2016. Campaigns were identified using contributions since Jan. 1, 2015, and the analysis includes any contributions given during the full time that the related committees were active, excluding contributions between allied committees.

A slew of earnings updates also delivered a mixed picture. U.S. lawmakers urged an inquiry into whether Sanofi , Eli Lilly, Merck and Novo Nordisk had colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. Sanofi and Novo Nordisk were down 1 percent and 3.2 percent respectively. Top faller was Hikma, down 6.8 percent after HSBC cut its price target citing broader market concerns over a separate U.S. Department of Justice investigation into price collusion in the pharma market. The sector has been hit recently by worries that Hillary Clinton could seek tougher pricing regulation if she wins the race for the White House next week. "A Clinton victory could be unhelpful for health care stocks," Citi analysts said in a strategy note. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.8 percent at its close, marking its biggest weekly fall since February. The index has been hit by growing jitters ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday and has been trading near its lowest levels since July. "As the presidential election race appears to (be) getting tighter with only a few days left until Americans are going to the polls, many traders (are) continuing to reduce their risk exposure further, which is also weighing on stocks," Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets, said in a note. Elsewhere market action was driven by earnings updates. France's Richemont rose 5.2 percent after the luxury goods group announced a management revamp in the wake of a drop in net profit in the six months to September, driven by one-off restructuring charges and product buy-backs. Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx said the key figures were above expectations while other analysts welcomed management comments that sales in October were modestly positive. The company had issued a profit warning in September. Among outstanding gainers, Ubisoft soared 8.6 percent to top the STOXX 600, as Kepler Cheuvreux upgraded the French game developer to "buy" after the company lifted its operating profit target. Shares were boosted at Cosmetics giant L'Oreal, whose sales growth beat expectations, and gambling firm Paddy Power, which lifted its full-year profit forecast citing a boost in the sterling value of its euro revenue, as well as this year's merger and favourable sporting results. But French outdoor advertising company JC Decaux fell nearly 10 percent after it said organic revenue growth would turn negative in the final quarter of the year and affect margins.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker European shares fall as pharma stocks come under fire; Richemont rallies Reuters   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Milan, Nov 4:   European shares fell on Friday, weighed down by weaker drugmakers after two US lawmakers called on federal antitrust regulators to open a probe for possible price fixing. A slew of earnings updates also delivered a mixed picture. The US lawmakers had on Thursday called for a probe into whether Sanofi, Eli Lilly, Merck and Novo Nordisk colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. Sanofi and Novo Nordisk were down 1.6 and 2.9 per cent respectively. Top faller was Hikma, down 7 per cent after HSBC cut its price target citing broader market concerns over a separate US Department of Justice investigation into price collusion in the pharma market. The sector has been hit recently by worries that Hillary Clinton could seek tougher pricing regulation if she wins the race for the White House. “A Clinton victory could be unhelpful for health care stocks,” Citi analysts said in a strategy note. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 1 per cent and on track for its biggest weekly fall since February. The index has been hit by growing nervousness before the US presidential election. “As the presidential election race appears to (be) getting tighter with only a few days left until Americans are going to the polls many traders continuing to reduce their risk exposure further which is also weighing on stocks,” Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets said in a note. Elsewhere market action was driven by earnings updates. France’s Richemont rose 6 per cent after the luxury goods group announced a management revamp after sales and core net profit in the six months to September, hit by one-off restructuring charges and product buy-backs. Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx said the key figures were above expectations while other analyst welcomed management comments that sales in October were modestly positive. The company had issued a profit warning in September. Among outstanding gainers, Ubisoft soared 9.5 per cent, topping STOXX gainers, as Kepler Cheuvreux upgrade the French game developer to “buy” after the company lifted its operating profit target. Shares were boosted at Cosmetics giant L’Oreal, whose sales growth beat expectations, and gambling firm Paddy Power, which lifted its full-year profit forecast citing a boost in the sterling value of its euro revenue, this year's merger and favourable sporting results. But French outdoor advertising company JC Decaux fell 7.3 per cent after it said organic revenue growth would turn negative in the final quarter of the year and affect margins.

A slew of earnings updates also delivered a mixed picture. The U.S. lawmakers on Thursday called for a probe into whether Sanofi, Eli Lilly, Merck and Novo Nordisk colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. Sanofi and Novo Nordisk were down 1.6 and 2.9 percent respectively. Top faller was Hikma, down 7 percent after HSBC cut its price target citing broader market concerns over a separate U.S. Department of Justice investigation into price collusion in the pharma market. The sector has been hit recently by worries that Hillary Clinton could seek tougher pricing regulation if she wins the race for the White House. "A Clinton victory could be unhelpful for health care stocks," Citi analysts said in a strategy note. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 1 percent and on track for its biggest weekly fall since February. The index has been hit by growing nervousness before the U.S. presidential election. "As the presidential election race appears to (be) getting tighter with only a few days left until Americans are going to the polls many traders continuing to reduce their risk exposure further which is also weighing on stocks," Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets said in a note. Elsewhere market action was driven by earnings updates. France's Richemont rose 6 percent after the luxury goods group announced a management revamp after sales and core net profit in the six months to September, hit by one-off restructuring charges and product buy-backs. Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx said the key figures were above expectations while other analyst welcomed management comments that sales in October were modestly positive. The company had issued a profit warning in September. Among outstanding gainers, Ubisoft soared 9.5 percent, topping STOXX gainers, as Kepler Cheuvreux upgrade the French game developer to "buy" after the company lifted its operating profit target. Shares were bosted at Cosmetics giant L'Oreal, whose sales growth beat expectations, and gambling firm Paddy Power, which lifted its full-year profit forecast citing a boost in the sterling value of its euro revenue, this year's merger and favourable sporting results. But French outdoor advertising company JC Decaux fell 7.3 percent after it said organic revenue growth would turn negative in the final quarter of the year and affect margins.

Previous Story Zebrafish offers hope for spinal cord repair... Next Story 'Explosion in cancer deaths among women' By AFP Added 2nd November 2016 07:59 AM Print A A A Fill in your Name and Email Address to receive a Free Newsletter "Most of the deaths occur in young- and middle-aged adults,", placing a heavy burden on families and national economies. PIC: Cancer is already killing one in seven women around the world. (AFP) Two reports have warned of an explosion in cancer deaths among women, with a toll, mainly from breast cancer, of some 5.5 million per year by 2030 -- roughly the population of Denmark. This represented a near 60-percent increase in less than two decades, said an analysis conducted by the American Cancer Society (ACS), released Tuesday at the World Cancer Congress in Paris. As the global population grows and ages, the highest toll will be among women in poor and middle-income countries, it said, and much of it from cancers which are largely preventable. "Most of the deaths occur in young- and middle-aged adults,", placing a heavy burden on families and national economies, said Sally Cowal, senior vice president of global health at the ACS, which compiled the report with pharmaceutical company Merck. A second report, published in The Lancet medical journal on Wednesday, said the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer alone could almost double to 3.2 million a year by 2030 from 1.7 million in 2015. For cervical cancer, the number of diagnoses could "rise by at least 25 percent to over 700,000 by 2030," mainly in low- and middle-income countries, said a statement from The Lancet. Cancer is already killing one in seven women around the world, said the ACS report -- the second highest cause of death after cardiovascular disease. All four of the deadliest cancers -- breast, colorectal, lung and cervical cancer -- are mostly preventable or can be detected early, when treatment is more successful. In poorer countries, a much smaller proportion of cancer cases are diagnosed and treated than in rich ones, while a much bigger group dies. The relative burden is growing for developing countries as people live longer due to better basic healthcare. Women in these countries are also increasingly exposed to known cancer risk factors "associated with rapid economic transition," said Cowal, "such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors" such as postponing motherhood. "Due to these changes, cancers that were once common only in high-income countries are becoming more prevalent," said the report entitled "The Global Burden of Cancer in Women." Regional differences According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 6.7 million new cancer cases and 3.5 million deaths among women worldwide in 2012. Of these, 56 percent of cases and 64 percent of deaths were in less developed countries. "These numbers are expected to increase to 9.9 million cases and 5.5 million deaths among females annually by 2030 as a result of the growth and ageing of the population," said the ACS report. The biggest concentration is in eastern Asia, with 1.7 million cases and a million deaths in 2012, mainly in China. The highest ratio of cancer cases per population group are still reported in high-income countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia, but this was partly due to better access to screening and detection. Deaths, however, were proportionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries with reduced access to diagnosis and treatment. The countries with the highest death rate were Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Mongolia and Papua New Guinea. Breast and lung cancer are the two most common types in both rich and poor nations, with colorectal cancer the number three killer in developed countries and cervical cancer in less developed ones. Cervical cancer can be staved off by vaccination against the cancer-causing Human papillomavirus (HPV) and can be easily detected through regular Papanicolaou (pap) test screens. The Lancet report, comprised of three research papers, said a basic cancer control package could be introduced in low- and middle-income countries for as little as $1.72 (1.55 euros) per person -- the equivalent of just three percent of current health spending in these countries. Universal HPV vaccination of all 12-year-old girls could prevent 420,000 deaths worldwide over their lifetime. "The global community cannot continue to ignore the problem -- hundreds of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily every year," said Richard Sullivan of King's College London, who co-authored The Lancet report. "Not only are the costs of essential cancer services for women lower than expected, but scale-up of diagnostic, surgical and treatment services are a highly effective investment compared the devastating economic cost to countries, communities and families."

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ MerckDr. Reddy'sCiplaAurobindo Pharma EXPAND TO VIEW ALL Mumbai: Shares of some domestic pharma companies tumbled on Friday, following the news that US authorities could file charges against generic drug makers on suspicion of price collusion. Experts said investors' jitters ahead of the voting day in the US too weighed on the sector. Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has taken a public stance against pharmaceutical companies raising drug prices. Sun Pharmaceutical, which has the largest presence among Indian drug makers in the US market, was the top loser in the sector with its shares closing 7.41% down on the BSE on Friday at Rs 652. Several pharma companies, including Sun Pharmaceutical, are being investigated by the US Justice Department for alleged collusion on pricing, according to a Bloomberg report on Thursday which cited people familiar with the matter as saying charges could be filed by the year-end. Trailing Sun was Dr. Reddy's, which fell 5.7% to Rs 3,077. While Aurobindo Pharma fell by 5.6% to close at Rs 727, Wockhardt was down 4.05% at Rs 800 and Cipla closed 2.6% lower at Rs 544. The BSE Healthcare index was down 4.16%. “Pharma stocks in India would become attractive post the US election as rhetoric from candidates would end and negative news flow would stop,“ said Rahul Arora, CEO, institutional equities business, Nirmal Bang Securities. “Stock price crash on news of filing of charges was a knee-jerk reaction as they would be contested. Also, the worst case scenario is that a few companies would be fined, which in case of Indian players would not be as huge as some of the global peers due to the size of the business.“ Generic drugs are supposed to ke ep healthcare costs down, but the US government may claim that these companies worked together to keep prices higher instead of allowing market competition to set pricing, a Bloomberg report said.Also, US lawmakers on Thursday called for a probe into whether Sanofi, Eli Lilly, Merck and Novo Nordisk colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. While pharma companies in the US have witnessed public outrage over spiralling drug prices, the environment became heated as the authorities launched criminal investigation into pharma companies two years ago. “Pharma companies have to go through three stages before the actual cash flows begin. This starts with the factories getting approval from US authorities, filing applications for registration and seek approval for products,“ said Nilesh Shah, managing director, Kotak Mutual Fund. He said investors should use this phase of challenge and underperformance to accumulate these stocks over the next 6-12 months. “The concern around pharma stocks seems more sentimental, as investors are worried about the outcome of the election results,“ said Sarabjeet Kaur Nangra, vice-president (research), Angel Broking.

In the highly competitive multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment market, prescription barriers helped 5 of the 10 brands we surveyed eke out narrow market share gains while the other 5 lost out. Which barriers had the biggest impact? Are they the ones that helped the most prescribed brand gain three times as much market share as its closest rival? Find out in Market Access Impact: MS. Request sample pages The report covers 10 major MS drugs from Bayer, Biogen, EMD Serono, Genzyme, Novartis, and Teva. You'll learn which barriers cost your brand the most share, and see which competitors you're losing share to and taking it from—insight you can use to improve your market access strategy. Not your market? Click here to see the EU report Top Takeaways Highly competitive market: More than two thirds of the doctors surveyed prescribe eight of the ten brands covered in the report. Nearly all doctors prescribe the top two brands. Half of brands benefit from barriers: But the most prescribed brand benefits the most, with a barrier-related gain three times as high as any competitor's. Market access is the #1 issue: Barriers related to market access affect nearly as many prescriptions as all other barriers combined. Excellent brand awareness and perception: Nearly all doctors surveyed are aware of the brands covered, and most of them are willing to consider brands they don't currently prescribe. Clear market loser: More doctors experience barriers with one brand in particular. Not surprisingly, that brand is least prescribed, and sees a net share loss to all of the others.

Valley Cottage, NY, November 05, 2016 --(PR.com)-- Future Market Insights (FMI) delivers key insights on the global companion animals drug market in its upcoming outlook titled, “Companion Animals Drug Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment, 2015 – 2025.” In terms of revenue, the global companion animal drug market is projected to register a healthy CAGR of 4.9% over the forecast period owing to various factors, which FMI analysis highlights and offers detailed insights and forecasts. The market is segmented based on product type, distribution channels and regions. The overall market has been segmented broadly into eight product types such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, parasiticides (further sub-divided into ecto-parasiticides and endo-parasiticides), heartworm drugs, nutritional, behavioural and skincare drugs and vaccines. Parasiticides more frequently applied as a cure for flea and tick infestations, are estimated to account for maximum revenue share by product type in the global companion animal drug market by 2015 end. The parasiticide drug segment is expected to expand at a CAGR of 6.6% in terms of value during the forecast period. Other popular drugs used in companion animals include heartworm medicines and vaccines. The vaccines segment is expected to reach market value of US$ 1,760.4 Mn by 2025, expanding at a CAGR of ~3% over the forecast period. Request Free Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-1077 To provide deeper insight into drug dispensing and distribution channels, the report has also been segmented by distribution channels such as veterinary hospitals, veterinary clinics and pharmacies and drug stores. It has been observed and validated that pet owners globally prefer consulting veterinary doctors at hospitals and clinics and administering prescription drugs to their small companion pets. However, a new trend of referring to the Internet to find out disease pathogenesis and buying over-the-counter (OTC) drugs from retail pharmacies and drug stores has been fast picking up. The primary trend in the companion animal drug market is an increase in pet adoption and humanization of pets globally. Other driving forces include increasing urbanization and growing affluence in emerging economies, increasing R&D for faster launch of first-in-line drugs, extension of patent approvals on formularies and growing demand for compounded medicines, as they are easily affordable and accessible. Factors restraining market growth include rising costs for R&D and lack of scope for innovation due to matured product portfolios. This report assesses trends driving growth of each segment on global as well as regional levels, and offers potential strategic recommendations that could prove useful to drug makers planning to penetrate or enter the market. North America is estimated to dominate the companion animals drug market with maximum market share by end of 2015. North America and Western Europe are collectively expected to account for close to 50% of the total companion animals drug market share in terms of value by end of 2015. Among emerging markets, Latin America is estimated to witness highest CAGR of 6.0% over the forecast period, followed by Asia Pacific excluding Japan, due to increasing pet adoption and rise in geriatric population. Send An Enquiry @ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/askus/rep-gb-1077 Some key players identified in the global companion animal drug market report include Zoetis Inc., Elanco (Eli Lilly), Merck Animal Health, Bayer Animal Healthcare, Merial (Sanofi), Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Virbac Animal Health and Ceva Santé Animale. They have discussed individual strategies followed by these companies in terms of enhancing drug portfolios, market consolidation and drug innovation pipelines. The report has been concluded with strategic recommendations for players already present in the market and also new players planning to enter the market, which could help them in the long run.

Nov 04, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article NEW YORK and ANN ARBOR, Mich., Nov. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lycera Corp., a privately held biopharmaceutical company developing breakthrough immune modulatory medicines, announced today the publication of new research findings for the Company's most advanced cancer immunotherapy program: oral, selective RORgamma agonists.  RORgamma is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that serves as a master control switch of the immune system, driving the generation and function of Type 17 effector immune cells, Th17 (helper), and Tc17 (cytotoxic) T cells.  These Type 17 immune T cells play an important role in mediating anti-tumor immune responses. In an article titled, "Synthetic RORgamma agonists regulate multiple pathways to enhance anti-tumor immunity," appearing in OncoImmunology, a research team, including scientists at Lycera, the Medical University of South Carolina, and the University of Michigan, report key preclinical research findings from Lycera's program, including: RORgamma expressing T cells infiltrate a range of human tumors. RORgamma agonists enhance immune cell effector functions such as cytokine production and cytotoxic activity, while also improving the persistence or survival of Type 17 T cells. The agonists inhibit the formation of regulatory T cells, which can suppress immune activity. This results in a favorable shift in the ratio of effector to suppressor T cells. Treatment of Type 17 cells with RORgamma agonists promotes T cell activation by mediating both an increase in expression of co-stimulatory molecules, including CD226, CD27, and 4-1BB (CD137), and a concomitant decrease of co-inhibitory molecule expression, including PD-1, TIGIT, TIM3, CD73, and LAG3. Treatment of T cells ex vivo with RORgamma agonists enhances the anti-tumor activity and persistence of anti-tumor effector T-cells in models of adoptive cell therapy. Oral administration of Lycera's RORgamma agonists have demonstrated single agent activity in multiple syngeneic tumor models, resulting in immune-dependent inhibition of tumor growth and extended survival. "We are pleased to report the publication of promising results for our RORgamma agonist program, highlighting the multiple anti-tumor mechanisms elicited by a single selective compound," said Paul Sekhri, President and CEO of Lycera. "By targeting the RORgamma transcription factor, Lycera's novel oral agents have been shown to reprogram the immune system to both increase the activity of anti-tumor immune cells, as well as reduce immunosuppressive mechanisms resulting in single agent anti-tumor activity in preclinical models. These findings provide a strong rationale for the potential of our lead program in immune-oncology, and we look forward to the continued advancement of this program to clinical trials."

Synthetic RORg agonists regulate multiple pathways to enhance anti-tumor immunity. OncoImmunology. 2016. [Epub ahead of print]. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2016.1254854 About RORgamma agonists RORgamma is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that serves as a master control switch of the immune system, driving the activation and differentiation of immune cells, including Th17 (helper T-cells) and Tc17 (cytotoxic T cells) T cells. Lycera has discovered selective and potent oral agonists that target RORgamma which are advancing to the clinic for the potential treatment of a broad range of cancers. These RORgamma agonists have demonstrated single agent therapeutic activity in multiple animal models of cancer. In addition, ex vivo treatment with Lycera's RORgamma agonist compounds has been shown to enhance the therapeutic benefit of adoptive T-cell therapy by improving both immune cell persistence and activation. About Lycera Lycera is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel oral immune modulators for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Based on successful progress of its world-class R&D platform, including expertise in immune metabolism, cell signaling, and immune cell differentiation, Lycera is commencing multiple clinical programs in 2016. The company is advancing a wholly owned, oral, gut-directed ATPase modulator, designated LYC-30937-EC, for the treatment of autoimmune disease, and has entered Phase 2 clinical studies in patients with ulcerative colitis. The Company also is progressing oral RORgamma agonists for diverse applications in immuno-oncology. Lycera has an exclusive strategic collaboration with Celgene Corporation to advance Lycera's proprietary pipeline for cancer and immune-mediated diseases. In addition, Lycera had previously established collaborations with Merck to discover, develop, and commercialize small molecule therapies for autoimmune disorders. Lycera's leadership possesses deep experience in drug discovery, development, and commercialization and has established close relationships with renowned thought leaders and clinical researchers worldwide. Lycera was founded in 2006 based on an initial scientific platform in-licensed from the University of Michigan. Lead investors in Lycera include InterWest Partners, ARCH Venture Partners, Clarus Ventures, and EDF Ventures.

Smoking a pack a day causes 150 mutations in every lung cell, research shows Scientists have found that smoking a pack a day of cigarettes can cause 150 damaging changes to a smoker's lung cells each year. The findings come from a study of the devastating genetic damage, or mutations, caused by smoking in various organs in the body. Gua sha therapy may offer some relief in perimenopause A Chinese medicine technique using a smooth-edged instrument to scrape or rub certain areas of the body may relieve troublesome symptoms women experience in the years leading up to menopause, according to a new study. Perimenopause can begin eight to 10 years before menopause, as estrogen levels fluctuate and start declining but menstrual cycles continue. During this time, and for another year or more after menstruation stops, women may experience hot flashes, insomnia, tiredness, mood swings, forgetfulness, aches and pains, vaginal dryness and pain during sex. Stronger muscles may mean sharper minds for kids Making sure kids have good muscle fitness might also benefit their school performance, according to a recent U.S. study. Aerobic fitness has already been linked to better thinking abilities in pre-teen children, but the current study found an independent link between muscle fitness and kids' performance on memory tests as well as their math and reading skills. Study finds gene markers for drug-resistant malaria in Cambodia Scientists have discovered genetic markers in malaria parasites linked to resistance to the key anti-malarial medicine piperaquine, and say their work could help doctors and health officials monitor and limit the spread of such resistance. In research published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, the team also said a simple test using blood taken from a finger pinprick could show whether a malaria patient has parasites with the genetic markers - allowing doctors to prescribe an alternative treatment. U.N. chief Ban honored by Elton John AIDS Foundation United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has been honored by the Elton John AIDS Foundation with its Founder's Award, which recognizes "extraordinary contributions to the global effort to end AIDS". The non-profit organization, founded by veteran singer Elton John, gave away the award at its 15th annual "An Enduring Vision" Gala in New York on Wednesday night. Accurate Facebook posts about Zika virus were plentiful, not popular (Reuters Health) - Social media is an important source of news for many Americans, but the health stories that are most popular may also be the least accurate, suggests a study of Facebook posts about Zika virus. In May and June 2016, a period of heavy media coverage of the Zika virus epidemic spreading in the Americas, about four out of five popular posts on Facebook about Zika contained accurate information, researchers found. But the ones containing inaccurate information or conspiracy theories were far more popular on the social networking website. Trauma burden and services not equally distributed across U.S. (Reuters Health) - The more surgical trauma centers there are in an area, the lower death rates tend to be, according to a study that finds the density of trauma centers varies widely by state. States like Maine, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Michigan and North Dakota had the highest density of surgical critical care (SCC) providers, while Alaska, Georgia, Oklahoma and New Mexico had the lowest density, based on 2013 data. Exclusive: Tobacco treaty leaders propose barring delegates linked to state firms The leadership of a World Health Organization (WHO) treaty on tobacco control has proposed barring delegates with ties to state-owned tobacco firms from its conference next week, tightening its application of rules to shut out the industry from policy making. That would include delegates employed by state-owned tobacco companies or those otherwise "working to advance the interests of the tobacco industry," according to an internal communication document seen by Reuters. Drugmakers under fire for possible U.S. price fixing Two prominent U.S. lawmakers on Thursday called on federal antitrust regulators to probe whether Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly and Co, Merck & Co Inc and Novo Nordisk A/S colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. The request by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings follows a similar letter they sent last fall calling for an investigation into 14 drug companies over price increases of generic drugs. Weight loss surgery may reduce risk of developing gout Obese people who have weight loss surgeries like gastric bypass are much less likely than those who don't have surgery to develop gout, a painful type of arthritis, according to a Swedish study. People who chose to get weight loss surgery are also less than half as likely to develop hyperuricemia, too much uric acid in urine, which can be a precursor to gout, the study team writes in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.
