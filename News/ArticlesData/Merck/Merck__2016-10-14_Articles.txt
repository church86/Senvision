Most measures of the cancer burden take a public health perspective. Cancer also has a significant economic impact on society. At an international event held in Copenhagen, experts from MSD, known as Merck in the US and Canada, disclosed that Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumors had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumors as chemotherapy alone. “Chemotherapy has been the standard treatment for most patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer for decades, but survival rates remain low,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “Our new data suggest that Keytruda treatment can offer meaningful improvement over chemotherapy in a broad array of patients. In this sense, these studies may represent a turning point in worldwide efforts to control lung cancer. We sincerely thank the patients and the clinical investigators for their participation in our studies. Together we are working to improve the health of more and more patients with cancer.” The findings published in The New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated that Keytruda reduced the risk of progression or death by 50 percent compared to chemotherapy Additionally, Keytruda resulted in a 40 percent reduction in the risk of death compared with chemotherapy. This finding includes the 66 patients (43.7%) on the chemotherapy arm who crossed over in-study to receive Keytruda once their cancer had progressed. “These data … demonstrate the potential of Keytruda to change the way non-small cell lung cancer is currently treated,” said Dr. Martin Reck, head of the thoracic oncology dept., LungenClinic Grosshansdorf, Germany, and lead author of The New England Journal of Medicine paper. The safety of Keytruda was consistent with what has been seen in previous trials among patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The most common treatment-related adverse events for Keytruda were diarrhea, fatigue, and pyrexia. Moreover, Roger Dansey, M.D., senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories, said “our research in immuno-oncology continues to show tremendous promise, with our goal being to extend the lives of significant numbers of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.” Merck has a robust clinical development program for Keytruda in lung cancer, with multiple registration-enabling studies currently underway. The Keytruda clinical development program includes more than 30 tumor types in more than 350 clinical trials, including more than 100 trials that combine Keytruda with other cancer treatments. MSD’s goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide. At MSD Oncology, “helping people fight cancer is our passion and supporting accessibility to our cancer medicines is our commitment. Our focus is on pursuing research in immuno-oncology and we are accelerating every step in the journey – from lab to clinic – to potentially bring new hope to people with cancer.” “As part of our focus on cancer, MSD is committed to exploring the potential of immuno-oncology with one of the fastest-growing development programs in the industry. We are currently executing an expansive research program that includes more than 350 clinical trials evaluating our anti-PD-1 therapy across more than 30 tumor types. We also continue to strengthen our immuno-oncology portfolio through strategic acquisitions and are prioritizing the development of several promising immunotherapeutic candidates with the potential to improve the treatment of advanced cancers,” MSD said in a statement.

Meet the Contributors → Bio Roundup: Bristol & Illumina Blues, Sickle Cell News & More Ben Fidler October 14th, 2016 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  On Aug. 4, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb closed at $75.32. Today, shares are worth just over $50. That means in three months, Bristol has lost a third of its value, equivalent to about $40 billion in market capitalization. The reason? One failed clinical trial has left rival Merck in the lead position to have what could be part of the new standard of care for lung cancer. That story and plenty more in this week’s roundup. TOP STORIES —The European Society of Medical Oncology held its annual meeting in Copenhagen, and the meeting featured updates on heavyweight immunotherapy programs, potential options for patients with advanced breast cancer, and more. Some of the big headlines from the meeting included the latest data on a prospective ovarian cancer drug, niraparib, from Waltham, MA-based Tesaro (NASDAQ: TSRO), and results from Merck’s (NYSE: MRK) pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients. Merck’s data sent immunotherapy rival Bristol’s shares down more than 10 percent, while Tesaro’s shares gained 17 percent over the week. —Shares of San Diego-based Illumina (NASDAQ: ILMN) fell more than 32 percent after the next-gen sequencing giant slashed its revenue projections once again. Illumina fended off a hostile takeover bid from Roche back in February 2012, and over the next three years shares went from about $51 apiece to as high as $219.30 in July 2015. But sagging sales have sent Illumina far down from last year’s peak. Here’s more from CNBC. THIS WEEK IN SICKLE CELL… —Researchers at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland, the Innovative Genomics Initiative of Berkeley, CA, and the University of Utah have made progress on a gene-editing treatment for sickle cell disease. The work used CRISPR-Cas9 to fix a genetic mutation in human bone marrow cells that were transplanted into mice. It remains years away from human testing. —Cambridge, MA-based Bluebird Bio (NASDAQ: BLUE) has made technological improvements to the process it uses to manufacture gene therapies. They’ll be incorporated into Bluebird’s current and future trials, which Bluebird hopes might help it overcome some of the limitations it’s seen so far in gene therapies for sickle cell and beta-thalassemia. IPOS, BIG AND SMALL —Cambridge and Basel-based CRISPR Therapeutics, which could go public next week, aims to raise $75 million by selling 4.7 million shares at $15 to $17 apiece. —Cancer drug developer Accelerated Pharma, based in Westport, CT, outlined terms for a $17 million IPO. —AzurRx Biopharma (NASDAQ: AZRX), which has an executive office at SUNY Downstate’s biotech incubator in Brooklyn, raised $5.3 million in an IPO. FUNDING ROUNDS —Zymergen of Emeryville, CA, raised a $130 million Series B round for its biological manufacturing business. It engineers microbes to produce chemicals for a range of industries. The round was led by Japan’s SoftBank Group. —Boston-based healthtech startup Iora Health raised a $75 million Series D round led by Singapore-based Temasek. Here’s more on the startup, which runs primary care clinics imbued with software that helps track patients’ health. AND IN OTHER NEWS… —New York-based Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ICPT) said that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has recommended conditional approval of obeticholic acid (Ocaliva) in Europe to treat patients with the rare liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis. The drug is already approved to treat PBC in the U.S. —Adaptimmune Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ADAP) said Wednesday it has changed the protocol for its ovarian cancer treatment in a Phase 1/2a trial. The stock price was down 10 percent as of Thursday’s close. —Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN) will team with Ocular Therapeutix (NASDAQ: OCUL) to develop a long-lasting version of its flagship eye drug, aflibercept (Eylea).

The label change will lift the contraindication for stable moderate renal failure CKD stage 3. The maximum daily metformin dose will be 2000 mg/day in CKD stage 3a (GFR = 45-59 ml/min) and 1000 mg/day in CKD stage 3b (GFR = 30-44 ml/min), allowing a large additional group of type 2 diabetes patients with reduced kidney function to benefit from the treatment: In a recent analysis in CPRD, a UK medical record database, 32.7% of all diabetic patients had CKD stage 3, with 23.2% in CKD stage 3a and 9.5% in CKD stage 3b[1]. (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160518/369530LOGO ) "We are pleased to know that the EMA review now confirms that metformin can be safely used in patients with moderate renal failure," said Luciano Rossetti MD, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "We are proud of our heritage in the diabetes space that spans nearly 60 years, and began by bringing metformin to market. Since then we, and others, have continued to research on this product, and metformin is now amongst the best investigated oral medications for type 2 diabetes. The lift of the contraindication is, at least in part, also a result of our research, and it further supports the safe and effective use of metformin as first line treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes." Following a routine evaluation of the safety of metformin medicines, it was found that based on scientific evidence and clinical guidelines, patients with moderate renal failure may stand to benefit from treatment with metformin, and that the contraindication may therefore no longer be justified. Furthermore, the contraindication in CKD3a differed in metformin-containing products across Europe, as Merck had been granted a lift of the contraindication in CKD stage 3a recently. Based on this evidence, the EMA issued an Article 31 referral requesting a cumulative review of the benefit and risk in this patient group across all metformin-selling companies in the European Union. Leveraging around 60 years of experience in market as the metformin originator, Merck supported the EMA request by providing a comprehensive analysis of all available clinical data on the efficacy and safety of metformin in patients with CKD stage 3. This was balanced against a cumulative analysis of all case reports Merck has received for lactic acidosis, the very rare risk associated with metformin accumulation due to acute or severe renal failure. The EMA reviewed the data submitted by all companies, and as a result, the CHMP has issued a positive opinion on lifting the contraindication for treatment of type 2 diabetes patients with renal impairment CKD stage 3. Once approved by the European Commission, the Glucophage® product portfolio and Glucovance® will adopt this lift of contraindication for type 2 diabetes patients with moderate renal failure (CKD stage 3) through a label change. Glucophage® is already today on label in patients with CKD stage 3a in Europe and CKD stage 3 in Switzerland. About Glucophage® Glucophage® (metformin hydrochloride) is a prescription-only medicine indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in overweight patients when diet and exercise alone have failed. In adults, Glucophage® may be given alone or with oral antidiabetic agents, or with insulin. In children from 10 years old and adolescents, Glucophage® may be given alone or with insulin. A reduction of diabetic complications has been shown in overweight type 2 diabetic adult patients treated with Glucophage® as first-line therapy after diet failure. The most commonly reported side effects with Glucophage® are gastro-intestinal disturbances that may occur during treatment initiation and resolve spontaneously in most cases. The Glucophage® product portfolio comprises: Glucophage® IR (immediate release) and Glucophage® XR (extended release). In addition, Merck produces Glucovance® a fixed dose combination of metformin and glibenclamide.

Merck launched Biosimilars Clarified, a new online resource about biosimilars for patients and healthcare providers. The drugmaker is currently partnering with Samsung Bioepis to bring biosimilars of AbbVie's Humira, Roche's Herceptin, and Sanofi's Lantus to market. 2. The price of branded insulin continues to rise even as new competitors emerge. Prices of competing insulins have gone up in lockstep. The annual cost of insulin reached $736 annually per patient in 2013 — a threefold hike from 2002. (STAT) 3. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said in draft guidance that it will not fund Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. The U.K. cost watchdog said it was weighing use of the drug to collect more data on its effectiveness, but only for patients with high expression of the PD-L1 protein in their tumors. (PharmaTimes) 4. BioMarin is mulling an appeal of the FDA's rejection of its experimental drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, drisapersen. The agency recently approved the first drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Sarepta Therapeutics' Exondys 51. (Endpoints News) 5. Despite the growing threat of antibiotic resistance and superbugs, drugmakers continue to market antibiotics to farmers. New FDA rules intended to curb the use of antibiotics will go into effect in January. In anticipation, drugmakers have launched educational webinars to help farmers comply with these new regulations and continue to receive antibiotics.

CHMP Adopts Positive Opinion of Metformin, Including Merck's Type 2 Diabetes Treatment Portfolio, in Patients with Renal Impairment CHMP Adopts Positive Opinion of Metformin, Including Merck's Type 2 Diabetes Treatment Portfolio, in Patients with Renal Impairment CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 14/10/2016 16:31 DARMSTADT, Germany, October 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Not intended for U.S. and UK-based media  Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued a positive opinion recommending extension of the label for all metformin-containing products, including the Glucophage® product portfolio and Glucovance®, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes patients. The label change will lift the contraindication for stable moderate renal failure CKD stage 3. The maximum daily metformin dose will be 2000 mg/day in CKD stage 3a (GFR = 45-59 ml/min) and 1000 mg/day in CKD stage 3b (GFR = 30-44 ml/min), allowing a large additional group of type 2 diabetes patients with reduced kidney function to benefit from the treatment: In a recent analysis in CPRD, a UK medical record database, 32.7% of all diabetic patients had CKD stage 3, with 23.2% in CKD stage 3a and 9.5% in CKD stage 3b[ 1 ].      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160518/369530LOGO ) "We are pleased to know that the EMA review now confirms that metformin can be safely used in patients with moderate renal failure," said Luciano Rossetti MD, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "We are proud of our heritage in the diabetes space that spans nearly 60 years, and began by bringing metformin to market. Since then we, and others, have continued to research on this product, and metformin is now amongst the best investigated oral medications for type 2 diabetes. The lift of the contraindication is, at least in part, also a result of our research, and it further supports the safe and effective use of metformin as first line treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes." Following a routine evaluation of the safety of metformin medicines, it was found that based on scientific evidence and clinical guidelines, patients with moderate renal failure may stand to benefit from treatment with metformin, and that the contraindication may therefore no longer be justified. Furthermore, the contraindication in CKD3a differed in metformin-containing products across Europe, as Merck had been granted a lift of the contraindication in CKD stage 3a recently. Based on this evidence, the EMA issued an Article 31 referral requesting a cumulative review of the benefit and risk in this patient group across all metformin-selling companies in the European Union. Leveraging around 60 years of experience in market as the metformin originator, Merck supported the EMA request by providing a comprehensive analysis of all available clinical data on the efficacy and safety of metformin in patients with CKD stage 3. This was balanced against a cumulative analysis of all case reports Merck has received for lactic acidosis, the very rare risk associated with metformin accumulation due to acute or severe renal failure. The EMA reviewed the data submitted by all companies, and as a result, the CHMP has issued a positive opinion on lifting the contraindication for treatment of type 2 diabetes patients with renal impairment CKD stage 3. Once approved by the European Commission, the Glucophage® product portfolio and Glucovance® will adopt this lift of contraindication for type 2 diabetes patients with moderate renal failure (CKD stage 3) through a label change. Glucophage® is already today on label in patients with CKD stage 3a in Europe and CKD stage 3 in Switzerland. About Glucophage®   Glucophage® (metformin hydrochloride) is a prescription-only medicine indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in overweight patients when diet and exercise alone have failed. In adults, Glucophage® may be given alone or with oral antidiabetic agents, or with insulin. In children from 10 years old and adolescents, Glucophage® may be given alone or with insulin. A reduction of diabetic complications has been shown in overweight type 2 diabetic adult patients treated with Glucophage® as first-line therapy after diet failure. The most commonly reported side effects with Glucophage® are gastro-intestinal disturbances that may occur during treatment initiation and resolve spontaneously in most cases. The Glucophage® product portfolio comprises: Glucophage® IR (immediate release) and Glucophage® XR (extended release). In addition, Merck produces Glucovance® a fixed dose combination of metformin and glibenclamide.

The New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson will play an active role in the project by assisting the state government in achieving the goal. The MoU was signed when Industries Minister K.T.

Rama Rao met Paul Stoffel, Chief Scientific Officer and Chairman of Pharmaceuticals Division, Melinda Richter, Head of JLabs and Jonathan Collard, VP, Government Affairs and Policy, Asia Pacific. Stoffel was very enthusiastic about proposed Hyderabad Pharma City, and will be visiting India and Hyderabad next year, said a statement from the minister's office here on Friday. Richter assured the Telangana delegation that they would explore the possibility of setting up of JLabs unit in Hyderabad. Later, the minister met Sanat Chattopadhyay, Executive VP and President, Merck Manufacturing Division, who mentioned the firm's intent for a social partnership with Telangana Government on arresting infant diarrhoea.

If achieved that would elevate its healthcare sales in 2022 to around €4bn, with its existing portfolio of multiple sclerosis, fertility/hormonal and cancer drugs contributing €2bn. Its Life Science and Performance Materials units are expected to add €1bn in new product sales apiece. On the face of it, the growth claim is a bold one for a company whose pipeline has not been particularly productive in recent years, and it is clear that a hefty chunk of that increase will depend on Pfizer-partnered PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab, which is in phase III trials for several types of cancer. The company said at a strategy update yesterday that it is preparing a regulatory submission for avelumab before the end of the year in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer, and it is expecting follow-up indications in gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer before 2020. Other than avelumab, Merck has just two other candidates in late-stage development, namely oral cladribine for multiple sclerosis (MS) and a biosimilar of AbbVie's TNF inhibitor Humira (adalimumab). Cladribine is closest to market having already been submitted for approval in the EU in June for the second time, having been rejected by the EMA and FDA in 2009, while the biosimilar launch will depend on how well AbbVie defends its intellectual property for the brand. If approved, cladribine will have to compete in the marketplace with established oral MS drugs such as Biogen's Tecfidera (dimethyl glutamate) and Novartis' Gilenya (fingolimod), but will tap into Merck's existing MS expertise with interferon beta product Rebif. "Since October 2015, 20 projects have either advanced into the next phase of clinical development or are about to," said the company in a statement. Among other candidates coming through the pipeline, it highlighted BTK inhibitor M2951 - in phase II for rheumatoid arthritis - and TGF-beta trap for solid tumours in phase I. "We firmly believe that we will meet the objectives we have set for 2018," which will be the company's 350th anniversary, commented Merck's chief executive Stefan Oschmann.

provided by Eisai Inc. Oct 13, 2016, 19:22 ET Share this article WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., Oct. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Eisai Inc. announced today the presentation of preliminary results of a Phase 1b clinical study (Study 111) of its in-house developed multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib (marketed in the U.S. under the brand name Lenvima®) in combination with the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy pembrolizumab (marketed under the brand name Keytruda®, developed by Merck & Co., Inc., known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada) in patients with selected solid tumors at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress. Development of this potential combination regimen, which is not approved by the FDA, is being overseen by a Joint Development Committee formed by both companies. This investigational study is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1b/2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab. In the Phase 1b part of the study, the primary endpoint was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The study comprised 13 patients with selected solid tumors (renal cell carcinoma (n=8), endometrial cancer (n=2), non-small cell lung cancer (n=2) and melanoma (n=1)) who had progressed after treatment with approved therapies or for which there are no standard effective therapies available. Patients received one of three dose levels of lenvatinib (either 24 mg, 20 mg or 14 mg given orally daily) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg given intravenously every three weeks). The Phase 2 part of this study is ongoing. According to the results of the Phase 1b part of the study, there were two dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) at the lenvatinib dose level 1 group (24 mg; 1 grade 3 arthralgia and 1 grade 3 fatigue) and no DLTs were reported in the lenvatinib 20 mg plus pembrolizumab 200 mg group. The maximum tolerated dose was confirmed as 20 mg of lenvatinib per day plus 200 mg of pembrolizumab once every three weeks. All patients reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were observed in 69.2% of patients, and no patients had discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. The most frequently observed adverse events in either the lenvatinib 24 mg plus pembrolizumab 200 mg group or the lenvatinib 20 mg plus pembrolizumab 200 mg group were decreased appetite, diarrhea and fatigue. "Eisai is committed to exploring the potential role that lenvatinib-based combinations may have for patients with difficult to treat cancers," said Alton Kremer, MD, PhD, Chief Clinical Officer and Chief Medical Officer, Oncology Business Group, Eisai. "We are encouraged by these results and look forward to further exploring the combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in the next stage of clinical development." This release discusses an investigational use for FDA-approved products. Lenvima is not approved for use in combination with Keytruda. This release is not intended to convey any conclusions about efficacy or safety of lenvatinib, pembrolizumab or any combination of these two agents. There is no guarantee that any investigational uses of such FDA-approved products will successfully complete clinical development or gain FDA approval. About LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) is a kinase inhibitor that is indicated for: Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC): single agent for patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory DTC. Renal Cell Cancer (RCC): in combination with everolimus for patients with advanced RCC following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. Lenvatinib, discovered and developed by Eisai, is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1-3. Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. Important Safety Information Warnings and Precautions In DTC, hypertension was reported in 73% of patients on LENVIMA vs 16% with placebo (44% vs 4% grade ≥3). In RCC, hypertension was reported in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 10% with everolimus alone (13% vs 2% grade 3). Blood pressure should be controlled prior to treatment and monitored throughout. Withhold dose for grade 3 hypertension despite optimal antihypertensive therapy; resume at reduced dose when controlled at grade ≤2. Discontinue for life-threatening hypertension In DTC, cardiac dysfunction was reported in 7% of patients on LENVIMA vs 2% with placebo (2% vs 0% grade ≥3). In RCC, cardiac dysfunction was reported in 10% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 6% with everolimus alone (3% vs 2% grade 3). Monitor for signs/symptoms of cardiac decompensation. Withhold for grade 3 cardiac dysfunction. Resume at reduced dose or discontinue based on severity and persistence of cardiac dysfunction. Discontinue for grade 4 cardiac dysfunction In DTC, arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 5% of patients on LENVIMA vs 2% with placebo (3% vs 1% grade ≥3). In RCC, arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 2% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 6% with everolimus alone (2% vs 4% grade ≥3). Discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming LENVIMA after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established, and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months Across clinical studies in which 1,160 patients received LENVIMA monotherapy, hepatic failure (including fatal events) was reported in 3 patients and acute hepatitis in 1 patient. In DTC, ALT and AST increases (grade ≥3) occurred in 4% and 5% of patients on LENVIMA, respectively, vs 0% with placebo. In RCC, ALT and AST increases (grade ≥3) occurred in 3% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 2% and 0% with everolimus alone, respectively. Monitor liver function before initiation, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold dose for liver impairment grade ≥3 until resolved to grade 0, 1, or baseline. Resume at reduced dose or discontinue based on severity/persistence of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue for hepatic failure In DTC, proteinuria was reported in 34% of patients on LENVIMA vs 3% with placebo (11% vs 0% grade 3). In RCC, proteinuria was reported in 31% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 14% with everolimus alone (8% vs 2% grade 3). Monitor for proteinuria before and during treatment. Withhold dose for proteinuria ≥2 g/24 h. Resume at reduced dose when proteinuria is <2 g/24 h. Discontinue for nephrotic syndrome In RCC, diarrhea was reported in 81% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 34% with everolimus alone (19% vs 2% grade ≥3). Initiate prompt medical management for the development of diarrhea. Monitor for dehydration. Withhold dose for diarrhea grade ≥3. Resume at a reduced dose when diarrhea resolves to grade 1 or baseline. Discontinue for grade 4 diarrhea despite medical management In DTC, events of renal impairment were reported in 14% of patients on LENVIMA vs 2% with placebo (3% vs 1% grade ≥3). In RCC, events of renal impairment were reported in 18% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 12% with everolimus alone (10% vs 2% grade ≥3). Withhold LENVIMA for grade 3 or 4 renal failure/impairment. Resume at reduced dose or discontinue, depending on severity/persistence of renal impairment. Active management of diarrhea and any other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms should be initiated for grade 1 events In DTC, events of GI perforation or fistula were reported in 2% of patients on LENVIMA vs 0.8% with placebo. In RCC, events of GI perforation, abscess, or fistula (grade ≥3) were reported in 2% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 0% with everolimus alone. Discontinue in patients who develop GI perforation or life-threatening fistula In DTC, QT/QTc interval prolongation was reported in 9% of patients on LENVIMA vs 2% with placebo (2% vs 0% >500 ms). In RCC, QTc interval increases >60 ms were reported in 11% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus (6% >500 ms) vs 0% with everolimus alone. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities in all patients. Withhold dose for QTc interval prolongation >500 ms. Resume at reduced dose when QTc prolongation resolves to baseline In DTC, hypocalcemia (grade ≥3) was reported in 9% of patients on LENVIMA vs 2% with placebo. In RCC, hypocalcemia (grade ≥3) was reported in 6% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 2% with everolimus alone. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary. Interrupt and adjust LENVIMA as necessary Across clinical studies in which 1,160 patients received LENVIMA monotherapy, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) was reported in 4 patients. Withhold LENVIMA for RPLS until fully resolved. Resume at reduced dose or discontinue based on the severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms In DTC, hemorrhagic events occurred in 35% of patients on LENVIMA vs 18% with placebo (2% vs 3% grade ≥3). The most frequently reported hemorrhagic event was epistaxis (11% grade 1, 1% grade 2). Discontinuation due to hemorrhagic events occurred in 1% of patients on LENVIMA. There was 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage case among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had central nervous system metastases at baseline. In RCC, hemorrhagic events occurred in 34% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 26% with everolimus alone (8% vs 2% grade ≥3). The most frequently reported hemorrhagic event was epistaxis (23% for LENVIMA + everolimus vs 24% with everolimus alone). There was 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage case. Discontinuation due to hemorrhagic events occurred in 3% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus. Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold dose for grade 3 hemorrhage. Resume at reduced dose or discontinue based on severity/persistence of hemorrhage. Discontinue for grade 4 hemorrhage In DTC patients with normal baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), elevation of TSH level above 0.5 mU/L was observed postbaseline in 57% of patients on LENVIMA vs 14% with placebo. In RCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 2% with everolimus alone. In RCC patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed postbaseline in 60% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 3% with everolimus alone.

Ogg October 15, 2016 11:35 am EST Print Email Tweet The week of October 14 was a volatile one, considering how there has been a lack of volatility most of the summer. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) ended the week down roughly 102 points at 18,138.38. Still, investors have become prone to buying their favorite stocks any time the market sells off. High valuations, and even the notion that this bull market is now seven and a half years old, have not thwarted investor appetites. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning, and this ends up being hundreds of analyst calls each week. Our goal is to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these reports cover stocks to buy that are blue chip stocks. When investors hear the word “blue chip” it generally means DJIA stocks with solid dividends. Sometimes this also refers to former Dow stocks, or stocks that might become Dow stocks. Here, we stick by the traditional Dow stocks. Here were six solid Buy ratings (which includes equivalent Outperform or Overweight ratings) issued in the blue chips during the week of October 14. Just remember: sometimes analysts are wrong, and even the great blue chip stocks come with no guarantees. Apple Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been on a serious recovery. The iPhone maker is winning from Samsung’s smartphone recall and cancellation, and Apple finished up 3.1% this week at $117.66, for a 13% gain so far in 2016. It turns out that multiple analysts raised their targets, either on share price targets or on their estimates for sales and earnings. 24/7 Wall St. tracked several major analyst calls this last week, with Credit Suisse even calling for $150 per share next year, and it even shows a trend of more upgraded estimates the prior week as well. Apple has a 52-week trading range of $89.47 to $123.82, and it has a Thomson Reuters consensus analyst price target of $127.59. Most investors do not buy Apple for its yield, but the company is buying back stock rapidly, and it still comes with almost a 2% dividend yield to boot. Caterpillar It would appear that Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) is in a stealth turnaround. The company’s numbers are still bad, and the trends look in decline from prior growth years. Still, sometimes the investing community treats value and serious stock sell-offs differently. Amazingly, Caterpillar is the top performing Dow stock of 2016, with a gain of 33% so far this year, and it still pays a 3.5% dividend yield. Caterpillar was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $112 price target at Goldman Sachs on October 11. The prior close was $88.22, and Caterpillar ended the week at $87.67. Its 52-week range is $56.36 to $89.87, and its consensus analyst target is $77.37. Investors need to consider that this is the highest analyst target of all now, and Goldman Sachs expects margin expansion and an earnings recovery much greater than investors have expected. Merck While Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) remains close to a 52-week high, investors should not overlook the fact that it is up 20.5% so far in 2016. Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock to Buy from Neutral on October 13. Its price objective was raised to $70 from $57 as well, and that is above the $67.79 consensus target. Note that the Merrill Lynch call is based on compelling data for its Keytruda first line lung cancer drug. The firm sees it becoming the standard of care and having 25% share. Merck has a 52-week trading range of $47.97 to $64.86, and its dividend yield is right a 3%. Nike Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE) has been down and out in 2016, logging the worst performance this year of all 30 Dow stocks with close to a 17% negative return. That isn’t the growth engine we were used to. After the latest earnings report offered disappointing futures sales, Susquehanna decided that enough is enough. The firm raised Nike’s rating to Positive from Neutral on October 11, and it assigned a $63 price target too. The prior closing price was $51.79. The consensus price target now is $63.71, though Thomson Reuters showed a consensus of closer to $67 just 90 days ago. Nike close out the week at $51.62 a share, and its 52-week range is $51.48 to $68.19. The dividend yield is currently only 1.25%, but the company has much more room to grow that payout in the years ahead. Procter & Gamble It may still be a boring blue chip in consumer products, but Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) just keeps chugging along. Now it has a brand sale under its belt in the long road of restructuring into a slimmer and more core-focused company. Independent research firm Argus came out swinging here, saying that the street is grossly undervaluing the growth prospects and underestimating its value. Argus raised the stock to a Buy from Hold on October 12, and it assigned a $103 price target as well. This target compared with a prior close of $88.54, as well as a 52-week trading range of $73.50 to $90.33. The consensus price target at Thomson Reuters is $92.28. Procter & Gamble still comes with an impressive 4% dividend yield, and it has been among the few 50-year dividend gainers and likely will keep raising that payout ahead.

The report forecasts the global metabolic disorders therapeutics market to grow at a CAGR of 4.62% during the period 2016-2020. Strategic collaborations and acquisitions will be a key trend for market growth. M&A are usually intended to enhance a company's product portfolio and increase the acquiring company's market penetration. Established pharmaceutical companies acquire late-stage products from small companies, where the product's efficacy has already been demonstrated, cutting down on initial R&D expenditure. Joint ventures between different companies enable the use of technical expertise from both companies for mutual benefits, allowing the use of regulatory and developmental experience gained by one company to support the pipeline candidates of the other. It also ensures the in-flow of adequate funds for R&D. According to the report, increase in academia-industry collaborations for drug development will be a key driver for market growth. The key players in the global diabetes therapeutics market are increasingly extending their support to academic institutions to facilitate the R&D of innovative products for the treatment of diabetes. Such collaborations enable the amalgamation of research expertise of educational institutions with the marketing intelligence of pharma companies, as well as provides funds for conducting trials. Further, the report states that low compliance and adherence rates will be a challenge for the market. Despite the availability of various treatment options for metabolic disorders, there exist significant unmet medical needs because of the presence of adverse effects with the existing treatment options. Most of the therapies used for metabolic disorders should be continued on a long-term basis. Adverse effects lead to low compliance and adherence rates for these therapies. Also, the availability of alternative treatment options will discourage compliance.

McAdams May 16, 2016 The Lessons of Henry Kissinger Jeffrey Goldberg Nov 10, 2016 James Hamblin Oct 14, 2016 Health Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size This week the medical-aid organization Doctors Without Borders refused a donation of one million vaccine doses from the pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer. It offered inoculations against a commonly fatal pneumonia—deliverable immediately, to people in need anywhere—and the doctors said no. The decision is the result of a fundamental impasse in modern healthcare. The heart of the refusal—which could well imperil children who would have received those vaccines—is a principled stand against the extremely high cost of many vaccines. Pfizer tells me that their revenue from the vaccine in question last year was $6.245 billion. (That’s the same as the revenue of United Airlines.) The enormous business includes much profit from countries that are willing and able to pay inflated prices for a life-saving vaccine. It necessarily leaves others behind. How has this system come to such a head that humanitarian doctors would refuse a million vaccines on principle? The medical background: The leading cause of death in children is pneumonia. In the lungs, alveoli fill with pus, which blocks the passage of oxygen. A person is essentially suffocated by their own immune response. This happens to 1.4 million kids every year. The process is often the result of one bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae. Decades ago, scientists were able to isolate proteins and carbohydrates from S. pneumoniae and expose children to only those benign molecules, instead of the entire bacteria. The kids’ bodies learned to recognize and destroy S. pneumoniae without having to be exposed to it. Pfizer’s modern iteration of this vaccine is known among doctors as PCV13. It’s recommended to be given to all children by medical authorities worldwide. Since its introduction, cases of severe Strep pneumonia in the U.S. have gone down by 88 percent. Elsewhere, death from pneumonia remains commonplace, especially in subsaharan Africa and southeast Asia. This is where much work is done by Doctors Without Borders—known outside the U.S. as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)—to provide care. So I was initially shocked to hear MSF refused a million PCV13 doses from Pfizer, who seemed shocked themselves. “Pfizer is committed to making vaccines available to as many people as possible,” company spokesperson Sally Beatty told me by email, “particularly those needing emergency humanitarian assistance.” Beatty explained that Pfizer “strongly disagrees” with MSF’s decision, and that “to suggest that donations are not valuable defies logic.” Of course, the doctors do see donations as valuable—simply not worth the costs in this context, which transcends seemingly straightforward philanthropy and medical science. Pfizer sells its PCV13 pneumonia vaccine under the name Prevnar 13. Among the best-selling vaccines on the market, its technology is protected by multiple patents—not just on the final product, but also on the process by which the vaccine is made. This makes it difficult for competitors to produce anything comparable at all. The South Korean company SK Chemicals came close to producing an analogue, but Pfizer sued the company and was supported by the country’s Intellectual Property Tribunal in 2015. MSF has been trying to get their hands on Prevnar 13 since it was introduced in 2009, but the price has been too high. Outside of dire situations—as when the group purchased some Prevnar from pharmacies in Athens a few months ago (for 60 euros per dose)––the group has lacked the resources to purchase it. And this cost is the fundamental issue to Jason Cone, the executive director of Doctors Without Borders in the United States. He explained that donations from pharmaceutical companies are ineffective against a problem of this scale. While the donation would benefit people under the care of Doctors Without Borders immediately, accepting it could mean problems for others, and problems longer-term. Donations, he writes, are “often used as a way to make others ‘pay up.’ By giving the pneumonia vaccine away for free, pharmaceutical corporations can use this as justification for why prices remain high for others, including other humanitarian organizations and developing countries that also can’t afford the vaccine.” Which is to say that for a disease of this scale, isolated donations are inadequate. “I'm not absolutely against donations,” MSF’s vaccine pharmacist Alain Alsahani told me by phone from Paris. In cases of neglected disease where there is little or no market for a product, he explained, “donation becomes a more interesting option for some countries to get access. But in the case of PCV, that's not a solution at all, in any way.” In this case, to accept a donation is to accept the status quo in which health technology is beholden to the priorities and values of multinational monopolies and duopolies whose interests exceed simply finding a solvent path to technological progress and human wellbeing. Last year Pfizer returned $13.1 billion to its shareholders. By every estimate, Prevnar 13 is a “blockbuster” contributor to the company’s profits, though they declined to share specific numbers. Prices paid by patients, insurers, and aid organizations can remain high in part because of this sort of opacity. Last year MSF determined that a single dose of the vaccine—a complete course requires three to four doses over time—runs $63.70 in Morocco and $67.30 in Tunisia, while it’s somehow cheaper in France at $58.40. (In the U.S., the group put the cost at closer to $136.) “The companies really operate on opacity of price data,” explained Kate Elder, the Vaccines Policy Advisor at MSF. People in the dark have no bargaining power. (Not unlike office workers negotiating salaries.) Isn’t there at least some list price for reference, I asked, like the price of a car? “What they try to avoid at all costs—no pun intended—is to avoid governments or other purchasers doing price referencing,” she added. “They won’t even quote us a price. So step one is them being a business and selling us a product.” I asked Pfizer if they would be open to a deal to make the vaccine affordable to humanitarian organizations like MSF. Beatty wrote, “We are actively exploring a number of new options to enable greater access to our pneumococcal vaccine … to aid NGOs facing humanitarian emergency settings.” I asked if that meant changing the price for MSF, and she copied and pasted the same response. One deal that Pfizer will talk about, even unprompted, is that with the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), an organization that purchases vaccines in bulk on behalf of poor countries. In 2009, Pfizer agreed to sell Prevnar to GAVI for $9.15 per course. That price is really what MSF wants, and has been requesting for years. So I put it to Pfizer directly, one final time: Why can’t you give the $9.15 price to NGOs? After all, their patients represent a relatively small part of the multibillion-dollar market for a vaccine that’s supposed to be given to all people. Pfizer’s representative didn’t answer the question directly, but again pasted “we are actively exploring a number of new options to enable greater access to our pneumococcal vaccine to aid NGOS facing humanitarian emergency settings.” Until that active exploration bears fruit, MSF is forced to choose the less imperfect option that will yield the greatest good. In the short term, does MSF’s decision threaten the wellbeing of children who might have received the donated vaccines? “We're taking every step we can to minimize that risk,” Elder said. “But our priority is to vaccinate as many children as possible in the long term.” In medicine, sometimes do no harm is an imperfect principle. It’s only possible to do the least harm. And Pfizer disagrees with MSF about how to do the least harm. In a cold phone call to my cell, Beatty reiterated that the company sees donation as a humanitarian endeavor. “Is policy really more important than the opportunity to vaccinate and protect vulnerable people in emergency settings?” In another email, she reiterated that the donation offer is still on the table, deliverable immediately, and that Pfizer would offer to store the doses prior to distribution, if adequate storage for the entire one million is not available. I felt like somehow I had become the negotiator. I’m still trying to identify the impasse for Pfizer, but I got the impression the standoff would persist. And its resolution could establish a precedent across the industry, because more than this dangerous pneumonia is at stake. Many new vaccines are still made by only one or two manufacturers, and monopolies and duopolies are a real factor in why prices remain high. The HPV vaccine is only made by GSK and Merck. The rotavirus vaccine against diarrhea (the second leading cause of childhood death worldwide) is only made by GSK and Merck. The new malaria vaccine is only made by GSK. If there is a reason for people to be concerned about vaccines, it is a problem with people not having access, and a legal and economic system that keep prices high. The spirit of MSF’s decision highlights the same principle behind herd immunity: Vaccines are not about individuals. They are not even about individual organizations. They’re microcosm of all health: We’re in this together. In an attempt to rectify consumer blindness, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently established a vaccine price and procurement database initiative, where all purchasers can share what they know, but there's still a scarcity of data. And on Wednesday, Elder was in Geneva at a meeting that WHO convened this week on vaccination in emergencies. There they proposed a humanitarian mechanism where manufacturers can participate to sell their vaccines to NGOs and others vaccinating in emergency settings at further reduced cost. Elder reported that GSK was the first to commit, and Pfizer did not, but was represented at the meeting. “So the onus is on them, from MSF and from WHO and UNICEF,” said Elder. “The ball is in their court.” Share Tweet Comments Latest Video The Art of Interviewing Henry Kissinger Jeffrey Goldberg on his conversations with the controversial American statesman Leah Varjacques Nov 11, 2016 About the Author James Hamblin, MD, is a senior editor at The Atlantic.

Most Popular Presented by Carlo Allegri / Reuters The Radical Anti-Conservatism of Stephen Bannon Conor Friedersdorf Donald Trump’s campaign manager wants to destroy the left. And the GOP nominee is just the most recent vessel of convenience in his consequences-be-damned crusade. Stephen Bannon, who recently took over as Donald Trump’s campaign manager, once gave an interview, while promoting his 2010 film, “Fire From the Heartland: the Awakening of the Conservative Woman,” where he argued that Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, and Ann Coulter pose an existential threat to the left. “These women cut to the heart of the progressive narrative,” he explained. “That's one of the unintended consequences of the women's liberation movement––that, in fact, the women that would lead this country would be feminine, they would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children. They wouldn't be a bunch of dykes that came from the 7 Sisters schools." The quote captures a key attribute of the former U.S. Navy officer, whose stints at Georgetown University, Harvard Business School, and Goldman Sachs afforded a foothold at the core of America’s elite, enabling him to launch a film career that began with a Sean Penn collaboration before segueing into polemic right-wing documentaries.

They won’t change anything, though. This article was updated on November 13, 2016 at 4:22 p.m. This chart has been making the rounds on Twitter these past few days: Turns out it's not a Trump insurgency, but a Clinton collapse. A graph that cuts straight through today's punditry ... pic.twitter.com/x41cyyy2XI — Jonathan Webber (@jonathanwebber) November 9, 2016 Donald Trump didn’t actually flip many Democrats, the thinking goes. Instead, Hillary Clinton failed to turn out liberal voters who had previously voted for Barack Obama. It’s a tempting narrative for smarting progressives, as it maintains status quo thinking—Clinton’s unlikable!—and removes any culpability on the part of the Democrats for missing a massive shift in the electorate. In other words, it’s Clinton’s fault, not theirs, that Trump won the presidency. Continue Reading Reuters / Jonathan Ernst The Iconic Hillary Clinton Caitlin Frazier In defeat, the politician may find a status that had eluded her in victory—becoming a symbol for all the women who see themselves in her struggles. Hillary Clinton hasn’t made any public appearances since her concession speech midday Wednesday, but she can be spotted in the wild. That’s what happened to Margo Gerster, a dispirited Hillary supporter when she was hiking with her daughter to cheer herself up near Chappaqua, New York. Gerster heard a rustling and out of the woods came Hillary and Bill Clinton and their dogs. You may have to count on a chance encounter like this one to spot Clinton. She’s unlikely to be much in the public eye over the next months. And she may need the rest after an exhausting and savage campaign that resulted in a verdict her supporters neither hoped for nor predicted. Although Clinton carried the popular vote on Election Day, the Electoral College delivered a decisive victory to Donald Trump. The so-called Blue Wall states that went for Trump (Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin) exposed embarrassing cracks in the Democrats’ campaign strategy. Add to that the humiliation of having to concede a presidential race for a second time in 8 years. Hillary Clinton is done. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Win McNamee / Getty The Lessons of Henry Kissinger Jeffrey Goldberg The legendary and controversial statesman criticizes the Obama Doctrine, talks about the main challenges for the next president, and explains how to avoid war with China. Author’s note (November 10, 2016): Over the past several months, I’ve interviewed Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, numerous times on the subject of America’s role in the world. Our conversations took place before this week’s election, but were informed by the foreign-policy differences between the candidates. The December 2016 issue of The Atlantic includes my article on these conversations, which you will  find published below. In addition, a full rendering of our several interviews, on subjects including the future of Russia, the rise of China, and the chaos of the Middle East, can be found here. On Wednesday, the day the country, and the world, were just beginning to absorb the shock of Donald Trump’s victory, I spoke with Kissinger by telephone to get his postelection thoughts. He told me that he was expecting other nations, particularly the great powers, to enter a period of intense study, in order to understand how they should respond to a Trump presidency. He also said he expected the Islamic State, or other similarly minded jihadist organizations, to test Trump early by launching attacks, in order to provoke a reaction (or, he suggested, an overreaction). Continue Reading Eric Nyquist The Case Against Cats Britt Peterson The animal so many dote on ranks among the world’s most destructive predators. New Zealand’s recent announcement of a plan to eradicate all invasive predators, including feral cats, sparked an immediate response—and not in defense of the stoat, up there with cats among the top 100 on the Global Invasive Species list. “Cat murdering New Zealand[ers] are for the birds,” one commenter vented on The Washington Post’s website. “Removing cats from an area is a futile effort—one that cannot succeed,” another warned. When Australia announced a plan in 2015 to cull 2 million feral cats, the singer Morrissey declared them “2 million smaller versions of Cecil the lion.” The actress Brigitte Bardot called the cull “animal genocide.” Needless to say, no celebrity outrage or online indignation has greeted New Zealand’s or Australia’s expensive and long-standing rat-eradication programs. Continue Reading Carlos Barria / Reuters Women Aren't Responsible for Hillary Clinton’s Defeat Clare Foran The media has created a misleading narrative in a rush to assign blame for the outcome of the election. Women failed Hillary Clinton—and none more so than white women. That idea has congealed into conventional wisdom in the aftermath of the election. Vanity Fair published an article titled: “Why Hillary Clinton Couldn’t Win Over Female Voters” while Time ran a story headlined: “Why So Many Women Abandoned Hillary Clinton.” Slate declared: “White Women Sold Out the Sisterhood and the World by Voting for Trump.” Samantha Bee had harsh words for white women, too. “A majority of white women, faced with the historic choice between the first female president, and a vial of weaponized testosterone said, ‘I’ll take Option B. I just don’t like her,’” she said, scathingly, in an episode of Full Frontal. The accusation leveled at women voters is clear: They didn’t just betray the woman who tried to shatter the ultimate glass ceiling, they also failed each other. Continue Reading Kena Betancur / AFP / Getty ‘I Voted for the Middle Finger, the Wrecking Ball’ Chris Bodenner None A Trump voter describes his worldview in great detail, and despite his blunt quote above, his note is more nuanced and perhaps more relatable than you think: I am Southern. I am white. I am a male. I was raised Roman Catholic and now go to a Methodist church regularly with my wife and kids. I value the 2nd Amendment but do not own a gun. Every male in my family, save me, is currently serving or has served in the U.S. military. I stand at the pledge of allegiance, and stand and sing with the anthem. I live near streets named after Stonewall Jackson and Strom Thurmond and know Tillman Hall was named after a racist populist who carried a pitchfork. Until recently, I attended field trips with my kids to our state capitol where the Confederate flag still flew, and I am genuinely glad we finally took it down. I have a Masters degree. My kids go to public school with kids of all races, colors, and creeds. Our neighborhood has immigrant families, mixed-race families, minorities, and same-sex couples. Our sports teams are multi-cultural, diverse, and play beautifully together, on and off the field. I have neither the time, energy, or room in my heart for hatred, bigotry, or racism. I work hard and sacrifice for my family. I expect everyone to do the same and believe most do. I am romantic enough to still believe that America was created and intended to be a meritocracy. I am intelligent enough to understand the realty that not every one starts off in life from the same spot and not all of us will reach the attain the same levels of success—however you define it. I also know that living right now, right here, is the greatest advantage any man, women, or child in the history of humankind has ever had. I understand a ruling class exists in our country and contrary to what many believe, my white skin does not provide me access to it. I started off with advantages others didn’t—many of which were afforded me by my parents sacrifices, judgment, and toil. They stayed away from drugs. The waited until marriage to have children. They moved to chase a better life, took night classes at local community colleges to earn credentials. They passed on new cars for used ones, sewed to repair clothes, declined cable television, ate in, not out—and saved every day and every night. They taught me right from wrong, first impressions matter, there is no substitute for hard work and no limits on achievement. I love working people who answer the alarm clock. I love parents who make sure their kids will have it better than they do. I respect people too busy paying the light bill to keep up with “the news.” I do not hate on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender, or faith in any way shape or form. I like liberals, conservatives, and independents. I do not hate Obama or Hillary; I do not know them. I did not deny Clinton my vote because she lacks a penis. I appreciate the incredible difficulties that surround an unwanted pregnancy, marvel at foster parents and adoption, but detest even the thought of abortion. But I have read a history book or two, so I get the lessons of prohibition.  I know we can’t just “turn the switch off” on abortion and I know a red herring when I see one. Abortion isn’t going away because we elected a Republican. It just isn’t.        I know the Clintons do not really care about me. I know Trump could not care less. I know Morning Joe will look the same tomorrow and the day after, and Fox News will put even more colorful graphics and pretty anchors on next week. I know Rush is a buffoon, and Al Sharpton is too. I know some schools are better than others, some students are too, and not everyone is destined to Jay Z or Jordan or Bill Gates. I know life has meaning beyond $ and I can be happy with what I have—and most importantly, ok with what I don’t. I can dream big and one day maybe design a better duck call that gets me my own TV show or make a loom for kids to make rubber band bracelets that makes me a fortune. America fosters those dreams. I voted for the wrecking ball—and I feel better about it now than I did in the booth.   Continue Reading Alex Brandon / AP The Trump Takeover The Editors After a shocking upset, the president-elect and his party prepare for next year.

They will now have the power of the federal government to help them. Saddam Hussein was allied with al-Qaeda, and helped finance the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The Hussein regime had sought uranium from Niger. Iraq had obtained aluminum tubes to be used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. All of those assertions turned out to be false. But they echoed throughout the press in the months-long run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and only after the war turned to disaster did the media engage in soul-searching and self-criticism. And even then, many sought to deflect blame. Judith Miller, the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter whose front-page story about the aluminum tubes bolstered the case for war in Iraq explained: “My job isn’t to assess the government’s information and be an independent intelligence analyst myself.

The growth of the global market is largely driven by increasing consumption of meat and milk, and increasing zoonotic and food borne diseases. Due to growing health concern of related animals and their increasing number, the healthcare expenses in farms are surging globally. Animal farms are increasing globally, due to growing demand for protein rich foods, such as milk, eggs and meat. Increasing trend of pet adoption is another key factor driving the growth of the global market. The declining research and development productivity and growth of generic and OTC drugs for animal care are the key trend witnessed in the global market. The declining research and development productivity is leading to the maturity of animal pharmaceutical product portfolio. The fewer new chemical entity approvals are limiting the opportunities for key manufacturers to expand their portfolio in animal pharmaceuticals market. The low productivity of research and development increases the competition among the key manufacturers. Explore Report Description with Detailed TOC at: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/animal-pharmaceuticals-market Among the different types of animal pharmaceutical products, the ectoparasiticides generated largest revenue in the global animal pharmaceuticals market in 2015. High prevalence of animals affected with ectoparasites is the key factor driving the growth of the ectoparasiticides market. The bronchodilators market would witness fastest growth during the forecast period. Based on animal type, the largest revenue was generated from the sales of animal pharmaceuticals for companion animals in 2015. Whereas, the animal pharmaceuticals market for production animals would witness faster growth during the forecast period.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Prescription drug prices are out of control Posted on October 15, 2016 by Brad Hoppmann If you’re one of the 3-in-5 Americans who take prescription drugs, your pocketbook may be getting crushed as a result. In the U.S., we now spend over $309 billion on prescription drugs every single year. That’s a rise of over 38% in just the last two years! This staggering price increase isn’t because people are using more meds, though. It’s because pharmaceutical companies can get away with charging more. And hospitals, doctors and patients who need the medicine have little choice except to pay up. Both generic and branded drug prices are increasing as well, eliminating once-more-affordable alternatives. And the most-expensive drugs aren’t necessarily new and innovative miracle cures. In fact, many are commonly used and have been on the market for decades. For Americans, prescription drugs are becoming one of the biggest financial burdens we face. Especially for retirees who could never have predicted or planned for this. You really only have two options when a medicine you take increases in price: 1. Make monetary sacrifices elsewhere to afford the new rate, or 2. Stop taking the drugs altogether and face the consequences. For most people, option two isn’t even an option. If you’ve been reading my Afternoon Editions for any length of time, you know that I am a fan of free markets, free minds and the free choice of individuals to do what they want with their hard-earned money. That also means having a healthy dose of skepticism when it comes to government solutions that come in the forms of more laws and regulations. Especially when the biggest beneficiaries aren’t the citizens themselves … Consider that Big Pharma has spent $3.4 billion in federal lobbying since 1998 — more than any other industry — to get lawmakers on the payroll and make sure no one gets in their way. One of the most-famous cases of pharmaceutical price-gouging came in late 2015. That was when Martin Shkreli, now-former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, raised the price of the drug Daraprim by 5,000%. Although price hikes like this have happened before, Shkreli instantly became public enemy No. 1 for his complete lack of empathy toward consumers. Unapologetic to this day, the former CEO doubled down on his decision by saying, “I would have raised prices even higher.” Related story: A Smirk of Defiance, or Just Dumb Hubris? Daraprim is used to treat a rare condition known as toxoplasmosis. It is only prescribed to around 2,000 patients in the U.S. For as notorious as Shkreli has become, not that many people use Daraprim and thus were mostly affected by the increase. Then there is pharmaceutical supplier Mylan, which took the price-hiking practice much further when it raised the prices of its popular allergen injection, the EpiPen. Mylan acquired the decades-old product in 2007 when pharmacies paid less than $100 for a two-pen set. Since then, the company has been steadily raising the price of this life-saving device. Related story: Price-gouging; the Senator’s Daughter; Cover from Washington In 2009, a pharmacy paid $103.50 for a set. By July 2013 the price was up to $264.50, and it rose 75% to $461 by last May. This May, the price spiked again to $608.61. Unlike the small group effected by the Daraprim increase, 3.6 million Americans were prescribed EpiPens last year. This type of price hike has a much greater impact and has affected the livelihood of millions of families in the U.S. Meanwhile, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch’s annual compensation has soared more than 700%, to $19 million. These examples, while extreme, are far from unusual … Take a look at some of the other recent price increases involving the most prescribed drugs in America …  Pfizer’s pain medication Lyrica jumped 45% on a per-prescription basis between 2014 and 2013, according to Medicare data.  Lantus, a popular form of insulin, jumped 41% on a per-prescription basis, reaching $403 in 2014 from $285 in the prior year.  Merck’s cholesterol medication, Zetia, had a 21% jump in per-prescription prices in 2014, rising to $290.  Abilify, used to treat a number of psychiatric illnesses, rose 17% in the last year. It’s not like this is happening behind closed doors, either. But there is something we can do about it. And it starts at the ballot box. Now, I know many of you are frustrated with what’s happening at the national political level, and I don’t blame you. However, there are state and local races where you can also make your voice heard. California is voting this upcoming November on Proposition 61, which would enact various forms of price regulation. A similar type of bill is being voted on in Ohio in 2017.

Happy and healthy investing, Brad Hoppmann Your thoughts on “Prescription drug prices are out of control” Books says: October 15, 2016 at 9:14 am My daughter has very bad health, goes to doctors often, and requires prescriptions. She is a low income person, but not low enough for Medicaid. Her Rx costs are killing her and killing us, since we try to help her out. The only thing good in this picture is the rule of Obamacare that insurance companies can’t dump you for pre-existing health issues, or she would be totally screwed. The obscene pay of CEO’s is causing much disgust in the average person. Reply David Broomhall says: October 15, 2016 at 9:52 am You may not want to call a ballot proposition to lower drug prices government interference in free markets, but that’s what it is. Propositions allow citizens to enact legislation that the politicians are too bought-and-paid for to enact on their own. And this proposition doesn’t go far enough. Why should we pay higher prices for drugs manufactured in the US than citizens in Canada and many other countries pay? Contrary to what you believe, there really are things that governments can do to improve the lives of its citizens that cannot be achieved through free markets. Read the section on market failure in most any basic economics textbook for the conditions under which government action may be improve markets. We may disagree about when and under what conditions government action leads to improvement, but I doubt we’d disagree that there are situations in which government action is an improvement. The list is long, and includes things like safety belts, pollution control, standards (how do you know you get a gallon of gas when you buy a gallon of gas?), insider trading, food labeling, etc. If you want to live without these things go live in a banana republic. Reply Duncan says: October 18, 2016 at 2:37 pm Don’t worry we are fast closing in on being a “banana republic’ ! Reply Deborah says: October 15, 2016 at 10:08 am We went to Mexico for a few weeks last year. While there I thought I’d would find out how much an in hailer I use cost there. This is a very common drug, an old drug used by many. Here the cost is well over 300 dollars in Mexico 35 dollars US. I was one astounded person how can this be? I mentioned this to my doctor and the answer to me was that it is agnist the law to bring back drugs from a forgien country please don’t mention this to me again. Truly we have no hope here in the US they the Gov would have us starve, lose our homes and become a ward of the STATE rather than address this problem. Reply Bob says: October 15, 2016 at 10:08 am Drug companies charge what they want because as they say “nobody pays for their drugs”. they are paid for by welfare or insurance. Do away with both; make everyone responsible for their own drug costs. If the prescriber writes for a $200 rx the patient will likely go back to the prescriber and ask for something more reasonable pricewise. When this is repeated enough times the prescriber gets smarter and stops writing for needlessly expensive drugs. When the drug companies can’t sell the over priced drugs I bet prices come down. Reply David says: October 15, 2016 at 10:16 am Ironically, over the counter drugs and vitamins cost in addition to the RX prescriptions hurt us too. My wife had bariatric surgery 6 years ago. She must take daily vitamins and special RX that works with a golf ball size stomach. Bottom line, through Medicare our RX cost less than over the counter drugs! Reply alan rodrigo says: October 15, 2016 at 10:28 am increase of prescription drugs prices are unacceptable at all.It is very unfair for these pharmaceutical companies to increase the drugs prices as and when they want to increase the companies profits by keeping patients life at a risk and withdraw heavy pay check at the expense of patients.My request to those CEOS is think and act as a human being and help fellow human beings in need of help not act like, Shylock like attitude asking !flesh of pound for flesh of pound!Last but not least Earn to live but not live to earn. Reply CHRIS KARSA says: October 15, 2016 at 10:50 am It is time for individual States to enact legislation to curb corporate greed and overreach. Congress is bought and paid for, members often pushing through legislation that has the sole purpose of increasing the corporations’ bottom line. We can not expect CEO s of corporations to act any differently than what has been seen. Get involved before corporations bankrupt all of us! Reply greg dillon says: October 15, 2016 at 11:03 am this is a perfect example of the rights old tired mantra ” if we would just get rid of government controls and let free enterprise take command the country will prosper and we will all be financially rewarded” which is a load of you know what as we watch ceo,s income go thru the roof. because of corporate greed we do need government control so the sick and elderly can continue to live! Reply Bob Cornelius says: October 15, 2016 at 12:14 pm Brad, I”m confused. First, you make the case that government regulation has been hijacked by the drug companies. Presumably this has raised the bar for entry into the market and stifled competition. Then you seem to advocate price controls, which always lead to shortages. Government meddling is the problem, not the solution. Sure, regulation of pharmaceuticals is necessary, but it must be fair, efficient and transparent. Reply Mel, rph says: October 15, 2016 at 2:10 pm I have been a pharmacist for 44 years and you are right..excessive price raises and control over market forces have been going on forever..some drugs up 40x. Never effective pushback from society. To make it worse you’re right the major drug cos are gobbling up their generic competitors and rapidly raising prices on most all products. Their money-buying influence on decision-maker is also obscene. Society SHOULD NOT be held hostage by this industry. Price controls are SO LONG overdue. It’s no wonder the public distrusts our elected officials. They are part of this HUGE growing prices. Its interesting big pharmacy has kept the best source of affordable decision making out of the hands of pharmacists..the most unbiased source of good therapy.

My son in law is losing his battle with cancer . He asked a doctor at Mayo Clinic about a newer, proven, treatment , doctors response , “why are you asking , you couldn’t afford it anyway” . People are more and more interested in homeopathic medicine now but government is trying to shut that down due to drug companies paying them to do so . Reply Larry says: October 15, 2016 at 7:15 pm Rather than more regulation I wonder why competitors don’t come along and sell the same drugs at cheaper prices. Do these companies have patents that disallow that? Surely there are alternatives in a lot of cases. I suspect that the heavy regulation from FDA and Obamacare contribute to this situation by making it very difficult to offer cheaper or alternative choices. Reply David Broomhall says: October 16, 2016 at 5:51 pm Well, Larry, I can think of two reasons why competitors don’t come along and sell the same drugs at cheaper prices. First, patent laws prevent all but the patent owner from manufacturing the drug for a certain number of years to encourage investment and innovation. If a drug company spent billions of dollars investing in a drug and another company could swoop in and manufacture it, no company would undertake the initial investment, and we would underinvest in drugs. The second reason is that when a drug comes off patent, other companies are allowed to manufacture the drug and undercut prices. However, since the drug patent owner stands to lose a lot of profit when there is competition, some drug companies will actually pay competitors not to manufacture a drug, thus allowing the patent owning company to keep prices high. It’s cheaper to pay a company not to manufacture than to compete with it. Why this is legal, I can’t say, but it sure should be. I suspect that the fact that the pharmaceutical industry spends more on lobbying than any other industry has something to do with it. Reply Dick Gustafon says: October 16, 2016 at 1:11 pm YES We need to do something;; Especially for drugs etc I suggest the GOVERNMENT = PEOPLE should NOT regulate.. BUT compete: make a manufacturing or bidding entity that SELLS at 150% of costs for any egregiously priced drug or other item especially health that is going on in the private sector; I’d be happy to suffer any start up/shut down costs; perhaps include a ramp down price schedule 500% -> 150% over 10 years for GENUINELY NEW in house developed drugs/products… MAKE COMPETITION WORK and have a generous reward UNDER THE GOV PRICE; Make it transparent ; what BETTER mission for the FDA?? Dick Gustafson genuinely NEW products developments Reply Loretta T says: October 16, 2016 at 9:22 pm my problem isn’t life or death but it sure makes me mad. hard to believe how greedy some people are. I have psoriasis. nothing that I will die of but my ointment has gone from $95 a 6mg tube in 2015 thanks to my drug insurance. I’m a senior. this year my prescription has gone up to $300 with my drug insurance. they pay 50% so the full charge is $600 a tube. noooo, this isn’t a life saving drug. btw, this is the GENERIC of the original drug. I fully intend on writing the ceo of this company and the cfo. I just haven’t decided whether I should write a letter and kill them with kindness or write one that tells them what I REALLY think. yes, I blame Washington for taking bribes. something HAS to be done and done soon.
