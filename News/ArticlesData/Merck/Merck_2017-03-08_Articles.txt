Lorie Volker gave her only son Braylen a telescope for Christmas, and taught him to find the spirit of his loved ones among the stars. Volker died at 6:52 p.m. on March 5, one year after being diagnosed with an aggressive bone cancer. "There was this beautiful star, it was huge and gorgeous and Braylen said 'there is my mama,' and pointed to the sky," said Abby Hildebrand, Volker's older sister and best friend.

What started as severe back pain spread cancer from her spine to her hips, right femur and several ribs before finally encroaching on her heart and lungs. Through a series of excruciating treatments, Volker's family and friends say she fought until her final breaths were spent. "We knew time was getting (short) and I told her 'you put up a really strong fight, you don't have to fight anymore,'" Hildebrand said. "Our whole family sat around her bed and told her we'll be okay. She just wanted to wait for us to say it was okay for her to truly be able to let go." Chemotherapy for sarcoma in the bone is one of the most painful treatments available, Volker said in January. "It leaves you close to the brink of death," she said. One regimen required her to stay at the hospital for 50 hours a week, leaving her unable to move for two weeks. Another made her brain bleed, causing hallucinations. Doctors had to stop the treatment to prevent lasting neurological damage. At times, she wasn't able to hold down a sip of water. Some days she closed her eyes to keep the room from spinning.  When five grueling rounds of treatment came and went unsuccessfully, a grassroots campaign led by hometown supporters convinced pharmaceutical company Merck to let Volker try a new FDA-approved therapy. Otsego residents had rallied behind Volker throughout her fight with cancer, hosting fundraisers and awareness events, creating videos and sharing her story through social media. When they heard of the drug, Keytruda, many posted directly on Merck's Facebook page, flooding it with appeals for help. On New Year's Day, Merck's vice president and head of oncology called with the good news. Merck clinical trials found Keytruda reduced the risk of progression or death by 50 percent compared to chemotherapy. Instead of attacking cancer cells directly, it attempts to stop cancer cells from evading T-cells that hunt them. Basically, the drug was intended to help Volker's immune system do what it's designed for; find and kill cancer cells. Volker said the treatment was a miracle. It wasn't enough. She was known as the "Honey Badger," a nickname inspired by the relentlessly tough mammal. Volker was a marine safety officer for the Macomb County Sheriff's Office and continued to work as strategic manager of global accounts for Office Depot during her treatment.

Volker is also a marine safety officer for the Macomb County Sheriff's Office and has worked as strategic manager of global accounts for Office Depot for the last 12 years.

Hildebrand said Volker told her she couldn't give up; too many people fought to make the treatment available. Against her oncologist's wishes, she took three doses of the drug, which left her hardly able to move. "Never once did her faith or her spirit waver, she never got angry or pity (for herself)," Hildebrand said. "In her heart she knew her life wouldn't be as long as everyone else's. My favorite memory (with her) was being able to spend every weekend with her for the last year of her life." Volker and her sister were born 13 months apart. The pair grew up like twins, Hildebrand said. "I wish everybody could experience the bond and relationship we had," she said. Edwina Hoonhorst, Volker's childhood friend and a South Carolina nurse, said Volker also handled her situation with grace; her positivity uplifted her loved ones in hard times. Volker's sister, mother and boyfriend John stayed by her side throughout the treatment. "She made you feel like you were the most important to her," Hoonhorst said. "She was the type of person you want your kids to be like. This world would be a better place with her in it." The last time they spoke, Hoonhorst said she and Volker spent the day laughing and enjoying each other's company. "It was the way I will always remember her," Hoonhorst said. "Not Lorie being sick, but that laugh and that huge beautiful smile." Hildebrand said she as fearless as her sister was, her legacy will be one of kindness and generosity.  Lorie Volker, 36, died this week after a year-long battle with an aggressive form of bone cancer. She is pictured here with her sister Abby Hildebrand. (Courtesy | Abby Hildebrand)Malachi Barrett | mbarret1@mlive.com  "Anyone who has ever crossed her path has been inspired by her in some way," Hildebrand said. "I truly thought she was a gift from God. Her heart was full when she knew she was helping someone else." Volker donated her body to science in the hope that it would give someone diagnosed with her disease a chance at life. Her family also plans to create a scholarship at Otsego High School in her honor. The Lorie Volker Honey Badger will be given to a selfless member of each graduating class, nominated by their peers. A celebration of Volker's life is planned on April 14th, what would have been her 37th birthday, instead of a funeral. "My heart has been so warmed by seeing the goodness of people," Volker said earlier this year. "Usually people see so much darkness in a disease, but it has been beautiful for me."   View Comments About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 MLive Media Group.

The three allegedly caused them to sell their shares for a substantially low price while hiding a planned exit deal the company conducted a year later, as well as other critical factors that affected the value of the shares. <p>The lawsuit is based on evidence collected by intelligence firm Black Cube. Arkin and Nusbaum were shareholders and directors at cCam and Rosen acted as the head of pharma at Arkin Holdings (an investment fund managed and owned by Mori Arkin), as well as a director in cCam until the exit deal took place in July 2015. Arkin and Nusbaum owned company Pontifax as well as OrbiMed and attorney Yuval Horn who allegedly represented cCam are also being sued. <p>In July 2015, cCam Biotherapeutics, which develops immunotherapies for treating different kinds of cancer, was sold to US pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. for $625 million. $95 million was paid in cash when the deal was done, and the balance was meant to be paid at a later stage, providing cCam met the milestones that were set. The company also obtained a breakthrough with regards to US FDA recognition for its flagship product, in a manner that impacted the potential value of the deal. <p>The plaintiffs, Gefen Biomed Investments and Meytav Technological Incubator, claim that Arkin, Nusbaum and the other defendants deliberately misled them, causing them to dispose of their shares in the company a year before the planned exit. They further claim that they concealed the negotiations with Merck & Co. and the fact that the flagship product was about to be approved by the FDA. <p>The lawsuit, filed by Advs. Guy Gissin, Yoel Freilich and Gadi Kay argues that Arkin and the other shareholders presented the minority shareholders with a false representation of cCam’s value, and pressured them through repeated talk about the need for capital injections and threats of dilution. Taking this false impression into account, Gefen and Meytav agreed to sell their shares in the company for just $780,000, while under the terms of the exit deal the shares’ value could have reached $100 million. <p>This claim states that it “deals, in a best case scenario of misleading, and in a worst case scenario, with a deliberate, pre-planned fraud initiated by the defendants or some of them, in attempt to rob the plaintiffs of their rights and while taking advantage of the additional information held by the defendants or some of them about the business potential of cCam Biotherapeutics and the value of the shares they held in the company." <p>The plaintiff companies claim that Arkin and others wrongly took advantage of the knowledge and experience they had, in order to create a false representation of cCam’s business potential, conceal crucial information from the plaintiffs against their liabilities and hide information from the board of directors of cCam itself. The plaintiffs further argue that the defendants created a troubling impression regarding cCam’s financing needs, in order to put false pressure on the minority shareholders and cause them to believe that they were required to inject large sums of money (which they did not have), should they wish to maintain their rights in the company. <p>As part of their claim, Gefen and Meytav state that “these deeds and wrongdoings committed by the defendants or some of them were aimed at getting the plaintiffs consent for a deal as part of which they would sell all their holdings in cCam for a negligible sum of money. If it was not for the deeds and wrongdoings of the defendants or some of them, and if the actual business potential of cCam, the FDA approval status of its products and the advance preparations for the exit deal were known to the plaintiffs - as well as the exit’s potential yield for the company and its shareholders - the plaintiffs would not have given their consent to move forward with the deal”. <p>Gefen and Meytav held 17.02% of the issued and paid up share capital of cCam until August 2014. In August 2014, an agreement was set with regards to the purchase of Gefen and Meytav’s shares in cCam by the companies owned by Arkin and others, allowing the latter to hold the entire issued and paid up share capital of cCam. <p>The claim suggests that Arkin and others concealed cCam’s business opportunities and full potential from the minority shareholders, in order to “make income at the expense of the plaintiffs and while initiating moves that were meant to rob the plaintiffs of their holdings in the company without getting anything substantial in return”. <p>It is also claimed that instead of acting as expected from a strategic partner, Arkin and the other defendants decided to make a wrongful use of their accumulated knowledge whilst hiding information from the plaintiffs and their representatives in cCam’s directors board. It is argued that the defendants’ representatives repeatedly approached Gefen and Meytav’s representatives in order to encourage them to sell their shares in cCam for sums that turned out to be completely unreasonable, considering the actual business potential that was later revealed to the plaintiffs. <p>The proposal to purchase cCam’s holdings was brought up during a breakfast meeting that took place in Turquoise Café in Herzliya in the third quarter of 2013. Participants at the meeting included Benny Sydon and Limor Cohen – directors at cCam on behalf of Gefen and Meytav, and Ran Nusbaum – a director in cCam and the representative of the defendants. <p>During the meeting and in response to Sydon and Cohen’s query about cCam’s cash situation and sustainability, Nusbaum was compelled to confirm that cCam could sustain itself until the end of 2015 without needing to raise any additional capital. Nusbaum was therefore informed that the defendants had no interest in selling their holdings in cCam. <p>However, the lawsuit claims that several, wrongful acts were made from that point onwards, in attempt to dismiss the plaintiffs’ rights, hide crucial information from them, mislead them and pressure them, until their holdings in cCam were eventually taken away from them. <p>It is argued that Gefen and Meytav were repeatedly presented with information that differed from the data presented by Nusbaum during the meeting, according to which all shareholders of cCam were required to urgently raise substantial capital - and if they failed to do so their shares would be significantly diluted, to the extent that they would be practically dismissed from cCam without getting anything in return. <p>The pressure under which the minority shareholders were put eventually persuade them to sell their holdings to the current shareholders for a value that was lower than their actual worth, as the minority shareholders later learned. <p>The claim states that in July 2015 (less than a year after the sale), the plaintiffs were surprised to find out that cCam was sold as part of a large-scale deal to the pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co.. It also become clear that the company managed to obtain a breakthrough with regards to the recognition of the American FDA authority. <p>It is claimed that this matter was not properly reported to the company’s board of directors, apart from a laconic mention of the company’s general discussions with the FDA. This misled the directors who were not privy to the information and essentially neutralized them, as they did not grasp the importance and significance of the progress made by the company. <p>The plaintiffs claim they hold accumulated information that raise a substantial suspicion, according to which, the talks with Merck & Co. ahead of the exit deal commenced two years prior to its completion - and a year before the sale of cCam’s shares - but were hidden from the plaintiffs and their representatives at cCam’s board of directors. RELATED ARTICLES Merck buys cCAM Biotherapeutics for up to $605m <p>The lawsuit refers to the way in which the “defendants deliberately concealed crucial information from the plaintiffs and their representatives in cCam’s board, including information that they were legally required to reveal to the plaintiffs and their directors”. It is argued that “if this information was revealed and if the true potential and worth of cCam were known to the plaintiffs, they never would have given their consent to the deal and the sale for the aggregated amount of only $780,000, which is in practice worthless. <p>The lawsuit that was filed included a report prepared by the business intelligence firm Black Cube, founded by Dan Zorella and Dr. Avi Yanus, which was hired by the plaintiffs and conducted recorded interviews with key figures in cCam, who were involved in and exposed to the talks with Merck & Co. and the FDA. <p>The plaintiffs argue that these interviews prove a deliberate and systematic attempt to conceal the talks with Merck. “The recorded statements of the aforementioned figures leave no doubt with respect to the ongoing communication between cCam and Merck & Co., which were hidden from cCam’s board of directors, including the plaintiffs’ representatives”, states the claim supported by Black Cube’s evidence. <p>During a recorded interview conducted by Black Cube with Dr Tehila Ben-Moshe, cCam’s first CFO and development vice-president, Ben-Moshe states that “cCam had many potential buyers and offers for collaborations, including with companies that have various approaches to promoting the product…”. “With Merck”, she says, “it was quite clear that they were committed to the plan and that they believed in the new medicine. We have had many email correspondences, including a thorough and professional process of background checks. They sent us many questions and we had many answers, and we had many conference calls regarding different aspects of the project, and it took time”. <p>The plaintiffs claim that this interview, amongst others, prove that “the deal with Merck & Co. was not completed over night, but rather after a long and carefully considered process”. <p>Ran Nusbaum, a partner in Pontifax Holdings, said today that “the shareholders at the time of the deal were Moti Menashe and Benny Saydon. They both wanted to sell their holdings in cCam due to the company’s shortage of cash. Saydon was previously involved in a plea bargain that took place in 2005 and during which he was sentenced for 9 months and fined with 24,000 Shekels. The plea bargain ­refers to Saydon and his partner’s activity as part of a strategic and financial consultancy firm that was suspected of stock manipulation in 1995. I have had the chance to speak to Moti Menashe, Saydon’s partner, who was imprisoned for another offense and was recently released. Menashe is no longer involved in Gefen, whose main shareholder is Nissim Dagladeti, who was convicted by the district court and sentenced for 30 months in jail. He is currently waiting for his verdict’s appeal in the high court of justice, which also instructed on tax offences. In short, they are not saints." <p><i>Published by Globes [online], Israel business news - <a href=http://www.globes-online.com>www.globes-online.com</a> - on March 9, 2017</i> <p><i>© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2017</i> 5 Comments View comments in rows Update by email about comments talkback POST Comments Your name Please insert your name Content Your comment Thanks You comment was recieved and soon will be published.

Pfizer-partnered avelumab is central to Merck's plans to revitalise its healthcare business, currently under pressure as top-selling Rebif (interferon beta-1a) - an injectable treatment for multiple sclerosis - tries to fend off competition from newer, oral MS therapies. Anti-PDL1 drug avelumab is under priority review in the US for lead indications bladder cancer and Merkel cell carcinoma. Analysts have predicted sales of around $600m in 2020, assuming approvals later this this year, and rising to $4bn-plus at peak - despite playing catch-up with rival PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co/MSD and Roche. For now, Rebif is holding up remarkable well, with sales slipping just €100m to €1.7bn last year, and its resilience helped Merck post healthcare sales of €6.85bn, down 1% on the prior year, although profit slipped 5% to €497m. Volumes were down in Europe but price hikes in the US helped buoy the product, said Merck. The MS drug is expected to face further challenges this year however if Roche's much-anticipated MS drug Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) - which outperformed Rebif in two phase III trials - clears the FDA later this month. Avelumab and other pipeline candidates such as oral MS therapy cladribine have assumed even more importance for Merck since it abandoned plans to seek approval of evofosfamide in advanced soft tissue sarcoma and pancreatic cancer after phase III study failures. The company said recently that it expects to see €2bn in revenuefrom new launches between 2017 and 2022, with a new product or indication launch every year. For 2017 Merck is predicting "slight organic growth" in its healthcare division, with continued declines for Rebif and a high single-digit decline in profit thanks in part to higher R&D investments. Overall sales at the group rose 17% to just over €15bn, thanks to largely to the expansion of its laboratory and life sciences division that was swelled by the recent acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich.

Merck Launches ‘Merck More than a Mother’ & ‘Merck STEM for Girls and Women’ in Liberia 09.03.2017 at 1:27 pm By BellaNaija.com Leave a Comment H.E. Madam Ellen Sirleaf (centre), the President of Liberia and Hon. Julia Cassell, Minister for Gender, Children and Social Protection with some of the infertile women who have been supported through ‘Merck More than a Mother’s’ ‘Empowering Berna’ Project Merck, a leading science and technology company launched the ‘Merck More than a Mother’ and ‘Merck STEM for Girls and Women’ program for the first time in Liberia. The launch took place on Wednesday as part of the organisation’s commemoration of International Women’s Day. ‘Merck More than a Mother’ will empower infertile women in Liberia through improving access to information, health, change of mindset and economic empowerment. ‘Merck More than a Mother’ was first implemented in Kenya in 2015 followed by Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Ghana, Cote D’Ivoire and Central African Republic in 2016. In Liberia both ‘Merck More than a Mother’ and ‘Merck STEM’ program are in partnership with the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. “Today we are recognizing the International Women’s Day by starting this very critical campaign for Liberia with the aim to empower an under-privileged segment of women. Women who couldn’t bear children and for this they are discriminated and mistreated by their husbands, families and communities. In some cultures, childless women still suffer discrimination, stigma and ostracism. This is unacceptable and has to change through our campaign,” said Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. “We will also start ‘Merck STEM’ Program which will contribute towards the social and economic development of Africa through empowering women and girls in the fields of science and technology where they are currently under-represented, starting today with 140 girls at Victoria Tolbert School,” Rasha Kelej added. The Liberian Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Bernice Dahn emphasized during her speech at the launch: “We are happy to partner with reputable and innovative company such as Merck. We believe that raising awareness about infertility prevention and improving access to regulated and equitable fertility care are very important, but it is even more important to intervene to break the stigma around infertility and infertile women in particular.” Julia Cassell, Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection emphasized: “In Liberia the infertility rate has increased due to the 40 years of civil conflict where women and girls were raped resulting in traumatic fistulas and the removal of their uterus to save their lives. Over 50% of these women and girls are now infertile. Harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation which is widespread in our country is also a major factor causing infertility as a complication.” “As a Ministry we have made a decision to collaborate with ‘Merck More than a Mother’ to help these women so that they are not stigmatized and discriminated against just because they are infertile and so that they can be empowered to become productive members of society. We also decided to partner with ‘Merck STEM’ program to empower our girls in STEM. This program is very important for Liberia and Her Excellency President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is very interested to make this program a great success,” Julia Cassell added. To mark International Women’s Day and in recognition of the important role women can play in the economic and social development of Africa, Merck is empowering women and girls to participate in STEM where they are currently under-represented, through the ‘Merck STEM Program’. Merck has inaugurated their initiative at Victoria Tolbert School where they equipped their library with computer and science labs to encourage young girls to study science and technology as part of their ‘STEM for Girls and Women’ in Africa. STEM Project by Merck is the first external support Victoria Tolbert School gets since their establishment by Madam President of Liberia for underprivileged and vulnerable girls.

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo DARMSTADT, Germany Germany's Merck KGaA on Thursday said it was seeking a buyer for its biosimilars unit, confirming a Reuters report in October. The chief executive of the maker of drugs, lab supplies and high-tech chemicals, Stefan Oschmann, said negotiations were far advanced but complex, speaking at a press conference after the release of full-year results. Merck has been working since 2012 with Dr Reddy's of India in developing cheaper versions of blockbuster biotech drugs such as AbbVie's Humira, Roche's Rituxan and Amgen's Neulasta but has not yet brought products to market. The lineup of prospective suppliers of these compounds - called biosimilars because they are equivalent to the original drug in efficacy and safety but not exact replicas - is expected to see a shakeout amid harsh competition. When asked about the future of Merck's Consumer Health division, Oschmann said it was developing well, but added that every one of the group's units would have to prove itself and would be under review on an ongoing basis. The business with 860 million euros ($908 million) in 2016 sales is seen by many industry experts as lacking critical mass to compete with much larger rivals, which are seeking to further consolidate the non-prescription treatments industry.

The chief executive of the maker of drugs, lab supplies and high-tech chemicals, Stefan Oschmann, said negotiations were far advanced but complex, speaking at a press conference after the release of full-year results. Merck has been working since 2012 with Dr Reddy's of India in developing cheaper versions of blockbuster biotech drugs such as AbbVie's Humira, Roche's Rituxan and Amgen's Neulasta but has not yet brought products to market. The lineup of prospective suppliers of these compounds - called biosimilars because they are equivalent to the original drug in efficacy and safety but not exact replicas - is expected to see a shakeout amid harsh competition. When asked about the future of Merck's Consumer Health division, Oschmann said it was developing well, but added that every one of the group's units would have to prove itself and would be under review on an ongoing basis. The business with 860 million euros ($908 million) in 2016 sales is seen by many industry experts as lacking critical mass to compete with much larger rivals, which are seeking to further consolidate the non-prescription treatments industry.

Features Education Sentinel School Zone State lawmakers question UCF foundation spending Lawmakers are targeting university foundations for wasteful spending  and called out UCF in particular during a hearing this week as the school foundation leader spent $6,000 on a plane ticket to Dubai and trustees rode on private jets to state education meetings. Lawmakers are targeting university foundations for wasteful spending  and called out UCF in particular during a hearing this week as the school foundation leader spent $6,000 on a plane ticket to Dubai and trustees rode on private jets to state education meetings. Gabrielle Russon and Gray RohrerContact ReportersOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy State lawmakers want to know why foundations at UCF and other Florida public universities are spending private money on what they called extravagant travel, even as the organizations receive millions of taxpayer dollars for employee salaries. Records show the University of Central Florida Foundation spent more than $600,000 on travel last year, including $6,701 of on a business class plane ticket to Dubai for its leader, Mike Morsberger, in February 2016. It also spent more than $21,000 on charter planes and related expenses so school officials could fly to meetings. The foundation paid nearly $22,000 on international trips for an engineering professor who was forced to resign last month, records show. “I think the House’s position is going to be very clear that the amount of money we put into the system, the system’s almost run wild,” state Rep. Carlos Trujillo, R-Miami, chairman of the powerful House appropriations committee, told reporters on Wednesday after UCF and other education leaders were questioned about the expenses at a legislative hearing in Tallahassee. “There’s one goal for these universities — that’s to graduate students. Their goals are not to send people to China. Their goals are not to fly first class to Dubai,” Trujillo said. But in an interview Thursday, Morsberger said travel is important, as the university aims to be a “global institution with a global reach.” The foundation, UCF’s fundraising arm, is considered to be a private corporation within the public institution and is run with its own board. It’s about halfway to its goal of raising $500 million for the school, officials have said. Some of the donations paid for faculty professional conferences, research and educational opportunities, such as a group of UCF engineering students traveling to a programming competition in Thailand. “We need to take the opportunity to go to those places,” Morsberger said. “We want to give our students every opportunity we can, as well as our faculty, to expand knowledge and expand the brand of UCF and bring good to world.” Trujillo also criticized the use of public money from the universities to run the foundations. UCF receives about $10 million to pay for foundation employees’ annual salaries. Twenty-five of the nearly 120 foundation staff members are paid at least $100,000, according to numbers UCF provided to the state. Morsberger’s annual salary is $437,835. “It’s money that could be used for faculty. It’s money that could be used for academic enhancement and support,” Trujillo told Morsberger and UCF chief financial officer Bill Merck during their testimony. “Where in statute do you have authority to use taxpayer money to supplement foundation operations?” Morsberger and Merck both said using the money that way was allowable and that the foundation staff generated about $60 million in cash and pledges. “I think it’s really powerful way the state and this university leverage its own resources,” Morsberger said. In defending the travel, Morsberger said his February 2016 trip to Dubai was a “unique situation.” Then-UCF doctoral student Albert Manero, who started Limbitless Solution, a group that makes 3-D plastic printed limbs for children without them, was invited to speak at a Dubai conference. Manero’s expenses were covered at the World Government Summit, but UCF officials did not want him there alone. When Manero spoke, there were more than 1,000 people in attendance — possible donors, leaders from major corporations and nonprofit leaders and others who may want to build partnerships with UCF, Morsberger said, adding he felt that Manero needed support from the foundation. “It was a 16-hour flight,” Morsberger told lawmakers. “We decided after talking to administration and the foundation board that business class was worthwhile.” In an interview Thursday, Morsberger said Limbitless Solutions was given international exposure and it spurred conversations. “I can’t say I came back with a big check. Philanthropy doesn’t work that way.” he said. Morsberger called the foundation’s hiring of charter planes for university leaders’ meetings “the exception to the rule.” Chartering a plane for officials was sometimes a more economical way to travel, he said. It could save the university from footing hotel bills and bring officials back to UCF sooner than waiting on inconvenient commercial flight times, he said. One chartered flight was for a meeting with Dean Colson — a member of the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees universities — in November 2015, at a time when UCF officials were fighting for the downtown Orlando campus. A email from Colson that surfaced that month praised Gov. Rick Scott’s decision to veto funding for the downtown Orlando campus. Less than a week later, the foundation chartered the $900 flight for officials to visit him. Morsberger and UCF spokesman Chad Binette said they did not know the purpose of the meeting or who went. Other trips in 2015 included President John Hitt and four others flying to Miami to meet with Colson again, which cost $2,550, and eight officials flying to Atlanta for the athletic director search at a $3,875 expense. Juin Liou, a UCF engineering professor who had worked at the school for 30 years, was one who benefited most from the foundation money, records showed. In 2015 and 2016, he went on five international trips that racked up more than $20,000 in airfare to visit multiple countries, including China three times. But despite repeated warnings from UCF, the school says he maintained inappropriate ties with a Chinese university over the years, which has prompted a federal investigation. He was accused of recruiting graduate students and employees to work at the Chinese university, providing the school with equipment and traveling to Asia 22 times in four years, according to a school investigation from August 2016. Liou resigned on Feb. 16 before UCF could terminate him for “serious misconduct,” school documents said. Liou did not return a message for comment Thursday. Morsberger did not speak to Liou’s case specifically, but he said he was confident about foundation’s oversight on spending. “We have a lot of checks and balances,” he said. “We’re careful about per diems.” grusson@orlandosentinel.com UCF Foundation gets a new CEO with $425K salary » Copyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Colleges and Universities University of Central Florida John Hitt News Pulse Shooting Sports Entertainment Classified Travel Legal Notices Obituaries 74°

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Incyte Corporation at the Cowen Healthcare Conference: 4 Things You'll Want to Know Incyte executives talked about the biotech's prospects at the Cowen healthcare conference. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Mar 9, 2017 at 11:41AM Few biotechs have enjoyed as fun a ride as Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) in recent years. The stock has soared more than 700% since early 2012 thanks primarily to tremendous success for cancer drug Jakafi. Incyte's chief medical officer, Steven Stein, and chief financial officer, David Gryska, sat down at the Cowen healthcare conference in Boston this week to discuss what's going on with the company. Here are the highlights of what they said.  Image source: Getty Images. 1. What's going on with epacadostat? Epacadostat holds the potential to be Incyte's next great cancer drug after Jakafi. Wall Street analysts think that epacadostat could generate peak annual sales of $1.6 billion if approved.  Stein said that Incyte spent much of 2016 enrolling patients in studies for the experimental drug. The most heavily anticipated of these studies is a late-stage clinical trial featuring epacadostat in combination with Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda in treating melanoma. Merck was so pleased with earlier results of the Keytruda/epacadostat combo that the big drugmaker opted to move forward with more clinical studies targeting other nine other tumors, including renal cancer, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer. While the late-stage melanoma study with Keytruda is at the forefront for Incyte, Incyte isn't limiting its collaboration possibilities to just Merck. Clinical trials are also in progress with epacadostat in combination with AstraZeneca's durvalumab and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo.  Stein said that Incyte remains open to working with other companies on melanoma as well. He explained that the biotech's deal with Merck prevents Incyte from conducting studies with another drugmaker for a two-year period, but that period ends in October 2017. 2. Are there any threats on the horizon for Jakafi? When asked about potential challengers for Jakafi, Gryska said, "At this point, we don't see a threat." Gryska noted that Incyte recently raised its outlook for peak sales of Jakafi to $2 billion. He said that the biotech expects strong volume growth and profit margins for the red-hot cancer drug. Stein added the company also thinks Jakafi has potential in treating essential thrombocythemia (ET) and is initiating a pivotal study for the indication.   3. Could a merger or acquisition be in the cards for Incyte? Gryska quickly responded with a "no comment" on the topic of potential mergers or acquisitions. Many have speculated that Incyte could be a buyout target for a larger organization. The company's executives deliberately refused to pour fuel on the flames of this speculation. Incyte is focused on "running [its] business to create shareholder value," according to Gryska. He said that there's "a lot of more greatness" to come over the next few years, with strong candidates in the biotech's pipeline.   4. Any news on baricitinib? Stein also basically punted on a question about U.S. approval for autoimmune disease drug baricitinib. He said that the drug is partner Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) "ship to run." The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) extended its review date for baricitinib in treating rheumatoid arthritis earlier this year. Stein said that Lilly is working with the FDA and a decision should be reached in the second quarter.  Incyte has opted in for co-development of baricitinib in the psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and atopic dermatitis indications with Lilly. Stein said that data will read out from a study of the drug in treating lupus next year. He indicated that Incyte could be interested in opting in for this indication as well, depending on the results. Looking ahead Incyte has the wind at its back going into the rest of 2017. Jakafi is booming. And, like Gryska said, there really aren't any significant threats to the drug. Baricitinib has already won European approval and seems to have a good shot at gaining U.S. approval as well. Epacadostat has tremendous potential in multiple combination therapies. The big question is the one that company executives don't want to answer: Is an acquisition on the way? One very well could be -- although it wouldn't be surprising to me if nothing happened this year. However, should corporate tax reform become a reality, with big drugmakers having a lot of extra cash on their hands, I don't think Incyte would remain "single" for too long. Regardless of what happens on the merger and acquisition scene, I suspect that Gryska's sentiment is on target: There's a lot more greatness to come for Incyte.

June 15, 2017 / Welcome to the Oldest Political News Web Site on The Internet. Home Congress FUBAR News Opinion Politics Reader Rant White House The two faces of Donald Trump March 8, 2017 6:39 am | by GINGER GIBSON and DAVID SHEPARDSON U.S. President Donald Trump meets with pharmaceutical industry representatives at the White House in Washington. (REUTERS/Yuri Gripas) When the bosses of some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies headed to Washington in January to meet U.S. President Donald Trump, it had all the makings of a potentially hostile meeting. Just weeks before, Trump had sent drug stock prices plummeting after accusing the companies of “getting away with murder” by charging too much for medicines. But the Trump who greeted chief executives of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Novartis (NOVN.S), Merck (MRK.N), Eli Lilly (LLY.N), Celgene (CELG.O) and Amgen (AMGN.O) on Jan. 31 was a surprisingly genial host who even gave them a personal tour of the Oval Office, according to several participants in the breakfast. “There is no question that it was better than it could have been or we thought it could be,” said one industry insider familiar with the meeting. Trump did not repeat his public attacks on the industry. Instead, he focused on “outdated” regulations that drive costs up for drugmakers, according to participants interviewed by Reuters. The CEOs left with Trump’s word that he would streamline regulations and reform the high U.S. corporate tax rate. Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has held at least nine meetings with groups of business leaders, including automakers, airlines, retailers and health insurers. In early morning or late-night tweets and in speeches, Trump has lambasted many of these companies for cost over-runs, or high prices, or foreign manufacturing, often knocking down their share prices. (See the effects of Trump’s tweets on stock prices here tmsnrt.rs/2ibdFSF) But Reuters interviews with nearly a dozen executives and lobbyists who have taken part in these meetings or have been briefed on them reveal a Trump who is very different from his uncompromising and demanding @realDonaldTrump Twitter handle. When he meets the nation’s top chief executives in person, he is a mix of charm and cajoling. This Trump is flexible and inquisitive, a schmoozer who remembers birthdays and often lavishes praise on their companies, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity so they could freely discuss private meetings. This private side of Trump sheds light on why many CEOs have expressed confidence that the Republican president is good for business, despite his share-denting public attacks. As recently as Tuesday, Trump tweeted he was working on a system to increase competition in the health industry and lower drug pricing, sending pharma shares lower. In the White House meetings, Trump focuses much of his talk on cutting regulations, the sources said, underscoring one of his administration’s key priorities – getting rid of rules imposed by his predecessor Barack Obama. He typically asks which regulations are holding businesses back from adding new jobs and promises to resolve the issues, executives say. “He said one thing for the cameras and the door shuts and then it’s like kumbaya,” said one person who was briefed on a meeting between Trump and a group of CEOs. “He likes to be seen as engaging and buddy buddy with other big important business leaders,” said this person. A former businessman, Trump runs his closed-door meetings with CEOs as if they were a corporate board meeting, attendees said. In contrast to his doctrinaire tweets, he likes to seek input from everyone at the table, and compared to former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, conversations are less scripted. Trump’s approach to these meetings is “one of listening and not lecturing”, said a senior White House official who has participated in industry meetings. “I’ve seen a president who is listening and asking questions to get to how he can create a thriving economy,” the official said. An Amgen spokeswoman said Trump made it clear that he wanted to work with the company on U.S. job creation and biotech innovation. Representatives of the other drugmakers declined to comment. SHOWING OFF THE DRAPES Because so little is known about how Trump interacts privately with CEOs, trade groups and company officials have begun to swap tips on how to approach their meetings with him. “There is this undercurrent of information sharing about what to expect, what to do,” said one trade group official who prepared CEOs for a recent meeting with Trump. He said he has gotten a flurry of calls from other industries next in line for a White House visit. At the end of most meetings, Trump leads CEOs into the Oval Office, showing off paintings, sculptures and the furniture, as well as the rug and curtains he has picked out. He also points out a bust of Martin Luther King Jr., which he inherited from Obama. Then he takes a group photo behind the desk. “He becomes tour guide and brings them over to the Oval Office,” the same official said. “He’s very proud of the Oval Office.” The White House official said Trump recognized the “awe” of the Oval Office. CHAIR FOR GM, BIRTHDAY WISH FOR FORD Chief executives of Detroit’s top three automakers – General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) – were pleasantly surprised when they went to the White House for a breakfast with Trump on Jan. 24. Since his election, Trump has frequently attacked the car companies for building in Mexico and warned U.S. firms would no longer be able to move U.S. jobs abroad “without consequences.” When Trump entered the Roosevelt Room, he greeted GM CEO Mary Barra with a playful tap on the shoulder as he gently prodded her to add jobs in the United States and later pulled out her chair before the meeting started, a review of the video transcripts of the first part of the meeting shows. He greeted Ford CEO Mark Fields with a “Happy Birthday. It’s his birthday ladies and gentlemen.” Trump said it was a “great honor” to see Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne. Trump did not specifically ask them to build plants in the United States – as he had tweeted he would before the meeting – but instead listened to their complaints about regulations and indicated a willingness to help them, people briefed on the meeting said. Ford declined to comment and referred to Fields’ comments to dealers in January that Trump had asked for a list of regulations that automakers wanted cut or kept. GM CEO Mary Barra said in a speech last week that Trump “really listened” to the automakers, while Marchionne told reporters at the Geneva auto show on Tuesday that Trump was “quite willing to make our lives easier” in terms of compliance and taxes in order to encourage U.S. job creation. Trump has been complimentary of his high-profile guests – and at times playful. After Denise Morrison, chief executive of Campbell Soup (CPB.N), introduced himself in one of those meetings, Trump quickly responded: “Good soup.” At another, after Target Corp (TGT.N) CEO Brian Cornell spoke, Trump responded by pronouncing the name of the company as “Tar-Jay,” a common joke to make the retailer sound more fancy. _______________________________________________________ Copyright © 2017 Capitol Hill Blue Copyright © 2017 Thomson Reuters.

Shares of large US pharmaceutical companies sold off after Mr Trump said he was working on a “new system” to reduce prices in the industry. Shares of Pfizer Inc and Merck & Co shed 1.1 per cent, and Amgen Inc dropped 1.4 per cent. The dollar edged up 0.09 per cent against a basket of six major trading currencies and gained 0.11 per cent against the Japanese yen ahead of the Fed’s meeting next week. The monthly US jobs report, due on Friday, is expected to show an increase of 186,000 jobs, probably enough to push the Fed to raise its base rate again for the second time in three months. US Treasury yields rose yesterday, supporting the dollar, as data showed the US trade deficit grew in January to its widest monthly level in nearly five years. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was up nearly two basis points at 2.511 per cent, while two-year yield edged up one basis point at 1.322 per cent. The market is taking in stride, unlike past years, expectations the Fed will raise rates, said Rahul Shah, chief executive of Ideal Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.73 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 20,951.61. The S&P 500 lost 3.04 points, or 0.13 per cent, to 2,372.27 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.76 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 5,850.93. The S&P 500 healthcare index dropped 0.65 per cent, setting it up for its worst day in more than five weeks. Stocks in Europe traded slightly lower as weak corporate earnings and the biggest fall in German industrial orders since the depths of the global financial crisis weighed on sentiment. Europe’s FTSEurofirst index of the 300 leading regional shares fell as much as 0.31 per cent, pulled down by healthcare and financial stocks. MSCI’s all-country world stock index fell 0.21 per cent. Brent crude added 17 cents at $56.18 a barrel while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 19 cents at $53.39. Gold slipped 0.64 per cent to $1,217.70 an ounce.

From heavy metal poisons to chemical pesticides, time is our greatest enemy as Americans pour on, consume and inject more and more chemicals every year, adding to the already chaotic overload of GMOs, fluoridated water, flu shots and the “recommended” CDC boatload of vaccines that have never been proven safe or effective. Are you experiencing brain fog, migraine headaches, severe allergies to foods, central nervous system disorders, anxiety, muscle spasms, immune system malfunctions, chronic inflammation or fibromyalgia? What you may really have is called Vaccine Overload Disorder, but no MD in America is allowed to speak of it, for fear of losing their license to practice medicine.   You should fear today’s vaccines more than you do infectious diseases – here’s why Less than 65 years ago, U.S. pharmaceutical companies hired Nazi scientists right out of prison to work on vaccines and prescription drugs for Americans. The first polio vaccine, the “inactivated” version, was “invented” by Jonas Salk in 1955. Or was it? The true history shows us that Salk did nothing more than conduct illegal medical experiments on mental patients, and he had nothing at all to do with the decline in mortality from infectious diseases. In 1961, Albert Sabin developed the commercialized oral polio vaccine. Or did he? Did you know that historical data was altered by the corrupt vaccine industry to convince people that vaccines ended polio? Be very afraid of the experimental toxins in every vaccine used in America – they are not “safe and effective” Millions of Americans have been literally injected with cancer via vaccines, but it’s never mentioned by doctors who fear that the AMA, FDA and CDC will shut them down. Today’s vaccines not only contain live versions of the diseases you do not want, but also contain GMOs, hormones from infected cows, pigs, chickens and monkeys, untested virus combinations (like H1N1), aluminum, mercury, emulsifiers, and crossbred bacteria from animals, mosquitoes and diseased humans. Most Americans have no clue that the live measles virus vaccine contains gelatin, sorbitol, sodium chloride, bovine cow serum, egg protein and human albumin. Most Americans have no idea that the combination Diptheria, Tetanus and Polio Vaccine contains formaldehyde, phenoxyethanol and aluminum phosphate. Hardly a living American has read the vaccine insert to know that the combination immunization jab DTaP, IPV, HBV and Hib given to infants 2 to 12 months young contains aluminum hydroxide, formaldehyde and bovine cow serum. Who has ever been warned by their doctor or nurse that Gardasil HPV vaccine – the human papillomavirus vaccine made by Merck – contains polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, aluminum and a “denatured” (fragmented and weakened) form of the virus? What happens to the human body when it is injected with bovine cow serum, gelatin, sodium chloride and mercury? Bovine cow serum is extracted from cow skin. When it’s injected into human muscle tissue it causes connective tissue disorders, arthritis and lupus, as well as shortness of breath, low blood pressure, chest pain and skin reactions. Gelatin is derived from the collagen inside animals’ skin and bones. Injecting gelatin poses the risk of infection from synthetic growth hormones and BSE (mad cow disease). Still worried about chicken pox, measles and other “diseases” the human body easily defeats with a normal immune system? You’ve got more to be afraid of by just examining the insane ingredients in today’s vaccines. Let’s continue. Sodium chloride raises blood pressure and inhibits muscle contraction and growth. Oh, and vaccines are prepared in eggs (certainly not organic ones). These conventional eggs may contain growth hormones, antibiotics and salmonella bacteria. Many vaccines are brewed in peanut oil. Wondering now why millions of American children are severely allergic to peanuts? The peanut allergy epidemic simply did not exist before vaccines, by the way. Think about that for a minute. Thimerosal is a neurotoxic mercury which causes autism. There are 25 mcg in one average flu vaccine while the EPA safety limit is 5 mcg, so children who are vaccinated simultaneously with multiple vaccines receive over 10 times the safety limit of mercury in one day. Question vaccines because your MD certainly never does. Human albumin is the protein portion of blood from pooled human venous plasma, and when injected causes fever, chills, hives, rash, headache, nausea, breathing difficulty and rapid heart rate. Injecting “pooled blood” can result in a loss of body cell mass and can cause immunodeficiency virus infection, or contain SV40, AIDS, cancer or Hepatitis B from drug addicts. Did you ever think you might get a deadly disease from the vaccines themselves? Vaccine Overload Disorder is sweeping the nation, and yet more and more states are proposing adding several more toxic vaccines to the already inundated CDC “recommended” schedule. Don’t be a medical guinea pig for the nefarious vaccine industry. You have rights. Vaccines can do permanent damage. Protect your children from the fake medicine nightmare!

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Space Environment Health Nature Archaeology Science Health Donald Trump hair loss drug finasteride associated with erectile dysfunction Persistent use of finasteride can cause sexual problems long after use is stopped. By Staff Reporter Updated March 10, 2017 08:03 GMT Dr Harold Bornstein told New York Times that Trump takes a small handful of pills daily, including finasteride to treat male pattern baldnessGetty Images A drug taken by US President Donald Trump to treat hair loss has been linked to erectile dysfunction in a new study. In February Trump's former physician, Dr Harold Bornstein, told the New York Times that Trump takes a small handful of pills daily, including the drug finasteride to treat male pattern baldness. According to a recent study by Northwestern University, men with a longer exposure to the drug have a higher risk of getting persistent erectile dysfunction than those with less exposure. For some subjects the persistent erectile dysfunction persisted despite stopping taking the drugs, in some cases for months or years. Trump's health has previously been the subject of speculation. When the 70-year-old announced he was running for office, Dr Bornstein released a letter claiming that "If elected, Mr Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency." Dr Bornstein, who claims to have been Trump's personal physician for three decades, subsequently said that he had written the note in all of five minutes while a Trump limousine waited for him to finish. The White House did not comment on Dr Borstein's claims. Defying the so called Goldwater Rule, which prohibits psychiatrists evaluating a presidential candidate's mental health without a face-to-face consultation, mental health professionals signed a letter in the New York Times declaring "grave emotional instability indicated by Mr Trump's speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president." The new study is not the first time finasteride has been associated with negative side-effects, and at least 1,245 lawsuits have been filed against Propecia's manufacturer, Merck, alleging that the company didn't sufficiently warn users of sexual and cognitive negative consequences. Among the subjects of the recent study, 167 of 11,909 (1.4 percent) developed persistent erectile dysfunction that continued for a median of 1,348 days after stopping finasteride and dutasteride, another male hormone blocker.
