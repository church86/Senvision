Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Apr 11, 2017 at 4:23PM Merck (NYSE:MRK) is known today as a pharmaceuticals industry leader with a market cap of over $170 billion and a solid dividend. But the stock didn't always claim the value that it does today. Through acquisitions, mergers, and nine stock splits along the way, the history of Merck stock has a lot of twists and turns. Here's a brief look at how Merck got to where it stands today as one of the top pharmaceutical stocks in the world -- from boom to bust to bouncing back. Image source: Merck.  Historic roots Merck's history dates all the way back to 1668, when Friedrich Jacob Merck bought an apothecary in Darmstadt, Germany. In 1827, Heinrich Merck transformed the company into a drugmaker. The company's American roots began in 1887, when a U.S. sales office was opened by E. Merck AG.  The modern Merck that we know came into existence in 1917. When the U.S. entered World War I, the American business separated from its German parent. The company became known as Merck & Co. in the U.S., although E. Merck AG retained the rights to the Merck name outside of the U.S.  Modern boom years Merck stock entered into a stretch of remarkable gains beginning in the mid-1980s. This winning streak extended into the end of the 20th century, with a few pullbacks along the way, most of them relatively short. MRK data by YCharts. Highlights of this boom period included the launch of congestive heart failure drug Vasotec in 1985. By 1988, Vasotec had become Merck's first drug to achieve annual sales of $1 billion. The company introduced cholesterol drug Zocor in 1992, which also went on to become a blockbuster for Merck.  A couple of significant acquisitions and divestitures occurred during the period as well. In 1993, Merck bought drug distributor Medco. A few years later, in 1999, the company sold off its specialty chemicals businesses.  From boom to bust Between 1985 and 2000, Merck stock soared more than 3,500%. Those tremendous gains didn't hold entirely, though. In the following decade, Merck's share price collapsed. MRK data by YCharts. Part of the problem was a decline in the overall market in the early 21st century following the bursting of the dot-com bubble. However, Merck also had its own unique challenges. Four of its top-selling drugs lost patent exclusivity in 2000 and 2001.  Even worse, Merck had to withdraw blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx from the market in 2004 after studies found that the drug doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes in long-term users. Merck stock cratered 27% on the day of the Vioxx announcement.  It was during this period (in 2003) that Merck spun off Medco as a separate company. Medco was eventually bought by Express Scripts in 2012 for $29.1 billion -- more than the entire market cap of Merck up until 1990. Merck also had some developments in the first decade of the new century that set the stage for an improved future. In 2006, diabetes drug Januvia won U.S. regulatory approval. That same year, HPV vaccine Gardasil gained approval. Both products would go on to become huge winners for Merck. And in 2009, Merck merged with Schering-Plough. Bouncing back When Merck acquired Schering-Plough, the crown jewels it inherited included international rights to autoimmune disease drugs Remicade and Simponi. However, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) thought the merger constituted a change of control that allowed it to take back ex-U.S. rights to the two drugs.  The two companies agreed on a settlement in 2011 that allowed Merck to keep marketing the drugs in most of the territories that Schering-Plough held. Remicade and Simponi contributed to Merck's reversal of fortunes beginning in 2010. MRK data by YCharts. A little-known drug called pembrolizumab was also included in the pipeline that Merck gained with the Schering-Plough merger. Schering-Plough had taken ownership of pembrolizumab when it bought Organon in 2007. The drug is now known as Keytruda.  Keytruda is the centerpiece of Merck's latest resurgence. The drug won approval in 2014 for treating advanced melanoma. In 2015, the FDA approved Keytruda as a second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Last year, the drug gained approval for treating head and neck cancer plus the biggest prize of all -- first-line treatment of lung cancer. More recently, in March 2017, the FDA granted approval to Keytruda for treating classical Hodgkin lymphoma.  Analysts think Keytruda should reach peak annual sales of close to $8 billion. The potential for the drug has helped Merck stock climb nearly 20% since the beginning of 2016.  Merck's pipeline could help boost the stock more down the road. The company claims 12 drugs in addition to Keytruda that are in late-stage clinical studies. After a history spanning nearly 350 years, the story of Merck stock has a long way to go.

(IMV)(otcqx:IMMVF), a clinical stage immuno-oncology company, today announced that University Health Network's Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM) has received Health Canada clearance to initiate a clinical study evaluating immunotherapies from Immunovaccine and Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada). The Phase 2 triple-combination therapy trial is designed to evaluate the potential anti-tumor activity of Merck's pembrolizumab with Immunovaccine's lead cancer vaccine candidate, DPX-Survivac, in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Patients will also receive low-dose cyclophosphamide. "There continues to be a significant unmet medical need for many ovarian cancer patients and we are pleased to have Health Canada grant clearance for this triple-combination therapy trial, which may be a means to address the complexities of the disease," said Frederic Ors, Immunovaccine's Chief Executive Officer. "Research has shown that ovarian cancer can be positively impacted by the activation of T cells - the hallmark of our DPX-Survivac mechanism of action. We believe that DPX-Survivac is uniquely positioned to be the enabling agent of choice, with a novel, clinically demonstrated ability to generate relevant, sustained immune responses. The initiation of this trial will mark the next stage of development for an exciting triple-combination therapeutic approach." Merck is funding and contributing materials for the non-randomized, open-label trial, which is expected to enroll 42 subjects with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Immunovaccine is contributing its product candidate as well as a related portion of analytical assays. The study's primary objective is to assess overall response rate (ORR). Secondary study objectives include progression free survival (PFS) rate, overall survival (OS) rate, and potential side effects, over a five-year period. DPX-Survivac is Immunovaccine's lead immuno-oncology candidate, generated by its novel proprietary DepoVax™ adjuvanting technology platform. The DPX-Survivac target, survivin, is present in more than 20 types of solid tumor and hematologic cancers. It is involved in multiple critical pathways of cancer cell growth and survival. Prior results from a Phase 1/1b study indicated that DPX-Survivac combined with a low dose of cyclophosphamide was highly immunogenic in individuals with high-risk ovarian cancer, inducing survivin- specific T cell immune responses in most trial participants.  About DPX-Survivac DPX-Survivac consists of survivin-based peptide antigens formulated in the DepoVax™ adjuvanting platform. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has recognized survivin as a promising tumor-associated antigen (TAA) because of its therapeutic potential and its cancer specificity. Survivin is broadly over-expressed in multiple cancer types in addition to ovarian cancer, including breast, colon and lung cancers. Survivin plays an essential role in antagonizing cell death, supporting tumor-associated angiogenesis, and promoting resistance to anti-cancer therapies. Survivin is also a prognostic factor for many cancers and it is found in a higher percentage of tumors than other TAAs.  The DPX-Survivac vaccine is thought to work by eliciting a cytotoxic T-cell immune response against cells presenting survivin peptides. This targeted therapy attempts to use the immune system to search actively and specifically for tumor cells and destroy them. Survivin-specific T-cells have been shown to target and kill survivin-expressing cancer cells while sparing normal cells. DPX-Survivac received Fast Track designation by the FDA as maintenance therapy in individuals with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer who have no measureable disease following surgery and front-line platinum/taxane chemotherapy to improve their progression-free survival. The FDA also granted orphan drug status to DPX-Survivac for the treatment of ovarian cancer. This designation is valid for all applications of DPX-Survivac in ovarian cancer without restriction to a specific stage of disease.  About the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre of the Toronto Hospital The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre has achieved an international reputation as a global leader in the fight against cancer and delivering personalized cancer medicine. The Princess Margaret, one of the top five international cancer research centres, is a member of the University Health Network, which also includes Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute and the Michener Institute for Education; all affiliated with the University of Toronto.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News High Prevalence of Infectious Diseases Drives the Global Antibacterial Drugs Market An antibacterial drug is referred to as an antimicrobial agent interfering with the growth and reproduction of bacteria that cause numerous mild to severe infections in humans and animals. Antibacterial drugs either kill or inhibit their growth. These agents possess bactericidal activity which target various parts of bacterial physiology such as protein synthesis, cell wall synthesis, nucleic acid synthesis and permeability of cell membrane, and therefore help in treating infections. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antibacterial-drugs-ma… Antibacterial drugs are being in use since the discovery of the first antibacterial in the form of penicillin in 1928, and presently a wide range of antibacterials in several formulations are commercially available and used for the treatment of various indications like pneumonia, tuberculosis, tetanus, diphtheria, diarrhea, legionellosis and other diseases. The global antibacterial drugs market has been categorized into eight segments based on their class which include: aminoglycosides, β-lactams, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, quinolones/ fluoroquinolones, macrolides, phenicols, and miscellaneous antibacterials. In 2014, β-lactams occupied the leading position with a share of 57.7% of the global antibacterial drugs market followed by the quinolones. However, these drug classes are expected to witness a decline in their market share during the forecast period due to scheduled patent expiry of key branded formulations, coupled with growing number of drug resistant bacterial strains and increasing influx of generic drugs. Hence, on account of the factors mentioned above, the global antibacterial drugs market is expected to witness slow growth during the forecast period 2015 to 2023. However, the miscellaneous antibacterials segment is expected to grow with the highest CAGR accompanied with growing demand for therapies against bacterial infections and rising geriatric populations are some of the factors that are anticipated to maintain the growth of the antibacterial drugs market. Additionally, expected commercialization of various antibacterial agents that are currently in developmental stages, such as solithromycin (Cempra, Inc.), VivaGel (SPL7013) (Starpharma Holdings Limited), surotomycin (Merck & Co.) MK-3415A (Merck & Co.) during the forecast period is also expected to profound impact on growth of this market. Asia-Pacific held the largest share of the revenue generated by the global antibacterial drugs market in 2014. This region is also expected to experience the highest growth rate during the forecast period 2015 to 2023. The major factors responsible for this region to hold leadership in this market in 2014 include presence of large number of generic manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturers in Asian countries, growing incidences of bacterial infections such as MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and tuberculosis and increasing purchasing power of the domestic population. For more information on this report, fill the form @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Moreover, developing health care infrastructure, presence of a large population base and growing geriatric population which is more prone to diseases would consequently increase the uptake of antibacterial drugs in Asia. North America held the second largest revenue share followed by Europe in the antibacterial drugs market in 2014. Market maturity, shortened product lifecycle, stringent regulatory requirements and generic infiltration are some of the factors that accounted for slow growth of this market. AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly and Company, Allergen plc, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer, Inc., and Sanofi are the major players engaged in the development, production and marketing of various antibacterial drugs. These players have worldwide presence in the pharmaceutical industry and are involved in constant competition with each other. Pfizer, Inc. was observed to be the most promising and leading player in the Antibacterial drugs market. Major customers for their antibacterial drugs include hospitals, private clinics, physicians and patients.

By directly identifying the specific aspects of the university that are attractive to the writer, the writer is able to clearly and effectively show not only his commitment to his studies but – perhaps more importantly – the level of thought he put into his decision to apply. Review committees know what generic responses look like so specificity sells. Online Colleges in Oregon: The Best Online Schools of 2017 Honors College students are assessed "Honors College Differential Tuition" each term. HC Differential Tuition enables the Honors College to provide small seminar-style classes, academic advising, co-curricular activities and other amenities. HC Differential Tuition is currently $986 per term and will appear on each student's billing account for each fall, winter, and spring term that the student is enrolled at Oregon State.   Ted W. Maul Professional Development Fund Established to benefit junior and senior students to travel to professional meetings. Earl L. Packard Achievement Award To a deserving, scholarly, and professionally motivated undergraduate senior in geology. The majority of online courses at EOU are delivered asynchronously via Blackboard, though students may also access their communications, view course assignments and take quizzes through the Canvas learning management system. Students access study materials and assignments when it is most convenient, completing class requirements on a weekly basis. Support services for online students include free eTutoring and use of the online writing laboratory, as well as full access to the Pierce Library. Some exams require a proctor, which requires the student to identify an approved local testing site. Degree-completion programs are a popular choice for distance learners, allowing working adults to finish bachelor's degrees without taking time off from work. The HC recognizes that the HC Differential Tuition associated with enrollment in the Honors College can present a financial challenge for some students. Honors students who are unable to pay the differential tuition in a specific term can apply for a  HC Differential Tuition Grant. Support services for online students include the digitally optimized Linfield Library and librarian staff dedicated to distance learners, plus free tutoring through the Western eTutoring Consortium. «Oregon state university essay questions» in pictures.

He previously wrote about management and corporate strategy for Quartz and Business Insider. Follow @MaxNisen Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 11, 2017 2:55 PM EDT PFIZER INC -0.11 At Closing, April 11th 33.93 USD One of the most highly prized quality that biotech investors seek in a CEO is the ability to sell one's firm to big pharma at a huge premium.   The current king is David Hung, the former CEO of cancer drugmaker Medivation, who stoked a bidding war that led Pfizer to acquire the company for $14 billion at a 118 percent premium to its unaffected share price. On Monday, Hung became CEO of Axovant Sciences Inc., a biotech focused on an Alzheimer's treatment, picking the company over what he says were more than 20 other job offers. Axovant CEO Stock Jump 20%  Axovant shares jumped more than 20 percent on Monday and rose a further 11 percent on Tuesday after the company announced a $125 million share sale at the newly boosted price. Hung's hiring is a publicity coup and represents a vote of confidence in the company's drug. But Axovant's fundamentals remain the same. It's attempting to rescue a previously failed drug for a tough-to-treat disease, and investors shouldn't allow excitement over a new hire to obscure that.  Can't Stop the Pop Investors continue to applaud Axovant's appointment of David Hung as its new CEO Source: Bloomberg Intraday times are displayed in ET. Alzheimer's drugs are already exceptionally risky. Companies have put billions of research dollars into medicines that failed in critical studies. Eli Lilly & Co. and Merck & Co. Inc. are the most recent examples. Axovant's lead drug has extra warning flags. It was bought for a $5 million pittance from GlaxoSmithKline's scrapheap after it failed a Phase 2 trial. The drug represents a different approach than Merck and Lilly's medicines and takes on the easier task of treating the symptoms rather than the cause of the disease. But both Lundbeck and Pfizer have given up on similar drugs after clinical trial failures.    Axovant maintains that its drug may be better and that it has designed its clinical trial to avoid mistakes other firms have made. But tweaking trials and moving the goal posts is far from a sure path to success. Drugs that failed previously tend to fail again, especially in Alzheimer's. Against that backdrop, the stock market reaction to Hung's hiring seems extreme. The 20 percent hiring bump was one thing, but the company was able to sell more than $100 million worth of shares at that new inflated price, and its stock continued to soar.  In an up-and-down biotech market, secondary share offerings more often come at a discount and lead to share price declines.   Rare Axovant's share price jump after tapping equity markets for cash is unusual Source: Bloomberg U.S. biopharmaceutical secondary share offerings that raised between $100 and $500 million Investors are most likely overestimating Hung's possible impact. The riskiness and binary nature of the company's lead trial makes an acquisition unlikely before the data is revealed in the fall. And while Hung clearly picked a winner with Medivation's prostate cancer drug Xtandi, his track record with Alzheimer's is less inspiring. Medivation scrapped a once-promising Pfizer-partnered drug in 2012 after a late-stage trial disappointed. Axovant is prone to hype, it has a charismatic founder in ex-hedge funder Vivek Ramaswamy and big upside if its drug is approved. That led it to one of the biggest biotech IPOs of all time at the peak of the 2015 bull market, with Axovant's shares spiking to nearly $30 at one point. But the stock was below $10 less than a year later on doubts about the drug's viability. New chief or not, the company is as risky as ever.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

It needs it. Jim Crumly (TMFSpeyside) Apr 11, 2017 at 11:05AM Swiss healthcare company Roche Holdings (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) is a powerhouse when it comes to drug development, especially in the hot field of cancer treatments. Investors in big pharma looking for growth should take notice of four important sources of growth in the next few years, and one big risk that looms. 1. Tecentriq, a muscular cancer fighter "Programmed death-ligand 1" sounds like a borg sent from the Galactic Empire to destroy rebel forces, but it's a protein that cancers use to evade the host immune system. Drugs that inhibit this pathway, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo, Merck's Keytruda, and now Roche's Tecentriq, uncloak the cancer and stimulate the body's immune system to attack it. Image source: Roche Holdings. Tecentriq is Roche's first entry into cancer immunotherapy and was launched just last year, but it is already making an impact. It's been approved for second-line bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, and it has already taken 10 points of market share from Opdivo in the latter indication in a matter of a few months. The beautiful thing about these drugs is that they tend to work against a broad range of cancer types and in combination with a lot of other therapies. Tecentriq is already in trials for treating renal cell cancer, prostate, colorectal, ovarian, breast, solid tumors, melanoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia. If the drug continues to demonstrate success and steal share from rivals, it could drive monumental growth for the business. 2. Perjeta and HER2-positive breast cancer Roche has built up a formidable franchise in HER2-positive breast cancer, and growth in Perjeta sales should keep the growth coming. The company's megablockbuster drug Herceptin along with Kadcyla had $7.5 billion in sales in 2016, although growth has slowed due to saturation of the market. Perjeta attacks the HER2 pathway using a different mechanism, opening up the possibility of being used in combination with these existing therapies and reinvigorating growth for Roche's breast cancer segment. 3. Ocrevus in multiple sclerosis In what may turn out to be the biggest drug approval in 2017, the FDA granted the go-ahead last month to Ocrevus, Roche's first entry in the multiple sclerosis market. The drug not only improves on the standard of care for the relapsing form of MS, it also is the first therapy approved for the primary progressive form of the disease. Roche could grab a good chunk of the $20 billion MS market going forward. 4. Diagnostics business One aspect of Roche's business that adds appeal to investors is its diagnostics division, which provides 23% of overall revenue. Sales of test instruments are not subject to the binary risk of trial results, nor are they affected by patent expirations as much as are pharmaceuticals. Besides the stability this adds to Roche's results, the segment is also boosting growth, with a 7% revenue gain in 2016 compared with the company's overall 4%. But generics and biosimilars will be a big headwind While some analysts believe Roche has the most valuable pipeline in the drug industry, it may also have the portfolio with the most risk from generics and biosimilars. The patent has already expired on antiviral Tamiflu, which brought in $786 million last year, and generic competition is having an impact. More importantly, patents will be expiring on biologics Herceptin, Avastin, and MabThera/Rituxan from around mid-2018 through 2020. Those drugs together accounted for a whopping $20 billion in sales in 2016, about 41% of the company's total revenue. That business won't disappear overnight, especially given the challenges in developing biosimilars and getting them approved. But those drugs are big, juicy targets for the competition and will certainly draw a lot of attention. While the risk resulting from patent expiration is real, Roche investors should take heart. The company not only has a commanding position in oncology and blockbusters in immunology and ophthalmology, it also has massive resources to find new indications for its older drugs, enter new therapeutic areas, and replace lost sales with innovative new products. The company has 50 human trials underway in cancer immunotherapy alone. Roche recently became the top spender in research and development among healthcare companies, shelling out almost $10 billion last year from its very healthy cash flow. For healthcare investors looking for steady growth and a yield of 3.2%, the positives more than offset the risk.

Campbell Dr. William C. Campbell discussed the drug Ivermectin, which helps combat the River blindness epidemic. The 2015 winner of a Nobel Prize in the category of Physiology or Medicine spoke at the event presented by the Health Studies Institute in coordination with the global studies and health care policy programs on April 7. By James Shepherd Nobel Prize winner William C. Campbell visited Rider University to speak about the therapy he discovered that combats infections caused by roundworms. Specifically, he discussed the drug Ivermectin and how it combats Onchocerciasis, or, as it its more commonly known, River blindness. Campbell won a Nobel Prize in 2015 in the Physiology or Medicine category. The root cause of River blindness is the bite of the Black Fly. “When it bites the person the infected larvae penetrate the bite wound and get under the skin before growing into adult worms,” Campbell said.” After the larvae mature, they begin to breed on their own. It is their progeny which migrate through the skin, some of which eventually end up in the eye. A telltale sign of infection is what Campbell refers to as “a tennis ball full of spaghetti.” Small nodules appear on the skin of the infected, within which lie the baby worms which eventually migrate through the skin to various points in the body. The therapy was eventually discovered through the efforts of research on a single mouse that had been exposed to the worms and larvae. “All of our microbial drugs have been discovered empirically,” Campbell said. “So in this case it was different because we tested substances in this new mouse [test], and the essence of the assay was that we gave a mouse an unknown amount of an unknown substance that might not be there.” The drug that had originally been found had been titled Avermectin but was later improved by chemists. “But it is in my experience that our chemistry friends seem to believe that no matter how good something is, the chemists will make it better.” Avermectin was improved by chemists by hydrogenating it, therefore improving its potency and resulted in the name change to Ivermectin. Campbell brought the drug to the attention of the board of the Merck Institute for Therapeutic Research to use the drug on human subjects instead of animals. Early community testing took place in West Africa and all results pointed towards a success of the drug, which in its final form killed the larvae in the skin. When it came to the debate of how to distribute the drug, the Merck Institute decided to give the drug away for free to those who needed it for as long as they needed it in a program they called the MDP (Mectizan Donation Program.) The drug is administered yearly in pill form. Since 2010, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Guatemala River blindness has been eliminated. Campbell believes that by 2025, River Blindness will be eliminated in Brazil and Venezuela. Campbell was gifted a crystal vase by Rider University as a token of gratitude.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 April 2017 by Military News Animal Antibiotics and Antimicrobials Market by Product, Mode of Delivery, Animal – Global Forecast to 2021 LONDON, April 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — The global animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2016 to 2021, to reach USD 4.73 billion by 2021 from USD 3.77 billion in 2016. The growth of this market is mainly attributed to rising demand for animal-derived food products, growing demand for pet insurance and rising animal health expenditure, and increasing incidences of zoonotic diseases. In addition, the implementation of the regulations for preventing the spread of animal diseases and increasing awareness about animal healthcare are further expected to drive the growth of this market. However, growing resistance to the antibiotic and antimicrobial agents, dearth of new antibiotics, and replacement of routine prophylactic use of antibiotics by good husbandry and hygiene practices may hinder the growth of this market to certain extent. Untapped emerging market such as China, India offers significant growth opportunities. Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4489948/ Based on the type of product, the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market is segmented into tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolides, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, cephalosporins, and other antimicrobials and antibiotics. On the basis of mode of delivery, the market is further segmented into premixes, oral powders, oral solutions, injections, and other modes of delivery. Similarly, on the basis of type of animals the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market is segmented into food-producing animals and companion animals. The food-producing animals segment accounted for the largest share of the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market in 2015. Geographically, the global animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Rest of the World. In 2015, North America commanded a major share of the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market. This is mainly due to the increasing adoption of companion animals, growing pet insurance industry, increasing demand for animal-derived food products, and rising veterinary healthcare expenditure in the region. However, Asia-Pacific is expected to witness the highest growth rate during the forecast period. Growth in the Asia-Pacific market can be attributed to rising companion animal population and increase in the demand for animal-derived food products. Some of the prominent players in the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market include Zoetis, Inc. (U.S.), Eli Lilly and Company (U.S.), Merck & Co., Inc. (U.S.), Bayer AG (Germany), Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH (Germany), Virbac (France), Ceva Sante Animale (France), Vetoquinol S.A.

article LONDON, April 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The global animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2016 to 2021, to reach USD 4.73 billion by 2021 from USD 3.77 billion in 2016. The growth of this market is mainly attributed to rising demand for animal-derived food products, growing demand for pet insurance and rising animal health expenditure, and increasing incidences of zoonotic diseases. In addition, the implementation of the regulations for preventing the spread of animal diseases and increasing awareness about animal healthcare are further expected to drive the growth of this market. However, growing resistance to the antibiotic and antimicrobial agents, dearth of new antibiotics, and replacement of routine prophylactic use of antibiotics by good husbandry and hygiene practices may hinder the growth of this market to certain extent. Untapped emerging market such as China, India offers significant growth opportunities. Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4489948/ Based on the type of product, the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market is segmented into tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolides, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, cephalosporins, and other antimicrobials and antibiotics. On the basis of mode of delivery, the market is further segmented into premixes, oral powders, oral solutions, injections, and other modes of delivery. Similarly, on the basis of type of animals the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market is segmented into food-producing animals and companion animals. The food-producing animals segment accounted for the largest share of the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market in 2015. Geographically, the global animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Rest of the World. In 2015, North America commanded a major share of the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market. This is mainly due to the increasing adoption of companion animals, growing pet insurance industry, increasing demand for animal-derived food products, and rising veterinary healthcare expenditure in the region. However, Asia-Pacific is expected to witness the highest growth rate during the forecast period. Growth in the Asia-Pacific market can be attributed to rising companion animal population and increase in the demand for animal-derived food products. Some of the prominent players in the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market include Zoetis, Inc. (U.S.), Eli Lilly and Company (U.S.), Merck & Co., Inc. (U.S.), Bayer AG (Germany), Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH (Germany), Virbac (France), Ceva Sante Animale (France), Vetoquinol S.A.

ET Share this article MIAMI, April 11, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The total value of international freight originating from and destined to Miami International Airport (MIA) in 2016 jumped eight percent to $57.3 billion in 2016, according to recently released data by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Largely responsible for the spike was pharmaceutical (pharma) freight, which surged 48 percent year over year to $4.4 billlion. Since 2010, when the total value of pharma shipments was $1.8 billion, MIA's pharma trade has grown by 140 percent. "MIA's continued growth means a stronger economy and more job creation for our community," said Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez. "That's something each of our 2.7 million residents can be proud of." (PRNewsfoto/Miami International Airport)... In 2015, MIA was designated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) as the first pharma freight hub in the U.S. and the second in the world. MIA was recognized for organizing its pharma logistics providers to undergo IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) Pharma Certification Program, which certifies that pharma products are transported in accordance with global best practices. To grow the global pharmaceutical air cargo industry, MIA and Brussels Airport – the first two IATA-designated pharma freight hubs in the world – partnered to create Pharma.Aero in October 2016. The goal of the association is to be a collaborative group of airport operators, pharma shippers, CEIV-certified cargo communities and other air pharma stakeholders focused on improving pharma handling and quality in the air cargo industry worldwide. Since its launch, the organization has added Singapore Changi Airport, Sharjah (UAE) International Airport, Chhatrapati Shivaji (Mumbai) International Airport,  Brussels Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Brinks Life Sciences, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. as strategic members. "Our efforts to maximize pharma freight traffic at MIA continue to pay dividends for Miami-Dade County, the state and the nation," said Miami-Dade Aviation Director Emilio T. González. "The World Health Organization projects that the global pharma industry will rise in value from $300 billion to $400 billion within the next three years, and we want to position MIA at the center of that growth trend." In addition to boosting pharma freight traffic, MIA remained the busiest airport for international freight in the U.S. and in the Western Hemisphere in 2016, handling: 83 percent of all air imports and 79 percent of all air exports between the U.S. and the Latin American/Caribbean region.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 April 2017 by Military News Pharma Trade At MIA Soars Higher In 2016 New Commerce Department data shows imports, exports grew 48 percent MIAMI, April 11, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The total value of international freight originating from and destined to Miami International Airport (MIA) in 2016 jumped eight percent to $57.3 billion in 2016, according to recently released data by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Largely responsible for the spike was pharmaceutical (pharma) freight, which surged 48 percent year over year to $4.4 billlion. Since 2010, when the total value of pharma shipments was $1.8 billion, MIA's pharma trade has grown by 140 percent. "MIA's continued growth means a stronger economy and more job creation for our community," said Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez. "That's something each of our 2.7 million residents can be proud of." In 2015, MIA was designated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) as the first pharma freight hub in the U.S. and the second in the world. MIA was recognized for organizing its pharma logistics providers to undergo IATA's Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) Pharma Certification Program, which certifies that pharma products are transported in accordance with global best practices. To grow the global pharmaceutical air cargo industry, MIA and Brussels Airport – the first two IATA-designated pharma freight hubs in the world – partnered to create Pharma.Aero in October 2016. The goal of the association is to be a collaborative group of airport operators, pharma shippers, CEIV-certified cargo communities and other air pharma stakeholders focused on improving pharma handling and quality in the air cargo industry worldwide. Since its launch, the organization has added Singapore Changi Airport, Sharjah (UAE) International Airport, Chhatrapati Shivaji (Mumbai) International Airport,  Brussels Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Brinks Life Sciences, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. as strategic members. "Our efforts to maximize pharma freight traffic at MIA continue to pay dividends for Miami-Dade County, the state and the nation," said Miami-Dade Aviation Director Emilio T. González. "The World Health Organization projects that the global pharma industry will rise in value from $300 billion to $400 billion within the next three years, and we want to position MIA at the center of that growth trend." In addition to boosting pharma freight traffic, MIA remained the busiest airport for international freight in the U.S. and in the Western Hemisphere in 2016, handling: 83 percent of all air imports and 79 percent of all air exports between the U.S. and the Latin American/Caribbean region. MIA also continues to handle the majority of America's perishable imports by air, including: 89.2 percent of all flower air imports; 66.7 percent of all fruit and vegetable air imports; and 49.8 percent of all fish air imports. In Florida, MIA's 2016 air trade amounted to 92 percent of the state's total air trade value and 40 percent of its combined (air & sea) trade value. Click here for hi-res images.

The study aims to identify vaccination strategies with the most promise to protect people from contracting the Ebola virus in order to prevent or quickly control a future outbreak. There is currently no approved vaccine to prevent Ebola, although some are at late stages of development. Pursuing research on vaccination strategies to prevent the disease is essential, as several questions remain regarding the durability of the immune response of candidate vaccines. The PREVAC trial will evaluate the speed, intensity and duration of the immune responses generated by the various vaccination strategies, as well as the safety and tolerability of the various vaccines, particularly in children. The PREVAC (Partnership for Research on Ebola VACcination) consortium brings together the health authorities of three countries in West Africa — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone–and their international partners, the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) in France, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIAID/NIH) in the United States, and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. The pharmaceutical companies Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V., part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Bavarian Nordic and Merck Sharp & Dohme, Corp (MSD outside USA and Canada), are supplying the experimental vaccines being tested. The PREVAC trial is a Phase 2, randomised trial that aims to compare three experimental Ebola vaccination strategies with placebos, in order to determine whether they are safe and able to trigger a durable immune response that can protect against Ebola. More than 5,000 adults and children living in countries at the epicentre of the 2014-16 West Africa Ebola epidemic will be enrolled. The study will initially be conducted at two sites in Guinea and one site in Liberia, with an additional site in Sierra Leone awaiting confirmation. In its first stage, the trial will evaluate one of the three strategies, a prime-boost vaccination combining two different vaccines (Ad26.ZEBOV made by Janssen and MVA-BN-Filo made by Bavarian Nordic) compared with a similar placebo regimen. Enrolment into this stage in Guinea and Liberia began on 27th March and 3rd April 2017, respectively. In a second stage, which is expected to start in the second half of 2017, the trial will evaluate all three vaccination strategies, including two additional strategies involving Merck’s rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine. Yves Levy, Inserm Chairman and CEO; Anthony S. Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH; and Peter Piot, Director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: “We, Inserm, NIH, and LSHTM, have designed and launched this unique international research partnership with our colleagues from the West African countries most affected by Ebola virus disease to answer remaining questions regarding the safety and immunogenicity of candidate Ebola vaccine strategies and thereby enable us to better fight future Ebola outbreaks.” Share this: Tumblr Email Print Google Reddit LinkedIn Twitter More Pinterest Facebook Like this: Like Loading...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 April 2017 by Military News Veterinary Vaccines Market: North America Leads but Emerging Economies to Present Promising Growth Opportunities Veterinary Vaccines Market A vast surge in the prevalence of zoonotic diseases, increased expenditures on the health and wellness of companion animals by pet lovers, and efforts by government and non-government organizations to educate masses about animal diseases and their effective treatment have collectively fueled the global veterinary vaccines market in the past few years. In the next few years, rising investments by key vendors on R&D activities are expected to lead to the development of highly effective varieties of vaccines such as subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and recombinant vaccines. This will have a huge impact on the overall growth prospects of the global veterinary vaccines market. Transparency Market Research states that the global veterinary vaccines market, which held an opportunity worth US$6.27 bn in 2015, will exhibit a healthy 6.9% CAGR from 2016 through 2024, and rise to a valuation of US$11.40 bn by 2024. Read Full Report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/veterinary-vaccines-ma… Of the key varieties of veterinary vaccines available in the global market, the segment of live attenuated vaccines presently dominates. The segment held a share of more than 44% in the global market in 2015. Expected to expand at a healthy 6.8% CAGR over the period between 2016 and 2024, the segment is expected to retain its dominance in the global market in the next few years as well. Factors such as easy transport, durability, affordability, safety, and ease of administration work in favor of these vaccine types. As the production of live attenuated vaccines incurs comparatively low costs than inactivated vaccines and can be produced in bulk, their market is expected to flourish especially in developing regions. Over the period between 2016 and 2024, however, the market for technologically advanced product varieties such as DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines, and recombinant vaccines is expected to expand at the fastest CAGR of 9.2%. Factors such as high level of safety and no use of adjuvants will help these vaccines gain increased attention from pet and farm animal owners. Download exclusive Sample of this report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… North America is presently the key regional market for veterinary vaccines, accounting for nearly 37% of the overall revenues of the global veterinary vaccines market in 2015. The vast rise in pet ownership in the region, especially in the U.S., which has the world’s largest number of pets, is central to the massive demand for veterinary vaccines in the region. The market for veterinary vaccines in North America is also driven owing to the strict regulations put in place by the federal government mandating vaccination against certain viruses such as parvovirus, rabies, and adenovirus. Continuous research and progress in the field of veterinary immunology and immunopathology have also kept the region at the forefront of the global veterinary vaccines market. Though the North America veterinary vaccines market will continue to be in a commanding position over the forecasting horizon in terms of revenue contribution, emerging markets such as Latin America, Asia Pacific, and Middle East and Africa are expected to provide the most promising returns. The vast rise in the number of companion and farm animals across these regions, rising awareness about vaccination among the population, and the rise in prevalence of zoonotic disease will drive the markets for veterinary vaccines in these regions. The market in Asia Pacific will exhibit a strong CAGR of 8.4% over the period between 2016 and 2024. Some of the key vendors in the global veterinary vaccines market are Ceva Santé Animale, Bayer AG, Bimeda, Inc., Merck Animal Health, Sanofi (Merial Animal Health), Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Eli Lilly and Company (Elanco Animal Health), Virbac, and Zoetis, Inc.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 April 2017 by satprnews satprnews Veterinary Vaccines Market Estimated to Grow at a CAGR of 8.84 % by 2019 Growing numbers of farm and companion animals, increasing use of intensive animal husbandry practices and rising incidence of chronic diseases in animals have propelled the need for better animal healthcare. Food safety concerns have boosted the usage of vaccines for better farm animal production. The global market for veterinary vaccines is estimated to be worth $12.68 billion in 2014. Expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.84 %, the market is set to reach a value of US$19.35 billion by 2019. Factors responsible for the growth of the market are increasing Zoonotic diseases, increasing investments by government bodies, animal welfare associations and leading players. Recent epidemics like swine flu, avian influenza and anthrax created awareness among livestock owners to avoid the huge production losses due to these diseases. The future of the animal vaccines will be dominated by DNA-related vaccine which can target the particular disease with minimal vaccines shots. Such innovative products will be more capable of providing protection than the conventional vaccines. However, rising maintenance costs for the storage of vaccines, increasing adoption of vegetarian diet in major economies owing to increasing risk of obesity and other chronic diseases are key restraints of this market. Veterinary vaccine market has shown growth in recent years which can be attributed to increasing husbandry practices and better management of farms. This results in estimation of further growth in the market due to advancement in biotechnological research. In country wise analysis, Chinese animal vaccine market is set to grow because the R&D platform and technology has the capability to support the development of various veterinary vaccines and the expansion of governmental tender vaccine. The global veterinary vaccine market is segmented by type of disease in companion and farm animals – poultry vaccines (Bronchitis, Avian Influenza, Marek’s disease, New castle disease), Swine vaccines (Porcine reproductive disease, Swine influenza, Swine Pneumonia). By vaccine technology, the market is segmented into toxoid vaccines, recombinant vaccines, inactivated vaccines and live attenuated vaccines. By geography, the market is divided into North America, Asia-Pacific, Europe and the rest of world. Europe accounts for the largest share of the animal vaccines market, followed by North America. While North America and Europe have decelerated growth in veterinary vaccines due to quality safety, high maturity and other factors, developing regions like Asia-pacific and other developing countries have fast growing animal vaccine market. Pfizer (U.S.), Merck (U.S.), Sanofi-Aventis (France), Bayer HealthCare (Germany), Virbac (France), Novartis (Switzerland), Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany), Heska Corporation (U.S.), Bioniche Animal Health Canada, Inc. (Canada) are the key players in the global animal vaccines market. Request a sample of this report at http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/256345 . Table of Contents: 1.

In particular, liberals have been happy to let the right say that they are the ones who want market outcomes, while the liberal do-gooders want the government to intervene to pursue their social agenda. This is horrible politics and happens not to be true. Conservatives want the government to intervene in all sorts of ways, but their goal is to redistribute income upward, not to ensure people a decent standard of living. (Yes, this is the topic of my book, Rigged.) The right's interest in intervention is especially obvious in the case of prescription drugs. They want the government to make drugs expensive with longer and stronger patent monopolies. The right's love of government monopolies is challenged by a bill introduced in the Senate last month by Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand and several other prominent Democrats. This bill includes measures such as drug importation, which directly lower prices, but more importantly provides funding for research so that in the future, drug companies will not have patent monopolies on newly developed drugs. Granting pharmaceutical companies the exclusive right to sell drugs that can be essential to people's lives or health is a great way to redistribute income upward. To take one example, the Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi has a list price of $84,000 for a three month course of treatment. A high quality generic version is available in India for $300. The basic story is that in a free market, drugs are almost invariably cheap -- it is government granted patent monopolies that make them expensive. This matters hugely for both individual patients and the economy as a whole. Those suffering from serious illnesses often face impossible financial burdens, even when they have insurance, as a result of having to pay for drugs that can cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Their cost would be a non-issue if they were sold at their free market price. We will spend more than $440 billion this year for drugs that would likely sell for less than $80 billion in a free market. The difference of $360 billion is almost 2 percent of GDP, coming to almost $2,800 a year per family. Patent monopolies on drugs lead to the sort of waste and corruption that economists predict when the government artificially inflates the price of a product. In the case of prescription drugs these problems are especially serious since the gap between the protected price and free market price is so huge. Drug companies routinely mislead the public about the safety and effectiveness of their drugs in order to sell as much as possible. This can often have disastrous consequences for public health, as when Merck allegedly concealed evidence that its arthritis drug, Vioxx, could be harmful to people suffering from heart disease. This is a group that has considerable overlap with the population that suffers from arthritis. In the same vein, the makers of opioid painkillers have been among the biggest lobbyists against legalizing marijuana. It turns out that marijuana is often a substitute for the addictive painkillers pushed by the pharmaceutical industry. The list of offenses by the pharmaceutical industry is lengthy: payoffs to doctors to push their drugs in articles and lectures, payoffs to generic drug companies to keep competitors out of the market, payments to politicians to make patents stronger and longer both domestically and in international trade deals. This is why the provision in the Senate bill to have the government start picking up the tab directly is so important. While the government already does spend more than $32 billion a year on basic research through the National Institutes of Health, the Senate bill would support payments to gain direct control over the end product either by buying out the patent or paying for the clinical testing and bringing the drug through the Food and Drug Administration's approval process. In both cases, new drugs could be sold as generics. No one would have to worry about mortgaging their house to pay for a loved one's cancer treatment. Drugs would be cheap. In addition, by making drugs available at free market prices the bill would largely eliminate the incentive to lie. The test results would be fully public so doctors and researchers could determine which drugs were most effective in specific cases, without the corrupting influence of corporate money. And, research would likely proceed more quickly since findings would be quickly available to the community of researchers, rather than being closely guarded secrets from which drug companies hoped to profit. Realistically, this bill has almost no chance of passing in a Republican controlled Congress. Nonetheless, it is an enormous victory for clear-thinking over inertia. Democrats are embracing a way in which the market can be used to better people's health and reduce inequality. It is the Republicans who support big government in the form of patent monopolies. And their goal is to make the rich even richer. _______ About author Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC.

Meet the Contributors → Emulate’s “Organ-on-a-Chip” Tech Picked for FDA Research Partnership Frank Vinluan April 11th, 2017 @frankvinluan @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Boston —  [Updated 4/11/17, 9:44 a.m. See below.] Experimental drugs encounter their earliest tests in petri dishes and animals, but these tests can fall short of predicting what happens in humans. The life sciences industry has been pursuing what many hope is a better way: packing human cells into tiny chips developed as stand-ins for organs. This chip technology has come far enough along that the FDA now wants to see if it is ready for the market. Today, Boston startup Emulate is announcing a research partnership with the agency aimed at finding out if the company’s organ-on-a-chip technology can stand up to what’s necessary for evaluating new products. Foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics will be the first products tested. But Geraldine Hamilton, president and chief scientific officer of Emulate, says the goal of the partnership is to eventually bring these testing capabilities to drugs. “Everyone wants the same thing— to put this technology in the hands of the end user to enable better prediction of human response,” Hamilton says. The partnership with FDA is what’s called a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement. These arrangements bring private companies together with FDA laboratories to develop and test new technologies that have the potential for reaching the market. The FDA declined comment on Emulate’s announcement. In a blog post, Suzanne Fitzpatrick, senior advisor for toxicology in FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, says that the chips can help scientists see how the body processes a dietary supplement ingredient or a chemical in a cosmetic, which in turn can be used to help assess the risks to human health. Hamilton says the agency has committed five scientists to the three-year partnership. Likewise, Emulate will also bring five of its scientists to the project, which will take place in FDA laboratories. [Sentence added with detail from FDA blog post.] The FDA has been looking at alternative testing methods for some time. In 2012, the agency teamed up with the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in an initiative called “Human on a Chip.” The goal was to create a 3D representation of 10 different organ systems. In a 2012 blog post, Jesse Goodman, then FDA’s chief scientist and deputy commissioner for science and public health, said that animal testing is expensive and doesn’t always detect toxic effects that would be found in humans. Conducting these tests on a small chip that has human cells could offer a different way to test compounds. Hamilton says that the Emulate technology was part of the Human on a Chip initiative, ultimately receiving $37 million in grant funding from DARPA while the research was still at Harvard’s Wyss Institute. She says the new collaboration marks the progress that Emulate has made with its technology. The company spun out of the Wyss Institute in 2014 backed by a $12 million Series A round of financing. Two years later, Emulate raised $28 million in a Series B round. Emulate calls its organ-on-a-chip technology the Human Emulation System. Translucent chips, about the size of a USB drive, are packed with cells in order to replicate a human organ. The company has also developed instruments and software that accompany the chips. Emulate has developed organ chip models for the lung, liver, intestine, and skin. Hamilton says the partnership with FDA will focus on Emulate’s liver chips from various species (dog, rat, and human) to assess toxicology results it produces in both animals and humans. The Emulate technology is already in testing with several pharmaceutical companies. Emulate’s publicly disclosed partners include Merck (NYSE: MRK), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Covance, now a division of Burlington, NC-based laboratory testing giant LabCorp (NYSE: LH). Hamilton says the testing that will occur under the FDA collaboration is similar to what the company has been doing with its pharma industry partners. Emulate is not the only company that has developed organ-on-a-chip technology. Huntsville, AL-based SynVivo also makes tiny chips that simulate a biological environment that can be used for researching the interactions between drugs and cells. And late last year, the Draper Laboratory, a non-profit research and development organization headquartered in Cambridge, MA inked a three-year partnership with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) to build organ-on-a-chip models for the liver, vascular, and gastrointestinal organs that could potentially test drug candidates.

Robert Urban, the global head of Johnson & Johnson Innovation, told The Korea Herald Tuesday that his team would discuss Korea’s health care ecosystem and J&J’s innovation platform with four to five local biopharmaceutical companies and investor groups over the next two days. The J&J executive declined to share further details of the planned meetings including the companies’ names or field of focus. Robert Urban, the global head of Johnson & Johnson Innovation, speaks during KPAC 2017 held at the InterContinental Seoul Coex hotel in Seoul, Tuesday (KPBMA) Urban is in Seoul to partake in this year’s Korea Pharma Associations Conference, one of the largest local industry events, centered on the theme of “global partnering for open innovation.” Open innovation in the pharmaceutical industry refers to moving away from closed R&D models and instead partnering with external research institutes and startups to spur new drug and technology development. J&J Innovation’s latest meetings in Korea come as it is preparing to open a new “innovation partnering office” for accelerating promising biotechnology and health care startups in Seoul by the year’s end. The office is set to operate under J&J Innovation’s Asia-Pacific branch. The US pharma giant currently operates four innovation centers in the world’s life science hubs including Boston, California, London and the Asia-Pacific region to support and invest in early-stage biotech startups and collaborate with academic and research institutions. At its Seoul office, J&J Innovation is expected to look for Korean startups aligned with the firm’s three core business areas -- pharmaceuticals, medical devices, global public health and consumer goods. It will announce details of the startup “grand challenge” program early next year, Urban said. Looking ahead, the J&J Innovation global chief believes many new health care innovations will emerge from Korea, a country with an “advanced health care data management system and technology that focuses on convergence and advanced diagnostics.” Urban also cited strong biologics development, in fields including stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, as well as an academic community with a robust data infrastructure as Korea’s core strengths in health care. In addition to J&J, the top research and development executives from big pharma companies including Novartis, Eli Lilly, Sanofi, Merck MGaA, Celgene, Amgen and MSD attended the KPAC. The foreign executives also held business meetings with the chief executives of Korean pharma firms on the sidelines of the Tuesday conference, organizers said. The KPAC, which ends Wednesday, was co-organized by the Korea Pharmaceutical and Bio-Pharma Manufacturers Association and the Korea Research-based Pharmaceutical Industry Association.
