Merck Launches New Gene Editing Technology to Engineer Virus Resistant CHO Cell Lines Merck Launches New Gene Editing Technology to Engineer Virus Resistant CHO Cell Lines CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 08/09/2016 14:03 - Reduces minute virus of mice contamination risk - Enhances viral safety while maintaining cell line productivity, protein quality DARMSTADT, Germany, Sept. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck, a leading science and technology company, today launched a first-of-its-kind gene editing technology to modify CHO cell lines to be resistant to minute virus of mice (MVM), a common contamination threat that remains despite the shift to chemically defined, animal component-free manufacturing processes. CHO cells are commonly used in the manufacture of biologics. Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160906/404353 Merck's new Centinel™ technology targets genes which play a role in MVM susceptibility. Viral contaminations like MVM can have major consequences for biopharmaceutical manufacturers, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, according to industry reports. The greatest impact of such contamination is on patients, as access to therapies can be put in jeopardy. Centinel™ technology provides manufacturers with an additional path for mitigating the risk of MVM contamination, while maintaining an equivalent level of protein quality and cell line productivity. "The Centinel™ program is just one example of how we are combining years of expertise and credibility in process development, biologics manufacturing and gene editing tools to increase safety for our customers and their patients," said Udit Batra, member of the Merck Executive Board and CEO, Life Science. "We are also leveraging this unique combination of experience and technologies to address some of the industry's most complex challenges and exciting applications, including cell therapy." Under the Centinel™ program, Merck can modify customers' CHO cell lines to provide viral resistance to MVM. A patent application has been submitted for the technology used in the gene editing approach to viral resistance. The company's BioReliance® testing services can validate MVM resistance and demonstrate the virus is not propagated in the cell line. Alternatively, customers can purchase the zinc finger nuclease pairs to engineer cell lines directly. Merck's new Centinel™ technology builds on the company's expertise in gene editing and biomanufacturing processes, as well as its in-depth understanding of the regulatory environment. In addition to enhancing the safety of biomanufacturing, Merck is also applying this expertise and approach to develop other technologies and services, including those supporting the cell therapy industry.

Down 23% in August Can Bristol-Myers Squibb recover from this surprising "CheckMate"? Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Sep 8, 2016 at 8:23AM Image source: Getty Images. What happened Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), a global drug developer focused on the development cancer, cardiovascular, and genetic-defined disease drugs, plunged 23% in the month of August according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The reason for Bristol-Myers' dismal performance can be traced to the top-line release of its CheckMate-026 data on Aug. 5. So what Bristol-Myers Squibb's CheckMate-026 trial was expected to be just as successful as every other trial the company had run with its cancer immunotherapy Opdivo. Unfortunately, that proved not to be the case. CheckMate-026 was designed to examine Opdivo as a monotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors had PD-L1 expression of at least 5%. The data showed that Opdivo failed to meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival. This was a big blow for treatment-naïve NSCLC patients, and it's an even bigger blow for Bristol-Myers' whose previously pristine cancer drug looked suddenly fallible. Image source: Merck. Making matters worse, Bristol-Myers Squibb's rival, Merck (NYSE:MRK), demonstrated positive results in its own treatment-naïve trial with cancer immunotherapy drug Keytruda. It should be noted that neither trial is comparable, because Keytruda was tested in first-line NSCLC in patients whose tumors had PD-L1 expression of 50% or higher. Of course, Merck's Keytruda not only met its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival, but it also lent to a statistically significant improvement in overall survival as well. Now what According to Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez following the top-line data release from CheckMate-026, the result of this failure could wind up costing Bristol-Myers up to $4 billion in annual Opdivo sales. The company does still have its CheckMate-227 study ongoing, which is examining the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy for PD-L1-positive patients, but the damage from CheckMate-026 has clearly been done. Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. On one hand, I'd suggest that it's important for investors to remember that cancer immunotherapies usually work better as combination therapies than as monotherapies. While it was disappointing to see Opdivo fail, it's not the end of the line for Opdivo, either. Bristol-Myers has dozens of ongoing studies that Opdivo could become a standard-of-care for in combination with an existing chemotherapy or cancer therapeutic. Conversely, Opdivo's aggressive trial (targeting just PD-L1 expression of 5% or higher as opposed to Ketytruda's 50%+), and failure, should allow Merck's Keytruda to creep back into the picture, potentially allowing it to take market share from Opdivo in certain indications. With profit estimates on Bristol-Myers dropping due to the CheckMate-026 fallout, I don't exactly see how paying 18 times forward earnings necessarily makes Bristol-Myers attractive. Though I do believe Opdivo remains a superior cancer choice in a number of key indications, the company will need a few wins under its belt to put this disappointment in the rearview mirror. Until such time, the sideline looks like a safe place to hang out. Sean Williams has no material interest in any companies mentioned in this article.

CHO cells are commonly used in the manufacture of biologics. Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160906/404353 Merck's new Centinel™ technology targets genes which play a role in MVM susceptibility. Viral contaminations like MVM can have major consequences for biopharmaceutical manufacturers, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, according to industry reports. The greatest impact of such contamination is on patients, as access to therapies can be put in jeopardy. Centinel™ technology provides manufacturers with an additional path for mitigating the risk of MVM contamination, while maintaining an equivalent level of protein quality and cell line productivity. "The Centinel™ program is just one example of how we are combining years of expertise and credibility in process development, biologics manufacturing and gene editing tools to increase safety for our customers and their patients," said Udit Batra, member of the Merck Executive Board and CEO, Life Science. "We are also leveraging this unique combination of experience and technologies to address some of the industry's most complex challenges and exciting applications, including cell therapy." Under the Centinel™ program, Merck can modify customers' CHO cell lines to provide viral resistance to MVM. A patent application has been submitted for the technology used in the gene editing approach to viral resistance. The company's BioReliance® testing services can validate MVM resistance and demonstrate the virus is not propagated in the cell line. Alternatively, customers can purchase the zinc finger nuclease pairs to engineer cell lines directly. Merck's new Centinel™ technology builds on the company's expertise in gene editing and biomanufacturing processes, as well as its in-depth understanding of the regulatory environment. In addition to enhancing the safety of biomanufacturing, Merck is also applying this expertise and approach to develop other technologies and services, including those supporting the cell therapy industry.

The FDA is planning to deliver a verdict on Keytruda (pembrolizumab) as a first-line therapy for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours express PD-L1 by 24 December. Approval in the first-line setting would mean Keytruda has leaped forward where its arch-rival in the PD-1 inhibitor space - Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab) - took a tumble, with analysts now predicting that Merck will dominate the NSCLC market. BMS' drug failed to meet its objectives in the phase III CheckMate-026 trial in first-line NSCLC thanks to an ambitious study design, which sought to show a benefit for the drug regardless of patients' PD-L1 status. That strategy worked well in the second-line setting and resulted in a broader label for Opdivo, allowing it to pull ahead in the marketplace, but has now backfired. Opdivo pulled in $1.58bn in sales during the first half of 2016 compared to $563m for Keytruda, but Merck's drug is expected to gain ground quickly in NSCLC if the FDA clears first-line use. Both drugs are still predicted to hit heady highs with analyst estimates of peak sales in the $8bn-$10bn range apiece, but Opdivo is no longer expected to be as dominant in the market. Meanwhile, Opdivo and Keytruda are also expected to face competition in the coming months from Roche's PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq (atezolizumab), which is already on the market for bladder cancer and has just shown promising results in an NSCLC trial. Merck's application is based on data from the Keynote-024 study, which showed that Keytruda improved progression-free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy for NSCLC. The trial was stopped early so patients still on chemotherapy could switch to Keytruda if desired. "Chemotherapy has been the foundation of first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer for decades, so the significant improvement in survival in patients with high PD-L1 expression seen with Keytruda compared to chemotherapy is welcome news," commented Merck's head of R&D Roger Perlmutter. Along with second-line NSCLC, Opdivo is also approved for treating melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, with an application in head and neck cancer under regulatory review. Keytruda has so far picked up approvals in melanoma, NSCLC, and head and neck squamous cell cancer. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Sep 7, 2016 at 9:21AM Image source: Getty Images. Despite a few recent setbacks, the enthusiasm for immunotherapy stocks hasn't dampened all that much. Led by an insatiable appetite for therapies based on chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR-T, several biopharmaceutical companies have found it easier than ever to raise money and attract partners. Early results from several programs have been promising, but investors suffering from "Fear Of Missing Out" should know that CAR-T isn't the only play in immunotherapy stocks. One potential opportunity is Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN), which is focused on "activating the body's own natural immune mechanisms." If that sounds familiar, it should -- it's essentially the exact elevator pitch used for CAR-T therapies. While Agenus isn't working on CAR-T therapies, it has several pipeline immunotherapy programs partnered with Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) and Merck & Co (NYSE:MRK) that you should know about. The pipeline Agenus considers itself an immuno-oncology company developing therapies based on cancer vaccines and checkpoint antibodies, although most of the company's value resides in the latter. Research and Development efforts are supported by a unique antibody generation platform that increases discovery throughput, reduces the time from discovery to clinic-ready candidates, and allows for more streamlined manufacturing. The technology platform was acquired in 2014 for just $10 million upfront in stock. What's a checkpoint antibody? Antibodies regulate signals within biochemical pathways involved in disease progression by linking up with specific receptors. There are two types of checkpoint antibodies: checkpoint inhibitors that reduce the output of specific proteins (antagonist) and checkpoint modulators that increase the output of specific proteins (agonist). While there's an alphabet soup of nine different antibody-receptor couplings being investigated at the moment, the two most advanced targets, CTLA-4 and GITR, are in phase 1 trials. The remainder are still being investigated in preclinical settings, but Agenus expects to initiate additional phase 1 trials in the second half of 2016.  A program investigating a CTLA-4 antagonist could be a potentially lucrative asset for partners if clinical data prove promising, even though Agenus must pay milestones and royalties to a research institution if successfully developed and commercialized. Tumor cells secrete CTLA-4 to block the activation of T cells and evade the immune system. Therefore, inhibiting CTLA-4 production could potentially allow the immune system to hone in on several types of cancer cells more efficiently. The melanoma drug Yervoy, which had sales of $1.1 billion in 2015 for Bristol-Myers Squibb, is a first-in-class CTLA-4 antagonist.   AGEN data by YCharts In early 2015 Incyte signed a $410 million agreement with Agenus to access the aforementioned antibody discovery platform. The deal included $25 million in cash upfront, the purchase of $35 million in Agenus stock, and $350 million in potential milestone payments for the successful development and commercialization of a slate of checkpoint antibodies. The most advanced asset in the partnership is being investigated in a phase 1 trial. The GITR agonist could enhance the production of certain types of T cells capable of targeting various cancer cell types, with the current trial investigating effectiveness against solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. The company's unique antibody discovery platform has also landed Merck, which recently selected its first checkpoint antibody for an undisclosed indication. The decision triggered a $2 million milestone payment to Agenus. Future developments could trigger up to $98 million in additional milestone payments, while successful commercialization would result in royalties on global sales.  Financials Agenus bolstered its cash position with a unique transaction in late 2015, in which it sold rights to 100% of the royalties it would have received from potential sales of two vaccines developed by GlaxoSmithKline. The vaccines -- for shingles and malaria -- each contained an adjuvant product called QS-21 Stimulon developed by Agenus, announced positive phase 3 results in recent years, and are up for approval in certain global regions. But rather than wait for royalty payments to trickle in, Agenus sold the rights to a capital fund in return for $115 million that it needs to advance its more promising, early stage checkpoint antibody programs. The transaction shows up as (non-dilutive) debt on the company's balance sheet, although it can repurchase the loan at any time if there's more upside to the vaccine sales than originally envisioned. However, I wouldn't expect the company to be in a position to do that anytime soon. While potentially lucrative, Agenus' early stage checkpoint antibody pipeline will prove costly to develop. The good news is that partnerships with Incyte and Merck will help to reduce the company's financial burden and have the potential to infuse cash in the form of milestone payments over the next decade. However, the company will need to decide if it wants to shoulder all of the costs associated with mid- and late-stage trials for its promising CTLA-4 antagonist. That depends on results from the current trial, but with about five quarters' worth of cash left in the bank at the end of 2Q 2016, there isn't much breathing room. What does it mean for investors? Agenus isn't quite the partner of choice in immunotherapy, but it has garnered industry attention for its antibody discovery platform. And with a market cap of just $540 million -- a fraction of leading CAR-T stocks -- it could represent considerable upside for investors. It also has a fraction of the cash on hand, which investors need to take into account. Milestone payments may not be enough, or may not be triggered soon enough, for the company to avoid raising dilutive capital by issuing shares. Given the early stages of development for the company's pipeline, I'm going to closely watch how things develop at Agenus in the next several quarters before I consider starting a position.

Sep 07, 2016, 08:35 ET Share this article -Acquired ZONTIVITY® in the U.S. and Canada- -Long-range market exclusivity through regulatory exclusivity and intellectual property protection- MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, Sept. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARLZ) (TSX: ARZ), a global specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced that it acquired the U.S. and Canadian rights to ZONTIVITY® (vorapaxar), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement entered into between Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Aralez Pharmaceuticals Trading DAC, a subsidiary of Aralez, based in Ireland. ZONTIVITY is the first and only approved therapy shown to inhibit the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), the primary receptor for thrombin, which is considered to be the most potent activator of platelets. In the U.S., ZONTIVITY is indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of heart attack (myocardial infarction) or in patients with narrowing of leg arteries, called peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and should be used in combination with daily aspirin and/or clopidogrel according to their indications or standard of care. In Canada, ZONTIVITY (vorapaxar sulfate) co-administered with aspirin with or without clopidogrel, according to their standard of care, is indicated for the reduction of atherothrombotic events in adult high-risk patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI). The asset purchase agreement included an initial upfront payment of $25 million, which was paid from cash on hand. The transaction also includes graduated royalties and potential added future consideration in the form of payments for achieving certain aggregate annual sales-based milestones. In addition to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the parties simultaneously entered into a Supply Agreement, a License Agreement with respect to trademarks and certain proprietary know-how and a Transition Services Agreement. Under the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, Merck will continue to distribute the product on behalf of Aralez for up to twelve months while the product rights, packaging and labeling and other responsibilities are transferred to Aralez Pharmaceuticals Trading DAC. The U.S. prescribing information for ZONTIVITY includes a boxed warning regarding bleeding risk. ZONTIVITY is not for use in patients with a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), or active pathological bleeding. Antiplatelet agents, including ZONTIVITY, increase the risk of bleeding, including ICH and fatal bleeding. ZONTIVITY is a once-daily tablet containing 2.08 mg of vorapaxar, equivalent to 2.5 mg of vorapaxar sulfate. There is no experience with use of ZONTIVITY as the only administered antiplatelet agent, because ZONTIVITY was studied only as an addition to aspirin and/or clopidogrel. "ZONTIVITY represents a revenue-generating asset with NCE regulatory data exclusivity and patent protection potentially extending to 2027. It is an excellent strategic fit with our anchor therapeutic position in cardiovascular disease targeting high prescribing cardiologists alongside YOSPRALATM, pending FDA approval, and FIBRICOR®," said Adrian Adams, Chief Executive Officer of Aralez. "This transaction is consistent with our business model designed to build value organically through the approval and commercialization of YOSPRALA, currently pending FDA approval with a September 14, 2016 PDUFA date, and through seizing high potential growth opportunities through aggressive business development and licensing in our anchor positions in cardiovascular disease, pain management and other specialty therapeutic areas." About Heart Attack and PAD Heart attacks are generally caused by atherosclerotic plaque disruption and thrombus (blood clot) formation in a coronary artery. Each year, about 750,000 Americans have a new (550,000) or recurrent (200,000) heart attack.1 Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is generally defined as obstruction of arteries supplying the lower or upper extremities, most commonly due to atherosclerosis and much more commonly involving the lower extremities. About 8.5 million individuals in the U.S. have PAD, of whom approximately 10 percent have classic claudication symptoms (i.e., calf muscle pain on exertion), and another 50 percent have other leg symptoms. People with PAD are at increased risk for heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death. 1 Clinical Data for ZONTIVITY Data supporting the benefit of ZONTIVITY are from the pivotal TRA 2°P TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events) trial. In patients with a history of heart attack or with PAD who had no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), ZONTIVITY added to aspirin and/or clopidogrel produced a significant 17 percent relative risk reduction over three years for the combined events of CV death, MI, stroke, and urgent coronary revascularization (UCR) (event rate 10.1 percent vs. 11.8 percent for placebo). These results were driven by an 18 percent relative risk reduction in MI [5.4 percent vs. 6.4 percent for placebo] and a 33 percent relative risk reduction in first stroke [1.2 percent vs. 1.6 percent for placebo]. Adding ZONTIVITY to aspirin and/or clopidogrel was associated with an increased rate of Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Arteries (GUSTO) moderate or severe bleeding through three years (3.7%) compared to adding placebo (2.4%), (hazard ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.30-1.86). GUSTO severe bleeding occurred at a rate of 1.3 percent for ZONTIVITY versus 1.0 percent for placebo (HR: 1.24, 95 percent CI: 0.92-1.66). Additional Selected Safety Information About ZONTIVITY ZONTIVITY is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke, TIA, or ICH and in patients with active pathological bleeding such as ICH or peptic ulcer. Discontinue ZONTIVITY in patients who experience a stroke, TIA, or ICH. Antiplatelet agents, including ZONTIVITY, increase the risk of bleeding, including ICH and fatal bleeding. ZONTIVITY increases the risk of bleeding in proportion to the patient's underlying bleeding risk. Physicians should consider the underlying risk of bleeding before initiating ZONTIVITY. General risk factors for bleeding include older age, low body weight, reduced renal or hepatic function, and history of bleeding disorders. Use of certain concomitant medications (e.g., anticoagulants, fibrinolytic therapy, chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) also increases the risk of bleeding. Avoid concomitant use of warfarin or other anticoagulants. ZONTIVITY is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Withholding ZONTIVITY for a brief period will not be useful in managing an acute bleeding event because, due to its long half-life, significant inhibition of platelet aggregation remains four weeks after discontinuation. There is no known treatment to reverse the antiplatelet effect of ZONTIVITY. Strong CYP3A inhibitors increase and inducers decrease ZONTIVITY exposure. Avoid concomitant use of ZONTIVITY with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding, is the most commonly reported adverse reaction with ZONTIVITY. For more information on ZONTIVITY, please refer to full Prescribing Information including Boxed Warning and Medication Guide. About Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc. Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc.

MerckManuals.com Sep 07, 2016, 08:03 ET Share this article KENILWORTH, N.J., Sept. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck Manuals (called MSD Manuals outside of the United States and Canada), one of the world's most widely used medical resources since 1899, today announced the release of its new Consumer and Professional mobile apps. For the first time, the completely redesigned apps will provide users with free access to thousands of in-depth articles, videos, animations and other resources without the need for an internet connection. The launch of the apps comes on the heels of an online survey highlighting the need for readily accessible medical information. The survey, conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Merck Manuals, revealed that one in 10 Americans has wanted to access medical information on a mobile device but were not able to because they did not have internet access. Continue Reading The Merck Manuals Consumer App provides free, offline access to thousands of medical resources "In today's mobile world, both consumers and medical professionals expect critical health information at their fingertips, with or without an internet connection," said Robert S. Porter, M.D., Merck Manuals Editor-in-Chief. "Whether you're a health care provider in an ER or serving patients in a remote area of the world, having a dependable medical reference in your pocket can make all the difference. We're also seeing tremendous interest in the consumer version from parents, caregivers, travelers and anyone who needs reliable access to first aid and symptom information." The Merck Manuals apps contain a comprehensive library of reference articles on diseases, symptoms and treatments, plus more than 800 photos and illustrations. Once the app is downloaded, this content is stored on the device and accessible without an internet connection.  Over 200 additional animations and videos are also available to download to the app for offline viewing. When an internet connection is available, the apps have online-only content that features continually updated medical news, interactive quizzes and drug reference information. The survey of 2,000 adults found that more than half of respondents who own a smartphone/tablet (54 percent) would be more likely to search for medical information on their mobile device if they knew the content was credible. Respondents would also be more likely to search if they can access content without needing to provide personal information (50 percent), without registering for the site/app (45 percent), without seeing any advertising (39 percent), and without needing internet access (23 percent). The Merck Manuals content is authored by 350 independent medical experts. The apps are free of advertisements and do not require users to register or share personal information, removing many of the barriers that prohibit users from accessing the content they need to make personal health decisions. The apps will also be available in Spanish by the end of this year. Following the Merck Manuals' transition from a medical textbook to an all-digital platform in 2015, the launch of these new apps is the next step in Global Medical Knowledge 2020, the Manuals' mission to make the best current medical information freely accessible to nearly 3 billion consumers and health care professionals by 2020. Both mobile apps are available in the Apple iTunes Store and Google Play Store. About The Merck Manuals and MSD Manuals First published in 1899 as a small reference book for physicians and pharmacists, The Merck Manual grew in size and scope to become one of the world's most widely used comprehensive medical resources for professionals and consumers. As The Manual evolved, it continually expanded the reach and depth of its offerings to reflect the mission of providing the best medical information to a wide cross-section of users, including medical professionals and students, veterinarians and veterinary students, and consumers. In 2015, The Merck Manual and MSD Manual kicked off Global Medical Knowledge 2020, a program to make the best current medical information accessible by up to three billion professionals and patients around the world by 2020.

Print Share All News Consumer Pharma New Drugs Pipeline Clinical Trials FDA Alerts Merck Provides Update on Odanacatib Development Program Tweet KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE) September 2, 2016 --Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that it is discontinuing the development of odanacatib, Merck’s investigational cathepsin K inhibitor for osteoporosis, and will not seek regulatory approval for its use. Merck previously reported a numeric imbalance in adjudicated stroke events in the pivotal Phase 3 fracture outcomes study in postmenopausal women. The company has decided to discontinue development after an independent adjudication and analysis of major adverse cardiovascular events confirmed an increased risk of stroke. The data from the analysis will be presented at the American Society for Bone Mineral Research (ASBMR) in September. “We are disappointed that the overall benefit-risk profile for odanacatib does not support filing or further development,” said Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D., president, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are very thankful to the researchers and patients who participated in the odanacatib clinical development program. We have learned that odanacatib treatment reduces the risk of osteoporotic fractures. At the same time, we believe that the increased risk of stroke in our Phase 3 trial does not support further development.” About Merck For 125 years, Merck has been a global health care leader working to help the world be well.

Reduces minute virus of mice contamination risk - Enhances viral safety while maintaining cell line productivity, protein quality Continue Reading MilliporeSigma's new Centinel technology leverages gene editing to modify CHO cell lines to be resistant to minute virus of mice, providing an additional path for mitigating the risk of MVM contamination for biopharmaceutical manufacturers. BILLERICA, Mass., Sept. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- MilliporeSigma today launched a first-of-its-kind gene editing technology to modify CHO cell lines to be resistant to minute virus of mice (MVM), a common contamination threat that remains despite the shift to chemically-defined, animal component-free manufacturing processes. CHO cells are commonly used in the manufacture of biologics. MilliporeSigma's new Centinel™ technology targets genes which play a role in MVM susceptibility. Viral contaminations like MVM can have major consequences for biopharmaceutical manufacturers, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, according to industry reports. The greatest impact of such contamination is on patients, as access to therapies can be put in jeopardy. Centinel™ technology provides manufacturers with an additional path for mitigating the risk of MVM contamination, while maintaining an equivalent level of protein quality and cell line productivity. "The Centinel™ program is just one example of how we are combining years of expertise and credibility in process development, biologics manufacturing and gene editing tools to increase safety for our customers and their patients," said Udit Batra, CEO, MilliporeSigma. "We are also leveraging this unique combination of experience and technologies to address some of the industry's most complex challenges and exciting applications, including cell therapy."     Under the Centinel™ program, MilliporeSigma can modify customers' CHO cell lines to provide viral resistance to MVM. A patent application has been submitted for the technology used in the gene editing approach to viral resistance. The company's BioReliance® testing services can validate MVM resistance and demonstrate the virus is not propagated in the cell line. Alternatively, customers can purchased the zinc finger nuclease pairs to engineer cell lines directly. MilliporeSigma's new Centinel™ technology builds on the company's expertise in gene editing and biomanufacturing processes, as well as its in-depth understanding of the regulatory environment. In addition to enhancing the safety of biomanufacturing, MilliporeSigma is also applying this expertise and approach to develop other technologies and services, including those supporting the cell therapy industry.

Q BioMed Inc. (OTC: QBIO), a biotechnology acceleration company is pleased to announce the closing of an exclusive license and option agreement for a FDA approved generic drug, Strontium Chloride ("SR89").  This licensed radiopharmaceutical agent is indicated for the treatment of pain associated with metastatic bone cancer. SR89 provides long lasting relief for patients suffering from bone pain due to metastatic cancer, typically caused by advanced-stage breast, prostate or lung cancer. The drug is preferentially absorbed in bone metastases, it has been proven to provide a long-term effect resulting in non--narcotic cancer pain relief and enhanced quality of life.  Cancer palliation drug expected to start generating revenue in less than 12 months  Read the full QBIO Press Release at:  http://financialnewsmedia.com/profiles/qbio.html Q BioMed immediate efforts and resources will focus on the material procurement and manufacturing process as well as preparing the marketing plan and distribution strategy.  This drug is expected to be revenue ready within a short time frame and we aim to generate sales within the first year.  We will make every effort to make this drug as widely available as possible and ensure that the drug will be priced competitively at a cost to patients that is lower than what they are currently paying. In the current environment of skyrocketing drug and medical costs, we believe this is a welcome deviation from the recent headlines. There are approximately 300,000 new cases of bone metastases in patients with breast and lung cancer per year in the U.S. alone. Approximately 80% of patients using SR89 have reported experiencing a substantial decrease in pain, an increase in physical activity and a reduction in the need for opiate analgesics, such as morphine. A U.S. Senate subcommittee has opened a "preliminary inquiry" into Mylan Pharmaceuticals' - Mylan N.V.(NASDAQ: MYL) price increases on its allergic reaction treatment EpiPen, Sens. The company's sixfold price increases on the EpiPen over the last several years sparked public outrage and condemnation by various lawmakers last month.  Read the full article at http://finance.yahoo.com/m/6779e9e6-126d-32c1-b98f-768027f1509f/ss_senate-subcommittee-opens.html Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company, and RetroSense Therapeutics LLC,  a private, clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on novel gene therapy approaches to restore vision in patients suffering from blindness, recently announced that Allergan has acquired substantially all of the assets of RetroSense in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the transaction, Allergan has paid RetroSense a $60 million upfront payment, and has agreed to potential regulatory and commercialization milestone payments related to its lead development program, RST-001, a novel gene therapy for the potential treatment of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). Merck & Co., Inc (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), the company's anti-PD-1 therapy, for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1, with a PDUFA, or target action, date of Dec. 24, 2016. Additionally, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this indication. Merck has also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for this indication. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) this week announced that the European Commission has approved ORENCIA® (abatacept) intravenous (IV) infusion and subcutaneous (SC) injection, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), for the treatment of highly active and progressive disease in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not previously treated with MTX. With this approval, ORENCIA is the first biologic therapy with an indication in the European Union (EU) specifically applicable to the treatment of MTX-naive RA patients with highly active and progressive disease.

The trials will resume on Jan. 5, on up to 15 volunteers, after checks to ensure that the joint pain symptoms in hands and feet were “benign and temporary”, the hospital said. Fifty nine volunteers have been vaccinated so far in the human safety trials in Geneva, which began on Nov. 10. Scientists are racing to develop Ebola vaccines after the world’s worst outbreak of the virus has killed more than 6,000 people in West Africa so far this year. Separately, safety data from a trial of a GlaxoSmithKline Ebola vaccine on 120 volunteers is “satisfactory”, the University of Lausanne Hospital said on Thursday. The first results of the Lausanne hospital’s trial of the GSK vaccine and whether it provides immunity against the virus are expected by the end of December, the university said in a statement. “The safety data looked satisfactory so far,” said Professor Blaise Genton, who is leading the GSK trial in Lausanne. “General symptoms such as fever might be slightly more frequent, though no serious adverse event has been observed so far.” Scientists reported on Nov. 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine that another version of the experimental GSK vaccine caused no serious side effects and produced an immune response in all 20 healthy volunteers who received it in an early-stage trial. The Geneva researchers reported on Dec. 2 that the first people vaccinated with the Merck-NewLink shot had seen no serious side effects, but a few had mild fever. On Thursday, the team said that four patients had reported joint pains in the second week that had lasted a few days. Before it was suspended, this first phase of the trial had been due to continue for another week. “The Geneva team has decided to allow time to understand what is happening. This precaution of momentarily suspending the trial is usual and classic in all clinical trials,” the team said. It was in close contact with researchers in the United States, Germany, Canada and Gabon who are carrying out the same trial on the Merck-NewLink vaccine, it said. “These centers have not observed symptoms of inflammation in their volunteers to date.” Marie-Paule Kieny, vaccine expert at the World Health Organization, said that the delay to the Merck-NewLink trial would allow time to see how widespread the problems are, but the trial should then be able to continue as originally planned. “It’s not a setback, not at all,” Kieny told a briefing. GAVI, the global vaccines alliance, pledged $300 million on Thursday to buy Ebola vaccines.

Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Sep 7, 2016 at 9:21AM Image source: Getty Images. Despite a few recent setbacks, the enthusiasm for immunotherapy stocks hasn't dampened all that much. Led by an insatiable appetite for therapies based on chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR-T, several biopharmaceutical companies have found it easier than ever to raise money and attract partners. Early results from several programs have been promising, but investors suffering from "Fear Of Missing Out" should know that CAR-T isn't the only play in immunotherapy stocks. One potential opportunity is Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN), which is focused on "activating the body's own natural immune mechanisms." If that sounds familiar, it should -- it's essentially the exact elevator pitch used for CAR-T therapies. While Agenus isn't working on CAR-T therapies, it has several pipeline immunotherapy programs partnered with Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) and Merck & Co (NYSE:MRK) that you should know about. The pipeline Agenus considers itself an immuno-oncology company developing therapies based on cancer vaccines and checkpoint antibodies, although most of the company's value resides in the latter. Research and Development efforts are supported by a unique antibody generation platform that increases discovery throughput, reduces the time from discovery to clinic-ready candidates, and allows for more streamlined manufacturing. The technology platform was acquired in 2014 for just $10 million upfront in stock. What's a checkpoint antibody? Antibodies regulate signals within biochemical pathways involved in disease progression by linking up with specific receptors. There are two types of checkpoint antibodies: checkpoint inhibitors that reduce the output of specific proteins (antagonist) and checkpoint modulators that increase the output of specific proteins (agonist). While there's an alphabet soup of nine different antibody-receptor couplings being investigated at the moment, the two most advanced targets, CTLA-4 and GITR, are in phase 1 trials. The remainder are still being investigated in preclinical settings, but Agenus expects to initiate additional phase 1 trials in the second half of 2016.  A program investigating a CTLA-4 antagonist could be a potentially lucrative asset for partners if clinical data prove promising, even though Agenus must pay milestones and royalties to a research institution if successfully developed and commercialized. Tumor cells secrete CTLA-4 to block the activation of T cells and evade the immune system. Therefore, inhibiting CTLA-4 production could potentially allow the immune system to hone in on several types of cancer cells more efficiently. The melanoma drug Yervoy, which had sales of $1.1 billion in 2015 for Bristol-Myers Squibb, is a first-in-class CTLA-4 antagonist.   AGEN data by YCharts In early 2015 Incyte signed a $410 million agreement with Agenus to access the aforementioned antibody discovery platform. The deal included $25 million in cash upfront, the purchase of $35 million in Agenus stock, and $350 million in potential milestone payments for the successful development and commercialization of a slate of checkpoint antibodies. The most advanced asset in the partnership is being investigated in a phase 1 trial. The GITR agonist could enhance the production of certain types of T cells capable of targeting various cancer cell types, with the current trial investigating effectiveness against solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. The company's unique antibody discovery platform has also landed Merck, which recently selected its first checkpoint antibody for an undisclosed indication. The decision triggered a $2 million milestone payment to Agenus. Future developments could trigger up to $98 million in additional milestone payments, while successful commercialization would result in royalties on global sales.  Financials Agenus bolstered its cash position with a unique transaction in late 2015, in which it sold rights to 100% of the royalties it would have received from potential sales of two vaccines developed by GlaxoSmithKline. The vaccines -- for shingles and malaria -- each contained an adjuvant product called QS-21 Stimulon developed by Agenus, announced positive phase 3 results in recent years, and are up for approval in certain global regions. But rather than wait for royalty payments to trickle in, Agenus sold the rights to a capital fund in return for $115 million that it needs to advance its more promising, early stage checkpoint antibody programs. The transaction shows up as (non-dilutive) debt on the company's balance sheet, although it can repurchase the loan at any time if there's more upside to the vaccine sales than originally envisioned. However, I wouldn't expect the company to be in a position to do that anytime soon. While potentially lucrative, Agenus' early stage checkpoint antibody pipeline will prove costly to develop. The good news is that partnerships with Incyte and Merck will help to reduce the company's financial burden and have the potential to infuse cash in the form of milestone payments over the next decade. However, the company will need to decide if it wants to shoulder all of the costs associated with mid- and late-stage trials for its promising CTLA-4 antagonist. That depends on results from the current trial, but with about five quarters' worth of cash left in the bank at the end of 2Q 2016, there isn't much breathing room. What does it mean for investors? Agenus isn't quite the partner of choice in immunotherapy, but it has garnered industry attention for its antibody discovery platform. And with a market cap of just $540 million -- a fraction of leading CAR-T stocks -- it could represent considerable upside for investors. It also has a fraction of the cash on hand, which investors need to take into account. Milestone payments may not be enough, or may not be triggered soon enough, for the company to avoid raising dilutive capital by issuing shares. Given the early stages of development for the company's pipeline, I'm going to closely watch how things develop at Agenus in the next several quarters before I consider starting a position.

Additionally FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this indication. The pivotal phase 3 KEYNOTE-024 study has shown that the monotherapy showed superior progression-free survival as well as overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1. The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the availability of promising new therapies that are planned for use, alone or in combination, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Keytruda is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells.

Down 23% in August Can Bristol-Myers Squibb recover from this surprising "CheckMate"? Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Sep 8, 2016 at 8:23AM Image source: Getty Images. What happened Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), a global drug developer focused on the development cancer, cardiovascular, and genetic-defined disease drugs, plunged 23% in the month of August according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The reason for Bristol-Myers' dismal performance can be traced to the top-line release of its CheckMate-026 data on Aug. 5. So what Bristol-Myers Squibb's CheckMate-026 trial was expected to be just as successful as every other trial the company had run with its cancer immunotherapy Opdivo. Unfortunately, that proved not to be the case. CheckMate-026 was designed to examine Opdivo as a monotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors had PD-L1 expression of at least 5%. The data showed that Opdivo failed to meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival. This was a big blow for treatment-naïve NSCLC patients, and it's an even bigger blow for Bristol-Myers' whose previously pristine cancer drug looked suddenly fallible. Image source: Merck. Making matters worse, Bristol-Myers Squibb's rival, Merck (NYSE:MRK), demonstrated positive results in its own treatment-naïve trial with cancer immunotherapy drug Keytruda. It should be noted that neither trial is comparable, because Keytruda was tested in first-line NSCLC in patients whose tumors had PD-L1 expression of 50% or higher. Of course, Merck's Keytruda not only met its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival, but it also lent to a statistically significant improvement in overall survival as well. Now what According to Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez following the top-line data release from CheckMate-026, the result of this failure could wind up costing Bristol-Myers up to $4 billion in annual Opdivo sales. The company does still have its CheckMate-227 study ongoing, which is examining the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy for PD-L1-positive patients, but the damage from CheckMate-026 has clearly been done. Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. On one hand, I'd suggest that it's important for investors to remember that cancer immunotherapies usually work better as combination therapies than as monotherapies. While it was disappointing to see Opdivo fail, it's not the end of the line for Opdivo, either. Bristol-Myers has dozens of ongoing studies that Opdivo could become a standard-of-care for in combination with an existing chemotherapy or cancer therapeutic. Conversely, Opdivo's aggressive trial (targeting just PD-L1 expression of 5% or higher as opposed to Ketytruda's 50%+), and failure, should allow Merck's Keytruda to creep back into the picture, potentially allowing it to take market share from Opdivo in certain indications. With profit estimates on Bristol-Myers dropping due to the CheckMate-026 fallout, I don't exactly see how paying 18 times forward earnings necessarily makes Bristol-Myers attractive. Though I do believe Opdivo remains a superior cancer choice in a number of key indications, the company will need a few wins under its belt to put this disappointment in the rearview mirror. Until such time, the sideline looks like a safe place to hang out. Sean Williams has no material interest in any companies mentioned in this article.

Keytruda won a breakthrough therapy designation and priority-review status based on data from the Phase 3 Keynote-024 trial, released in June, which showed that the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor had significant progression-free survival and overall survival when compared with chemotherapy. Keytruda was ok-ed as a second-line therapy for NSCLC in October. The FDA will review the drug as a first-line therapy with a target action date of December 24. “Chemotherapy has been the foundation of first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer for decades, so the significant improvement in survival in patients with high PD-L1 expression seen with Keytruda compared to chemotherapy is welcome news,” said Merck R&D chief Roger Perlmutter in a statement. In contrast, a clinical trial of Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo, also a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, did not show an advantage over chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. In fact, these results suggest that oncologists will more often choose Keytruda as a treatment option, noted Reuters. Both drugs were approved by U.S. regulators last year for previously treated patients with NSCLC.

Being the third such request I’d received in as many weeks, I figured it was time to take a closer look at the shingles vaccine. Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, can cause a serious and very painful rash. Judy’s friend Jane was urging her to get vaccinated for shingles. Jane’s husband Stan had a case of shingles that Stan described as “worse than anything he has ever known, including spinal surgery.” Sometimes, open sores accompany the rash and the pain is so severe people have trouble walking and sleeping. In rare cases, the complications of shingles can last for months and sometimes years. That fact surely caught Judy’s attention. In fact, she admitted she had a profound fear of the disease having seen her aunt go through postherpetic neuralgia where the pain continues to last even after the rash and blisters have disappeared. In her opinion, any level of pain seems bearable if you know it will eventually end, but the thought of living with such pain for life made a compelling argument for getting vaccinated. So what could I say about the vaccine called Zostavax being promoted to prevent shingles? I always like to start my research by looking at the pointy end of things: the marketing. If there is one principle in play, it’s that the marketing diverges from the science. And since the advertising is what patients and physicians will likely see first, that’s a good place to start. The ads for Zostavax, made by drug giant Merck, lay out the hook in bold letters: “Have you had your shingles vaccine yet?” In typical marketing style, that innocent question is driven home by the fear factor, reminding us that this is something we all need to be worried about. In smaller print, the ad says, “In Canada, it is estimated that nearly 1 in 3 people will develop shingles in their lifetime.” Ok, if true, this establishes that shingles doesn’t seem to be such a rare condition. Most of us who have had chicken pox as children are susceptible and it usually strikes people over 60, though no one is really sure how or why this happens. Many of us know someone, maybe our mother, friend or neighbour, who has a horror story to tell about the unbearable pain shingles can deliver. I didn’t have to go far to hear some anecdotes. I asked my mother about it and learned that she had had shingles a few years ago that lasted several weeks, which included three visits to the hospital and incredible pain across her stomach. Treatment for shingles usually involves antivirals (drugs such as acyclovir), which, if given early enough, can help shorten the length and intensity of the rash. The vaccine marketer captures the disease’s potential for serious pain with graphic ads featuring a lot of flames and thorns with a clear and unspoken question: “Do you want your life to be a living hell?” Now that we’ve established the nastiness of the disease, the first question has to address the science: “Does the Zostavax vaccine work?” If a vaccine is about protecting you from a disease, you need to know your likelihood of getting the disease in the first place. One study from the British Medical Journal says that for people over 50, approximately two to three people out of a thousand per year get shingles; that increases to about eight per thousand for those 70 and over. The average doctor with 1,500 patients in his care would see about three to five cases per year. A 2005 study in the New England Journal of Medicine enrolled over 38,000 people over 60 and reported that, over three years, the vaccine Zostavax “reduces the occurrence of herpes zoster by 51.3%.” Wow. So if you know 100 people who got vaccinated, the vaccine would prevent half of them from getting shingles, right? Wrong. Remember, if the average doctor sees five cases a year in his practice and he manages to reduce that load by 50%, he’d only see maybe 2.5 cases per year. But how many thousands would he have to vaccinate to prevent those other 2.5 cases? A lot. This study of the vaccine, which was a gold standard, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, measured the incidence, severity and duration of the pain caused by shingles. Let’s focus on just one of those: incidence. Basically, how many people were prevented from getting shingles? The study noted there were 315 shingles cases among those vaccinated and 642 among placebo recipients, concluding that it reduced the rate of shingles by 51.3 percent. Another way this is expressed is in “1,000-person years” where the effects are examined in 1,000 people for one year. The study found that the vaccine dropped the rates of shingles per 1,000 person-years from 11.12 (those on placebo) to 5.42 (those given the vaccine). What this means is the vaccine ‘helps’ about 5.7 people per thousand per year (11.12 minus 5.42= 5.7). Where did the “51.3 % reduction” come from? Well, when you drop the rate from 11.12 to 5.42, that’s about half the rate, or a 51.3% reduction. To summarize, here are two ways of presenting the same data: 1) “The vaccine helps five people per thousand vaccinated. Or 2) “The vaccine helps 50% of the people vaccinated.” Hmmm. You can imagine which one gets the most traction with the marketers. So let’s talk cost. If you have to vaccinate 1,000 people per year at $150 a shot, it would cost $150,000. That’s a fair bit of money to save five people from getting shingles. In other words, the cost of avoiding shingles is about $30,000 per person per year. Does that sound like a bargain? Depends on whom you ask. If you asked Judy’s friend Jane, she’d probably say that not seeing her husband in such pain is “priceless.” If you ask governments to pay for the vaccine, seems they think it’s too high a price to pay and it isn’t covered in BC. It’s not that the vaccine doesn’t work; it’s that it hardly works. And that’s before you wander into the other side of the equation: the vaccine’s potential for adverse effects. By August 2011, in the US, the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) had received 442 serious vaccine adverse reports following Zostavax vaccination, including 36 reported deaths. While these are ‘associations’ and not causations, it still makes one pause before hitting the “jab” button. The kinds of serious shingles vaccine reactions included things like joint and muscle pain, fever, abnormally swollen glands and so on. Some might ask, “Is it possible the vaccine can actually cause shingles?” A good question to which there is no definitive answer, but rashes akin to chicken pox are mentioned on the vaccine’s label as one of the potential adverse effects. At the end of the day, facts can be twisted in any way to make a point, especially when the ‘point’ comes at the end of a syringe. But back to Jane who was caring for her husband and his very nasty bout of shingles. Seeing Stan in such pain was enough for her. She begged Judy and her other friends to get vaccinated. She went and paid the $150 to get herself vaccinated. And a few weeks later? You guessed it; she too came down with a new diagnosis. That’s right, shingles. — Alan Cassels is a pharmaceutical policy researcher at the University of Victoria and the author of Seeking Sickness: Medical Screening and the Misguided Hunt for Disease (Greystone, 2012).

This was the only article I could find not funded by the Government or Pharma with a clear analysis to the actual vaccine. I’m still in search of an ingredient list of the vaccine, and other information for her. Thanks again. Reply Tara Charles / November 26, 2012 Do you have any thoughts, or found any evidence that the rate and intensity of Shingles is increasing in North America? From what I’ve read, the U.K. didn’t implement the chickenpox vaccine for children because it feared that doing so would affect the cases of Shingles. And OMG…I work in healthcare and although this is only my anecdotal observation, Shingles is now extremely prevalent, painful, and can even lead to vision problems. (I’ve also talked to a GP who firmly believes it to be rather self evident that there has been a dramatic upswing and severity in cases of Shingles. She points to the vaccine as a likely candidate. ) Reply mary alexander / March 2, 2013 I got the vaccine about 4 years ago. I currently have a very painful Shingles. My breast and back have the rash – no itch, but horrible, horrible pain. The vaccine did not work for me Reply Sandy Foley / March 20, 2013 Is it possible that the injection is a money scam and of all the people who have received the vaccine The ones who did not get shingles, would probably never have gottem them in their life Anyway? Is there any proof to show that it really helps? Reply Lilla / March 21, 2013 I am 68 year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. I’m just getting over Shingles and I still have pain and can’t sleep because of that even if I take extra strength Tylenol…! After reading your studies regarding the Shingles Vaccine, I’ve decided to not get vaccinated for any future bouts with Shingles…! (Hopefully it won’t find me again…!) Do you have any information on how to alleviate this pain??? Thank you Lilla Reply Beth Gessinger / May 23, 2013 According to my book “Prescription for Nutritional Healing”, it advises to “avoid taking medications that contain acetaminophen (Tylenol, Datril, and others), as they may prolong the shingles. Perhaps you should try another pain killer? Good Luck, Beth Reply Carol Marica / April 12, 2013 I am 86, had shingles about 5 years ago.I had mild chest pains over my heart for about two weeks, A doctor that I went to see, spotted one blister on my back. He gave me a prescription for valacyclovir 500mg I started the pills right away and had no further pain or blisters.After reading this article I may not get the vaccination that I was contemplating. Carol Reply Chard Breed / May 12, 2013 brilliant, and so true. Thanks! Reply John Arkelian / June 16, 2013 Revised (to fix some small typos): In your article, you pose the question: “Is it possible the vaccine can actually cause shingles?” A good question to which there is no definitive answer…” Well, I know of one case in which the vaccine indisputably did cause the very illness it was intended to prevent. And neither the pharmaceutical company that made the drug (Merck Canada), nor Canada’s or Ontario’s health ministers, nor the FDA in the United States showed the slightest interest in investigating or reconsidering (or even quantifying) the vaccine’s potential risks. My published op-ed article on the case appears at this link — though you will have to scroll down to find the article, titled “When the Cure Causes the Disease…” http://artsforum.ca/ideas/regional-perspectives John Arkelian Canada Reply Larry Phillips / January 11, 2014 Like the author and many of the readers, I too have my doubts about the efficacy of the shingles vaccine. However, I question the $30,000 calculation cost to prevent one case. I believe the vaccine lasts for 10 years so wouldn’t the cost per year be $3,000. Certainly still a significant sum. Reply Kevin Friesen / January 21, 2014 While most of the numbers stated are correct (although the $30000 per person is not right, but 30000 per case of shingles avoided may be), the 5 cases per 1000 patient years is slightly misleading. By the time you are sixty, you have a 30% chance of having shingles, if you live to 80, you have a 50% chance. Imagine 100 patients observed for 60 years. This is 6000 patient years. If you have 5 cases per 1000 patient years, this ends up with 30 cases. Thirty cases in 100 people is 30%. The thing is that citing incidence rates can be very misleading unless you know how to interpret them. When I was first learning how to do population research I started by learning about zoster. When I heard about the vaccine, I to thought that if the incidence is only 5 per 1000 patient years why even bother, especially since it is only 50 to 65% effective (different studies have had different results, but the 50% is pretty good). But when you consider that you have a 30% chance of getting it by the time you are sixty, and 50% by the time you are eighty (I plan on living that long anyways), then it seems a bit more likely. More important though, in my mind, is that it is 67% effective in preventing post herpetic neuralgia, which is that intense burning nerve pain that is so extremely difficult to treat that can follow shingles. It is true that there are adverse reports, most of them are mild, but yes, a self limited rash is possible. Whether full outbreak of shingles could occur is not so obvious. We already have the virus, all of us, sleeping in all of our spinal nerves, it is not like the vaccine will wake it up, rather, it will cause the immune system to suppress it. That being said, anything can happen, but just because she got it does not necessarily mean it was from the vaccine, she might have gotten shingle anyways. Whether I think the public should pay for it, well, it is pretty expensive on a nationwide basis for how well it works, so I don’t know. Reply Dick de Seve / September 5, 2016 The problem is that these manufacturers state that ANYBODY has a 1 in 3 chance of getting shingles in their lifetime. That is absolutely false. My physician, who combines homeopathy and standard medicine, states that the actual number is more like 11%. For that, I will not be getting the vaccine. Another medical scam. Reply RJ Patterson / November 22, 2014 My interest in reading this article is that I have just had a shingles like outbreak, although the appears and symptoms are consistent my doctor has yet to examine me. The original discussion fails to consider that the ZOSTAVAX vaccination is a once in a lifetime vaccination. A booster is not recommended. As one comment noted the study population was not comprised only of seniors with elevated incidence rates. Once these issues are considered group cost of prevention is reduced substantially, by a factor of at least 30, possibly by as much as 60 ~ 90. So the cost per case of shingles prevention is reduced to as little as $350, otherwise as much as $1000. Much less than the suggested $30,000. If you get the ZOSTAVAX vaccination before you are 60 years old, you are on average providing yourself with nominally 30 years of protection, or reduction of severity. Even with only a 50 ~ 65% effectiveness rate it is a minor cost for an average budget. So, with that said, I will have the vaccination what ever my doctor advises the rash to be! Reply Cheryl / February 1, 2015 Recent studies demonstrate that immune system antibodies from vaccine are quite low after just two years. Most researchers now agree that vaccine provides a maximum of five years protection. So it is doubtful that this is a one time vaccine. As people age, incidence of shingles increases. So vaccinate a 60-year-old and he/she will have NO protection at age 70, when even more vulnerable to shingles. I will wait for vaccination until age 70. If I get Shingles before then, I will take antivirals immediately to shorten length and severity. A second bout is rare so having a case before getting vaccinated would decide that I don’t need to get vaccinated. Reply Justin White / February 18, 2016 Thanks for this – been seeing a poster at my local Coop pharmacy, and they’ve started putting it in their flier too. The ‘1 in 3 people will develop shingles’ seemed sketchy to me, I thought shingles were pretty rare. Seeing these numbers help – but where do these posters get off saying ‘1 in 3’ people will develop shingles in their lifetime? If we take into account the number of children that die, that means pretty much everyone who reaches a certain age will get it. I simply don’t believe it. Reply Reg Reid / February 20, 2016 After carefully considering the over-the-top marketing and speaking to others, I have to say the type of scare-mongering practiced by Merck pharma doesn’t have me convinced of the benefit of the vaccine. It does have me convinced the company has an ethics problem though. Reply victoria / April 26, 2016 I am a healthy person, but couple of years ago my Dr. urged me to get this vaccine, which I would not touch with 10 foot pole. When the Gov. and the doctors are suggesting the medicine, I am very sceptical. However, my friend developed a small rash on her behind, achy, itchy and blistery. As I study, read and try home remedies with anything that ails me or my friends. I suggested to her to put toothpaste on her blisters or Apple cider vinegar. IT WORKED, even the pain was gone. A lot of people are not aware, when in blisters, it is contagious if touched with body fluids. The wife who was vaccinated and then came up with diagnose of shingles, she probably got it from her husband and vaccine just made it worse. Reply Robert Dares / August 30, 2016 I contracted shingles on 19 Feb. 2016 and now after 6 months it is nearly gone. only some slight pain and itching left. I am trying to find out if it is possible to get shingles a second time. Do I need to get the vaccine? Reply daryl / September 20, 2016 I have a viral inner ear infection. It could be caused be chicken pox or herpes virus. Would the shingles vaccine affect this for good or bad?

The EpiPen, so prominent in the news lately, delivers about $1 worth of the hormone through an easily administered auto-injector. The story of how the price skyrocketed six-fold evinces both the genius and the folly of the American healthcare system. Christopher Hopkins Christopher Hopkins Photo by Contributed Photo /Times Free Press. The device that became the Epi- Pen was invented in 1974 as a means for U.S. soldiers to quickly treat symptoms of poison gas on the battlefield. In 1987, the device was approved for delivery of epinephrine (the trade name for adrenaline) to treat anaphylaxis. The manufacturer was acquired by Pfizer, which sold the marketing rights to Merck. In 2007, Mylan Pharmaceuticals purchased the marketing rights to the product. At that time, a single-dose injector sold for around $50. Mylan embarked upon a brilliant strategy: to stimulate additional demand by encouraging the stockpiling of EpiPen devices in public venues. It was a masterstroke of promotion that also saved lives, as the company relentlessly raised awareness of the risk of severe allergic reactions in children. Ultimately, Congress passed a bill in 2013 encouraging schools to keep emergency supplies of the injectors on hand. This was a classic case study in marketing that enriched shareholders as well as Mylan's executives as sales spiked from $200 million in 2007 to $1.1 billion last year. Thanks to the byzantine and mysterious mechanism of rebates, discounts and revenue sharing with pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies, virtually no one paid the full retail price. This began to change as high-deductible health care plans gained market share. And while the trend was already under way, Obamacare accelerated the rush to high-copay plans. This means many more patients are now confronted with the full $300 bill for an EpiPen until their deductible is satisfied. While never anticipated by Mylan, the significant cost shift toward patients has now created a major public relations nightmare for the company. Many of the same politicians who mandated EpiPen distribution in the schools now rail against the resultant price hikes. One might reasonably inquire as to why a century-old drug in a 30-year-old package has not been replaced with generics. Recall Ronald Reagan's prophetic quip about the most terrifying words in English: "I'm from the Government and I'm here to help you." As it turns out, there exist both a less expensive branded competitor to Mylan's EpiPen and a generic equivalent. But under current FDA rules, they cannot be freely substituted without a specific prescription, although it is unclear how they could differ substantially enough to warrant exclusion. Nevertheless, these alternatives have struggled to attain barely 10 percent of the market. Meanwhile, the FDA has been woefully slow to evaluate and approve additional generic substitutes. According to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, there are over 4,000 generic drug applications awaiting FDA approval, including potential EpiPen replacements. Contrast that with the European equivalent of the FDA, with a backlog of just 24 applications. Not surprisingly, the European version of the EpiPen sells for a fraction of the cost. It is indeed rare that we look across the Atlantic for a model of economic efficiency, but in this case the U.S. FDA has actually protected Mylan's effective monopoly and inhibited the market's inherently competitive response to a pricing imbalance. Mylan is responding to the negative attention with a generic of its own, and it looks like FDA approval for a Teva Pharmaceutical version may finally be forthcoming in 2017. Once the force of competition is unleashed, expect the price to decline rapidly. And expect the EpiPen to star in future case studies of both what is right and what is wrong with American healthcare.

ReportBuyer Sep 08, 2016, 17:40 ET Share this article LONDON, Sept. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The global sleeping aids market accounted for $61,798.0 million in 2015, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% during 2016-2022. The Insomnia sleep disorder segment dominated the global sleeping aids market in 2015 with 30.1% share; whereas, among the various products, the mattress and pillow segment accounted for the highest share at 42.3% in the global sleeping aids market in the same year. The growth of the sleeping aids market is escalating with high growth rate, due to growing aging population. The growth of aging population has become the major growth driver for the global sleeping aids market, as with aging, people experience various health issues, due to which they become more susceptible to sleep disorders. With the changes in lifestyle, the increased consumption of products containing caffeine, alcohol, smoking and tobacco further leads to disrupted sleep, thus leading to the growth of the global sleeping aids market. The sleeping aid products industry has witnessed huge growth in the recent years. The growing acceptance of mattresses and pillows, sleeping aid medications (sleeping pills), sleep laboratories and sleep apnea devices has increased the demand for sleeping aids. The mattress and pillow segment grew with an average annual growth rate of over 6.0% during 2012-2015. The emergence of medications has further laid opportunities for the growth of the global sleeping aids market. The changes in lifestyle patterns, along with working in different shifts are encouraging consumers to use sleeping aid products, for overcoming disturbance in sleep. The disturbance in sleep also increases the risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, depression, heart diseases and obesity. Obesity can lead to serious sleep disorders, such as insomnia and sleep apnea. All these factors are further responsible for the growth of the global sleeping aids market. The increasing awareness about sleep disorders by various organizations is further driving the growth of the global sleeping aids market. Various government and non-government organizations are spreading awareness about the importance of proper sleep and usage of sleep aid products. These organizations aim at providing awareness about sleep hygiene by educating people about it. The restraints associated with the growth of the global sleeping aids market include patent expiration of sleeping pills and various side effects associated with sleeping aids medications. The loss of patents of various major drugs used to treat sleep disorder results in heavy loss within revenue generation, which is adversely affecting the growth of the global sleeping aids market. In addition, the side effects associated with the consumption of sleeping aids medications, such as headache, dry mouth, dizziness, constipation and stomach ache is further restraining the growth of the global sleeping aids market. The key companies operating in the global sleeping aids market include Merck & Co., Sanofi, Koninklijke Philips N.V, Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC., SleepMed Inc., Cadwell Laboratories Inc., Natus Medical Incorporated, Drive Medical Ltd., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Compumedics Limited, CareFusion Corporation, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

Jeanne Yurman reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Investors took a look at mixed economic data and earnings news and said "meh". Blue chips were little changed while tech shares stumbled. The U.S. services sector, which accounts for a majority of the country's jobs, chugged ahead last month according to the Institute for Supply Management. Its services index ticked up to 54 from 53 in December. And payroll processing firm ADP said private sector jobs expanded by 175,000 last month. The cold weather, it said, was behind the smallest increase since August. The markets have been unable to shake some possibly troubling signs of an economic slowdown and the challenges facing emerging markets. Famed investor Jim Rogers says these concerns will be with us for a while. SOUNDBITE: JIM ROGERS, CHAIRMAN, ROGERS HOLDINGS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "A lot of markets are going to have serious, serious problems for three or four years until they sort out their basic problems, which they're ignoring." After the bell, Twitter, under pressure to show Tweets translate to profits, beat Street forecasts with a non-GAAP earnings of two cents per share. But its average monthly subscriber number disappointed at 241 million. Dow component Walt Disney handily beat profit and revenue estimates helped by runaway hit "Frozen" and strength in its TV networks. Earlier in the day, Time Warner's space thriller "Gravity" helped propel better-than-forecast quarterly profits. And for the first time ever, it detailed results for HBO, revealing revenues of nearly $5 billion and the biggest jump in U.S. subscribers in 17 years. Merck's earnings missed Street forecasts. But shares of the number two U.S. drugmaker held steady after it said it's working with three other drugmakers to find combo treatments for a future cancer medicine. CVS Caremark became the first national drugstore chain to stop selling tobacco products. The company said selling them was in conflict with its efforts to be known as a health provider. And Google put a three-year antitrust probe by European regulators to rest - and avoided a fine - after agreeing to concessions on how it displays rivals' links on its website. It had been accused of promoting its own services at the expense of other companies like Microsoft. Sticking with Europe, edgy European markets broke a two-week slide thanks to a technical bounce.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 08, 2016 11:12am   Comments Share: Related IYH Healthcare ETFs: Maybe Too Much Time In The Penalty Box Government Study: Cellphone Radiation Linked To Cancer What Investors Should Expect Under President Trump (Seeking Alpha) Just two months away from Election Day, it is accurate and fair to say this presidential election year — as have previous ones — has been unkind to the healthcare sector. Election Year Blues The third-largest sector weight in the S&P 500 is lagging the benchmark U.S. equity index by a wide margin. For example, the (NYSE: IYH) is up just 1.6 percent year-to-date, less than 20 percent of the 8.5 percent returned this year by the S&P 500. Over the past 90 days, traditional cap-weighted healthcare ETFs such as IYH have steadied a bit, returning around 1 percent. However, that still lags the S&P 500 by a considerable margin and underscores a point recently that healthcare stocks are inversely correlated to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's poll numbers. Related Link: Infrastructure Intelligence With This ETF Put simply, if polls emerge showing Clinton extending her lead over Republican rival Donald Trump, it is likely healthcare stocks and ETFs will fall on that news. This creates a good news/bad news situation for investors mulling new stakes in the likes of IYH. Viral Volatility? “Although volatility is likely to persist across the broad market, specific sectors may be particularly vulnerable, or conversely, offer some opportunity. Among those to be cautious on is health care,” said BlackRock in a recent note. “The sector has historically underperformed in election years (source: Bloomberg), due in large part to concerns over pricing pressure on the biotech and pharmaceuticals subsectors. The latest headlines over EpiPen pricing have renewed this focus and brought with it increased volatility.” As has been widely documented, election year political yammering has negatively affected the biotechnology stocks. In turn, that has plagued ETFs such as IYH because — although these are diversified healthcare ETFs — they feature significant biotech weights. For its part, IYH allocates over 23 percent of its weight to biotech stocks. Paragon Consider this: Four of the Dow stocks that are up at least 10 percent this year are Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE: UNH). Those stocks combine for nearly 29 percent of IYH's lineup, but the ETF is not even up 2 percent this year because of biotech's politically-induced drag on the broader healthcare sector. “Over the short term, we don’t believe that the election and a new president will have a big impact on health care stocks’ fundamentals. Given the two candidates’ opposing views on health care, however, there could well be longer-term implications on policy changes. But remember that implementing any real, significant changes to the health care system will need to pass through Congress and will likely take years, not months,” added BlackRock.

According to the study results, a dose-dependent, statistically significant reduction in serum iron was observed in the study. LJPC-401 was also well tolerated, and there were no dose-limiting toxicities. LJPC closed Wednesday's trading at $16.02, down 2.38%. Merck's (MRK) supplemental Biologics License Application for KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 has been assigned priority review, with a decision date set for Dec. 24, 2016. KEYTRUDA is already approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and for treating patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The drug generated global sales of $566 million in 2015 - the first full year on market, and $563 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. MRK closed Wednesday's trading at $62.87, down 0.59%. The phase II results of Repros Therapeutics Inc.'s (RPRX) oral Proellex for the treatment of premenopausal women with confirmed symptomatic endometriosis, announced Wednesday, are encouraging. According to the company, subjects with moderate to severe endometriosis experienced relief of menstrual pain and a reduction in the use of pain medication with the use of Proellex. More specifically, subjects treated with Proellex had a statistically significant greater reduction in menstrual pain compared to the 37.5% change from baseline achieved with placebo. Additionally, the total pain medication use decreased 56% and non-prescription pain medication use decreased 74% in subjects treated with Proellex. RPRX closed Wednesday's trading at $1.90, down 2.56%. Shares of Retrophin Inc. (RTRX) rose as much as 44% on Wednesday, following positive top-line results from its phase II study of Sparsentan for the treatment of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, is a rare kidney disease that scars the kidneys, causing them to lose functionality. FSGS is a common cause of proteinuria, a condition which refers to abnormal amount of protein in the urine. In the phase II study, dubbed DUET, the mean reduction of proteinuria from baseline after eight weeks of treatment for all patients treated with 200, 400, and 800 mg/day of Sparsentan was 44.8 percent, compared to a mean reduction of proteinuria for all patients receiving 300 mg/day of Irbesartan of 18.5 percent. Irbesartan is part of a class of drugs used to manage focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in the absence of an approved pharmacologic treatment. However, the comparison of individual Sparsentan dose cohorts to Irbesartan did not reach statistical significance. But, there were clear signals of relative improvement, said the company. RTRX closed Wednesday's trading at $20.81, up 27.51%. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Canadian News All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Here's Why ISB Food Group Is Recalling These Ice Cream Brands ADAP Surges As FDA Lifts Clinical Hold, OCUL Catches Eyes, RegeneRx On The Rise 7 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Comeback Kid: Donald Trump Hugely Resilient In Business, Too Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Novartis Reportedly Considering Sale Of Alcon Eye Care Division Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Erickson Says Bankruptcy Court Approves Interim DIP Financing Sumitomo Electric Starts Operation Of CPV Power Generation Plant In Morocco Allianz Group Q3 Profit Climbs; Confirms 2016 Operating Profit Outlook NTT H1 Profit Up, Sales Down; Lifts FY Profit View, Cuts Sales Forecast Bechtle Q3 Profit Rises; Outlook For Year Adjusted Upwards Innogy 9-month Profit Declines; Confirms Forecast - Quick Facts SIG 4-Month Revenues Rise, LFL Revenues Down; CEO Stuart Mitchell Steps Down Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

Please sign up for it here. We offer our view of odd provisions in Michael Weinstein’s two initiatives, turn to Fox News’ settlement with Gretchen Carlson in her sexual harassment case, and give our recommendation on Dean Cortopassi’s Proposition 53. Nice concept. Wrong prescription. Take a job Michael Weinstein has a fine job as head of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. And yet in the two initiatives he is promoting on the Nov. 8 ballot, he seems to be seeking a new position: defender of Propositions 60 and 61. Proposition 60 attacks the porn industry. Proposition 61 attacks the pharmaceutical industry. Both are worthy targets, though whether the measures should be approved is a question for another day (soon). Both initiatives include virtually identical and equally odd provisions. If the attorney general refuses to defend them in court, they say, the people of the state of California declare that the proponent of the measures could step in because he has “a direct and personal stake” in the outcome. That would be Weinstein. The language gets stranger. The proponent would become a state employee who would take the official oath of office, could only be fired by a majority vote of the Legislature for “good cause,” and would be indemnified by the state for actions related to defending the initiatives. Nice protections. Attorney Thomas Hiltachk, who visited our editorial board as part of the No-on-61 contingent Tuesday, theorized that the provision stems from the 2013 U.S. Supreme Court case challenging Proposition 8, the 2008 initiative banning same-sex marriage. Attorney General Kamala Harris, a proponent of marriage equality, declined to defend Proposition 8. So the measure’s backers stepped in, or tried to. A majority of the justices declined to rule on the merits of the case. The reason, they held, was that the proponents had no “direct stake” in the outcome. Propositions 60 and 61 aren’t nearly as weighty as Proposition 8 was. But lest the Supreme Court have any doubt, Weinstein would have a direct and personal stake in the outcome. Take a number: $86.6 million Proposition 61 implications aren’t altogether apparent. But by altering how the state purchases pharmaceuticals, the initiative threatens drugmakers’ bottom line. Clearly, Gilead, Merck, Purdue Pharma, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, Astra Zeneca and the rest understand the implications. They’ve raised $86.6 million to kill it, and the election is still two months away. Our take Editorial: The Roger Ailes scandal gives Fox a chance to disprove ongoing reports that Ailes was abetted by male managers who remain with the corporation. They can start with a fairer, more balanced, more respectful, perhaps even – dare we say it? – politically correct treatment of women, both off and on the air. Endorsement: In the guise of combating government debt, Proposition 53 could increase construction costs and add unnecessary layers of complexity and uncertainty to an already unwieldy state government. Also opposing Proposition 53 are The Mercury News of San Jose, The Bakersfield Californian and The Santa Rosa Press Democrat. Emily Rusch’s Soapbox: Senate Bill 1107 would empower small campaign donors over special interests and megadonors. David Vander Griend’s Soapbox: Biofuels present a solution to harmful airborne chemicals. Their take L.A. Times: No on Proposition 59. Don’t amend the Constitution over Citizens United. We don’t rule out supporting an appropriately crafted constitutional amendment in the future, but we see no reason to rush. We took a different view. Dallas Morning News: Donald Trump is not qualified to serve as president and does not deserve your vote. Miami Herald: Donald Trump’s gift to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi deserves a closer look. Charlotte Observer: John Koskinen’s imperfections almost surely fall far short of the “high crimes and misdemeanors” that impeachment requires. Syndicates take Ruben Navarrette: To judge Clinton on immigration, look at the company she’s kept. David Brooks: The incredible shrinking Obamacare. Mailbag: It is unacceptable and unconscionable that a city asks its citizens to participate in and support its events but makes no effort to provide basic and decent accommodations. – Sondra Olson, Davis And finally, All might not be lost for Patti “Patris” Miller, the Oak Park activist and business owner on the verge of losing her studio space to gentrification. Dozens of people have contributed to a GoFundMe page set up to help her purchase the building she leases at 35th Street and Second Avenue. Miller remains short of her goal of $50,000. Give a little to someone who gave a lot. Miller has lived in Oak Park for 25 years and helped transform it from a haven for drug dealers to one for hipsters. – Erika D.
