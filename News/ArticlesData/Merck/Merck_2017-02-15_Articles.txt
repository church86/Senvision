Merck's verubecestat becomes the latest casualty in treating Alzheimer's disease. Is there any hope in sight for this dreaded disease? Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Feb 15, 2017 at 5:02PM And another one bites the dust. Merck (NYSE:MRK) announced on Tuesday that it was halting a phase 2/3 clinical study of verubecestat in treating Alzheimer's disease. This news marked the second major clinical failure in recent months by a big drugmaker for a disease that still has no effective treatment. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) reported disappointing results for solanezumab in treating Alzheimer's disease in November. Why are these drugs proving to be ineffective? And is a pipeline candidate with a real shot at beating Alzheimer's disease anywhere in sight?  Image source: Getty Images. What's not working Merck's verubecestat inhibits the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). BACE1 is an enzyme that's involved with the development of amyloid beta. Amyloid beta consists of pieces of protein that clump together and build up over time into amyloid plaque in the brain. The goal of BACE inhibitors is to prevent the buildup of this plaque, and thereby slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Verubecestat showed great promise in an early-stage study. Patients with Alzheimer's disease taking a 60 mg dose of the experimental drug experienced sustained reduction in the levels of beta-amyloid peptides. Lilly's solanezumab also targeted the buildup of amyloid beta, but through a different mechanism. The humanized monoclonal antibody binds with soluble forms for the peptide that are thought to interfere with cognitive function. But while verubecestat reduced amyloid beta, Merck's external data-monitoring committee stated that the experimental drug had "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect" in improving cognition. Lilly's drug had already failed to improve cognition in two previous late-stage studies. However, the drugmaker initially saw some potential for solanezumab in reducing cognitive decline in patients with a mild form of Alzheimer's disease. Lilly moved forward with another late-stage study, which also flopped. More attempts Although Lilly has thrown in the towel for solanezumab, Merck is continuing to evaluate verubecestat in a late-stage study for treating Alzheimer's patients with early symptoms of the disease. Lilly and AstraZeneca are partnering on their own BACE inhibitor, which is currently in a late-stage trial. Roche (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) has also run into dead ends in the past in treating Alzheimer's disease. Gantenerumab disappointed in a previous phase 3 study targeting the indication. However, Roche thought the experimental drug might have a better chance of success given in higher doses. The company has two late-stage studies currently in progress, one for gantenerumab plus another for crenezumab. Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) claims one of the most promising Alzheimer's disease candidates right now. The biotech announced encouraging results from an early stage study of aducanumab in 2016. These results showed reduction in amyloid plaque, and more importantly, the rate of clinical decline in patients. Aducanumab is now in a late-stage study. Other theories Note that all of the drugs mentioned thus far target reduction of amyloid beta. There are other thoughts, however, about how to treat Alzheimer's disease. A major alternative theory involves preventing buildup of tau proteins. Like amyloid beta, tau protein deposits have been found in the brain cells of Alzheimer's disease patients. A couple of companies are pursuing the tau theory. Slovakian biotech AXON Neuroscience has a phase 2 study of its AADvac1 tau vaccine in progress. AC Immune is working with Johnson & Johnson on tau vaccine ACI-35 and with Roche on an anti-tau antibody. Both experimental therapies are in early-stage testing. Axovant Sciences (NYSE:AXON) is taking yet another approach. Alzheimer's disease patients have low levels of a neurotransmitter chemical called acetylcholine. Axovant's intepirdine is a 5HT6 receptor antagonist that blocks the receptor's ability to decrease acetylcholine levels. The experimental drug is in a late-stage clinical study for treating patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. What's next With the Alzheimer's-disease landscape littered with failures, it's probably wise to focus more on candidates farther along in the pipeline -- even though several late-stage drugs have also flopped. Merck's continuing late-stage study of verubecestat isn't scheduled to wrap up until 2019. Biogen should report results for aducanumab in 2019, also. Roche is on track to announce results from its study of gantenerumab in the same year. Results from the late-stage study of Roche's crenezumab are expected in 2020. It's possible, of course, that these studies could be halted early if there's no chance of success -- just as Merck recently did.  The earliest hope for an effective Alzheimer's treatment is with Axovant's intepirdine. Results from the company's late-stage study should be announced in the third quarter of this year. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The decision was made to end trials on verubecestat for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease after an external study found there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect," said a statement issued late Tuesday. "While we are disappointed that a benefit was not observed in this study, our work continues," said Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, adding that verubecestat will continue to be studied "in people with less advanced disease." Another study using the experimental drug is continuing, with its results expected in 2019. The results of a preliminary trial involving the drug in 32 people were released in November, when the company described the results as encouraging. The experimental drug was said to work by reducing levels of beta amyloid proteins by blocking an enzyme known as BACE1. In people with Alzheimer's disease, the proteins clump into plaques that damage the brain, affecting cognitive abilities, especially memory. The enzyme plays a key role in producing the proteins. Three months ago, US firm Eli Lilly abandoned its experimental drug solanezumab, saying it failed in a major clinical trial and calling the results "disappointing." The World Health Organization says 36 million people worldwide suffer from dementia. The number of cases is expected to reach more than 65 million by 2030, and triple to 115 million by 2050.

Drug company Merck made the decision after an independent study found that the drug, verubecestat, had 'virtually no chance' of working. The news comes just three months after Eli Lilly ended the only other promising trial into a drug to treat the devastating brain disease. Patients taking it had demonstrated no signs of improvement compared to those taking a placebo. It marks the latest in a long line of crushing disappointments as scientists struggle to find an effective treatment for the mind-wasting disease. Drug company Merck announced it was halting its late-stage trial for a new Alzheimer's drug after an independent study found it had 'virtually no chance of working' (stock) Merck had been testing the drug in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. 'There were high hopes that [the trial] might succeed,' Dr John Breitner, a professor of geriatric psychiatry and preventive medicine at McGill University, told CNN. 'There is a lot of concern and debate in the professional community at this point. It has been very disappointing.'  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Heading a football raises the risk of dementia: Study of... Do YOU cook with vegetable oil? It could increase your risk... Share this article Share HOW TO DETECT ALZHEIMER'S Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory, thinking skills and the ability to perform simple tasks. It is the cause of 60 percent to 70 percent of cases of dementia. The majority of people with Alzheimer's are age 65 and older. More than five million Americans have Alzheimer’s. It is unknown what causes Alzheimer's. Those who have the APOE gene are more likely to develop late-onset Alzheimer's.  Signs and symptoms: Difficulty remembering newly learned information Disorientation Mood and behavioral changes Suspicion about family, friends and professional caregivers More serious memory loss Difficulty with speaking, swallowing and walking Stage of Alzheimer's: Mild Alzheimer's (early-stage) - A person may be able to function independently but is having memory lapses Moderate Alzheimer's (middle-stage) - Typically the longest stage, the person may confuse words, get frustrated or angry, or have sudden behavioral changes Severe Alzheimer's disease (late-stage) - In the final stage, individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, carry on a conversation and, eventually, control movement There is no known cure for Alzheimer's, but experts suggest physical exercise, social interaction and adding brain boosting omega-3 fats to your diet to prevent or slowdown the onset of symptoms. Currently, about 47 million people live with dementia worldwide, with Alzheimer's accounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases. This figure is expected to double every 20 years to reach 131 million people in 2050, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. The disease slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. It's been over a a decade since a new drug for alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's was made available.  However, there is currently no treatment available proven to stop - or slow down - the impact of the disease. Verubecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer's drugs called BACE1 inhibitors that target an enzyme involved in the formation of the toxic amyloid protein that turns into plaque in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. While the ultimate cause of cell death and tissue loss in the brain of Alzheimer's patients has never been proven, amyloid plaque build-up between nerve cells in the brain has been long suspected as one of the main causes. But the failure of verubecestat adds to growing concerns that this assumption is wrong. Although studies have managed to successfully 'cure' or reduce memory loss in transgenic lab animals such as rats, this has never been replicated in humans. Dr Breitner said: 'Alzheimer's is a terrible disease and we desperately need treatments. There would be a huge market for a successful drug. 'Until now companies have been willing to take the risk [by investing large sums of money in clinical trials]. But at the moment a lot of things are being reassessed.' Researchers are increasingly focusing on attacking the disease earlier because it appears likely that once symptoms have taken hold, any approach fails to work. Merck said another study of its drug in patients with prodromal, or very early, Alzheimer's disease would continue with results expected by February 2019. Patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living.  Read more: Promising Alzheimer's drug verubecestat fails in Merck trial - CNN.com Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Moment ISIS suicide attacker detonates bomb near Syrian rebels Dog CRIES after being told off for chewing sofa into pieces Redback spider catches brown snake in it's web and attacks it Terrifying moment deadly Chicago ambush captured on Facebook live Shocking moment a model poses on the ledge of very tall skyscraper Social Experiment: Would you breastfeed a stranger's baby?

 A breakthrough approach to treating Alzheimer's is facing major setbacks Lydia Ramsey Feb. 15, 2017, 2:07 PM 1,867 facebook linkedin twitter email print NIH Many promising Alzheimer's drug trials have failed in the past few months. The latest trial from drugmaker Merck stopped Tuesday after a committee found that the drug had "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect." These drugs are based on the "amyloid hypothesis," which some are still hopeful will be a successful way to treat Alzheimer's even with these setbacks. It's been a hard few months for promising Alzheimer's clinical trials.  The disease in its mildest form is characterized by symptoms including memory lapses, getting lost, repeating questions, and misplacing things — behaviors that generally get more severe over time.  By 2050, the number of people living with Alzheimer's in the US alone is projected to triple to an estimated 13.8 million.  Right now, there are only four treatments that treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's, and the hits just keep coming for potential new treatments in development. (On average about 99% of all drugs in clinical trials never actually make it to approval.) On Tuesday, drugmaker Merck stopped its late-stage trial of its drug, verubecestat, in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's, after a committee found that there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect." The hope was to have the drug stop the disease from progressing. Merck said it's still working on another late-stage trial for the drug to treat people with even earlier stages of the disease, and those results are expected in 2019.  The results came less than a week after another Alzheimer's drug that was hoping to treat the symptoms of the disease failed two key clinical trials.  The amyloid hypothesis is taking a beating So far, 2017 isn't looking much different from 2016, when there were four major flops for Alzheimer's drugs, including a highly-anticipated treatment from pharmaceutical giant Lilly. That drug, solanezumab, as well as Merck's verubecestat came out of research on the "amyloid hypothesis," or the idea that targeting beta amyloid deposits in the brain to clear them out was the way to go about treating the disease. In people who have Alzheimer these deposits build up in certain parts of the brain, but it's still not known whether the plaques cause the disease, or are just a byproduct. NIH But solanezumab failed to slow down cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's; those in tests who took a placebo fared about the same.  "It's not what we wanted, it's not that leap forward for patients, but it's a step forward for the science," Dan Skovronsky, Lilly's senior vice president of clinical and product development, told Business Insider in January. Skovronsky said that progress was related to being able to screen patients for the very thing they were trying to target, something that he said seems intuitive but isn't. "What it's telling us is that there's a small effect on disease progression. But it's not zero. It's a clue that we're headed in the right direction." Skovoronsky said that despite some setbacks, he remained more encouraged than ever by the amyloid hypothesis. Even so, Lilly has stopped its remaining phase 3 solanezumab trial, turning the focus onto the company's BACE inhibitor — the same kind of approach that the Merck drug took.  Lilly's not the only one that's holding on hope for the amyloid hypothesis. Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal noted that Merck's trial was expected to fail, in particular because it didn't screen for people with beta-amyloid plaques before getting started (diagnostics that screen for the plaques are still relatively new). That's not the case with the other trial Merck's continuing, where they're targeting people with even earlier stages of Alzheimer's. And treating as early as possible could be the key to proving out the amyloid hypothesis, Roger Pelmutter, Merck's head of research and development told Forbes.  "Because Alzheimer’s progresses over a period of decades, it’s understandable that it might be necessary to get in really quite early," he said.  There will be more opportunities to see that hypothesis in action, too. Biogen, another company that's big in neuroscience, expects to have data on its beta-amyloid targeting treatment in 2019.  There's still more ahead in 2017, and not all rely on the amyloid hypothesis   While a lot seems to hinge on the amyloid hypothesis, drugmakers are working on other approaches that could be game-changing. Accera, the company looking into the metabolic aspects of Alzheimer's, will have data coming out on its phase three trial in the first quarter of 2017. And Axovant, whose drug aims to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's, will have phase three data coming out in the second half of 2017. Some of Axovant's competitors that have been going after the same target have had less-than stellar results. On February 8, drugmaker Lundbeck announced its 5-HT6 antagonist had failed two key trials, quashing any last hopes for that particular drug.   SEE ALSO: 6 factors that could increase your risk of Alzheimer's disease DON'T MISS: 2017 will be a make-or-break year for neuroscience drugs NOW WATCH: The US government just sank a giant ship on purpose — and the footage is amazing Loading video...

Merck is stopping the study following the recommendation of the external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC), which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim safety analysis, and determined that there was “virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect.” The eDMC noted that safety signals observed in the study “are not sufficient to warrant stopping study 017,” and recommended that protocol 019, also known as APECS, which is evaluating verubecestat in people with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease, continue unchanged. Results from protocol 019 are expected in February 2019. Results from EPOCH will be analyzed and presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. “Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most pressing and daunting medical issues of our time, with inherent, substantial challenges to developing an effective disease-modifying therapy for people with mild-to-moderate disease. Studies such as EPOCH are critical, and we are indebted to the patients in this study and their caregivers,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “While we are disappointed that a benefit was not observed in this study, our work continues with APECS, which is studying verubecestat in people with less advanced disease.” The efficacy and safety of verubecestat was being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials: Protocol 017, or EPOCH, in mild-to-moderate AD, and Protocol 019, or APECS, in prodromal AD. Patients with mild to moderate AD exhibit detectable and worsening impairment of cognitive and functional abilities. Patients with prodromal AD have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living.

Meet the Contributors → Merck Alzheimer Drug Is Latest To Fail In A Big Study Alex Lash February 15th, 2017 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  Another Alzheimer’s drug has failed a major test. Merck (NYSE: MRK) reported late Tuesday that its pill verubecestat was not helping people with significant Alzheimer’s symptoms. The drug maker announced that it halted its EPOCH study early because an oversight group said there was “virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect.” Verubecestat is the latest in a long string of experimental Alzheimer’s drugs that have failed to meet study goals and help people whose symptoms are fairly advanced—known as “mild to moderate” Alzheimer’s. Most of these drugs have attacked the underlying disease by breaking up accumulations, or plaques, of the protein amyloid-beta, or by preventing the plaques from forming. Verubecestat was meant to be a preventative measure. Every failure of an amyloid-targeting drug adds fuel to skepticism about the prevailing theory of treatment: that attacking the protein, in whichever form it takes, will help Alzheimer’s patients. “Expectations for this trial were low,” wrote ISI Evercore biopharma analyst Mark Schoenebaum in a research note Tuesday evening. He cited two factors: First, Merck did not test patients for amyloid-beta before enrolling them. That means people with other forms of dementia were likely included in the 2,200-person study, and verubecestat was not designed to help them. Second, the study aimed to treat people well into the course of the disease. Stung by other failures in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s patients, drug makers and researchers have shifted hopes to patients who have amyloid in their brains, or high risk of Alzheimer’s based on their genetics, but whose symptoms are not as far along. Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) is making a huge bet that its drug aducanumab, now in Phase 3 studies due to provide data in 2019, will help people with early disease. But Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) said last fall that its drug solanezumab failed to deliver enough impact for patients with mild Alzheimer’s, and two months later it pulled the plug on a related study with even earlier-stage patients. Merck said it would continue to test verubecestat in a separate study of prodromal Alzheimer’s patients, who have memory loss but can still live relatively normal lives. The prodromal study is dubbed APECS. Because Alzheimer’s progresses so slowly, researchers are keen to find an underlying biological signal that could stand in for health improvements to show a drug is working. In heart disease, that surrogate signal is lower cholesterol; in HIV, it is viral load. But so far the ties between amyloid levels and changes in health have proven elusive. “A third of people with amyloid in their brains don’t get Alzheimer’s,” said USAgainstAlzheimer’s chairman George Vradenburg in an interview with Xconomy last week. “You can demonstrate a positive change in amyloid, but it’s not necessarily established that you’d have a positive clinical benefit.” More major Alzheimer’s data are due later this year from Axovant Sciences (NASDAQ: AXON), which bought a discontinued drug from GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) for $5 million with hopes it could help mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s patients stave off cognitive decline. The drug, intepirdine, is being tested in a big Phase 3 study in combination with donepezil, one of the few cognitive boosters approved for Alzheimer’s. It works by interacting with the brain chemical serotonin, not by disrupting amyloid. (Axovant’s trial and Merck’s EPOCH were two of 14 key trials to watch in 2017 that Xconomy flagged late last year.) Verubecestat blocks a protein called beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, or BACE1. When left unchecked, BACE acts like tiny scissors to create the amyloid-beta fragments that clump up into plaques. Earlier BACE inhibitors failed because of safety concerns. Verubecestat is part of a new generation that their makers hope have fewer side effects and change the course of the disease. The outside advisors monitoring EPOCH said that side effects were not part of the decision to stop the study, according to Merck, and recommended that APECS continue without changes. “Brain” by Dierk Schaefer via Creative Commons 2.0 license.

The latest disappointment comes from a phase II/III study of Merck & Co's BACE inhibitor verubecestat, a drug designed to block the formation of the amyloid plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The EPOCH trial enrolled patients with established mild-to-moderate Alzheimer symptoms and was due to generate primary results later this year and complete fully in 2019. However, an interim look at the data accrued so far by the study's monitoring committee has determined that there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect" with verubecestat. Merck (known as MSD outside the US and Canada) is currently leading the race to bring a BACE inhibitor to market, so the failure of the EPOCH trial fires a warning shot across the bows of companies that also have BACE inhibitors in development, including Lilly/AstraZeneca, Eisai/Biogen and Novartis. The list of failed amyloid-targeting drugs in Alzheimer's is extensive, but there have been high hopes that BACE inhibitors could duck the trend as they prevent the formation of plaques while other drugs have focused on breaking them up. Several candidates in the class have been discontinued - including Roche's RG7129, Eli Lilly's LY2886721 and Vitae/Boehringer Ingelheim's BI 1181181 - but have so far been scuppered by toxicity issues. The EPOCH trial results are among the first to point to a lack of efficacy for the class, and analysts at Evercore ISI said in a research note that while BACE inhibitors may still have a role to play in Alzheimer's the finding "will dampen investor enthusiasm for the mechanism”. However, the US drugmaker is not giving up on verubecestat just yet. The data monitoring committee has recommended that a trial in prodromal disease - in other words patients who have mild cognitive symptoms but are not yet considered to have Alzheimer's proper - should continue unchanged. That study - called APECS - got underway in 2013 and is due to generate its first results in 2019, said Merck. The company's head of R&D Roger Perlmutter said that while the results are disappointing there are "inherent, substantial challenges" to developing an effective disease-modifying therapy for people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. "Studies such as EPOCH are critical, and we are indebted to the patients in this study and their caregivers. Our work continues with APECS, which is studying verubecestat in people with less advanced disease," he added. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

It comes just three months after Eli Lilly announced that it was ending the clinical trial of its Alzheimer's drug solanezumab, after patients taking it demonstrated no signs of improvement compared to those taking a placebo. "While we are disappointed that a benefit was not observed in this study, our work continues [to study the impact of] verubecestat in people with less advanced disease," said Dr Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories. Experts say the failure of the drug on people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's was a substantial setback. "There were high hopes that [the trial] might succeed," Professor John Breitner, Canada research chair in prevention of dementia and professor of geriatric psychiatry and preventive medicine at McGill University told CNN.

While two well-established risk factors for Alzheimer's are genetics and aging, "there is hope that adopting healthy brain life habits might delay or prevent the appearance of Alzheimer's disease," the Alzheimer's Association says. Here are some tips: Stay physically active to maintain good blood flow to the brain and encourage new brain cells. Eat a "brain-healthy diet" low in fat and cholesterol. Stay social to reduce stress levels and maintain healthy brain cell connections. Stay mentally active to strengthen brain cells and the connections between them. "There is a lot of concern and debate in the professional community at this point. It has been very disappointing." Around 47 million people currently live with dementia worldwide, with Alzheimer's estimated to account for 60 to 80% of dementia cases. This figure is expected to double every 20 years to reach 131 million people in 2050, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. Years of testing, trials It has now been over a decade since a new drug for alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's was made available. There is currently no treatment that has been proven to slow the impact of the disease, which causes a gradual decline in memory and thinking skills and eventually leaves sufferers unable to care for themselves. "We really don't know the causal pathway that causes the loss of connection in the brain that results in the loss of cognitive abilities [in Alzheimer's patients]," said Breitner. "Despite 25 years of trying to figure out what is going on and what is the appropriate target for treatment, we still don't know." There have been many successful studies that have "cured" or reduced memory loss in transgenic lab animals such as rats, which have been bred with human genes as a model for Alzheimer's. But this success has so far never been replicated in humans. JUST WATCHED How Alzheimer's destroys the brain Replay More Videos ...

While the ultimate cause of cell death and tissue loss in the brain of Alzheimer's patients has never been proven, amyloid plaque build-up between nerve cells in the brain has been long suspected as one of the main causes of the disease. However, the failure of verubecestat adds to growing concerns that this underlying assumption, known as beta amyloid theory, is wrong. There are several pharma companies currently trialling BACE inhibitors in the hope of finding a cure, including AstraZeneca and its research partner Eli Lilly, Novartis in collaboration with Amgen, as well as Janssen and Biogen. "Alzheimer's is a terrible disease and we desperately need treatments. There would be a huge market for a successful drug," said Brietner. "Until now companies have been willing to take the risk [by investing large sums of money in clinical trials]. But at the moment a lot of things are being reassessed." Continuing the fight against Alzheimer's "This isn't the end for beta amyloid theory, just yet," said Professor Bryce Vissel, the Roth Fellow and director of the Centre of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at University of Technology Sydney. "There's a trial of another important drug for Alzheimer's, aducanumab, being run by Biogen -- another pharmaceutical company -- which has shown interesting and encouraging signs." "We must continue to pursue this disease," said Vissel. "There's good reason to have hope and optimism that with the pursuit of excellent science and some rethinking about [Alzheimer's], a treatment will become available for this devastating disease in our lifetimes." The results of Merck's trial of verubecestat on patients with early stage Alzheimer's are expected in February 2019. Merck's shares fell by nearly 2% following Tuesday's announcement.

While the ultimate cause of cell death and tissue loss in the brain of Alzheimer's patients has never been proven, amyloid plaque build-up between nerve cells in the brain has been long suspected as one of the main causes of the disease. However, the failure of verubecestat adds to growing concerns that this underlying assumption, known as beta amyloid theory, is wrong. There are several pharma companies currently trialling BACE inhibitors in the hope of finding a cure, including AstraZeneca and its research partner Eli Lilly, Novartis in collaboration with Amgen, as well as Janssen and Biogen. "Alzheimer's is a terrible disease and we desperately need treatments. There would be a huge market for a successful drug," said Brietner. "Until now companies have been willing to take the risk [by investing large sums of money in clinical trials]. But at the moment a lot of things are being reassessed." Continuing the fight against Alzheimer's "This isn't the end for beta amyloid theory, just yet," said Professor Bryce Vissel, the Roth Fellow and director of the Centre of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at University of Technology Sydney. "There's a trial of another important drug for Alzheimer's, aducanumab, being run by Biogen -- another pharmaceutical company -- which has shown interesting and encouraging signs." "We must continue to pursue this disease," said Vissel. "There's good reason to have hope and optimism that with the pursuit of excellent science and some rethinking about [Alzheimer's], a treatment will become available for this devastating disease in our lifetimes." The results of Merck's trial of verubecestat on patients with early stage Alzheimer's are expected in February 2019. Merck's shares fell by nearly 2% following Tuesday's announcement.

It comes just three months after Eli Lilly announced that it was ending the clinical trial of its Alzheimer’s drug solanezumab, after patients taking it demonstrated no signs of improvement compared to those taking a placebo. “While we are disappointed that a benefit was not observed in this study, our work continues [to study the impact of] verubecestat in people with less advanced disease,” said Dr Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories. Experts say the failure of the drug on people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s was a substantial setback. “There were high hopes that [the trial] might succeed,” Professor John Breitner, Canada research chair in prevention of dementia and professor of geriatric psychiatry and preventive medicine at McGill University told CNN. “There is a lot of concern and debate in the professional community at this point. It has been very disappointing.” Around 47 million people currently live with dementia worldwide, with Alzheimer’s estimated to account for 60 to 80% of dementia cases. This figure is expected to double every 20 years to reach 131 million people in 2050, according to Alzheimer’s Disease International. Years of testing, trials It has now been over a decade since a new drug for alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer’s was made available. There is currently no treatment that has been proven to slow the impact of the disease, which causes a gradual decline in memory and thinking skills and eventually leaves sufferers unable to care for themselves. “We really don’t know the causal pathway that causes the loss of connection in the brain that results in the loss of cognitive abilities [in Alzheimer’s patients],” said Breitner. “Despite 25 years of trying to figure out what is going on and what is the appropriate target for treatment, we still don’t know.” There have been many successful studies that have “cured” or reduced memory loss in transgenic lab animals such as rats, which have been bred with human genes as a model for Alzheimer’s. But this success has so far never been replicated in humans.

Pharma Merck halts late-stage Alzheimer’s trial due to lack of efficacy By Juliet Preston Post a comment / Feb 14, 2017 at 7:41 PM Shares7 Failure continues to haunt the Alzheimer’s field. The latest blow came late on Tuesday at the hands of Merck, with news that its Phase 2/3 trial of verubecestat had been stopped due to a lack of efficacy. The Data Monitoring Committee for its EPOCH study in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease concluded that there was “virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect.” Merck shares fell 1.5 percent as after-hours trading began. According to ClinicalTrials.gov the EPOCH study was slated to run from Nov. 2012 to July 2019. The silver lining is that the drug’s safety profile remains sound, justifying the continuation of Merck’s other late-stage trial of verubecestat in patients with a subtype of Alzheimer’s known as prodromal AD. The question of efficacy is far more deeply-rooted. Verubecestat targets BACE1, an enzyme associated with the production of amyloid beta. Many in the scientific community believe amyloid plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. By Inhibiting BACE1, verubecestat should theoretically have reduced the formation of amyloid plaques in patients’ brains and slowed symptom progression. This clearly hasn’t eventuated, said Andrew Budson, an Alzheimer’s clinician, professor of neurology at Boston University and author of an upcoming book about the disease. In an email, Budson said many different approaches are needed to increase the odds of success. BACE inhibitors stop the formation of beta amyloid. If the drug worked as was intended and yet did not stop disease progression, it might suggest that treatment needs to be initiated prior to the mild-to-moderate stage. Although I remain hopeful that anti-amyloid pharmacological approaches to treating Alzheimer’s disease will be beneficial, I cannot deny the fact that each negative trial result reduces my hope that the next one will be successful. This negative result for an amyloid-based approach also makes the current efforts to find additional symptomatic therapies and those that can reduce downstream neurodegeneration more important. Today’s results will likely reverberate throughout the field, negatively impacting companies invested in the amyloid hypothesis. It follows other high-profile failures, such as Eli Lilly’s solanezumab. In December, solanezumab flopped in its second major Phase 3 trial. The drug attempted to bind beta-amyloid in the bloodstream to prevent it from accumulating in the brain. Lilly has also invested in BACE inhibitors, signing a partnership with AstraZeneca in 2014 and proceeding into a pivotal Phase 2/3 trial. Data from that study is expected in May 2019. Biogen and Eisai are also pursuing an oral BACE inhibitor, E2609. In 2016, the companies moved the drug into a Phase 3 trial using the highest of three doses evaluated in the Phase 2 study. Once again, no major safety issues have arisen. But the pressure is on to prove efficacy.

The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said on Monday it was “pausing” the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after US lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price. Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization said that during high-level discussions with Trump advisers, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency’s approval of new medicines. That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who said that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. “People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive,” said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. “We have the sense that the balance is pretty right… you have to have a well-characterised risk/benefit profile.” That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market — estimates run as high as $2.6 billion — would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. “It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation… to make sure the private sector can be more competitive,” said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO’s regulatory committee. “But payers are looking for evidence of value.” He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. “Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach,” said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc, which is developing drugs for rare diseases. Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. “It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed,” said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won’t happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available. To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation “will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition,” Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call. After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to “streamline” the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA. The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or licence early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed. “The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago… it has become incredibly expensive,” said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners. He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Insurers sense opportunity in unwanted pension plans Higher energy prices boost US producer inflation in January → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent HM and Rouhani discuss bilateral relations Another historic day for Oman-Iran relations Greetings to His Majesty conveyed Banking ties discussed with Iran Read More ...

Credit: Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 3.0) Advertisement | Report Ad By Reuters Staff (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Tuesday it will halt a late-stage trial of an Alzheimer's drug after it was determined that it had no chance of working, marking the latest in a long line of crushing disappointments in efforts to find an effective treatment for the disease. The company was testing its drug, verubecestat, in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. But an independent data monitoring committee determined that there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect" and recommended the trial be stopped for futility. The news sent Merck shares down nearly 2 percent in after hours trading. Verubecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer's drugs called BACE1 inhibitors that target an enzyme involved in the formation of the toxic amyloid protein that turns into plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Several companies are pinning hopes on Alzheimer's treatments using the BASE inhibitor mechanism, including Eli Lilly and Co, Biogen and Novartis in collaboration with Amgen Inc. Lilly previously endured multiple failures with its solanezumab, which also targets beta amyloid, but in a different way. In the most recent setback, Lilly said that drug failed to slow declines in mental capacity of patients with even mild symptoms. Researchers are increasingly focusing on attacking the disease earlier as it appears likely that once symptoms have taken hold current approaches fail to work. Merck said another study of its drug in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease would continue with results expected by February 2019. Patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living. Blinded clinical trials use independent monitors to watch for any unexpected safety problems that may crop up. They can also recommend stopping a study early if it becomes clear that a drug is going to fail or if the data looks so compelling that it believes the treatment should be offered to those getting a placebo or other standard treatments.

(NYSE: MRK) added its verubecestat to the list of inefficacious treatments. The series of failed tests have inspired questions about the amyloid hypothesis on which recent treatments rest. The hypothesis entertains the idea that clearing beta amyloid buildups in the brain could cure Alzheimer's. “It is too early to speculate on what the EPOCH trial results mean for the validity of the amyloid hypothesis,” said Pamela Eisele, a spokesperson for Merck. Related Link: Taking A Clinical Road Less Traveled: Neurotrope Hopes To Succeed In Alzheimer's Where Competitors Fail The company noted in its press release it will continue studying verubecestat in patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease — a condition known as APECS. “It is hoped that by evaluating verubecestat in people at the earlier prodromal stage, who have lower levels of damage to the brain, we will be better able to slow disease progression,” Eisele said. “This trial is fully enrolled and the results are expected to be available in February 2019.” Merck's stock closed Wednesday at $65.16.

The company is stopping the Phase 2/3 study following the recommendation of the external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC). In a recent safety analysis, the eDMC assessed the benefit/risk of the EPOCH study, also known as protocol 017, for Alzheimer’s and determined that there was “virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect.” The committee further noted that safety signals observed in the study “are not sufficient to warrant stopping study 017,” and recommended that protocol 019, also known as APECS, which is evaluating verubecestat in people with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease, continue unchanged. The results from protocol 019 are expected in February 2019. Results from EPOCH will be analyzed and presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. The efficacy and safety of verubecestat was being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials: Protocol 017, or EPOCH, in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s, and Protocol 019, or APECS, in prodromal Alzheimer’s. There is a slight difference in each. Patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s exhibit detectable and worsening impairment of cognitive and functional abilities. Patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living. Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, commented: Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most pressing and daunting medical issues of our time, with inherent, substantial challenges to developing an effective disease-modifying therapy for people with mild-to-moderate disease. Studies such as EPOCH are critical, and we are indebted to the patients in this study and their caregivers. While we are disappointed that a benefit was not observed in this study, our work continues with APECS, which is studying verubecestat in people with less advanced disease. Shares of Merck were trading down 0.5% at $65.30 on Wednesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $68.55 and a 52-week trading range of $49.63 to $65.87.

Meanwhile, treatments for mental illnesses have seen few advances despite increased understanding of the diseases. Stat: The Next Big Alzheimer's Trial Came Up A Dud Merck pulled the plug on a closely watched trial in Alzheimer’s disease after finding out its in-development drug had no effect on patients with mild forms of the disorder. The drug, verubecestat, showed “virtually no chance” of meeting its goal in a 2,200-patient study, Merck said. The trial was meant to read out later this year, but Merck, on the advice of its independent data monitors, pulled the plug early. (Garde, 2/14) Stat: Scouring The Brain For Clues To New Treatments For Mental Illness While demand for mental health drugs has surged, big pharmaceutical companies have largely backed away from investing in the field; the number of psychopharmacological drug research programs has shrunk 70 percent in the last decade, according to NeuroPerspective...To advance the field, researchers say they need to find biomarkers — tangible biological clues that can help diagnose mental illness, just the way high blood glucose levels can signal diabetes. The hope is that those biomarkers could help pinpoint what’s gone wrong in the circuitry of a particular patient’s brain and offer clues for drug development — and, perhaps one day, even precision psychiatric therapies.

Revenue also beat forecasts, and the company announced a 7 percent dividend hike, as well. PepsiCo gave a full-year outlook that fell slightly below Street forecasts, with CEO Indra Nooyi saying the company expects global economic challenges this year. Anthem — Anthem filed suit against Cigna, seeking a temporary restraining order against Cigna's move to end their $48 billion deal. Cigna had sued Anthem late yesterday, saying regulatory hurdles mean that Anthem's planned purchase of Cigna cannot possibly be completed, and seeking a multibillion-dollar reverse breakup fee. Hilton Worldwide — The hotel operator beat estimates by 5 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 70 cents per share. Revenue also beat forecasts. Hilton was helped by increased bookings at higher prices. Amazon, Alphabet — The Wall Street Journal reports that the companies have separate plans to use their Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers as home telephones, although implementation of those features does face some hurdles such as telecom regulations. Integra LifeSciences — The medical technology company announced an offer to buy Johnson & Johnson's Codman Neurosurgery unit for $1.045 billion in cash. Kraft Heinz, ConAgra Brands — The two were rated "buy" in new coverage at Deutsche Bank and called "top picks" by the firm. Deutsche Bank said it was recommending names that have a higher probability of value creation in the current environment. Merck — The drugmaker halted a late-stage trial of an experimental Alzheimer's treatment. Merck determined that the treatment was ineffective. Apple — Berkshire Hathaway nearly quadrupled its stake in Apple by buying 42 million more shares and benefiting from the rise to an all-time high yesterday. Berkshire also added to its stakes in airline companies American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines, United Continental, and Southwest, and took a new stake in Monsanto, all according to its latest quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Express Scripts — Express Scripts beat estimates by a penny a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.88 per share. The pharmacy benefit manager's revenue came in below Street forecasts and it also gave a lower-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. AIG — AIG took a $5.6 billion charge against earnings to boost reserves for claims, dragging the insurance company's quarterly loss well below estimates at $2.72 per share. However, AIG also announced a $3.5 billion stock buyback program, following strong results in areas such as consumer insurance. Fossil — Fossil earned $1.03 per share for the fourth quarter, 15 cents a share shy of estimates. The watch maker's revenue also missed forecasts. Fossil also gave worse-than-expected guidance for the current quarter, with ongoing impact from currency fluctuations, as well as a decline in overall sales of traditional watches. Humana — Humana announced a $1.5 billion stock buyback and raised its quarterly dividend to 40 cents per share from the prior 29 cents a share. The news follows the end of its deal to merge with Aetna, which was announced on Tuesday morning. Procter & Gamble — Activist investor Trian Fund Management has taken a stake in P&G now worth $3.5 billion, according to Trian's quarterly SEC filing. The consumer products giant represents Trian's largest-ever holding, as measured by dollar value. Fortress Investment Group — The asset manager will be bought by Japan's Softbank for $3.3 billion, or $8.08 per share, compared to a closing price of $6.21 on Tuesday.

Apollo Global Management — The private-equity firm hired investment banks to explore either a sale or initial public offering of the Chuck E. Cheese restaurant chain, according to Reuters. CSX — The railroad operator is asking shareholders to vote on compensation benefits for prospective CEO Hunter Harrison, and on demands by activist investor Paul Hilal that his fund, Mantle Ridge, be reimbursed for "exceptionally unusual" compensation benefits for Harrison. The vote has not yet been scheduled, but was called for after talks between CSX and Hilal fell apart.

The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said Monday it was "pausing" the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after U.S. lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price. Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization told Reuters that during high-level discussions with Trump advisors, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency's approval of new medicines. That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. "People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive," said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. "We have the sense that the balance is pretty right ... you have to have a well-characterized risk/benefit profile." That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market - estimates run as high as $2.6 billion - would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. "It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation ... to make sure the private sector can be more competitive," said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO's regulatory committee. "But payers are looking for evidence of value." He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. "Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach," said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc., which is developing drugs for rare diseases. Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. "It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed," said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won't happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available. To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation "will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition," Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call. After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to "streamline" the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA. The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or license early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed. "The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago ... it has become incredibly expensive," said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners. He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised. "We want to make healthcare itself more efficient," he said. "Let the marketplace decide how valuable a drug is." The fate of deregulating the FDA will be driven by its next commissioner. President Trump said last month he has a "fantastic person" lined up for the role. Candidates, according to sources close to the administration, include former FDA staffer Scott Gottlieb, and Jim O'Neill, a colleague of Trump supporter Peter Thiel who has advocated for allowing some medicines to reach the market once they are shown to be safe, even if there is scant evidence that they work. A recent survey of drug company executives conducted by Mizuho Securities found that 72 percent said Gottlieb should be Trump's pick to head the FDA. "There is no groundswell of movement for change," said attorney Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandler's FDA regulatory practice. "The industry likes certainty."

Diaz-Shephard     Implanon Migration Leads to Unwanted Pregnancy, Surgery The Implanon (etonogestrel implant) birth control, is a small, thin implantable plastic rod that slowly releases etonogestrel. The device is meant to last three years and received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance one decade ago. Implanon birth control may last longer than three years; however, the three-year time frame is what is recommended to remove the nearly-spent Implanon for replacement, or to switch to an alternative birth control device. Twelve years prior, a research paper described the difficulty in extracting the six capsules that made up the prior Norplant implantable birth control system. The Implanon implantable birth control followed the Norplant. In the 23 years, concern has risen over similar implantable devices and the challenges in removing the device and device migration. Implanon birth control is one of the more recent devices approved for long-term, low maintenance birth control by implanting the device subcutaneously (under the skin) in the upper arm. The device is meant to distribute protection from unwanted pregnancy without the user having to remember to take a daily pill or change a birth control patch or other birth control device. The product liability attorneys at Parker Waichman are actively reviewing potential lawsuits regarding medical devices including the Implanon birth control device. Implanon Lawsuits and Research Meanwhile, plaintiffs have alleged, in Implanon birth control personal injury lawsuits, experiencing difficulty locating and extracting the used device at the end of its life cycle. In some cases, the Implanon device migrated away from the original insertion site during the three-to-four years that the device was in place. There are also documented cases in which the Implanon device was located far from the initial insertion point; for instance, in a blood vessel of the lung or where the device could not be located, according to Merck & Company, the maker of the device. One plaintiff alleged wrongful birth, after becoming pregnant. Merck & Co. through its subsidiary Organon, has released Implanon NXT and Nexplanon, updates to the Implanon device that includes barium sulfate added to the core of the device. Barium sulfate may be seen on X-rays, which helps clinicians locate a difficult-to-locate device. Problems associated with Implanon have not been sufficient to convince the FDA to mandate a removal of the Implanon implantable device from the market. This, despite a federal regulator mandated warning label update in March 2016 concerning the rare potential for device migration. The FDA indicates that it deems the implantable devices as safe and effective. Meanwhile, an Implanon birth control consumer fraud lawsuit was brought by a woman from Maine who was implanted with the Implanon birth control device early in 2012 following a recommendation she received from a community health clinic. Approximately 18 months later, when the birth control had only been through less than half of its life cycle, the woman tested positive for pregnancy, gave birth to a child, and became a single mother. Despite repeated attempts, clinicians were unable to locate the device. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court, District of Maine over allegations of wrongful birth. Lawsuits alleging Implanon birth control consumer fraud include that patients were not fully aware of the potential for device migration, or the difficulty often faced when attempting to remove the device. Meanwhile, 20 years prior, a paper was published describing the difficulty in locating and removing the six capsules that were part of the Norplant device, which is no longer in use. “A case study was presented of one woman who asked for removal of the six small Norplant capsules (2.4 mm x 34 mm) that were inserted sub dermally, radially in the medial portion of the upper arm, per standard protocol,” the paper indicated. “The obstetrician made a surgical incision and removed easily five of the capsules, but could not locate the last one by digital probing. The patient was then referred to a hospital radiology department. The first action taken was a radiograph, which revealed a faint visualization. The second picture was taken with real time sonography, but the capsule could not be visualized. A third action was a computed tomography of multiple thin (3 mm) slices, but again there was no success in locating the missing capsule. The final attempt was to use intermittent fluoroscopy and persistent probing, which revealed the locale and led to successful removal of the last capsule.” In all, it took four attempts to locate and remove the sixth Norplant capsule. Wyeth, the maker of Norplant, withdrew the device from the market six years later, in 2000, and was facing a number of lawsuits over the product. Six years after that, the FDA cleared Implanon, without mentioning the potential for device migration until ten years later in 2016. Norplant was implanted in a similar way to the single-application Implanon, which has one rod or capsule. Now indicated in the listing of Implanon birth control side effects is that “Implants have been reported to be found in a blood vessel including a blood vessel in the lung.” Although the statement does not specifically reference device migration, it is inferred given the distance between the inner upper arm and the lung. Device migration is later addressed in the second paragraph on page eight under a sub-head “Problems with Insertion and Removal” that states, “Location and removal of the implant may be difficult or impossible because the implant is not where it should be. Special procedures, including surgery in the hospital, may be needed to remove the implant. If the implant is not removed, then the effects of IMPLANON (sic) will continue for a longer period of time. Implants have been found in the pulmonary artery (a blood vessel in the lung). If the implant cannot be found in the arm, your healthcare professional may use imaging methods on the chest. If the implant is located in the chest, surgery may be needed.” Legal Advice and Information Regarding Implanon If you or someone you know suffered injuries associated with the Implanon birth control device, you may have valuable legal rights.

The company was testing its drug, verubecestat, in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. But an independent data monitoring committee determined that there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect" and recommended the trial be stopped for futility. The news sent Merck shares down nearly 2 percent in after hours trading. Verubecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer's drugs called BACE1 inhibitors that target an enzyme involved in the formation of the toxic amyloid protein that turns into plaques in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Several companies are pinning hopes on Alzheimer's treatments using the BASE inhibitor mechanism, including Eli Lilly and Co, Biogen and Novartis in collaboration with Amgen Inc. Lilly previously endured multiple failures with its solanezumab, which also targets beta amyloid, but in a different way. In the most recent setback, Lilly said that drug failed to slow declines in mental capacity of patients with even mild symptoms. Researchers are increasingly focusing on attacking the disease earlier as it appears likely that once symptoms have taken hold current approaches fail to work. Merck said another study of its drug in patients with prodromal, or very early, Alzheimer's disease would continue with results expected by February 2019. Patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living. Blinded clinical trials use independent monitors to watch for any unexpected safety problems that may crop up. They can also recommend stopping a study early if it becomes clear that a drug is going to fail or if the data looks so compelling that it believes the treatment should be offered to those getting a placebo or other standard treatments. Merck shares fell to $64.48 in extended trading from a close at $65.66.

Henriques-Parker posted on Facebook, asking friends and family to send a Christmas card to her grandfather Jim Gaboardi, who suffers from dementia and worked for decades as a mailman in Danbury. Henriques-Parker says Gaboardi has been "inspired" from the cards he has received. By Naomi Kresge / Bloomberg News Dementia has unseated AIDS as one of the world’s top killers, new figures from the World Health Organization show, as drugmakers struggle to either curb or cure it. Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia killed 1.54 million people in 2015, more than twice the number of deaths from the disease in 2000, according to documents posted on the WHO website last month. It replaced HIV/​AIDS as No. 7 on the global health watchdog’s list of the 10 biggest causes of death worldwide. New therapies helped push fatalities from HIV/​AIDS from 1.5 million down to 1.1 million over the same 15-year period. Drugmakers have struggled to understand Alzheimer’s, with Merck & Co. abandoning a high-profile study this week, less than three months after a similar defeat for Eli Lilly & Co. More than 100 experimental treatments have failed to slow the condition, which dismantles memories and leaves patients unable to take care of themselves. Dementia afflicts some 47 million people around the world and the number of cases will probably rise to 75 million by 2030, said Shekhar Saxena, director of the WHO’s department of mental health and substance abuse. “We are making slow progress,” Dr. Saxena said, calling for more public money to be directed toward developing treatments. “I am less optimistic than I would like to be.” Dementia’s climb up the WHO ranking is partly due to the aging of society, and partly to doctors diagnosing it more frequently because they are more familiar with the disease, he said. In high-income economies, Alzheimer’s and other dementia rank as the No. 3 cause of death, trailing only heart disease and stroke. By contrast, HIV/​AIDS remains on the top 10 list in the poorest countries, alongside problems such as malaria and diarrhea. The most recent drug to help treat symptoms of Alzheimer’s is more than a decade old, and with no cure.

23.9% - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets Feb 15, 2017, 13:10 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Feb. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Cancer Immunotherapies Market to 2022 - Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines to Characterize Increasingly Competitive Market" report to their offering. The market size for cancer immunotherapies is expected to grow more than fourfold from $16.9 billion in 2015 to $75.8 billion by 2022, representing a rapid compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.9%. The imbalance between early-stage and late-stage product development is more pronounced than typically seen in the industry, and may suggest greater difficulty than normal in developing cancer immunotherapies. However, these findings may also indicate a substantial drive to invest in early-stage cancer immunotherapy development, which could eventually filter through to late-stage product development. According to the research, several late-stage pipeline drugs, as well as some already marketed drugs, are expected to achieve blockbuster status by the end of the forecast period, while a number of existing blockbuster therapies are forecast to experience strong revenue growth. Established immunotherapies, particularly Revlimid, Opdivo, Keytruda and Gazyva, are set to witness rapid sales growth throughout the forecast period, with Keytruda and Opdivo rising by $7 billion and $9 billion, respectively. Revlimid will experience similar levels of growth, driven by label expansions covering oncology indications, including multiple forms of leukemia and lymphoma. The cancer immunotherapies market already consists of some commercially successful products. - Which classes of drug dominate the market? - What additional benefits have newly approved therapies brought to the market? The cancer immunotherapies pipeline is vast, with a significant degree of diversity in terms of molecule types and targets. - Which molecular targets appear most frequently in the pipeline? - What are the commercial prospects for the most promising late-stage pipeline products? The cancer immunotherapies market is forecast to rise from a value of $16.9 billion in 2015 to $75.8 billion in 2022, at a compound annual growth rate of 23.9%. - Which products are forecast to drive this substantial degree of growth? - Will generic competition have a significant impact on the market over the forecast period? The company landscape is growing increasingly competitive. - What are the leading companies in terms of market share? - Which companies are forecast to experience the greatest growth in market share? - What are the drivers of growth for key companies in the market? - How dependent are the key companies on this disease cluster for revenue? - Which companies rely heavily on this disease cluster for revenue?

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to roll back government regulations at least 75 percent is causing anxiety for some pharmaceutical executives that a less robust Food and Drug Administration would make it harder to secure insurance coverage for pricey new medicines. The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said Monday it was "pausing" the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after U.S. lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price. Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization told Reuters that during high-level discussions with Trump advisors, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency's approval of new medicines. That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. "People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive," said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. "We have the sense that the balance is pretty right ... you have to have a well-characterized risk/benefit profile." That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market - estimates run as high as $2.6 billion - would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. "It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation ... to make sure the private sector can be more competitive," said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO's regulatory committee. "But payers are looking for evidence of value." He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. "Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach," said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc., which is developing drugs for rare diseases. Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. "It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed," said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won't happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available. To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation "will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition," Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call. After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to "streamline" the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA. The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or license early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed. "The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago ... it has become incredibly expensive," said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners. He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised. "We want to make healthcare itself more efficient," he said. "Let the marketplace decide how valuable a drug is." The fate of deregulating the FDA will be driven by its next commissioner. President Trump said last month he has a "fantastic person" lined up for the role. Candidates, according to sources close to the administration, include former FDA staffer Scott Gottlieb, and Jim O'Neill, a colleague of Trump supporter Peter Thiel who has advocated for allowing some medicines to reach the market once they are shown to be safe, even if there is scant evidence that they work. A recent survey of drug company executives conducted by Mizuho Securities found that 72 percent said Gottlieb should be Trump's pick to head the FDA. "There is no groundswell of movement for change," said attorney Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandler's FDA regulatory practice. "The industry likes certainty."  © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to “streamline” the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA. The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or license early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed. "The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago ... it has become incredibly expensive," said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners. He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised. "We want to make healthcare itself more efficient," he said. "Let the marketplace decide how valuable a drug is." The fate of deregulating the FDA will be driven by its next commissioner. President Trump said last month he has a "fantastic person" lined up for the role. Candidates, according to sources close to the administration, include former FDA staffer Scott Gottlieb, and Jim O'Neill, a colleague of Trump supporter Peter Thiel who has advocated for allowing some medicines to reach the market once they are shown to be safe, even if there is scant evidence that they work. A recent survey of drug company executives conducted by Mizuho Securities found that 72 percent said Gottlieb should be Trump's pick to head the FDA. "There is no groundswell of movement for change," said attorney Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandler's FDA regulatory practice. "The industry likes certainty."

The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said Monday it was "pausing" the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after U.S. lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price. Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization told Reuters that during high-level discussions with Trump advisors, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency's approval of new medicines. That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. "People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive," said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck &amp; Co Inc. "We have the sense that the balance is pretty right ... you have to have a well-characterized risk/benefit profile." That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market - estimates run as high as $2.6 billion - would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. "It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation ... to make sure the private sector can be more competitive," said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO's regulatory committee. "But payers are looking for evidence of value." He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. "Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach," said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc., which is developing drugs for rare diseases. Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. "It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed," said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won't happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available. To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation "will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition," Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call. After top executives at Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to "streamline" the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations.

That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. "People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive," said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. "We have the sense that the balance is pretty right ... you have to have a well-characterized risk/benefit profile." That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market - estimates run as high as $2.6 billion - would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. "It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation ... to make sure the private sector can be more competitive," said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO's regulatory committee. "But payers are looking for evidence of value." He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. "Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach," said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc., which is developing drugs for rare diseases. Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. "It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed," said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won't happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available. To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation "will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition," Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call. After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to “streamline” the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA. The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or license early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed. "The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago ... it has become incredibly expensive," said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners. He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised. "We want to make healthcare itself more efficient," he said. "Let the marketplace decide how valuable a drug is." The fate of deregulating the FDA will be driven by its next commissioner. President Trump said last month he has a "fantastic person" lined up for the role. Candidates, according to sources close to the administration, include former FDA staffer Scott Gottlieb, and Jim O'Neill, a colleague of Trump supporter Peter Thiel who has advocated for allowing some medicines to reach the market once they are shown to be safe, even if there is scant evidence that they work. A recent survey of drug company executives conducted by Mizuho Securities found that 72 percent said Gottlieb should be Trump's pick to head the FDA. "There is no groundswell of movement for change," said attorney Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandler's FDA regulatory practice. "The industry likes certainty."

Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here US President Donald Trump's vow to roll back government regulations at least 75 percent is causing anxiety for some pharmaceutical executives that a less robust Food and Drug Administration would make it harder to secure insurance coverage for pricey new medicines. The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said Monday it was "pausing" the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after US lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price. Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization told Reuters that during high-level discussions with Trump advisors, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency's approval of new medicines. That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. "People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive," said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. "We have the sense that the balance is pretty right ... you have to have a well-characterized risk/benefit profile." That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market - estimates run as high as $2.6 billion - would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. "It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation ... to make sure the private sector can be more competitive," said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO's regulatory committee. "But payers are looking for evidence of value." He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. "Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach," said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc., which is developing drugs for rare diseases.

REUTERS/Jason Reed/File PhotoMore By Deena Beasley (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to roll back government regulations at least 75 percent is causing anxiety for some pharmaceutical executives that a less robust Food and Drug Administration would make it harder to secure insurance coverage for pricey new medicines. The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said Monday it was "pausing" the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after U.S. lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price. Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization told Reuters that during high-level discussions with Trump advisors, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency’s approval of new medicines. That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. "People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive," said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. "We have the sense that the balance is pretty right ... you have to have a well-characterized risk/benefit profile." That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market - estimates run as high as $2.6 billion - would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. "It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation ... to make sure the private sector can be more competitive," said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO's regulatory committee. "But payers are looking for evidence of value." He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. "Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach," said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc., which is developing drugs for rare diseases. Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. "It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed," said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won't happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available. To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation "will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition," Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call. After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to “streamline” the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA. The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or license early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed. "The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago ... it has become incredibly expensive," said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners. He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised. "We want to make healthcare itself more efficient," he said. "Let the marketplace decide how valuable a drug is." The fate of deregulating the FDA will be driven by its next commissioner. President Trump said last month he has a "fantastic person" lined up for the role. Candidates, according to sources close to the administration, include former FDA staffer Scott Gottlieb, and Jim O'Neill, a colleague of Trump supporter Peter Thiel who has advocated for allowing some medicines to reach the market once they are shown to be safe, even if there is scant evidence that they work. A recent survey of drug company executives conducted by Mizuho Securities found that 72 percent said Gottlieb should be Trump's pick to head the FDA. "There is no groundswell of movement for change," said attorney Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandler's FDA regulatory practice. "The industry likes certainty."

The group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, is reviewing its membership criteria after Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, a member of the organization, said it would introduce a drug for a rare, deadly muscle disease at the cost of $89,000 a year. A version of the drug had been available for about $1,000 a year overseas and many U.S. patients were allowed to import it. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Marathon’s “recent actions are not consistent with the mission of our organization,” Steve Ubl, chief executive officer of PhRMA, said in an e-mailed statement. “The leadership of the PhRMA board of directors has begun a comprehensive review of our membership criteria to ensure we are focused on representing research-based biopharmaceutical companies that take significant risks to bring new treatments and cures to patients.” PhRMA includes many of the world’s biggest drugmakers, including Pfizer Inc. and Merck & Co. Its members have faced repeated criticism over the price of medicine in the U.S., after a handful of companies -- some members of the group, some not -- significantly raised the price of older, sometimes off-patent treatments. A spokesman for Marathon didn’t immediately respond to a call seeking comment. The company said it was delaying its introduction of the drug, which is used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, after facing criticism of the price, including an inquiry from two members of Congress.

Regulatory approval of crenezumab, gantenerumab, and notably ocrevus (ocrelizumab) could give the drug-maker approximately 15 percent of the market share within this forecast period. The author of the report, GBI analyst Qaisrah Khalid, wrote Ocrevus is expected to become a blockbuster drug within three years of its launch potentially generating $3.2 billion in sales becoming the primary force responsible for Roche’s growth.   Ocrevus is an investigational monoclonal antibody being tested as a treatment for relapse remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). The drug works by targeting CD20-positive B cells that are immune cells which are believed to play a key contributing role in nerve cell damage. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Ocrevus a priority review in June 2016 after clinical trial results indicated the six month intravenous injection was able to lower the risk of disability progression by 24 percent in PPMS patients.  Another study revealed Ocrevus provided better disease control for RRMS patients compared to Merck’s Rebif. A mix of clinical and MRI outcomes were used to test the efficacy of these drugs, but the trial achieved its endpoint when these RRMS patients exhibited no evidence of disease activity over the course of two years.    RRMS is the most common form of the disease characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms followed by periods of partial or complete recovery. Approved treatments for this variation of the disorder include Copaxone, Tecfidera, and Lemtrada. Ocrevus could fill an important need for patients suffering from PPMS because the rarer but more debilitating form of this condition marked by steadily worsening symptoms has no approved therapy. However, Khalid’s analysis concludes noting Biogen will maintain its lead over this treatment space throughout the forecast period largely due to Tecfidera sales, which is not set for patent expiry until 2028 while another therapy Plegridy is predicted to reach blockbuster status sometime in the next five years. The FDA is scheduled to make a decision on Ocrevus in March 2017. The European Medicines Agency will conduct its review of the drug in the third quarter of this year too.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 February 2017 by Military News Competitive Landscape for Worldwide Bone Marrow Transplant Market by Segments – 2024 Albany, NY — — 02/15/2017 — Global Bone Marrow Transplant Market Bone marrow is a type of human tissue found within bones. It constitutes less than 5% of the human body by mass. However, it is a crucial part of the human circulatory and immune systems, as it produces red blood cells and lymphocytes. Hence, diseases of the bone marrow or affecting the bone marrow can be fatal. Bone marrow transplant is a procedure utilized in extreme cases of bone marrow diseases and skin and bone cancer. A transplant is the last resort in such cases, as bone marrow is required for proper functioning of the body. However, the increasing prevalence of conditions that require a complete bone marrow transplant has driven the global market for the same in the last few years. The most common diseases that require bone marrow transplant include leukemia, thalassemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and anemia. Download Complete Healthcare Analytical Brochure: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=11237 Global Bone Marrow Transplant Market: Drivers Increasing incidence of blood cancer is a primary driver of the global bone marrow transplant market. Aided by lifestyle factors such as the rising prevalence of smoking of alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy diets, the prevalence of cancers, particularly blood cancers, has increased in the last few decades. This has driven the bone marrow transplant market, as malfunctioning bone marrow can be extremely harmful to the body. By disease type, leukemia is the major contributor to the global bone marrow transplant market. The infrastructure required to carry out bone marrow transplant procedures has also expanded in the last few decades. Increasing research into the biological and logistical factors of storing and using donated bone marrow has made the process smoother and easier. This has led to higher patient confidence and, consequently, improved market performance. Intensive research in bone marrow transplant has made the process more reliable, thereby increasing the prognosis of the patient significantly. This has also driven patient confidence in the procedure, which in turn is driving the global market. Global Bone Marrow Transplant Market: Restraints High cost of bone marrow transplant is a major restraint of the global bone marrow transplant market. The process is highly sophisticated and requires constant monitoring and post-operative care. Hence, it costs more than what the average consumer, even in developed countries, can pay. Increasing demand is likely to help the bone marrow transplant market overcome this restraint. The adverse impact of this factor on the bone marrow transplant market is exacerbated by the lack of reimbursement options for the treatment. Lack of bone marrow donors is another major factor restraining the global bone marrow transplant market. Less awareness about the procedure in the developing countries has resulted in shortage of bone marrow donors. Global Bone Marrow Transplant Market: Geographical Overview Europe dominated the global bone marrow transplant market. The region is home to some of the world’s most extensively distributed and advanced health care systems, with several countries offering excellent public facilities. This has allowed the region’s health care players to add bone marrow transplant to their portfolios. Europe is expected to continue to dominate the global bone marrow transplant market in the next few years. However, the bone marrow transplant market in North America is showing promising signs of growth. Major companies providing bone marrow transplant equipment are Lonza Group Ltd., Sanofi-Aventis LLC, STEMCELL Technologies, Merck Millipore Corp., and AllCells LLC.

Who We Are Healthcare Article Comments Your Email Recipient's Email Message (Optional) Send Cancel State Funding Gives Sharp Boost to NJ’s Biotech, Life Sciences Industry Lilo H. Stainton | February 15, 2017 Tax credits for 'angel investors' are key to encouraging private investment in new and growing companies A record number of biotechnology, life sciences and other tech-related companies with a presence in New Jersey stand to benefit from private investments spurred in part by tax credits approved by state officials last year — a sign the Garden State continues to serve as the nation’s medicine chest. The New Jersey Economic Development Authority announced Tuesday it has approved 251 applications from “angel investors” who are eligible for state income-tax credits to help offset the more than $96 million in private funding they funneled to Garden State tech firms during 2016 — the highest annual total since the program launched three years ago. Nearly four-fifths of these applications were OK’d in the last quarter alone, according to the EDA, which uses tax credits, loans, bond sales, and other public financing mechanisms to help businesses and nonprofits grow in New Jersey. The Angel Investor Tax Credit Program, which also requires sign-off from the state Division of Taxation, is designed to encourage private investment in new and growing tech companies of all kinds. Approved applicants can receive credits equal to as much as 10 percent of their investment in firms that conduct research, manufacture products, or work to commercialize new technology in New Jersey. (The companies can be based elsewhere, as long as they have a real footprint here.) Garden State an ideal location for biotech Biotech leaders said the Garden State is an ideal location for their growth, given the experienced and well educated pool of employees, the location and easy access to New York and Philadelphia, and funding opportunities — both public and private. One example is Taxis Pharmaceuticals, a Monmouth Junction-based company now working on an antibiotic designed to treat MRSA, a highly resistant bacterial infection, based on technology developed at Rutgers University. Taxis benefitted from a number of private investments in 2015 and another in 2016 that involved the EDA’s tax credit program. Gregory Mario, president and CEO, Taxis Pharmaceuticals, Monmouth Junction Taxis president and CEO Gregory Mario said at a conference in September hosted by BioNJ, an industry advocacy group, that New Jersey’s advantages included a strong labor pool, “some of the greatest scientists in the world,” and other top-tier pharmaceutical companies ripe for collaboration. He also praised “the very healthy relationship between public and private entities,” including academic institutions like Rutgers and state agencies like the EDA, “which has been instrumental in our ability to incubate our young technology.” While New Jersey has long been home to pharmaceutical giants like Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson, the larger biotech sector — which explores how living organisms can benefit medicine, agriculture, industry, and other technologies — has grown from 50 to nearly 400 companies statewide, according to a study by BioNJ. The industry directly employs more than 212,000 people in the state, and also supports thousands of service companies based here. “The expertise you need to develop a drug is in New Jersey,” Pamela Demain, a former Merck executive, said at the BioNJ conference. Some lawmakers say state should do more to help the industry Despite this reputation, some lawmakers insist the state should do more to build biotech-related business. A task force to promote the industry was formed in the 1990s but the former Commission on Science and Technology, which provided grants to start-up firms, has not been funded since then Gov. Jon S. Corzine eliminated its budget in 2010. Gov. Chris Christie signed a bill to create a nine-member New Jersey Biotechnology Task Force in August, but it is not clear if any members have yet been appointed to fill these posts. Al Altomari, president and CEO of Agile Therapeutics, Princeton In the meantime, interest in the EDA program appears to have skyrocketed. Since 2013, the EDA has approved 673 applications that helped investors channel $220 million into 51 tech and life sciences companies. (Most companies benefit from multiple investments offset by these tax credits.) The credits available for investors range from just over $1,000 to $500,000; state officials were still calculating on Tuesday the total value redeemed. Investors can apply the credits to personal or business income tax payments; if they don’t live in the state, or don’t owe tax, they could be eligible for a refund. Another benefactor of the program, Agile Therapeutics of Princeton, focuses on female contraception. The company received two investments in 2014 that triggered tax credits, including one for $425,000 — one of the highest ever awarded by the EDA. “Our roots are in New Jersey,” said Agile president and CEO Al Altomari, explaining that their work grew out of research at Rutgers University. “New Jersey is a great place for us to recruit talent, to be close to investors, to be close to the thought leaders and have virtually everything we need for our organization,” he said.

The market size for cancer immunotherapies is expected to grow more than fourfold from $16.9 billion in 2015 to $75.8 billion by 2022, representing a rapid compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.9%. The imbalance between early-stage and late-stage product development is more pronounced than typically seen in the industry, and may suggest greater difficulty than normal in developing cancer immunotherapies. However, these findings may also indicate a substantial drive to invest in early-stage cancer immunotherapy development, which could eventually filter through to late-stage product development. According to the research, several late-stage pipeline drugs, as well as some already marketed drugs, are expected to achieve blockbuster status by the end of the forecast period, while a number of existing blockbuster therapies are forecast to experience strong revenue growth. Established immunotherapies, particularly Revlimid, Opdivo, Keytruda and Gazyva, are set to witness rapid sales growth throughout the forecast period, with Keytruda and Opdivo rising by $7 billion and $9 billion, respectively. Revlimid will experience similar levels of growth, driven by label expansions covering oncology indications, including multiple forms of leukemia and lymphoma. The cancer immunotherapies market already consists of some commercially successful products. - Which classes of drug dominate the market? - What additional benefits have newly approved therapies brought to the market? The cancer immunotherapies pipeline is vast, with a significant degree of diversity in terms of molecule types and targets. - Which molecular targets appear most frequently in the pipeline? - What are the commercial prospects for the most promising late-stage pipeline products?
