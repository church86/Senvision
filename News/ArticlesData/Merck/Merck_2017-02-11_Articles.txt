Roz Edward, Michigan Chronicle Managing Editor Leave a comment   Grady Health System is one of only six in the nation that will become part of the new Alliance to Advance Patient-Centered Cancer Care.  The Merck Foundation has committed $15 million in funding over five years across the program sites, with the goal of increasing timely access to patient-centered cancer care for vulnerable and underserved populations in the United States.   “We are honored with this vote of confidence in Grady and look forward to working with the Merck Foundation and the other members of the Alliance to identify and implement new ways to deliver high quality care for the hundreds of cancer patients who seek treatment at our hospital every year,” said Renay Blumenthal, president of the Grady Heath Foundation.   Alliance members were selected based on criteria including the technical merit of proposed programs, organizational capabilities and experience, relationships with community partners and ability to promote sustainable improvements.  The other institutions selected include The Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore), Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston), Northwestern University (Chicago), Ohio State University (Columbus) and The University of Arizona (Tucson).   The National Program Office for the Alliance will be housed at the University of Michigan School of Nursing (Ann Arbor).   “With 1.7 million Americans newly diagnosed with cancer each year, there is a great need to improve the quality and delivery of patient-centered care to help address the significant challenges of those facing this diagnosis.  These superb program sites and the National Program Office should accelerate identification and uptake of innovations that benefit patients, improve health communications and enhance the overall coordination of care,” said Julie L. Gerberding, chief patient officer, Merck, and chief executive officer, Merck Foundation, in the release announcing the new program.

By Chris Lange February 10, 2017 8:35 am EST Print Email Tweet Pharmaceutical companies usually are involved in a lengthy process in getting their drug candidates to market through clinical trials. There is a fair amount of risk involved, should a study come back negative or a candidate not be approved. Conversely, if a drug gains FDA approval or passes a clinical trial, there can be big upside. The Trump administration has promised reforms in the health care sector, such as changing the bidding process for drugs and shortening the FDA approval process. It has yet to be seen how much headway Trump can actually make with these reforms, but so far the reaction has been quite positive. Keep in mind that short sellers betting against big pharma are taking on an added risk. They have to pay out the ongoing high dividends on top of the cost of borrowing the shares. The January 31 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and short interest moves in these selected pharmaceutical stocks mostly increased. Short interest in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) decreased to 34.30 million shares from the previous 37.93 million. Its shares were last seen at $32.38, within a 52-week trading range of $28.74 to $37.39. The number of Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) shares short increased to 18.36 million from 15.95 million in the previous period. Its shares were trading at $64.39, in a 52-week range of $48.28 to $65.46. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s (NYSE: TEVA) short interest increased to 20.99 million shares, compared to the previous level of 19.98 million. Shares were trading at $32.25, in a 52-week range of $31.90 to $59.35. The short interest rise in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY) was to 13.45 million shares, compared to the previous reading of 12.18 million. Shares were trading at $51.51, within a 52-week range of $46.01 to $77.12. The number of shares short in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) decreased to 30.98 million, compared to the previous 33.44 million. The stock was trading at $60.84, in a 52-week range of $51.60 to $68.12. Eli Lilly and Co.’s (NYSE: LLY) short interest increased slightly to 10.82 million shares from the previous 10.72 million. The stock was trading at $77.70. The 52-week range is $64.18 to $83.79.
