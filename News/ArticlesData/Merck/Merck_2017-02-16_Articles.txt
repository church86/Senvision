The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said on Monday it was “pausing” the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after US lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price. Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization said that during high-level discussions with Trump advisers, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency’s approval of new medicines. That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who said that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. “People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive,” said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. “We have the sense that the balance is pretty right… you have to have a well-characterised risk/benefit profile.” That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market — estimates run as high as $2.6 billion — would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. “It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation… to make sure the private sector can be more competitive,” said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO’s regulatory committee. “But payers are looking for evidence of value.” He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. “Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach,” said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc, which is developing drugs for rare diseases. Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. “It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed,” said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won’t happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available. To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation “will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition,” Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call. After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to “streamline” the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA. The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or licence early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed. “The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago… it has become incredibly expensive,” said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners. He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Insurers sense opportunity in unwanted pension plans Higher energy prices boost US producer inflation in January → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent HM and Rouhani discuss bilateral relations Another historic day for Oman-Iran relations Greetings to His Majesty conveyed Banking ties discussed with Iran Read More ...

Credit: Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 3.0) Advertisement | Report Ad By Reuters Staff (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Tuesday it will halt a late-stage trial of an Alzheimer's drug after it was determined that it had no chance of working, marking the latest in a long line of crushing disappointments in efforts to find an effective treatment for the disease. The company was testing its drug, verubecestat, in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. But an independent data monitoring committee determined that there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect" and recommended the trial be stopped for futility. The news sent Merck shares down nearly 2 percent in after hours trading. Verubecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer's drugs called BACE1 inhibitors that target an enzyme involved in the formation of the toxic amyloid protein that turns into plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Several companies are pinning hopes on Alzheimer's treatments using the BASE inhibitor mechanism, including Eli Lilly and Co, Biogen and Novartis in collaboration with Amgen Inc. Lilly previously endured multiple failures with its solanezumab, which also targets beta amyloid, but in a different way. In the most recent setback, Lilly said that drug failed to slow declines in mental capacity of patients with even mild symptoms. Researchers are increasingly focusing on attacking the disease earlier as it appears likely that once symptoms have taken hold current approaches fail to work. Merck said another study of its drug in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease would continue with results expected by February 2019. Patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living. Blinded clinical trials use independent monitors to watch for any unexpected safety problems that may crop up. They can also recommend stopping a study early if it becomes clear that a drug is going to fail or if the data looks so compelling that it believes the treatment should be offered to those getting a placebo or other standard treatments.

While a few treatments temporarily ease symptoms such as memory loss, confusion and agitation, dozens of drugs tested have failed to slow mental decline or halt the mind-robbing disease, including the one Eli Lilly & Co. scrapped in November.

Henriques-Parker posted on Facebook, asking friends and family to send a Christmas card to her grandfather Jim Gaboardi, who suffers from dementia and worked for decades as a mailman in Danbury. Henriques-Parker says Gaboardi has been "inspired" from the cards he has received. By Naomi Kresge / Bloomberg News Dementia has unseated AIDS as one of the world’s top killers, new figures from the World Health Organization show, as drugmakers struggle to either curb or cure it. Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia killed 1.54 million people in 2015, more than twice the number of deaths from the disease in 2000, according to documents posted on the WHO website last month. It replaced HIV/​AIDS as No. 7 on the global health watchdog’s list of the 10 biggest causes of death worldwide. New therapies helped push fatalities from HIV/​AIDS from 1.5 million down to 1.1 million over the same 15-year period. Drugmakers have struggled to understand Alzheimer’s, with Merck & Co. abandoning a high-profile study this week, less than three months after a similar defeat for Eli Lilly & Co. More than 100 experimental treatments have failed to slow the condition, which dismantles memories and leaves patients unable to take care of themselves. Dementia afflicts some 47 million people around the world and the number of cases will probably rise to 75 million by 2030, said Shekhar Saxena, director of the WHO’s department of mental health and substance abuse. “We are making slow progress,” Dr. Saxena said, calling for more public money to be directed toward developing treatments. “I am less optimistic than I would like to be.” Dementia’s climb up the WHO ranking is partly due to the aging of society, and partly to doctors diagnosing it more frequently because they are more familiar with the disease, he said. In high-income economies, Alzheimer’s and other dementia rank as the No. 3 cause of death, trailing only heart disease and stroke. By contrast, HIV/​AIDS remains on the top 10 list in the poorest countries, alongside problems such as malaria and diarrhea. The most recent drug to help treat symptoms of Alzheimer’s is more than a decade old, and with no cure.

The group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, is reviewing its membership criteria after Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, a member of the organization, said it would introduce a drug for a rare, deadly muscle disease at the cost of $89,000 a year. A version of the drug had been available for about $1,000 a year overseas and many U.S. patients were allowed to import it. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Marathon’s “recent actions are not consistent with the mission of our organization,” Steve Ubl, chief executive officer of PhRMA, said in an e-mailed statement. “The leadership of the PhRMA board of directors has begun a comprehensive review of our membership criteria to ensure we are focused on representing research-based biopharmaceutical companies that take significant risks to bring new treatments and cures to patients.” PhRMA includes many of the world’s biggest drugmakers, including Pfizer Inc. and Merck & Co. Its members have faced repeated criticism over the price of medicine in the U.S., after a handful of companies -- some members of the group, some not -- significantly raised the price of older, sometimes off-patent treatments. A spokesman for Marathon didn’t immediately respond to a call seeking comment. The company said it was delaying its introduction of the drug, which is used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, after facing criticism of the price, including an inquiry from two members of Congress.
