He said the issue of childlessness was often blamed on the women, even though reports suggest 50 per cent of infertility problems were caused by men. “This perception does not represent the reality, as the causes of infertility are often shared between males and females,” he said. Tejuosho, who spoke during the ‘Merck More than a Mother’ initiative by Merck Pharmaceuticals in Lagos, said one in four Nigerian couples have infertility challenge, adding that this statistics needs some attention. “We need to focus on how we will make the health institutions accessible to them for infertility management.” While decrying stigmatisation of women due to fertility challenges, he called for increased advocacy so that men will also know it is not an exclusive problem of the women. “When men are also very enlightened on this, they will have the courage to come out with their wives to seek treatment, so that treatment efforts can be directed accordingly. Awareness and education can greatly reduce the high number of infertility in the country,” he added. Noting that the federal government was putting all efforts on ground to ensure healthcare centres were strengthened across the country, Tejuosho explained that within the next two years, there would be 10,000 functioning health centres across political wards of the country. He also noted that the legislature will close ranks during health budgeting to make sure health centres have the capacity to attend to infertility issues. Lending his voice, the Chief Social Officer, Merck Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Rasha Kelej, said the main reason for the establishment of Merck was to empower women in Africa and also to create awareness to change the mindset of people against infertility. “We are here in Africa to empower women to create awareness, information, health and change of mindset. It makes me sad listening to stories on stigmatisation, especially when only the women are blamed for infertility. Men do not want to admit the fact that they can be the cause of infertility as well. “We want to change all these. We know changing culture and belief is very difficult, but with integration and cooperation of the media, there can be awareness on infertility, which would also help eliminate stigmatisation. Women are to be respected,” she added. While urging men to boldly cone out and speak of their fertility problem, she urged the society to respect women. “Even if they don’t have children, we should respect and appreciate them and they will become reproductive members of the society as well,” Kelej noted.

The German company said it would also be increasing the number of staff it employs at the facility by 20% thanks to the two-year programme. The Tres Cantos plant is Merck's main site for the production of active substances in its fertility treatment Gonal-f and endocrine and metabolic disorders treatment Saizen, for which global demand is rising steadily. Simon Sturge, chief operating officer of Merck's biopharma business, said: “The demand for our core portfolio of medicines keeps increasing worldwide. “The expansion in Tres Cantos is part of our continuous commitment to deliver high quality medicines at the right time to our patients.” Merck was able to raise its sales forecast for 2016 earlier this year after a particularly strong second quarter performance, spearheaded by a 23% growth of Gonal-f that saw its sales reach €209m. The Darmstadt, Germany-headquartered firm has invested around €250m in its healthcare manufacturing network so far this year, including in a new regional hub in Côte d'Ivoire launched just this week. The hub will serve Merck's operations in French-speaking countries in Central and West Africa, and will oversee two minilabs donated by the company to aid in the region's fight against counterfeit medicines. Thierry Hulot, head of Merck's biopharma global manufacturing and supply, commented: “We are continuously investing in our manufacturing network to maintain state-of-the-art industry level and adapt its capacity to patient needs for our medicines. “We are very pleased to have completed the expansion of our Tres Cantos biotech manufacturing facility which plays a leading role in our manufacturing network and exemplifies our culture of safety at work, quality and service.” Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

The main driver of this achievement being its increase in competitiveness and steady progress in economic development,” Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, chairman of the executive board and the family board of E. Merck KG, said at the opening. “We are excited to open this office in Abidjan, which will be our first in Francophone Sub-Saharan Africa.” The office was inaugurated by Claus Auer, ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Côte d’Ivoire, and key representatives of the Ivorian government along with Stangenberg-Haverkamp and Karim Bendhaou, president of North and West Africa. “This new office will allow us to reinforce and to develop our already existing activities in the country and it will be the hub for French speaking countries in Central and West Africa. We will continue to bring specialist and high-quality products to serve patients and help them to improve their quality of life,” added Bendhaou. Merck also donated two minilabs with the aim of supporting Côte d’Ivoire in its fight against counterfeit medicines. The minilabs, which help to detect counterfeits, are manufactured by the Global Pharma Health Fund, GPHF, a charitable initiative financed by Merck. “We are pleased that our plan to establish a public-private partnership to combat counterfeits will be translated into effective measures with the donated minilabs, in addition to an awareness campaign led by the Minister of Health and Public Hygiene,” Bendhaou said. The donation ceremony was graced by The First Lady of Côte d’Ivoire, Dominique Claudine Ouattara and minister of Health and Public Hygiene, Dr. Raymonde Goudou Coffie. These minilabs will be the first to be used in Côte d’Ivoire. “This donation done by Merck will allow us to reinforce our structures for drug monitoring. The people will be reassured that they are investing in medicines which are safe, not dangerous and suitable for consumption,” minister of health and Public Hygiene expressed her gratitude for this donation. “The mobile compact laboratories are globally renowned for their ability to detect counterfeits quickly, cost-efficiently and reliably.  The Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene makes quality control its top priority.” Merck’s fight against counterfeit medicines is part of the company’s health-related corporate responsibility initiatives. Many people in low- to middle-income countries lack access to high-quality health solutions and Merck is leveraging its expertise and collaborating with strong partners to develop innovative solutions for such patients. —  Oct 18, 2016 @ 13:20 GMT | No Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The Merck technology, called in-mold 3-D (IM3D), creates the effect with the help of pearlescent pigments. It can be implemented in a single step during the injection molding process, Merck said. IM3D technology creates the look of depth and texture on flat surfaces. “With the IM3D technology from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, brand owners and manufacturers have an outstanding enhancement option that can set their premium products apart from the competition,” said Christoph Palm, vice president and general manager, Color & Additives EMEA & India at PolyOne. “We’re already seeing interest globally from market leaders in packaging and consumer electronics.” “IM3D is just the beginning of our strategic collaboration with PolyOne. Our objective in the coming years is to jointly launch additional innovative plastics technologies with pearlescent pigments,” added Michael Heckmeier, head of the Pigments & Functional Materials business unit at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.

Follow @MaxNisen Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Oct 18, 2016 2:19 PM EDT MERCK KGAA -1.08 At Closing, Nov 11th 94.56 EUR ABBVIE INC -0.90 At Closing, Nov 11th 63.10 USD The pharma world can be cutthroat as firms jockey for position with competing drugs. But even in that context, Pfizer's decision to announce a late-November launch of its competing version of Johnson & Johnson's best-selling drug Remicade the afternoon before J&J released its third-quarter earnings seems a bit cold.  Pfizer's announcement cast a shadow on another blockbuster quarter from J&J, whose shares fell 2.7 percent on Tuesday. But J&J isn't going to let Remicade's $6.5 billion in sales slip gently into the good night. And it's better positioned than just about any other company to weather such a storm.  Down, Not Out Concerns about competition for its best selling drug Remicade dropped Johnson & Johnson shares Tuesday. Source: Bloomberg Intraday times are displayed in ET. Pfizer's drug, Inflectra, is not your standard generic. J&J's drug Remicade is what's known as a biologic drug, made with living cells instead of a chemical process. It's impossible to copy exactly; hence the term "biosimilar." The regulatory tango involved in getting such a drug approved is about as complicated as making it.  Inflectra is just the second biosimilar to hit the U.S. market. It's going to be a huge test of how willing doctors are to prescribe biosimilars, how aggressive payers will be in pushing them, and how firms will fight for biologic market share over the next decade.  Remicade sales helped Johnson & Johnson top earnings estimates in the latest quarter. Sales of the drug grew more than 10 percent from a year ago -- but such performance likely won't be seen again. Merck markets the drug in Europe and splits the profits with Johnson & Johnson. Biosimilars first launched in that region in February of last year, and Merck saw sales drop by more than $500 million compared to 2014, a substantially bigger decline than what analysts currently expect for J&J in 2017.  Patent Bunny Slope? Analysts expect a relatively slow dropoff in J&J's Remicade sales as biosimilar copies hit the U.S. market Source: Bloomberg Things are a bit more complicated in the U.S. Pfizer's drug is an "at risk" launch; there are still outstanding patent appeals that could tangle things up. The FDA has yet to release guidance that would make it easier for pharmacists to switch patients from Remicade to Inflectra. Pfizer is also pricing its drug at a relatively modest 15 percent discount, which may help J&J minimize the sales impact.  The J&J company line, per its earnings call, is that it already faces biosimilar competition elsewhere and has managed to preserve most of its market share. It argues doctors and patients will be reluctant to switch and expects only a "modest" impact from Pfizer's launch.   Remicade sales will drop -- possibly more than expected, if it loses major market share or payers press J&J for discounts.  That means J&J must rely on its pipeline for future growth -- but there are worse things. Last year, J&J committed to file for regulatory approval for a total of 10 drugs with at least $1 billion peak sales potential each by 2019. One of those, the cancer drug Darzalex, has already been approved. By 2019, the company also expects to file for 10 line extensions -- expanded approvals for existing drugs -- that it says could account for at least $500 million each in peak sales. If even a modest portion of that forecast is met, then Remicade becomes much less of a worry. Though J&J's device and consumer businesses are declining in relative importance, they still combined to deliver $9.4 billion in sales in the quarter and give the company a steady base other competing pharma firms lack. That makes J&J less dependent on Remicade. Yes, the drug accounted for 21 percent of pharmaceutical sales in the latest quarter. But it provided only 10 percent of J&J's total sales. Contrast that with AbbVie, whose biosimilar-threatened blockbuster Humira accounted for 64 percent of revenue in the second quarter.  If that's not enough, J&J also has $42.5 billion in cash on hand and is on the hunt for pharma acquisitions. It's on its way to more than $72 billion in revenue in 2016 and delivers on or exceeds expectations quarter after quarter.  Always On Time Johnson & Johnson has made a habit of beating or exceeding analyst's quarterly earnings expectations Source: Bloomberg Adjusted to make comparable with Bloomberg estimates If Pfizer wants to truly rattle J&J, it may have to try a bit harder.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

This research report also lists several other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. Special regulatory designations will act as a major boost for the global metabolic disorders therapeutics market. These special designations help vendors launch their drugs quickly into the market. Also, in a few cases, governments offer tax incentives for such drugs. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the orphan drug designation for a few already approved drugs such as Elelyso, Zavesca, and Cerezyme. Regulatory bodies, at times, give these designations to pipeline products. For instance, Amicus Therapeutics' migalastat is under regulatory review in the US. However, the drug received orphan designation from the FDA for Fabry disease in June 2016. Competitive vendor landscape Novo Nordisk dominated the global metabolic disorders therapeutics market in 2015, primarily because of the high revenues obtained from the diabetes drugs segment. The dominant drugs of the company are Levemir, NovoRapid/NovoLog, NovoMix/NovoLog Mix, and Victoza, which together accounted for the sales of USD 10.14 billion in 2015. The company focuses mainly on diabetes, obesity, hemophilia, and growth hormone disorders. The sales in diabetes and obesity care products increased by 22% in 2015, when measured in Danish Krone (DKK). "Sanofi holds the second position in the metabolic disorders therapeutics market, particularly the diabetes drugs market owing to the high performance of Lantus, which remains the world's best-selling insulin brand, both in terms of volume and value. The sales of Lantus represented over 17% of the total net sales of the company in 2015," says Barath Palada, a lead cardiovascular and metabolic disorders analyst from Technavio. Merck has captured the third position in the global metabolic disorder therapeutics market owing to its prominent position in diabetes and hypercholesterolemia drugs market. Januvia and Janumet are the leading diabetes drugs offered by the company, the combined sales of which accounted to USD 6.01 billion in 2015.

The increase was because of the growth in performance of Victoza (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 therapy for type 2 diabetes) and insulin and protein related products (Treshiba, Ryzodeg, and modern insulin). However, it was partially offset by the decrease in sales of oral antidiabetic products (Novonorm, Prandin, and Prandimet).

The revenue generated from the sales of the other products in the diabetes segment amounted to USD 8.41 billion in 2015.

2016, 08:04 ET Share this article KENILWORTH, N.J., Oct. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Contrary to popular myths, poison doesn't always come in the form of a tainted red apple or an untraceable dose of ricin in a cup of tea. In reality, most poisonings are caused by exposure to common toxic substances that can easily be found. With the nation's 55 poison centers receiving more than 2.2 million calls about exposures in 2013 alone, many Americans are taking the right steps following a suspected poisoning. Yet misconceptions about treatment, largely based on outdated practices, still exist – many of which can cause further harm to victims. Merck Manuals author and toxicology specialist Dr. Gerald O'Malley debunks five common myths about poisoning and shares insight about treatment methods for someone who has been exposed to a poisonous substance on MerckManuals.com: Myth #1. There's an antidote for most poisons. Debunked. There are only about 40 different antidotes used in clinical medicine to counteract poisonings from specific substances, and most emergency rooms only stock a portion of them. Less than five in 100 poisoning patients receive an antidote specific to whatever they've been exposed to. One reason for this is that doctors don't know what caused the poisoning and have to piece together the most likely source. But it's also true that most poisonings, even when the type of poison is known, can be treated effectively without an antidote. In many cases, doctors will address the symptoms resulting from the poisoning while the body eliminates the poison on its own. Myth #2. Carbon monoxide poisoning usually results in the victim falling unconscious. Debunked. This is an especially dangerous misconception for many families. The signs of low-level carbon monoxide poisoning are very subtle and often difficult to accurately diagnose. Early symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, shortness of breath, fatigue, mood swings and impaired judgment. Many people are evaluated or hospitalized for these symptoms before doctors realize carbon monoxide is the cause, leaving the source of the colorless, odorless gas undetected and its dangerous effects uncorrected. Carbon monoxide poisoning should be thought of whenever many household members, particularly the smallest ones, simultaneously develop vague or flu-like symptoms. Myth #3. Ipecac and inducing vomiting is an effective way to treat many poisonings. Debunked. There are serious complications that come with inducing vomiting in a potential poison victim. Ipecac syrup, a medicine once commonly used to induce vomiting, is no longer recommended to be kept in households, and in fact many drug stores don't carry it anymore. This and other methods– like putting a finger down the throat – also have the potential for dangerous unintended consequences and do not increase the success of treatment. Myth #4. Swallowing poison is always more dangerous than absorbing it through the skin. Debunked. Topical medications, especially pain patches, can be just as dangerous as ingested pills and are often more potent. These patches offer a huge benefit to patients who have difficulty swallowing pills or remembering to take regular doses. However, even after the recommended usage, there can be up to 75 percent of the medicine remaining on the patch. Patches also pose a poisoning risk if they're damaged or if they're applied to irritated or broken skin, which can lead to faster absorption of the medication. Myth #5. Poison control is only for life-threatening poisoning emergencies. Debunked. Calling the American Association of Poison Control Centers (1 (800) 222-1222) is not like calling 9-1-1. You don't need to be facing a life-threatening emergency to call. In fact, about two percent of hotline calls are about pet poisonings. The hotline is also a useful resource for identifying unknown pills, and almost 10 percent of calls are for the pill identification service. More than two-thirds of calls don't result in a trip to a doctor or emergency room. If you suspect you or anyone else is suffering from a possible poisoning, do not hesitate to call the hotline. The call is free and confidential, and you'll be connected directly to a poison specialist who is a registered nurse or pharmacist. The specialist will ask for information including the patient's age, presence of symptoms, weight, health history, and details of the possible poisoning.

AgWired Animal Ag Precision Energy AgNewsWire ZimmComm Navigation Subscribe Advertise About Subscribe Advertise About Merck Receives USDA License for BOVILIS CORONAVIRUS Merck Receives USDA License for BOVILIS CORONAVIRUS Jamie Johansen October 17, 2016 Leave a Comment Facebook Twitter Email Print The 2016 World Dairy Expo was the perfect venue for Merck Animal Health to debut their BOVILIS® CORONAVIRUS, the 1st USDA-approved modified-live intranasal vaccine to aid in reduction of enteric disease caused by Bovine Coronavirus (BCV). BCV is commonly transferred by animals during periods of stress, including shipping, parturition, cold weather, commingling or delivery to a backgrounding facility or feedyard. Scours and winter dysentery are often the two signs that will signal the presence of BCV. A 2012 study at the University of Wisconsin Diagnostic Laboratory tested 147 herds and found nearly half (49.4 percent) of the herds to be positive for BCV. In related research at Oklahoma State University, 37 percent of BCV cases are found in calves zero to 30-days old. Scott Nordstrom, D.V.M., Merck Animal Health, was on hand during the Expo to share more about the new vaccine. “Bovine coronavirus is far more prevalent than producers realize and, thus, the need to vaccinate is vitally important. When used as part of a complete vaccination protocol, BOVILIS CORONAVIRUS delivers protection against the enteric signs of bovine coronavirus and is a critical component in improving the overall health of cattle on an operation.” Dr. Nordstrom said BOVILIS CORONAVIRUS the intranasal vaccine can be given from birth on. As a modified-live vaccine, it creates it’s own active immunity. “It can be given prior to when we see the disease in calves. Which is usually between zero and fours weeks of age.” In the past the only way to protect calves was to vaccinate the dams, but now Dr. Nordstrom said, “We are not only able to vaccinate the dams to provided colostrum with antibodies for it, but we can immunize the calves by giving them this product.” Listen to my complete interview with Dr. Nordstrom to learn about diagnostic signs and the importance of working with your local veterinarian.

Which of these clinical-stage biotechs is the better pick for investors right now? Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Oct 18, 2016 at 3:42PM Image source: Getty Images. It's been a good year for clinical-stage biotech Agenus Inc. (NASDAQ:AGEN): Its shares are up over 20% in 2016. Meanwhile, shares of peer Bellicum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:BLCM) have sunk more than 20%. Which of these two biotech stocks presents the better choice for investors now? The case for Agenus Why buy Agenus stock? One top reason would be the company's promising QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant, used in vaccines to strengthen immune response. GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) is using the adjuvant as a key component in its malaria and shingles vaccines. Glaxo's malaria vaccine, Mosquirix, has experienced ups and downs. It received a positive opinion from European regulators in 2015. However, the World Health Organization is requiring additional pilot programs before expanding use of the vaccine. While Mosquirix's efficacy decreases over time, that doesn't seem to be a problem for Glaxo's shingles vaccine, Shingrix. The big drugmaker expects to file for regulatory approval before the end of 2016. That's good news for Agenus, which has already monetized part of the royalties it hopes to receive from Glaxo's vaccines through a note purchase agreement. Agenus also has its own vaccines in development. Prophage successfully completed a couple of phase 2 clinical studies for newly diagnosed and recurring glioblastoma multiforme. Agenus hopes to have another study of Prophage begin by the end of 2016, but this study won't be sponsored by the biotech. Two other cancer vaccines, AutoSynVax and PhosphoSynVax, are in preclinical testing.  Then there's Agenus' checkpoint antibody program. The company launched a phase 1 study of AGEN1884 earlier this year. Agenus is working with Incyte on another phase 1/2 study of experimental cancer treatment INCAGN1876. Also, in June Merck selected its lead product candidate from Agenus' antibody roster to advance into preclinical testing. Agenus reported cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $123.3 million at the end of June. That's only enough to carry the biotech through the first half of 2017. Further dilution of shares through another stock offering seems quite likely.  The case for Bellicum Lead candidate BPX-501 stands as the main reason for investors to like Bellicum. The adjunct T-cell therapy is in two pivotal clinical studies targeting pediatric leukemias, lymphomas, and rare inherited blood diseases. BPX-501 could address a critical issue with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the transplantation of stem cells from bone marrow or blood. While HCST is the standard of care for treating several blood diseases, it's not a viable option for many patients, because they don't have a fully matched donor. BPX-501 helps make partial match donor (haploidentical) transplants more likely to be successful.  Bellicum has received orphan drug designation for BPX-501 in both the U.S. and Europe. The biotech hopes to be able to submit for European approval of the drug based on its ongoing phase 1/2 clinical study under the European Union's "exceptional circumstances" provision. This provision allows for early approval for drugs that treat rare diseases or where controlled studies aren't a practical option. The company also has a couple of other candidates in its pipeline. BPX-601 is being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial for treating non-resectable pancreatic cancer. Another drug, BPX-701, will soon be evaluated in a phase 1 clinical study focusing on initial indications of refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Bellicum reported cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities of $136.6 million at the end of June. The biotech thinks that should be enough to fund development and operations through the end of 2017. Better buy It's a tough pick between these two clinical-stage biotechs. Both have opportunities, but both also have significant risks.  Shingrix should be a big winner for Glaxo and Agenus. If Glaxo's results with Mosquirix were more positive, I'd probably give the nod to Agenus.  Instead, my pick is Bellicum. The company owns all rights to its drugs, which is a big plus. If all goes well with BPX-501, Bellicum could be quite successful. I also wouldn't be surprised if the biotech ended up as an acquisition target down the road. Bellicum looks like the better buy right now. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The vaccine's safety and effectiveness will be tested on volunteers infected with HIV, starting in Ottawa and Montreal in November, and followed by trials in Senegal and Burkina Faso next year, the government said in a statement. The tests are being conducted in partnership with US pharmaceutical company Merck. "It is particularly important to study the effectiveness of this Ebola vaccine in vulnerable populations, such as those living with HIV," said principal investigator Cecile Tremblay. "These populations can often be most at-risk during outbreaks, because of their compromised immune systems." Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids, and causes a range of symptoms, from fever and body aches to vomiting, diarrhea and hemorrhage. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Ebola has killed up to 90 percent of those infected during some outbreaks, though the average chance of survival is about 50 percent. A 2014 epidemic killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa. The Ebola vaccine, originally developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, provided blanket protection in a field trial in Guinea, according to a preliminary study published in 2015. The results published in The Lancet medical journal were hailed as "extremely promising" by the World Health Organization. The world was "on the verge of an effective Ebola vaccine," the UN's health agency had said in a statement. The final results of the study are expected to be published this fall, said the Canadian government. "This next phase of clinical trials is an important milestone in the development of the world's first proven, effective vaccine against the Ebola virus," commented Health Minister Jane Philpott.

Bargain hunting may contribute to early strength on Wall Street along with a positive reaction to the latest corporate results. U.S. stocks moved about in a lackluster manner on Monday before ending modestly lower. The major averages opened higher but moved back and forth across the unchanged line until the mid-session. Subsequently, the averages moved decisively lower, declining steadily until late afternoon trading and moving roughly sideways thereafter. The Dow Industrials ended down 51.98 points or 0.29 percent at a more than 1-month low of 18,086, the S&P 500 Index closed 6.48 points or 0.30 percent lower at 2,127 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at 5,200, down 14.34 points or 0.27 percent. Twenty-two of the thirty Dow components declined in the session and one stock was unchanged, while the remaining seven stocks ended higher. McDonald's (MCD), Nike (NKE), Home Depot (HD) and Merck (MRK) were among the worst performers of the session. Among the sectors, retail and brokerage stocks showed notable moves to the downside, while gold stocks gained ground. On the economic front, the results of the New York Federal Reserve's manufacturing survey showed that conditions among manufacturers in the region worsened in October. The general business conditions index fell to -6.8 from -2.0 in September, remaining negative for the third straight month. Economists expected an improvement to 1. The new orders index was at -5.60, the shipments index was at -0.60 and the employment index was at -4.70. Inflation measures were on an upswing, with the prices paid index climbing about 6 points to 22.60 and the prices received index rising about 3 points to 4.70. The 6-month outlook index edged up by two points to 36.0. The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production rose 0.1 percent month-over-month in September, smaller than the 0.2 percent increase expected by economists. Manufacturing output was up 0.2 percent compared to the 0.1 percent growth predicted, with high-tech production offering support. However, business equipment production was down for the second straight month. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are rising $0.40 to $50.34 a barrel after ending Monday's session down $0.41 at $49.94 a barrel. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is currently trading at $1,263.50, up $6.90 from the previous session's close of $1,256.60. On Monday, gold rose $1.10. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 103.98 yen compared to the 103.89 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0995 compared to yesterday's $1.1000. Asia The Asian markets all rebounded notably, with the Chinese, Hong Kong and Indian markets leading the forward charge. However, the New Zealand market retreated sharply. Japanese stocks rose moderately, advancing for the third straight session, as the yen remained flat at the upper 103 levels against the dollar. The Nikkei 225 Index saw some weakness in early trading but moved above the unchanged line in the late morning. Subsequently, the index remained mostly above the unchanged line before ending up 63.49 points or 0.38 percent at 16,964. Food, housing, textile, real estate, chemical, paper, resource and utility stocks ended mostly higher, while the pharma, export and financial spaces saw mixed sentiment. On the other hand, retail and telecom stocks saw weakness. Australia's All Ordinaries Index hovered mostly above the unchanged line before ending up 21.10 points or 0.39 percent at 5,492. Utility and real estate stocks led the gains, although IT and industrial stocks came under selling pressure. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended at 23,394, up 356.85 points or 1.55 percent at 23,394 and China's Shanghai Composite rallied 42.71 points or 1.40 percent before ending at 3,084. On the economic front, the minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's October meeting showed that board members foresee a gradual slowing in the short term before a recovery sets in. The economists see no significant change in the outlook for inflation, so the prospects for a rate cut at the November board meeting are remote. Separately, an Australian Bureau of Statistics report showed that new motor vehicle sales in Australia rose 2.5 percent month-over-month in September following a flat reading in August. Annual growth slowed to 0.8 percent from 2.8 percent. Europe European stocks are also rallying amid a pickup in risk appetite. While the French CAC 40 Index has jumped by 1.4 percent, the German DAX Index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index are up by 1.2 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. In major corporate news, Ryanair reduced its full year net profit guidance by 5 percent, citing the weakness of the Sterling following the Brexit, which is expected to impact average fares for the second half. French dairy giant Danone reported a 2.1 percent increase in the like-for-like sales, as a 2.8 percent increase in value offset a 0.7 percent drop in volume. Burberry reported an increase in same store sales for the September quarter, benefiting from a weaker pound. However, conditions in Hong Kong, Macau and continental Europe remained weak. On the economic front, a survey by the European Central Bank showed that Eurozone banks are set to tighten credit standards on business lending in the final three months of this year, while they expect to ease standards for housing loans and retain the existing levels for consumer credit. The U.K. Office for National Statistics reported that annual inflation in the U.K. rose to 1 percent in September from 0.6 percent August, reaching the highest rate since November 2014. Higher clothing and transportation costs led to much of the spike. Economists expected an inflation rate of 0.9 percent. Meanwhile, another report showed that output price inflation accelerated but input price inflation decelerated by much more than expected. Annual U.K. house price inflation unexpectedly accelerated to 8.4 percent in August after easing in the previous month, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed. Economists had expected inflation to ease to 7.8 percent. The measure has been rising since end of 2013. U.S. Economic Reports Reflecting higher prices for gasoline and shelter, the Labor Department released a report showing that U.S. consumer prices rose in line with economist estimates in the month of September. The Labor Department said its consumer price index climbed by 0.3 percent in September after edging up by 0.2 percent in August. Excluding food and energy prices, the core consumer price index inched up by 0.1 percent in September after increasing by 0.3 percent in August. Economists had expected core prices to rise by 0.2 percent. The annual rate of consumer price inflation accelerated to 1.5 percent in September from 1.1 percent, while the core rate slowed to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent. At 10 am ET, the National Association of Home Builders will release the results of its homebuilder confidence survey for October. The consensus estimate calls for a decline in the housing market index to 63. In September, the housing market index rose to 65 from a downwardly revised reading of 59 for August. The present sales condition index rose 6 points to 7, representing a nearly 1-year high, the index measuring prospective buyer traffic was up 4 points to 48 and the sales expectations index gained 5 points to 71.

IBM (IBM) reported better than expected third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share and revenues, with the top line boosted by income from intellectual property. Cloud revenues were up 44 percent.

Source: A 4 via Flickr BMY stock’s latest issue arrived when rival Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) released positive clinical trial results for a type of lung cancer treatment. Shares of BMY were crushed because it is developing a similar drug for the same type of cancer and the first to market will be the major winner. With the news hitting the market this past weekend, MRK officially has the lead and this hurts BMY’s prospects. 9 Best Stocks to Buy Amid Market Turmoil Click to Enlarge In fact, it sent BMY stock down 10% to its lowest level since 2014. The chart is in clear breakdown mode after its second major plunge in the past three months. BMY first collapsed on Aug. 5, falling 16% after poor results for a cancer drug. The negative news kicked off a freefall from which the stock has yet to recover. There’s another factor hurting BMY, too: Now that Hillary Clinton has taken a commanding lead in the polls, her rhetoric of being harsh on drug pricing has put a black cloud over the entire sector. The iShares Dow Jones US Pharm Indx (ETF) (NYSEARCA:IHE), which tracks the Dow Jones Pharmaceutical Index, closed at a fresh three-month low Wednesday. At this point, buying into BMY stock would be trying to catch a falling knife. The only logical plan is to wait for the sector to bottom out, then see how BMY is reacting. If it’s also building a base, that could be the opportunity to get in at a low price. Personally, I’d buy in a little higher rather than trying to pick a bottom. Disney Princesses Give Hasbro the Magic Touch There is still great long-term value in BMY stock given its solid cancer drug pipeline, but shares can become oversold for months before the true fundamentals are reflected in the stock price.

Compared with placebo, aprepitant did not meet the patient-reported 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) for nausea (met by 46% of patients on aprepitant versus 40% of the placebo group, 95% CI 0.8-1.7; P=0.43), said Gianrico Farrugia, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., at the American College of Gastroenterology annual meeting. However, the 126-participant study did find that aprepitant use resulted in a greater decline in mean daily hours of nausea over 4 weeks (-2.5 versus -1.2 hrs; P=0.03), mean 4-week Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) score (-1.3 versus -0.7; P=0.001), and greater improvement in multiple other measures of symptom severity including the patient-reported PAGI-SYM instrument and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). Kenneth R. DeVault, MD, ACG president and session moderator, agreed that future research on aprepitant as a treatment for gastroparesis is necessary. "I completely think that there needs to be another trial because there are so few drugs that will positively affect gastroparesis," he told MedPage Today. "It was a great proof of concept but is really something that will need further study." Aprepitant is currently approved for treating nausea in chemotherapy patients and those coming out of surgery. Researchers (as well as manufacturer Merck) thought it might also be effective in gastroparesis. The multicenter, double-masked trial randomized 126 patients 1:1 to 125 mg/day of oral aprepitant or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was either a 25-mm reduction after 4 weeks in patients' VAS reports or a 4-week VAS average of less than 25 mm. At baseline, 57% of patients had delayed gastric emptying and the remainder had normal or rapid emptying but with gastroparesis symptoms; 29% of the sample was diabetic. When asked by an audience member why the trial missed its primary endpoint, Farrugia responded: "We're slaves to the outcomes we chose, [in this case it was] 25-mm change. Now we can argue in retrospect that it was too severe, but that was what we chose." During the presentation Farrugia called attention to the fact that aprepitant showed significant benefits in gastroparesis measures used more commonly, including overall symptom relief and GCSI scores for nausea, vomiting, postprandial fullness, bloating, and abdominal pain. Farrugia noted that twice as many patients in the treatment group versus the placebo group experienced at least one adverse effect (32% vs 16%, P=0.10), yet most were mild to moderate and none were serious. The drug and placebo were provided by Merck. One investigator also reported a consulting relationship with Vanda Pharmaceuticals. 2016-10-18T08:00:00-0400 Primary Source American College of Gastroenterology Source Reference: Pasricha P, et al "Aprepitant for symptoms of gastroparesis and related disorders: the APRON randomized clinical trial" ACG 2016; Abstract 1. 0 comments Next More in Meeting Coverage Two Years of Immunotherapy Falls Short in Hay Fever ACC Video Conference Reporter: AHA 2016 AHA: More Potent Antiplatelet Agent Not Better for PAD AHA: Healthy Lifestyle Eases Heart Impact of High Genetic Risk AHA: No Cognitive Benefit from Heart Drugs in HOPE-3 AHA: Long-Term Benefit in HF Patients Elusive for Novel Vasodilator AHA: Study Finds Celebrex Safe for Heart ACAAI: Early Exposure to Peanuts May Thwart Allergy Next Article MedPageToday is a trusted and reliable source for clinical and policy coverage that directly affects the lives and practices of health care professionals.

Equities traded in a fairly narrow range all day as we head into another week that is likely to be dominated by corporate earnings and politics. Among the sectors, consumer discretionary and energy stocks lag while utilities and telecom have moved higher. WTI crude oil for November delivery settled at $49.94 a barrel, down 0.8% for the day.

The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Monday was McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) which traded down 1.53% at $112.34. The stock’s 52-week range is $102.08 to $131.96. Trading volume was about equal to the daily average of around 4.6 million. The company reports earnings later this week, and a report Monday from Nomura suggests flat U.S. sales. The Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD) traded down 1.03% at $125.11. The stock’s 52-week range is $109.62 to $139.00. Volume was about 40% below the daily average of around 4.4 million shares. The home improvement giant had no specific news. Nike Inc.

Volume was about 30% below the daily average of around 9 million shares. The company had no specific news, but a downgrade at competitor Under Armour could have had some effect on investor sentiment. Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) traded down 1.01% at $61.52. The stock’s 52-week range is $47.97 to $64.86. Volume was a bit above the daily average of around 10.1million shares.

The S&P/TSX Composite inched up 3.88 points to greet noon at 14,588.87. The Canadian dollar gained 0.03 cents to 76.13 cents U.S. The Chief Executive of Rogers, Guy Laurence, is stepping down effective immediately and will be replaced by former Telus Corp executive Joe Natale as soon as possible, the Canadian telecom company said. The surprise move came as Rogers also posted a sharp fall in net income after it shut down the streaming television joint venture Shomi. Its shares rose 1.4% to $55.11. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added strength as Teck Resources rose 4% to $25.65, while Barrick Gold was up 0.8% at $20.77. Among industrials, Canadian National Railway fell 0.4% to $86.83, while health-care giant Valeant Pharmaceutical International was down 1.9% at $28.58. On the economic slate, Statistics Canada reported foreign investment in Canadian securities totaled $12.7 billion in August, led by acquisitions of Canadian bonds on the secondary market. At the same time, the agency says, Canadian investment in foreign securities slowed to $1.6 billion. This resulted in a net inflow of funds of $11.1 billion into the Canadian economy in the month ON BAY STREET The TSX Venture Exchange was positive 0.39 points to 773.41 The 12 TSX subgroups were evenly split between gainers and losers, as gold moved upwards 1.2%, materials took on 0.8%, and utilities strengthened 0.5%. The half-dozen laggards were weighed most by consumer discretionary stocks, down 0.5%, while energy and health-care surrendered 0.4% each. ON WALL STREET U.S. stocks held slightly lower on Monday as investors digested a number of corporate results and key economic data while keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrials staggered 35.95 points to 18,102.43, with Merck leading decliners and IBM the top advancer. The S&P 500 slid 3.33 points to 2,129.65, with energy leading five sectors lower and utilities leading risers. The NASDAQ composite index dropped 2.96 points to 5,211.20, as shares of Apple dropped 0.4%. Banking giant Bank of America and toymaker Hasbro were among the firms reporting quarterly earnings before the bell. Both firms beat Wall Street estimates. IBM and Netflix are among the companies scheduled to release results after the close on Monday. Earnings season has gotten off to a good start. Experts say that, of the 34 S&P 500 companies that had reported as of Friday morning, 79% had beaten Wall Street estimates for earnings per share. Last week, banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all reported better-than-expected profits and sales. Investors also digested industrial production data, which showed a 0.1% increase in September, slightly below a consensus estimate of 0.2%. Meanwhile, the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions showed manufacturing in the state contracted for the third straight month. Overseas, Chinese gross domestic product, retail sales and industrial profits are all scheduled for release on Wednesday. Last week, U.S. stocks were weighed down by a surprise fall in Chinese exports. Prices for the 10-year Treasury gained, lowering yields to 1.78% from Friday’s 1.8%. Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions. Oil prices were down 88 cents at $49.47 U.S. a barrel Gold prices nosed higher 40 cents to $1,255.90 U.S. an ounce.

Human papillomavirus, which is transmitted sexually, can cause at least six types of cancer as well as genital warts.

It will include policy recommendations from the Moonshot Task Force for a range of government agencies — possibly for funding for the genome sequencing of tumors — and Biden’s vision for how to achieve 10 years of advancements against cancer in half that time. Story Continued Below This is likely the Obama administration’s last big White House event on the issue. It follows a blue ribbon report last month that laid out the greatest scientific opportunities in cancer research. But whether the Moonshot lifts off or fails to launch depends largely on whether Congress funds it in the upcoming lame-duck session. Appropriators have shown they’re willing to boost NIH’s fortunes based on bills passed in committee earlier this year, but cancer research advocates will be pushing for extra short-term funding in the 21st Century Cures legislation. The “Cures bill is something we are going to be strongly advocating for in the lame duck because it’s the perfect vehicle for the moonshot,” said Jon Retzlaff, managing director of science policy and government relations at the American Association for Cancer Research. “[It] could really change the face of cancer.” Happy Monday and welcome to Prescription PULSE, where we note that this month in 1979, Allan Cormack and Godfrey Hounsfield won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for their work developing computer-assisted tomography — the revolutionary new 3-D imaging technology. FDA TO COLLECT $2.5 BILLION IN USER FEES IN GDUFA II — That’s nearly $1 billion more than the agency agreed to collect in the first iteration of the Generic Drug User Fee Act, which was signed into law in 2012. Generic drug companies and FDA agreed that user fees should total $493.6 million annually in GDUFA II, which Congress is expected to reauthorize in late 2017. It would run through FY 2022. In GDUFA I they agreed to $299 million a year, but that was based on FDA receiving about 750 generic drug applications each year. Instead, the agency has received about 1,000 applications annually, so the agency needs additional funds to meet its productivity goals. The GDUFA II fee structure is also being revised so that FDA receives a smaller percentage of its user fees from new generic drug applications. To offset this change, companies that sponsor one or more approved generic drugs will pay an annual fee. The agency is also eliminating fees for supplements to already approved applications and altering how it determines fees for small companies. The full text of the commitments FDA agreed to in return for the financial support was also released late last week. Some highlights: FDA is committing to review 90 percent of generic applications within 10 months of submission. It will review priority applications within eight months if a company submits certain manufacturing information two months ahead of filing its application. UDI TO FLY — The obscure ASC-X12 standards committee will likely recommend that unique device identification numbers for medical devices be included on payment claims forms, Pro eHealth’s Darius Tahir reports. Even as the device industry’s trade groups have publicly turned against the idea, objections from stakeholders, including the American Hospital Association and even CMS, have gradually been worn down by safety hawks and data wonks campaigning to do for medical devices what the barcode did for retail products. … UDI would allow tracking of individual devices as they move through the system, enabling easier recalls and informing comparative effectiveness research. AdvaMed worries that information on the claims forms will lead to research that misconstrues the data, and instead recommends putting the UDI on electronic health records. But members of the standards committee said the concerns would be overcome. “Right now I am optimistic that there will be a field for the device identifier on the claim,” Joseph Drozda, Mercy Hospital cardiologist and X-12 workgroup member, told Darius. “There’s a groundswell to support that.” TOP DEMS PRESSURED FDA, DRUG COMPANY TO HELP DYING BIG DONOR — Former President Bill Clinton, then-Sen. John Kerry and other top Democrats pressured FDA and a pharmaceutical company to get a top donor access to an experimental cancer medicine, according to hacked emails released by Wikileaks Saturday. In 2008, Clinton and Kerry, along with former Sens. Max Baucus and Tom Harkin, worked Washington lobbyists, board members and shareholders for the drug company Biogen, helping to arrange conversations between then-FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach and company CEO James Mullen. They were working to get Dallas fundraiser Fred Baron access to Biogen’s Tysabri to treat his bone marrow cancer. The effort appeared to help persuade FDA to provide assurances to the drug company that FDA would turn a blind eye to any negative effects experienced by Baron when evaluating the drug, but Biogen continued to say no. Doctors are legally allowed to use FDA approved treatments "off label" for conditions not approved by FDA. However, Tysabri’s distribution was very tightly controlled and monitored because it increases patients risk of a deadly brain infection. Ultimately it was Nancy Pelosi — who worked with FDA and the Mayo Clinic to get the drug administered without the company’s consent, according to the Dallas Morning News. But it did not save Baron’s life. The disclosure comes amid a nationwide push for “Right-to-Try” laws that allow terminally ill patients to skirt FDA’s compassionate use process when requesting access to experimental medicines. More than half the states have passed such laws with huge bipartisan support, but backers haven't been able to get a national version though the Senate. Former FDA attorney Patti Zettler said that the Wikileaks emails actually support the position that "FDA generally works with terminally and seriously ill patients who are seeking expanded access." That, she added, suggests that the right to try laws are a "misplaced policy effort to the extent they draw attention and resources away from efforts to develop effective treatments for terminally and seriously ill patients, sow confusion about the FDA’s role and processes or create false hope.” And despite the emails' claim that Biogen hesitated in Baron's case over fears it could compromise the drug's approval for cancer, Zettler added that FDA has recently published a study showing it is extremely rare for adverse events from expanded access to have a negative impact on drug development. MED DEVICE INDUSTRY CHAMPION IN TOUGH REELECTION FIGHT — Rep. Erik Paulsen last year helped win a two-year moratorium on Obamacare's medical device tax, but the Minnesota Republican is facing his toughest reelection contest. Paulsen represents exactly the type of wealthy, suburban swing district where Donald Trump's incendiary rhetoric may prove toxic down ballot. He’s won his last three reelection contests by more than 15 points, but polls show his district is distinctly anti-Trump. More from Pro’s Paul Demko here. PHARMA IN THE STATES A PEEK BEHIND THE DRUG REBATE CURTAIN DOESN’T MAKE THE PICTURE ANY PRETTIER — Drug spending in Massachusetts grew significantly from 2013 to 2015, the state’s Office of the Attorney General reported last week, even when accounting for discounts and rebates paid by drug companies. The findings debunk claims that rebates — often kept secret — mitigate the trend of increased drug spending when only the list price is taken into account. The AG studied spending by 10 different plans accounting for about 75 percent of Massachusetts’ commercial market and found that in most cases rebates didn’t substantially alter the increase in spending. In one case, a health plan actually experienced a greater increase in drug spend post-rebates. … Competition fail. The AG also conducted a case study of multiple sclerosis drugs to understand why prices have increased even as new drugs have entered the market. There are 14 FDA approved products). The report found net prices, not just list prices, have been steadily increasing since 2011. It also found that most commercial plans in the state pay very similar prices for the treatments despite different negotiation approaches with drug companies, varying plan size and market share, and differences in formulary design. “Our findings suggest we cannot count on competition … to discipline prices” because the demand for treatments for some diseases is great enough that “payers cannot meaningfully negotiate on formulary placement or the rebates that lower net prices.” Another problem, they said, is the lack of data on comparative effectiveness. Most MS drugs haven’t been tested in head-to-head clinical trials, making it difficult to assess whether one is more valuable than another. … Generic competition suffers too. Of the 10 MS drugs they zeroed in on, the only drug with a generic alternative in the group, Copaxone 20 mg, appears to have become victim to “product hopping” — a tactic used by brand drug makers to squash generic competition. A year before the generic drug came on the market, Teva introduced an injectable version that patients take less often. By the time the generic Copaxone 20 mg pill was available, 70 percent of patients had changed to the newer branded version, which doesn’t have an automatically substitutable generic. ** A message from The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA): PCMA's That's What PBMs Do campaign highlights how pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) will save America's employers and consumers $654 billion over the next decade. Learn more at http://thatswhatpbmsdo.com ** TEXAS JUDGES LET CONTROVERSIAL DOC OFF THE HOOK — Most of the serious accusations against Stanley Burzynski, a Texas doctor who has been under suspicion by federal and state regulators of giving cancer patients unproven treatments for decades, were dismissed by a panel of state judges last week. One of the judges went as far as to describe Burzynski as “‘a dedicated and innovative physician’ whose treatments have saved the lives of cancer patients, both adults and children,’” the Houston Chronicle reports. The state’s case against Burzynski focused on seven patients who said they were lured by false advertising about his controversial and unproven chemotherapy and received substandard care. It’s the latest victory for Burzynski who’s been targeted by FDA and the Texas State Medical Board. Terminal patients travel all over the world to see the doctor, although his medications have never been proven effective in clinical trials. CALIFORNIA FIGHT OVER PROP 61 HEATS UP — Sen. Bernie Sanders headlined a rally Friday for the ballot measure that would cap what state programs pays for prescription drugs at the rates negotiated by the Veteran’s Administration. The provision has enjoyed broad approval in recent polls, but six more California papers weighed in last week against the measure, joining a recent wave of editorials warning that it’s not the answer to high drug prices. MERCK, AETNA SET UP DIABETES PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE PROGRAM — The drug giant and health insurer announced the latest agreement that aims to tie drug reimbursement to how well products work in the real world. Merck will provide Aetna with rebates on two of its type 2 diabetes drugs, Januvia (sitagliptin) and Janumet (sitagliptin plus metformin). Rebates will be based, in part, on whether Aetna’s members achieve or maintain their treatment objectives while taking the medications. Merck will also work with Aetna on its AetnaCare initiative. The program works with patients, physicians and caregivers to encourage treatment adherence, reinforce healthy behaviors and provide additional support, such as nutrition assistance. These types of reimbursement deals have been touted as one of the promising non-government solutions to high drug prices, but industry experts say it will probably be a year or two before we’ll learn if any of these programs live up to their promise. QUICK HITS Staving off an IPR challenge. Biopharmaceutical firm, Shire, proved victorious over hedge fund manager Kyle Bass this month, staving off an IPR challenge — a method of contesting a company’s intellectual property more quickly than through the court system. The Patent and Trademark Office upheld the validity of one of the company’s patents, which is related to the ulcerative colitis drug, Lialda. Free charity? Forbes reports Doctors Without Borders rejected $1 million worth of free pneumonia vaccines from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, arguing that there is no such thing as “free” vaccines. The organization’s executive director, Jason Cone, writes in a Medium blog post that such acts of charity often come with conditions restricting where the vaccines can be administered and who can receive them. Pfizer strongly disagreed. Secret compassion. Only about one in five drug and biotech companies post on their websites their “compassionate use” policies, which allow for the use of investigational medical products outside of clinical trials. That’s according to a recent review by Avalere. Fighting superbugs. As the FDA ramps up the fight to control deadly superbugs by limiting antibiotic use in American livestock, the pharmaceutical industry — while complying with policy — is marketing the same drugs to veterinarians and expanding sales overseas to offset any decline in U.S. sales. More from Bloomberg. Rx legislation. Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn) introduced the Prescription Drug and Medical Device Review Board Act last week. It would create a board to review the prices of drugs and medical devices, as well as manufacturing costs. The board would be empowered to take actions such as limiting the period during which monopolies are protected or imposing fines on companies charging excessive prices. CBO fuzzy math? American Enterprise Institute's Joe Antos questions how the CBO concluded the Medicare Part B drug payment demonstration project would save $1.1 billion over a decade, given how few specifics are known about how the program would work. Read his paper here. Cases dismissed. A federal judge in Massachusetts dismissed the cases against two employees of the New England Compounding Center whose handling of contaminated steroids led to a nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis, the FDA Law Blog reports. Other NECC cases are ongoing, but the judge concluded that these two employees, who were responsible for checking outgoing drug packages for accuracy, were not pharmacists dispensing prescriptions under the law, and therefore, had no intent to defraud or mislead. Making pigs safe again. The FDA is working to bolster the regulation of heparin in China to prevent another tragedy like the one that took place in 2007-08. More than 80 deaths in the U.S. resulted from an adulterated version. But heparin's complex mixture of molecules makes it difficult for regulators to determine its authenticity. One Chinese company, Enoray, however, is up for the challenge of guaranteeing the integrity of its heparin supply chain. More from C & EN. Weapon for sale. An Associated Press investigation found 12 Chinese companies will export a powerful synthetic opioid known as carfentanil to the United States and other countries, for as little as $2,750 a kilogram, no questions asked. It’s a powerful chemical that has been killing unsuspecting drug users and is so lethal that it presents a potential terrorism threat. Officials say the drug, which is manufactured legally and openly sold online in China, is comparable to traditional nerve agents, raising concerns that they can be used as chemical weapons. THE COST OF VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASE — Researchers estimate that adults in the U.S. who didn’t receive 10 recommended vaccines were responsible for about $7.1 billion in avoidable costs from doctors visits, hospitalizations and lost productivity. One example from the new Health Affairs paper: Just 42 percent of adults received the flu vaccine in the last flu season; influenza accounted for $5.79 billion in medical costs. More here. GENERIC DRUG MAKERS ACCUSED OF COLLUDING ON PRICE HIKES — Perrigo Company, Fougera Pharmaceuticals, Sandoz and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries are all accused of conspiring to raise and fix the price of the generic skin treatment, Desonide, in a class-action lawsuit filed last week by an employee health fund in the Southern District of New York. Shortly after two meetings attended by each of the companies in July 2013, the drug makers acted in concert to raise the price of generic Desonide, with some versions rising by as much as 800 percent. CATCHING OUR ATTENTION: GENERATION ADDERALL — Adderall, the drug prescribed to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, has become ubiquitous on college campuses, with sales exploding among adults to the tune of roughly 16 million prescriptions in 2013. But not much is known about the long-term effects of using the drug. Casey Schwartz, author of “In the Mind Fields,” shares her journey of how she broke free. The New York Times magazine. ** A message from The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA): How do preferred pharmacy plans save money for Medicare seniors?

(Stephen Mally/The Gazette) Vanessa Miller The Gazette More stories from Vanessa Oct 14, 2016 at 9:40 pm | Print View Nearly four months after retiring from Iowa State University, the institution’s longtime Senior Vice President Warren Madden still is on the job — sort of. He’s volunteering. The 77-year-old emeritus vice president who spent 50 years at Iowa State before retiring June 30 is working out of the ISU Research Park on several university projects, including real estate and land deals agreements with the City of Ames, and tenants in the 220-acre Research Park. Madden, who’s not the only top university administrator in Iowa to continue working after retirement, told The Gazette he’s not been involved with ISU Flight Service or a $4.4 million deal with the City of Ames to improve its airport — both of which he was involved with before retirement and both of which have come under public scrutiny of late. He said his volunteer work rather has focused on ISU land deals, reviewing and extending several park leases with the city, and implementing the Research Park master plan, including expanding its footprint and working with tenants who want to expand facilities there. “I know the individuals and have the historical background that is helpful,” Madden said. “There are a number of central Iowa business and ISU alumni that serve and volunteer time and their expertise, and I am now one of them.” “For me,” he said, “this is also a good transition.” Despite his retirement and assertion he’s no longer involved in the university’s flight service, Madden recently has been looped into publicity around Iowa State’s airport deal with Ames and ISU President Steven Leath’s use of university aircraft. Madden, while employed at Iowa State, oversaw its flight service operation, and a recent Associated Press report indicated he said policy bars personal use of university planes — a comment that came as ISU revealed Leath on four occasions flew ISU aircraft for trips involving university and personal business. The AP article also quoted Madden as saying the school would never let Leath “fly by himself one of our planes because of insurance and liability issues.” The report prompted Madden to pen a letter in the Iowa State Daily refuting the report. “To suggest that I believe that the travel described in the various news articles violated policy or state law is simply wrong,” Madden wrote. “I have no such belief. In fact, my understanding is directly opposite to this conclusion.” He added about reports that Leath wouldn’t be allowed to fly ISU planes by himself, “This is also not true.” Madden reiterated for The Gazette — despite his history with ISU Flight Service, past work on the airport upgrades, and comments about the recent controversy — he’s not been involved with those issues since retiring. “I have not been involved in the airport development work since June 30,” Madden said. “I’m out of the airport business.” Several projects Madden has been working on are due to go before the Board of Regents for approval next week, although ISU spokesman John McCarroll said Madden is not planning to present to the board. One such project involves an ISU request to lease a 31,280-square-foot warehouse to the Research Park for product manufacturing for one of its tenants — Merck and Company, Inc. “The university’s long range goal is to build a relationship with Merck, encouraging future growth and expansion, ultimately leading to the construction of a new dedicated facility at the Research Park for product manufacturing and research and development,” according to board documents. Even though Madden is no longer on the Iowa State payroll, he continues to use a university email account. He also remains on the Research Park board and has agreed to continue on the CyRide board, “as they complete a major route review this year.” Madden said he expects his work with Iowa State will transition into a more traditional alumni role — “being athletic fans and personal donors and volunteers with units like Reiman Gardens, University Museums, and the concert series.” “My past administrative responsibilities in these areas are personal interests, and we have shifted to being donors and volunteers,” he said. Madden pointed out he’s not the only former administrator to stick around and help out. Former university presidents have volunteered in different capacities over the years, and Madden said his predecessor, Wayne Moore, transitioned out in a similar way. So did Carl Hamilton, who served as ISU vice president for information and development from 1967 to 1984. At the University of Iowa, former hospitals director John Colloton was one emeritus administrator whose work beyond retirement drew attention. He served as director from 1958 to 2000, but The Gazette in 2007 reported he had a UI office, phone number, email account, and secretary who was paid $58,447. The university at that time refused to release his emails and correspondence because, officials said, he “no longer conducts university business.” More recently, former longtime Senior Vice President and Treasurer Doug True officially retired in January 2015 but continued working part-time in three areas for about a year after. He assisted with the university’s treasury function, its flood recovery, and its acquisition of the AIB College of Business campus in Des Moines. And, True told The Gazette, he got paid for that part-time work. But he hasn’t been on the payroll since the start of this year — although he does make himself available for consult with those who have taken over the work he did. “These are my friends,” True said, adding that if they need help understanding a decision he made in 1998, for example, “it’s always delightful, if I can remember, to help people have some context.” John Barnshaw, director of research and public policy for the American Association of University Professors, said university administrators willing to continue working on a volunteer basis after retirement can add value in a variety of capacities — including in their institutional knowledge, deep business relationships, alumni networking, and donor connections. His only concerns relate to transparency and potential conflicts of interest. He said past administrators conducting university business should do so with a university email account, and they should continue to avoid potential conflicts with any personal business. “But if you’re above board, and your transparent in what you’re doing, and it has the buy-in of the administration as well as the faculty … it could add value,” Barnshaw said.

The Asia-Pacific gastric cancer market is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.4% from $1.3 billion in 2015 to $2.7 billion in 2022. The current marketed products landscape comprises a wide range of treatment options, including HER2-targeted therapy, angiogenesis inhibitors and new chemotherapies. Nevertheless, significant unmet need remains for products that can treat HER2-negative gastric cancer patients. However, the gastric cancer market is undergoing a gradual change from a focus on generic chemotherapy regimens to a complex treatment landscape based on targeted therapies. In the current market, patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer can be treated with targeted therapies, such as Herceptin, while HER2-negative patients still receive chemotherapy regimens as the first-line treatment. The market will be driven by recently launched products and upcoming targeted therapies during the forecast period. The main restraints will be the low penetration of new targeted therapies, owing to their high price, and constrained healthcare budgets.
