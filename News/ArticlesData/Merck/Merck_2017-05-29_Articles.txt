Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck Receives FDA Approval of ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir), a New Once-Daily Option, in Combination with Other Antiretroviral Agents, for the Treatment of HIV-1 Infection in Appropriate Patients KENILWORTH, N.J.–( )–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ISENTRESS® HD, a new 1200 mg once-daily dose of the company’s integrase inhibitor, ISENTRESS® (raltegravir), to be administered orally as two 600 mg film-coated tablets with or without food, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults, and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg, who are treatment-naïve or whose virus has been suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg given twice daily. “ISENTRESS has been used as a component of treatment regimens for patients diagnosed with HIV-1 for almost a decade,” said Dr. Michael S. Saag, associate dean for global health, and director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. “The addition of a convenient once-daily version with a comparable efficacy and safety profile at 48 weeks to the existing twice-daily version of ISENTRESS provides physicians with a new therapeutic option for some patients with HIV-1 infection.” ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD do not cure HIV-1 infection or AIDS. Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develop and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely. For more information, see “Selected Safety Information” below. The FDA approval of once-daily ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) is supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 ONCEMRK trial. At Week 48, 89 percent (N=531) of treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once a day achieved viral suppression of HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL compared to 88 percent (N=266) of patients receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice a day, each in combination therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with a treatment difference of 0.5 percent, and a 95 percent confidence interval of -4.2, 5.2. This was consistent across demographic groups at initiation of therapy and a variety of patient populations, including those with high viral load (HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL). “Because of improvements in the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies and with appropriate access to care, HIV infection can now be managed as a chronic disease,” said Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute. “For people living with HIV, having a wide range of effective therapies is important because it provides options to fit patients’ individual needs and lifestyles.” In ONCEMRK, through 48 weeks, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was low (1 percent in patients receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily and 2 percent in patients receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily). There were no drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥2 percent of patients in either treatment group. Clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate, and severe) occurring in ≥2 percent of patients on ISENTRESS HD or ISENTRESS included abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Treatment-emergent viral mutations leading to any drug resistance were detected in less than 1 percent (4/531) of those treated with ISENTRESS HD once daily. ISENTRESS HD can be co-administered with a wide range of antiretroviral agents and non-antiretroviral agents. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. The co-administration of ISENTRESS HD with aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids, calcium carbonate antacids, rifampin, tipranavir/ritonavir, etravirine, and other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is not recommended. “ISENTRESS HD exemplifies Merck’s unwavering commitment to innovation in HIV therapy, and we are pleased to be able to offer this option to a broad range of appropriate adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg who are living with HIV,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, global clinical development, infectious diseases and vaccines, Merck Research Laboratories. The price of ISENTRESS HD will be the same as ISENTRESS twice daily. Merck anticipates ISENTRESS HD to be available in pharmacies in approximately four weeks. About ONCEMRK The ONCEMRK study is an ongoing Phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active comparator-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg, given as two 600 mg oral tablets, compared to twice-daily ISENTRESS 400 mg, each in combination therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in previously untreated adults with HIV-1 infection with HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL. The primary efficacy objective was the proportion of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 48. Selected Safety Information about ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) and ISENTRESS (raltegravir) Immune reconstitution syndrome can occur, including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. ISENTRESS chewable tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame, which may be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria. Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with drugs that induce uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir. Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other drugs may alter the plasma concentration of raltegravir. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. Co-administration or staggered administration of aluminum and/or magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids and ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD is not recommended. Co-administration of ISENTRESS HD with calcium carbonate antacids, tipranavir/ritonavir, or etravirine is also not recommended. During co-administration with rifampin, the recommended dosage of ISENTRESS in adults is 800 mg twice daily. Rifampin, a strong inducer of UGT1A1, reduces plasma concentrations of ISENTRESS. There are no data to guide co-administration of ISENTRESS with rifampin in patients below 18 years of age. Co-administration with rifampin is not recommended with ISENTRESS HD. The impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes on raltegravir is unknown (e.g., Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, and Phenytoin). Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with other strong inducers is not recommended. About ISENTRESS (raltegravir) Approved in 2007, ISENTRESS was the first integrase inhibitor developed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. ISENTRESS is one of the regimen options recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services – in combination with other antiretroviral agents – as a first-line therapy in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults. ISENTRESS chewable tablets and oral suspension, each in combination therapy, are approved to treat pediatric patients aged at least four weeks of age, and weighing less than 20 kg. ISENTRESS works by inhibiting the insertion of HIV-1 DNA into human DNA by the integrase enzyme and has demonstrated rapid antiviral activity. Inhibiting integrase from performing this essential function limits the ability of the virus to replicate and infect new cells. ISENTRESS is approved as part of combination therapy in 112 countries for treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients. ISENTRESS, in combination therapy, for use in children and adolescents with HIV-1 aged two years and older has also been approved for use in 69 countries, and ISENTRESS oral suspension for infants at least four weeks of age is approved for use in 33 countries. Selected Safety Information about ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) and ISENTRESS (raltegravir) Continued The most commonly reported (≥2 percent) drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity in treatment-naïve adult patients receiving ISENTRESS compared with efavirenz were headache (4 percent vs. 5 percent), insomnia (4 percent vs. 4 percent), nausea (3 percent vs. 4 percent), dizziness (2 percent vs. 6 percent), and fatigue (2 percent vs. 3 percent), respectively. The most commonly reported (≥2 percent) clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (Mild, Moderate, and Severe) in treatment-naïve adult patients receiving ISENTRESS HD compared with ISENTRESS through 48 weeks included abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Intensities were defined as follows: Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated); Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); or Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity). Grade 2–4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with ISENTRESS. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, or increased serum creatine kinase. There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263. Women infected with HIV-1 should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD due to the potential for HIV transmission.

ECHO Flight transports aid workers and medical supplies to Ebola outbreak in DRC, May 2017. European Commission/Flickr. Some rights reserved.Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the African subcontinent, Ebola strikes back. The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed that a new outbreak of the disease had occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on May 12th. On May 21st, it revealed that a fourth person – one of the 43 believed to have been affected and the 400 now being tracked as potential patients – was believed to have died as a result of the virus. However, unlike the chaos that surrounded the first Ebola outbreak, the authorities seem largely in control.  Despite the significant logistical challenge of getting the right medical help deep into the jungles of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Matshidiso Rebecca Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa says that she is “optimistic” that the outbreak can be halted quickly. She also notes that WHO Africa has learned lessons from the last outbreak to become a “more responsive, accountable, effective and transparent organization”.    And of course, this time, doctors are coming armed with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine candidate, developed by pharmaceutical giant Merck. The drug is slated to be 100% effective against one of the five strands of the virus and has demonstrated “compelling results” in previous trials, but it has not been licensed yet. Undeterred by this minor detail, the WHO has 300,000 doses on hand and Moeti has indicated that the WHO “could potentially mount a campaign within a week if all of the conditions are met and personnel, financing and logistics are in place.” And on May 23rd, the DRC submitted a formal vaccine trial protocol to an ethical review board, the first step towards deploying the vaccine.  A damp squib in the fight against Ebola? Recent reports have cast a long shadow over Merck’s vaccine. Indeed, the US National Academy of Medicine has challenged the methodology of the 4160-patient clinical trial and made the lukewarm statement that while the vaccine “most likely provides some protection to recipients,” the protection “could in reality be quite low”. Not only is the vaccine ineffective against four strands of the Ebola virus, but also it might be altogether useless on people with compromised immune systems (HIV positive) or pregnant women.  Beyond raising questions about the way treatments are developed for infectious diseases with public and private funds, rVSV-ZEBOV’s fate seems to parallel another boom-bust: the experimental drug ZMapp. Despite being one of the most sought-after drugs at the height of the Ebola crisis and seen by many as having already been responsible for saving lives, ZMapp has narrowly missed the statistical threshold that researchers have set to prove the drug’s effectiveness. For this reason, the authors of a study conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases concede that ZMapp has probably lost its chance to prove its worth as an Ebola treatment. Therefore, future clinical trials would be better off focusing on “one of a small number of other promising, but unproven, treatments that have emerged since the beginning of the recent crisis.”  Luckily, the Merck vaccine is just one of several candidates now in different phases of development. Among the most promising is GSK’s cAd3-ZEBOV vaccine, with the company touting “very encouraging” findings after the first tests, albeit with the caveat that it will only be available in the second half of 2018. And earlier in May, scientists at New York’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine have also indicated that they have identified two antibodies  – ADI-15878 and ADI-15742  – that they believe will be able to thwart the five known Ebola viruses.  Johnson and Johnson is developing a 2-dose vaccination approach, while China has also thrown down the gauntlet and is working on the Ad5-EBOV vaccine, based on work done by a Chinese military research unit. Another promising candidate comes from an unlikely source – Guinea. Russian scientists working in a medical research centre built by the aluminium company UC Rusal in the country have devised a vaccine, the Gam-Evak-Kombi, which claims to be 100% effective. After the recent Ebola outbreak in the DRC, Moscow started shipping the drug to Guinea in case the DRC outbreak expands. States to the rescue With so many vaccines in the works, one would be forgiven for thinking that the lessons of 2014, when Ebola claimed 11,000 lives, were learned. In actuality, up until 2014, treating such diseases had usually been the remit of national governments  - like the US, Canada, the UK, China or Russia - as the scale of previous outbreaks of infectious diseases was never sufficient to justify billions being invested by profit-driven private pharmaceutical companies.  And Ebola isn’t going to be the health challenge that leads them to change their ways. Writing in The Independent, Oxford University’s Professor Adrian Hill observes that there was never a real business case for the Ebola vaccine “because of the nature of the outbreak…because of the number of people likely to be affected was, until now, thought to be very small and [because] the people affected are in some of the poorest countries in the world and can't afford to pay for a new vaccine."  In short, thousands died due to a “market failure”, as the WHO’s outgoing Director Margaret Chan, once said. This is borne out by the fact that the work to create a vaccine actually started 10 years ago. But the research stalled at the Phase One clinical trial juncture due to a lack of funding. Only when the recent outbreak started did interest in the vaccine resurface.  Western governments need to realise that to completely rely on the for-profit pharmaceutical sector to drive the process to develop vaccines is to accept that only drugs that have a lucrative market will ever be developed. As the Ebola crisis proved, this is disastrous for public health. Governments need to change their approach and understand they need to invest significantly larger sums in prevention and vaccines. The pharma sector won’t change, so they will have to.

Merck’s commitment to infectious diseases For more than 80 years, Merck has contributed to the discovery and development of novel medicines and vaccines to combat infectious diseases. In addition to a combined portfolio of antibiotic and antifungal medicines, vaccines, and medicines for HIV and HCV, Merck has multiple programs that span discovery through late-stage development. Merck currently has nine compounds in Phase 2/Phase 3 clinical trials for the potential treatment or prevention of infectious diseases. About ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) ZERBAXA is an antibacterial combination product for intravenous infusion consisting of the cephalosporin antibacterial drug ceftolozane sulfate and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam sodium. ZERBAXA is approved in the United States and is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by the following Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ZERBAXA used in combination with metronidazole is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus salivarius. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZERBAXA and other antibacterial drugs, ZERBAXA should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Important Safety Information about ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) Patients with renal impairment: Decreased efficacy of ZERBAXA has been observed in patients with baseline CrCl of 30 to ≤50 mL/min. In a clinical trial, patients with cIAIs with CrCl >50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 85.2% when treated with ZERBAXA plus metronidazole vs. 87.9% when treated with meropenem. In the same trial, patients with CrCl 30 to ≤50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 47.8% when treated with ZERBAXA plus metronidazole vs. 69.2% when treated with meropenem. A similar trend was also seen in the cUTI trial. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dose of ZERBAXA accordingly. Hypersensitivity: ZERBAXA is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to ceftolozane/tazobactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, or other members of the beta-lactam class. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials. Before initiating therapy with ZERBAXA, make careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. If an anaphylactic reaction to ZERBAXA occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD), ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. Development of drug-resistant bacteria: Prescribing ZERBAXA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients were headache (5.8%) in the cUTI trial, and nausea (7.9%), diarrhea (6.2%) and pyrexia (5.6%) in the cIAI trial.

Merck’s commitment to infectious diseases For more than 80 years, Merck has contributed to the discovery and development of novel medicines and vaccines to combat infectious diseases. In addition to a combined portfolio of antibiotic and antifungal medicines, vaccines, and medicines for HIV and HCV, Merck has multiple programs that span discovery through late-stage development. Merck currently has nine compounds in Phase 2/Phase 3 clinical trials for the potential treatment or prevention of infectious diseases. About ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) ZERBAXA is an antibacterial combination product for intravenous infusion consisting of the cephalosporin antibacterial drug ceftolozane sulfate and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam sodium. ZERBAXA is approved in the United States and is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by the following Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ZERBAXA used in combination with metronidazole is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus salivarius. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZERBAXA and other antibacterial drugs, ZERBAXA should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Important Safety Information about ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) Patients with renal impairment: Decreased efficacy of ZERBAXA has been observed in patients with baseline CrCl of 30 to ≤50 mL/min. In a clinical trial, patients with cIAIs with CrCl >50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 85.2% when treated with ZERBAXA plus metronidazole vs. 87.9% when treated with meropenem. In the same trial, patients with CrCl 30 to ≤50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 47.8% when treated with ZERBAXA plus metronidazole vs. 69.2% when treated with meropenem. A similar trend was also seen in the cUTI trial. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dose of ZERBAXA accordingly. Hypersensitivity: ZERBAXA is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to ceftolozane/tazobactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, or other members of the beta-lactam class. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials. Before initiating therapy with ZERBAXA, make careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. If an anaphylactic reaction to ZERBAXA occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD), ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

Merck’s commitment to infectious diseases For more than 80 years, Merck has contributed to the discovery and development of novel medicines and vaccines to combat infectious diseases. In addition to a combined portfolio of antibiotic and antifungal medicines, vaccines, and medicines for HIV and HCV, Merck has multiple programs that span discovery through late-stage development. Merck currently has nine compounds in Phase 2/Phase 3 clinical trials for the potential treatment or prevention of infectious diseases. About ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) ZERBAXA is an antibacterial combination product for intravenous infusion consisting of the cephalosporin antibacterial drug ceftolozane sulfate and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam sodium. ZERBAXA is approved in the United States and is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by the following Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ZERBAXA used in combination with metronidazole is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus salivarius. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZERBAXA and other antibacterial drugs, ZERBAXA should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Important Safety Information about ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) Patients with renal impairment: Decreased efficacy of ZERBAXA has been observed in patients with baseline CrCl of 30 to ≤50 mL/min. In a clinical trial, patients with cIAIs with CrCl >50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 85.2% when treated with ZERBAXA plus metronidazole vs. 87.9% when treated with meropenem. In the same trial, patients with CrCl 30 to ≤50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 47.8% when treated with ZERBAXA plus metronidazole vs. 69.2% when treated with meropenem. A similar trend was also seen in the cUTI trial. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dose of ZERBAXA accordingly. Hypersensitivity: ZERBAXA is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to ceftolozane/tazobactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, or other members of the beta-lactam class. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials. Before initiating therapy with ZERBAXA, make careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. If an anaphylactic reaction to ZERBAXA occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD), ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. Development of drug-resistant bacteria: Prescribing ZERBAXA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients were headache (5.8%) in the cUTI trial, and nausea (7.9%), diarrhea (6.2%) and pyrexia (5.6%) in the cIAI trial. About Merck For more than a century, Merck, a leading global biopharmaceutical company known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, has been inventing for life, bringing forward medicines and vaccines for many of the world’s most challenging diseases. Through our prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products, we work with customers and operate in more than 140 countries to deliver innovative health solutions. We also demonstrate our commitment to increasing access to health care through far-reaching policies, programs and partnerships. Today, Merck continues to be at the forefront of research to advance the prevention and treatment of diseases that threaten people and communities around the world – including cancer, cardio-metabolic diseases, emerging animal diseases, Alzheimer’s disease and infectious diseases including HIV and Ebola.

These new jobs will be created at the company’s bases in Cork and Carlow in a €280m investment by MSD. While jobs have not been created in the animal health division itself, which is based in Dublin, the move will boost overall company operations and add to the individual site regions – in rural Co. Cork and on the outskirts of Carlow town respectively. Over 200 new employees will be hired in the MSD plant in Brinny, Co. Cork, which works on medicines for lung cancer, melanoma, hepatitis C and rheumatoid arthritis. Meanwhile, a further 120 recruits will be brought in at the company’s Carlow plant, which is a manufacturing site and, according to MSD, “the company’s first stand-alone vaccine and biologics facility outside the US”. The firm, with headquarters in the USA, will bring its total number of employees up to more than 1,900 with the move. This move is designed to meet the increased global demand for MSD’s medicines and vaccines produced in Ireland, according to the company. There will be various types of jobs created such as biochemistry, biology, engineering, technical, quality and operations roles. MSD has a current workforce over 1,600 people in Ireland with plants in Dublin, Cork, Carlow and Tipperary. Its Irish operations had a turnover of €4.7 billion in 2016. MSD creates common farm vaccines such as Bovilis BVD, Bovilis IBR Marker, Blackleg Vaccine and Bovivac S. It also produces a range of animal antibiotics and pour-ons. Sanat Chattopadhyay, MSD Executive Vice President and President of MSD’s Manufacturing Division, spoke at the announcement of the move, stating: “Today’s announcement is a reflection of MSD Ireland’s positive standing in our global network, a vote of confidence in our people and their work, and a sign of MSD’s future commitment to Ireland. The expansion of our presence in Ireland is a testament to the talent of our Irish employees. In recent years our Irish businesses have played an increasingly important role in the production of some of MSD’s most important breakthrough medicines for the global market. Minster for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Mary Mitchell O’Connor, welcomed the move and the locations chosen, noting: “It is particularly gratifying that this expansion and additional job creation will take place in two regional locations, thereby strengthening the government’s efforts to ensure balanced industrial development around the country.” Related Stories Zurich seeking candidates with farming experience for insurance apprenticeship Read More From Agri-Business Job creation Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation MSD MSD Animal Health Vaccines Connect With Us Hide Comments Please be considerate of others when commenting.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck Receives FDA Approval of ISENTRESS® HD (raltegravir), a New Once-Daily Option, in Combination with Other Antiretroviral Agents, for the Treatment of HIV-1 Infection in Appropriate Patients KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ISENTRESS® HD, a new 1200 mg once-daily dose of the company’s integrase inhibitor, ISENTRESS® (raltegravir), to be administered orally as two 600 mg film-coated tablets with or without food, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults, and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg, who are treatment-naïve or whose virus has been suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg given twice daily. “ISENTRESS has been used as a component of treatment regimens for patients diagnosed with HIV-1 for almost a decade,” said Dr. Michael S. Saag, associate dean for global health, and director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. “The addition of a convenient once-daily version with a comparable efficacy and safety profile at 48 weeks to the existing twice-daily version of ISENTRESS provides physicians with a new therapeutic option for some patients with HIV-1 infection.” ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD do not cure HIV-1 infection or AIDS. Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develop and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely. For more information, see “Selected Safety Information” below. The FDA approval of once-daily ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) is supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 ONCEMRK trial. At Week 48, 89 percent (N=531) of treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once a day achieved viral suppression of HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL compared to 88 percent (N=266) of patients receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice a day, each in combination therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with a treatment difference of 0.5 percent, and a 95 percent confidence interval of -4.2, 5.2. This was consistent across demographic groups at initiation of therapy and a variety of patient populations, including those with high viral load (HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL). “Because of improvements in the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies and with appropriate access to care, HIV infection can now be managed as a chronic disease,” said Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute. “For people living with HIV, having a wide range of effective therapies is important because it provides options to fit patients’ individual needs and lifestyles.” In ONCEMRK, through 48 weeks, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was low (1 percent in patients receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily and 2 percent in patients receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily). There were no drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥2 percent of patients in either treatment group. Clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate, and severe) occurring in ≥2 percent of patients on ISENTRESS HD or ISENTRESS included abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Treatment-emergent viral mutations leading to any drug resistance were detected in less than 1 percent (4/531) of those treated with ISENTRESS HD once daily. ISENTRESS HD can be co-administered with a wide range of antiretroviral agents and non-antiretroviral agents. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. The co-administration of ISENTRESS HD with aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids, calcium carbonate antacids, rifampin, tipranavir/ritonavir, etravirine, and other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is not recommended. “ISENTRESS HD exemplifies Merck’s unwavering commitment to innovation in HIV therapy, and we are pleased to be able to offer this option to a broad range of appropriate adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg who are living with HIV,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, global clinical development, infectious diseases and vaccines, Merck Research Laboratories. The price of ISENTRESS HD will be the same as ISENTRESS twice daily. Merck anticipates ISENTRESS HD to be available in pharmacies in approximately four weeks. About ONCEMRK The ONCEMRK study is an ongoing Phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active comparator-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg, given as two 600 mg oral tablets, compared to twice-daily ISENTRESS 400 mg, each in combination therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in previously untreated adults with HIV-1 infection with HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL. The primary efficacy objective was the proportion of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 48. Selected Safety Information about ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) and ISENTRESS (raltegravir) Immune reconstitution syndrome can occur, including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. ISENTRESS chewable tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame, which may be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria. Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with drugs that induce uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir. Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other drugs may alter the plasma concentration of raltegravir. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. Co-administration or staggered administration of aluminum and/or magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids and ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD is not recommended. Co-administration of ISENTRESS HD with calcium carbonate antacids, tipranavir/ritonavir, or etravirine is also not recommended. During co-administration with rifampin, the recommended dosage of ISENTRESS in adults is 800 mg twice daily. Rifampin, a strong inducer of UGT1A1, reduces plasma concentrations of ISENTRESS. There are no data to guide co-administration of ISENTRESS with rifampin in patients below 18 years of age. Co-administration with rifampin is not recommended with ISENTRESS HD. The impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes on raltegravir is unknown (e.g., Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, and Phenytoin). Co-administration of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD with other strong inducers is not recommended. About ISENTRESS (raltegravir) Approved in 2007, ISENTRESS was the first integrase inhibitor developed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. ISENTRESS is one of the regimen options recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services – in combination with other antiretroviral agents – as a first-line therapy in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults. ISENTRESS chewable tablets and oral suspension, each in combination therapy, are approved to treat pediatric patients aged at least four weeks of age, and weighing less than 20 kg. ISENTRESS works by inhibiting the insertion of HIV-1 DNA into human DNA by the integrase enzyme and has demonstrated rapid antiviral activity. Inhibiting integrase from performing this essential function limits the ability of the virus to replicate and infect new cells. ISENTRESS is approved as part of combination therapy in 112 countries for treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients. ISENTRESS, in combination therapy, for use in children and adolescents with HIV-1 aged two years and older has also been approved for use in 69 countries, and ISENTRESS oral suspension for infants at least four weeks of age is approved for use in 33 countries. Selected Safety Information about ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) and ISENTRESS (raltegravir) Continued The most commonly reported (≥2 percent) drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity in treatment-naïve adult patients receiving ISENTRESS compared with efavirenz were headache (4 percent vs. 5 percent), insomnia (4 percent vs. 4 percent), nausea (3 percent vs. 4 percent), dizziness (2 percent vs. 6 percent), and fatigue (2 percent vs. 3 percent), respectively. The most commonly reported (≥2 percent) clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (Mild, Moderate, and Severe) in treatment-naïve adult patients receiving ISENTRESS HD compared with ISENTRESS through 48 weeks included abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Intensities were defined as follows: Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated); Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); or Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity). Grade 2–4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with ISENTRESS. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, or increased serum creatine kinase. There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263. Women infected with HIV-1 should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD due to the potential for HIV transmission.

Image: Luke Maxwell How can you make your career matter? Spend it saving lives by Kirsty Tobin 5 days ago16 Shares For most people, it’s hard to know how to make a career worthwhile. In biopharma, it’s a little easier: you’re saving lives. This morning (30 May), pharma giant MSD announced 330 new jobs as part of a €280m investment in Ireland. That investment will see sites in Cork and Carlow expanding production facilities and capacity to meet global demand for medicines and vaccines. Speaking at the announcement, the executive VP of MSD, Sanat Chattopadhyay, said: “The expansion of our presence in Ireland is a testament to the talent of our Irish employees.” While specific roles were not announced, current openings at the sites include technical, engineering, biochemistry, biology, quality and operations positions. But why should someone want to pursue one of these roles? We’ve all been there. After a tough week in work, we ask ourselves: ‘Is it all worth it? Am I making any difference at all?’ For those working in biopharma, that question is a little less nebulous. Every day, they’re helping to save people. At a National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT) event in April of this year, we caught up with Gary Collins, director of operations for biologics at MSD, to talk about what makes biopharma a great sector to work in. “Personally, I’ve got to work on two life-saving drugs,” said Collins. Collins spoke about Keytruda, a cancer treatment drug that is manufactured at MSD’s Irish operations. “There was a huge buzz about getting the drug to the patients, supporting the early-access programme, and then seeing it launched … and knowing that what we do helps save people’s lives.” From another (arguably more cynical) point of view, a career in biopharma can also mean long-term job security and stability, as the sector goes from strength to strength in Ireland. “In recent years, our Irish businesses have played an increasingly important role in the production of some of MSD’s most important breakthrough medicines for the global market,” Chattopadhyay said of the announcement earlier today. This central role translates to continued growth in the Irish biopharma market, as hubs in Cork and Galway experience a heavy influx of FDI. This places MSD – and its talent – in great company, and the future is looking good.

One term that may well become more familiar is deception technology. It's a small but growing field that has sparked the interest of some of the largest multinational companies. Israeli startup illusive networks, which is the way they spell it - no capital letters for a deception technology firm, and Germany-based pharmaceutical and life sciences company Merck KGaA, Tuesday announced a deal for the use of illusive's "Deception Everywhere" cybersecurity technology. Merck, a company with over $15 billion in net sales last year, has an extensive network to protect that stretches across six continents and has intellectual property worth millions. A 2015 Ponemon Institute study found that together with the financial services industry, pharmaceutical companies suffer the highest cost from data breaches. Companies such as illusive don't come into play at the first, most basic level of defenses against cyber threats, explains Merck's Branden Newman, head of business technology security. "The idea is that if an advanced attacker makes it past these standardized controls, there is a next level of protection that really protects our crown jewels," says Newman, who used to work for the U.S. Army Cyber Command. This level is where illusive fits in, as well as on the level of the continuous monitoring the system undergoes. Illusive networks is the first company to come out of Israel's team8, the cybersecurity startup incubator set up by of veterans of the Israeli military's Unit 8200, says illusive's founder and CEO Ofer Israeli. He explains that the deception technology developed by illusive is really attractive to high-risk clients, like those in the financial services and pharmaceutical industries "The types of attacks that we are catching and that we have been built to mitigate are really those low probability high-impact attacks. The ones that won't hit you every day but when they do hit you it can go to tens and hundreds of millions of dollars," says Israeli. The value of the deal has not been disclosed but Merck's Newman says that the extra layer of protection afforded by illusive does not come at a huge price. "Monetarily it's a relatively a low investment compared to the overall the security portfolio." That's partly because deception technology is not yet as widespread as more standardized cybersecurity solutions. Gartner research estimates that by next year one in ten companies will deploy deception technology and various reports estimate the market for it by 2021 to be between $1.33 billion and $1.7 billion. There are several reasons why Merck went for illusive over two or three other candidates, says Newman. Among those are the Israeli technology's "proactive approach" and "ease of deployment" that obviates the need for a mass install across Merck's systems. He likens the technology to a corridor with lots of doors. If attackers enter the corridor, they don't know which door to go through and if they even lightly jar one, the system is alerted. Merck keeps a close tab on Israeli cybersecurity startups, says Newman. "We have a very close connection to the U.S. startup scene but we also do keep an eye on the Israeli startup scene, particularly in the cybersecurity area because they have a very strong cybersecurity startup scene." In the meantime, illusive has spread its wings beyond Israel, especially in terms of sales and marketing, says Ofer Israeli. "From an R&D perspective, Israel is a perfect fit. For sales and marketing there's a much clearer fit in other portions of the world such as the United States," says Israeli. The company has gathered more than $30 million from early investors, including Microsoft Ventures, Cisco, Citi Ventures and NEA.

The jobs will be created as part of a €280 million investment over the next three years. MSD – which trades as Merck in the US and Canada – is a pharmaceutical giant which develops new treatments and therapies for patients. The company said its two manufacturing sites in Cork and Carlow are important links in its global chain of plants.

The plant in Brinny, Co Cork is for the development, testing and manufacturing of biologics, specialising in the fermentation, purification and sterile filling of biotech products. The over 200 new staff will work on this site, developing medicines for lung cancer, melanoma, hepatitis C and rheumatoid arthritis. In Carlow, 120 jobs will be created in the state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. Jobs on offer will include technical, engineering, biochemistry, biology, quality and operations positions. Commenting on the investment, Jobs Minister Mary Mitchell O’Connor said that she “warmly welcomed” the announcement. “MSD has been at the cutting edge of bio pharmaceutical innovation over recent years and their Irish operations are at the heart of many of the company’s exciting new products,” she said. MSD currently employs over 1,600 people across four sites in Ireland – in Carlow, Cork, Dublin and Tipperary. It’s Irish operations had a turnover of €.7 billion in 2016.

The pharma giant – which trades as Merck in North America – unveiled its three-year plans for two of its Irish manufacturing sites this morning. The new jobs come as a result of increased global demand for MSD’s medicines and vaccines produced in Ireland, while the investment will see both sites expand production facilities and capacity to meet that demand.  Available roles at the sites include technical, engineering, biochemistry, biology, quality and operations positions. The announcement was welcomed by the Minster for Jobs, Enterprise & Innovation, Mary Mitchell O’Connor, who addressed over 1,200 senior MSD business leaders from 50 countries, gathered in Dublin for MSD’s annual EMEAC (Europe, Middle East, Africa & Canada) Congress. MSD in Brinny, Co Cork, is an integrated site for the development, testing and manufacturing of biologics, specialising in the fermentation, purification and sterile filling of biotech products. More than 200 new hires will be needed to meet demand for its work on some of the company's important treatments – medicines for lung cancer, melanoma, hepatitis C and rheumatoid arthritis.  MSD in Carlow, which is the company’s first standalone vaccine and biologics facility outside the US, plans to create 120 new roles. Minister Mitchell O'Connor said: "MSD has been at the cutting edge of bio pharmaceutical innovation over recent years and their Irish operations are at the heart of many of the company's exciting new products. "It is particularly gratifying that this expansion and additional job creation will take place in two regional locations, thereby strengthening the Government's efforts to ensure balanced industrial development around the country.” Sanat Chattopadhyay, MSD executive vice president andpresident of MSD’s manufacturing division, said: "The expansion of our presence in Ireland is a testament to the talent of our Irish employees. In recent years our Irish businesses have played an increasingly important role in the production of some of MSD’s most important breakthrough medicines for the global market.” Ger Brennan, managing director of MSD Human Health in Ireland, said: "Today, our Irish sites are involved in the production of over 50% of MSD’s global top 20 products, exporting to over 60 countries worldwide and helping lead the development of new life-changing medicines for patients, including MSD’s new treatments for cancer and hepatitis C.” MSD currently employs over 1,600 people across four sites in Ireland – in Carlow, Cork, Dublin and Tipperary. Its extensive Irish operations, encompassing manufacturing, commercial, global financial services and marketing facilities, had a turnover of €4.7 billion in 2016. The Carlow and Cork bases serve as important links in MSD’s global network of manufacturing plants. It maintains headquarters for the company and manufacturing division in the US. 7:33 30 May 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 5 days ago 4 Related articles Some chemotherapy treatments deferred over drug shortages Ireland moves up the pharma food-chain Eli Lilly pushing ahead with €200m Kinsale plans Pharmacists urge Government to allow them to provide more services most popular latest sport #PornWeek: The A to Z - by way of XXX - of pornography London mayor has "more important things to do" than respond to Trump tweets GALLERY: GAA Championship Round-Up 'I would consider it if Madrid made an offer:' Eden Hazard site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

Image: Still Life Photography/Shutterstock Dr Barry Heavey remembers one man’s big bet on attracting inward investment for a then early-stage biopharmaceutical manufacturing project in the 1980s, which Ireland has paid back many times over. Despite his unassuming nature, Sean Ward can lay claim to being one of the founding fathers of the burgeoning Irish biotech cluster, which has seen more than €10bn in new investment in the last 10 years and is forecast to add 5,000 new jobs in the coming years in Ireland. The basis for my assertion dates back to the time that Sean worked with IDA Ireland in the early 1980s, when he and his team in IDA was instrumental in winning the first biotech investment from Schering-Plough (now MSD) in 1983. Schering was so impressed with Sean, they hired him and he served in a variety of roles in the US and Ireland, including director of manufacturing and strategic operations, until he retired in 2000. Trailblazer investment The success of Schering’s investment in Brinny, Co Cork was hugely significant in establishing Ireland as a location of choice for biotech investment. It was a trailblazer investment at precisely the time when the biotech revolution was taking off globally, and put Ireland firmly on the map in the sector. The success of that initial investment created a reputation for Ireland that would result in massive additional investment from companies such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson (J&J), Bristol-Myers Squibb, Shire, MSD, Regeneron, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Alexion, Sanofi, GE and Allergan in subsequent decades. Given Sean’s key role in both initially winning that investment while in IDA, and his role in making it a success in Schering, I was keen to talk to him to learn more about his experiences and insights. Irish ambition Sean grew up in the 1950s, and he describes Ireland of the time as “bleak”, with a pervasive view that the country would not develop a strong industry base because it had no coal and iron deposits. He saw first-hand how many schoolmates were effectively left with no choice but to emigrate. “It really used to break my heart because I knew guys who were bright, who, if they had been given the chance, were capable of a great deal more than that,” he says. This experience shaped his thinking. After working with the Electricity Supply Board, he moved to ICI in the UK, and of this time he said, “While I enjoyed my time in the UK and learned a huge amount there, I always felt that I would have liked to have a life that didn’t coerce me into being an emigrant.” His role in ICI allowed him to return to Dublin in the early ’70s, where he started to notice what the then-Industrial Development Authority (now IDA) was doing to grow and attract industry in Ireland, and applied for a job there. “I took a 20pc drop in pay and had to give up my company car to join the IDA,” he recalls, “but I was delighted. I was working with a bunch of people who shared my attitude about doing the best for our country. We worked very well as a team, calling each other up in the evenings with advice and guidance on opportunities and challenges that were arising as we dealt with companies visiting Ireland on site visits. We weren’t paid overtime nor were we paid for our phone calls, but we felt compelled.” Cultivating relationships Sean was just a year in that role when he was selected to move to Chicago in 1973 with his family. “I was delighted to be in the front line, representing Ireland with clients. I felt I was pretty well equipped to cultivate relationships and I had some great wins during the six years I spent there,” he says. The companies he attracted to Ireland included Eli Lilly in Cork, Thermo King in Galway and Bausch & Lomb in Waterford. ‘I knew Ireland had plenty of brain power and I had a missionary zeal about harnessing that to ensure we had a chance to partake in the biotech revolution’ – SEAN WARD In 1979, a vacancy came up for a promotion in Dublin to lead the IDA’s pharmaceutical and healthcare sector. He returned to find a significantly expanded organisation with almost 800 people. “It was an exciting time because one of my clients, Lilly, had just collaborated with an upstart biotech company called Genentech to develop the first biotech product: insulin. The biotech revolution was dependent on brain power, not coal or iron deposits. I knew Ireland had plenty of brain power and I had a missionary zeal about harnessing that to ensure we had a chance to partake in the biotech revolution.” The catalyst In 1982, Sean organised a meeting in IDA’s HQ on the theme of biotech, and invited all the relevant academics from Irish universities in Dublin, Cork and Galway. “I felt that biotech represented a huge opportunity and called the meeting to make the point that the biotech sector was burgeoning and could be a catalyst for significant industrial development in Ireland,” he recalls. “My goal was to bring together the multidisciplinary skills that are essential for biotech – such as science, biochemistry and engineering – and ask the Government to commit £5m to £6m to pull together expertise.” Government funding Despite a huge response to this initiative, it wasn’t entirely successful, primarily because of the amount of disagreement between the academics, which Sean found quite disheartening. “Mistrust and mutual suspicion around the table was palpable and I even had to clarify that I wasn’t related to one of the academics!” Eventually, the Irish Government approved £4m in biotech funding. But, as Sean describes it, this money “was split across every point of the compass, which was all but useless”. Sean is glad to hear that the Government has more recently committed substantive funding to biotech, and created a centre of excellence in the form of the National Institute for Bioprocess Research and Training (NIBRT). Sean Ward, the father of the Irish biotech cluster. Image: IDA Ireland Back to the early ’80s, Sean was targeting Schering-Plough, which had an active biotech R&D pipeline. “In particular, I built a relationship with John Nine, who was the senior VP in Schering-Plough at the time. We were facing severe competition from alternative locations, with Puerto Rico being particularly competitive at the time, but we positioned Ireland as a location with an extremely talented and highly educated, English-speaking workforce. We also had to act quickly and decisively in offering grant support to win the project – concrete evidence of support from IDA – and win it we did.” Expansion Such was the strength of Sean’s relationship with John Nine that he was offered a role in Schering in 1983. “I took it because it was a bloody good offer, so I dispensed with all the niceties and notions of patriotic endeavour!” Sean was based in Brinny from 1983 to 1985 when the site was doing pilot production for its key biotech pipeline asset, Intron A. “I cut my teeth there when we had less than 100 people. I then moved to the role of director of manufacturing and strategic planning based in New Jersey and with significant time in other sites such as Puerto Rico and Memphis.” He was based in the US until 1991, when Intron A was approved by the FDA, and he was sent back to Brinny as the site underwent an enormous expansion for commercial production. Academic engagement The big challenge facing Sean was in recruiting people with relevant knowledge and experience. As he puts it: “Experienced biochemists were not hanging out of trees!” Again, he worked closely with the local universities, engaging with their international alumni and sponsoring the first MSc in biotech in Galway. “I persuaded Schering to support some lecturers and the quid pro quo was that the academics would come out and liaise with our scientists and help us build a pipeline of suitably trained graduates. Not all of these interactions were successful – one lecturer felt we were impinging on their academic independence – but in general, we built up strong relationships with the universities and built a strong team in Brinny. I’ve always had the view that you will never see it on a balance sheet but the capability of the staff is the key success factor in any business, and we had that in abundance in Brinny.” ‘You will never see it on a balance sheet but the capability of the staff is the key success factor in any business, and we had that in abundance in Brinny’ – SEAN WARD Brinny then became the postgraduate training centre for people who went on to other biotech sites in Ireland such as the Wyeth (now Pfizer) Grange Castle facility, and J&J and Lilly facilities in Cork. “I’m proud that we blazed the trail and helped to prove that Ireland could build and sustain such a successful cluster of biotech manufacturers,” is how Sean sums up his work. Sean also pays tribute to the “very positive” attitude of people in Schering, such as John Nine, to IDA and Ireland. “I know that Schering’s positive experience and endorsements helped in convincing other companies to establish their biotech operations in Ireland. It was my job to ensure that that relationship between Schering and IDA stayed strong and that any issues that might arise were flagged to IDA and dealt with as soon as possible. Minimising bureaucracy and being responsive was key to maintaining a strong partnership.” Ongoing opportunities Looking forward, Sean sees huge opportunities to win investment in areas such as research and innovation, and he believes investing in these areas will attract companies. But he warns: “We shouldn’t underestimate how difficult this will be because the international competition is intense. We have to put enough bait on the hook to attract in companies, and we have to place a few bets on a few long shots.” Sean Ward had a passion for his country and a vision that Ireland could use the natural resource it had in abundance – talent – to win in a revolutionary new area of technology. He convinced IDA to take a big leap of faith in trying to attract the first biotech investment in the early 1980s when the technology was relatively nascent. He can be enormously proud of his achievement with that investment and the ripple effect it has had in the Irish economy since then.

UCC economics lecturer Declan Jordan said the decision by Merck — which is known as MSD in Europe — to invest €280m in its manufacturing bases in Cork and Carlow was evidence that fear of Mr Trump’s protectionist rhetoric was overblown. Mr Jordan said the creation of 210 jobs in Cork and 120 in Carlow by MSD Ireland showed it was back to business as usual in Europe for multinationals who saw Ireland as a gateway to the continent.  MSD Ireland has 500 employed in Brinny and has been one of the area’s biggest employers for 35 years. Fellow pharma giant Eli Lilly recently confirmed it would be proceeding with a €200m expansion near Kinsale, having put it on hold in the direct aftermath of Mr Trump’s election to the White House — a sign fears had subsided, Mr Jordan said. However, he warned that Mr Macron could upset the apple cart for foreign direct investment in Ireland if he pursued the implementation of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), which aims to share out the spoils of European corporation tax.  The CCCTB proposal has faced fierce resistance in Ireland, with leaders insisting it could cost the country 50% of its current corporation tax base. Mr Jordan said: “We are not overly reliant on foreign direct investment but it is a very important part of our economy. We tend to go over the top when we hear rhetoric such as that from Mr Trump.  "However, he is just another factor we have to contend with and I am confident we can overcome that. I am more wary of Mr Macron. The CCCTB is a bigger risk than Mr Trump.” Mr Jordan said it was important the Government “did not rest on its laurels and become complacent” as the threat of Brexit loomed. There was more good news on the jobs front as outdoor clothing firm Regatta Great Outdoors announced 100 jobs in Dublin, Galway, and Waterford. The jobs will be filled in the next 12 months. In Sligo, global healthcare company Abbott will relocate its Irish nutritional devices business from its existing base to a new, purpose-built IDA Ireland advance technology building.  The move will see a combined investment of almost €10m and will join manufacturing and business support within one building. “The good and bad times go in natural cycles,” said Mr Jordan.  “It may be lots of job announcements and investments today, which is fantastic — but it was job losses in recent years. The important thing is to not get carried away by either and make sure we take our opportunities when they come, especially in relation to Brexit. I maintain there is lots of opportunity for Ireland in relation to Brexit.” Newly elected Cork Chamber president Bill O’Connell said the MSD announcement was evidence that Cork was still a destination par excellence for the pharma industry. “We have a unique business environment, exceptional quality of life and highly educated workforce, and we work hard to ensure that this is furthered and maintained,” he said.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Wednesday that it could not recommend routine use of the medicine in newly diagnosed patients, given the drug's high cost and uncertainties about overall survival benefits. But the agency backed Keytruda use within the Cancer Drugs Fund, signalling that it had the potential to satisfy the criteria for routine use on the National Health Service (NHS) for this group of patients but needs more investigation. The decision follows data presented at a medical meeting last year showing that Keytruda could help lung cancer patients whose tumours have a high level of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. Keytruda is already approved as a cost-effective second-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have previously taken chemotherapy but no longer respond. MSD, as Merck is known outside North America, has agreed to provide Keytruda to the NHS at an undisclosed discount.

Adult vaccines, on the other hand, are expected to expand at a 13.2% CAGR from 2016 to 2024. Based on product, the pneumococcal segment accounted for the majority share in in 2015, with the hepatitis segment exhibiting strong growth during the forecast period. On basis of vaccine type, the conjugate vaccines segment accounted for the majority share in the global human vaccines market in 2015. On the other hand, the combination vaccines segment is expected to expand at an outstanding CAGR from 2016 to 2024. By distribution channel, the hospital pharmacies segment led the global human vaccines market. However, the drugstores segment is projected to expand at a considerable pace through 2024. Geographically, North America dominates the global human vaccines market and is estimated to reach a value of US$28.0 bn by 2024. Asia Pacific is the most promising market for human vaccines and is expected to expand at a high CAGR of 12.5% during the forecast period. Minimal Side Effects of Vaccines Bolstering Large-scale Adoption An extremely low risk of serious and fatal side effects associated with vaccines is one of the primary factors driving the market for human vaccines around the world. Similar to other drugs, vaccines are associated with a few side effects; however, most of the times, these are rather mild. Soreness, swelling, redness at the site of injection, fever, rash, or itchiness are the most common side effects of vaccines. Several healthcare organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US FDA, the American Medical Association (AMA), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend the use of vaccines owing to their safety. Complementing this factor is the growing awareness among patients and the general population regarding the benefits of vaccination. This can be attributed to a rise in awareness programs by government, private, and not-for-profit organizations. “The celebration of the National Immunization Awareness Month in the month of August in the U.S., for instance, is a great way of spreading awareness and getting more people to opt for vaccination,” the author of the report states. Request a sample of this report to know what opportunities will emerge in the rapidly evolving Human Vaccines Market by 2024: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… High Costs Deterring Market Growth Strict regulatory requirements is a major hurdle for most players in the global human vaccines market. In addition to this, high costs pose a significant challenge. “The discovery and development of new vaccines require immense capital. Moreover, the transportation, storage, and handling of vaccines can also be extremely heavy on the pocket,” the TMR analyst reports. Apart from this, the containment of technical expertise in the hands of a few major players also acts as a deterrent on the growth of the human vaccines market.

Markets News provided by Research and Markets 30 May, 2017, 09:40 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Therapeutics Market Analysis By Drug (Alimta, Iressa, Avastin, Tarceva, Zykadia, Tagrisso, Xalkori, Cyramza, Opdivo, Alecensa), By Region And Segment Forecasts 2014 - 2025" report to their offering. The global non-small cell lung cancer therapeutics market is expected to reach a value of USD 12.2 billion by 2025 The non-small cell cancer therapeutics (NSCLC) market is anticipated to witness significant growth during the forecast period. This can be attributed to the high investment by market players in the research and development of lung cancer therapy, presence of a rich pipeline, and increasing penetration of drugs during the forecast period. Introduction of several drugs in various geographical regions is likely to drive the market during the forecast period. For instance, in October 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Alecensa (alectinib), a drug developed by Genentech to treat ALK-positive NSCLC as a first-line treatment. The drug has been approved in the U.S., Japan, Canada, Hong Kong, South Korea, Kuwait, and Israel. Presence of a strong pipeline of drugs for non-small cell lung cancer helps propel the market during the forecast period. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Orion Corporation, Merck KGaA, AstraZeneca, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, and Pfizer, Inc. have major molecules in the pipeline. Further key findings from the study suggest: By drug, Alimta accounted for the highest share in 2015. However, it is expected to witness decline in its share during the forecast period. Alecensa (alectinib) is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period. This is majorly attributed to the clinical benefit of the drug to treat ALK-positive NSCLC. Alecensa is expected to be a competitor to Pfizer's Xalkori and Merck's Keytruda during the forecast period. A superior progression-free survival rate of Alecensa was observed in the clinical trials as compared to Crizotinib. Geographically, North America dominated the overall industry in 2015. This is due to the early entry of drugs in the market, increased adoption of new treatment, and high cost of the drug. It is expected that North America would maintain its dominance during the forecast period and grow with the highest rate over the coming years due to expected entry of new drugs. Several players are operating in the industry. Geographical penetration and development of innovative & effective drugs are the key strategies of the players to increase their share. Some of the key players are GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Plc., Novartis AG, AstraZeneca, F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer Inc., Eli Lilly & Company, and Sanofi.

Pic: Dan Linehan SOCIAL BOOKMARKS Cork gets 210 jobs through MSD Brinny expansion Rob McNamara  MORE than 200 jobs are to be created in the latest employment boost for Cork after pharmaceutical giant MSD announced a €280 investment in their Irish operations. MSD, known as Merck in the UK, will be hiring 210 people at their Brinny facility, outside Kinsale, to meet demand for medicine products for lung cancer, melanoma, hepatitis C and rheumatoid arthritis. Jobs Minister Mary Mitchell O'Connor said the announcement will contribute to the spread of jobs development outside of the capital. “MSD has been at the cutting edge of biopharmaceutical innovation over recent years and their Irish operations are at the heart of many of the company's exciting new products. It is particularly gratifying that this expansion and additional job creation will take place in two regional locations, thereby strengthening the Government's efforts to ensure balanced industrial development around the country,” she said. The company develops, tests and manufactures biologics, specialising in the fermentation, purification and sterile filling of biotech products that fight common diseases. Biologics are genetically-engineered proteins made from human genes. They will be hiring 210 people at their Brinny facility to meet demand for medicine products for lung cancer, melanoma, hepatitis C and rheumatoid arthritis. The company will also hire 120 people for its Carlow facility and Jobs Minister Mary Mitchell O'Connor said the announcement will contribute to the spread of jobs development outside of the capital. “MSD has been at the cutting edge of biopharmaceutical innovation over recent years and their Irish operations are at the heart of many of the company's exciting new products. It is particularly gratifying that this expansion and additional job creation will take place in two regional locations, thereby strengthening the Government's efforts to ensure balanced industrial development around the country,” she said. Martin Shanahan, CEO of IDA Ireland said, “MSD’s decision to invest in its Irish operations across a number of regional locations further strengthens Ireland’s positioning as a global destination for manufacturing excellence in biopharmaceuticals. It is pleasing that MSD continues to evolve, grow and innovate from Ireland to continue to meet patient needs around the world.” MSD already employ more than 1,600 people at four locations – Cork, Carlow, Dublin and Tipperary – and has been in the country for the last 50 years. The company had a turnover of €4.7bn last year. Ger Brennan, managing director of MSD Human Health in Ireland said that investment in Ireland over the last five decades has positioned MSD as a significant player in responding to the world’s most vital, unmet health needs. “Our existing portfolio and future pipeline ensure current and future employees can operate at the cutting edge of science and technology. Our Irish sites are involved in the production of over 50% of MSD’s global top 20 products, exporting to over 60 countries worldwide.” Details on the jobs at MSD are available at http://www.msd.ie/careers &nbsp;     Most Read Woman dies after two dogs attack her in Galway 04.06.2017 Man charged with possessing 4kgs of TNT; another charged with IRA membership 04.06.2017 Two due before Special Criminal Court on dissident charges 04.06.2017 Leo Varadkar to set up new anti-terrorism Govt unit in response to London attack 04.06.2017 PSNI investigate attack on man in Coleraine by eight men with metal bars and bats 04.06.2017 Motorcyclist in hospital with serious injuries after accident in Antrim 04.06.2017 Connect With Us Contact Us Linn Dubh, Assumption Road, Blackpool, Cork, Ireland. 021 4272722 Contact us online here Home Cork News National News Lotto Send us your news Cork Sport National Sport Business Ents Showbiz Horoscopes Competitions Life Showbiz Horoscopes Competitions Services Family Notices Free Ads Advertising Find a House Find a Job Competitions Our Partners Breaking News Irish Examiner RecruitIreland Support Contact Us Cookie Policy Privacy Policy About Us Terms and Conditions © Evening Echo 2017

The nation is in the right place at the right time. If you read the news today then you would have learned that MSD, known as Merck in the States, is to create 330 new jobs at its manufacturing plants in Cork and Carlow as part of a €280m investment. What is also riveting about the announcement is that the Irish sites are responsible for more than 50pc of MSD’s top 20 products. These new responsibilities put Ireland at the cutting edge of developments in the areas of biologics. ‘We see a day where every individual suffering from disease will have molecular drivers of that disease clarified, and have new treatment doors opened up for them that [are] as unique as they are. In that regard, we are on the cusp of a Pentium-type era in life sciences’ – COLIN MAC HALE The pharma industry in Ireland has come a long way since the 1990s when the industry was largely involved in processing, a rather unglamorous but essential part of the supply chain. Since then, the myriad of operations of biotech giants – from MSD to GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Regeneron, Allergan and others – are higher up the value chain and have more in common with the Google campus than the old smokestack past. Ireland is the seventh-largest exporter of medicinal products in the world The latest numbers available from IDA Ireland indicate that there are now more than 120 biopharmaceutical operations in the country, out of which 40 are approved by the FDA to produce goods for the pivotal US market. There are 29,000 people directly employed in the biopharma FDI sector alone, and nine out of the top 10 biopharma giants in the world are manufacturing in Ireland. ‘In the last 10 years, there has been a significant ramp-up in large molecule, biologics and manufacturing throughout Ireland’ – TOMMY FANNING In 2015, the biopharma sector recorded €39bn worth of exports, and it contributes more than €1bn in corporation tax to the Irish exchequer annually. According to IDA Ireland’s head of biopharmaceuticals and food division, Tommy Fanning, Ireland is the seventh-largest exporter of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in the world. “In the last 10 years, there has been a significant ramp-up in large molecule, biologics and manufacturing throughout Ireland, adding to our substantial traditional manufacturing base in small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and oral solid dose (OSD). “Over €10bn in new investment has been committed in the last decade for new biotech manufacturing facilities in both drug substance (Alexion, Pfizer, Regeneron, Lilly, J&J, BMS and BioMarin) and drug product (Sanofi-Genzyme, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Amgen and MSD). “Our existing clients have continued to invest and have been joined by an exciting new group of high-growth companies.” Fanning said that an exemplary compliance record, strong Government support for R&D and zero-defect biopharma manufacturing excellence have driven this wave of investment in new biotech facilities. “Irish plants are regularly seen as global manufacturing sites, with FDA approvals in addition to European manufacturing licenses. “The Irish Government is committed to continuing to invest in our education, research and broader ecosystem to ensure that Ireland remains the competitive location of choice for new biotech manufacturing operations. “We have established the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT), which, with its pilot-scale biotech manufacturing equipment, serves as a ‘flight simulator’ for biotech manufacturing. NIBRT is now working with world-leading companies, providing detailed and significant training as well as growing its investment in process research.” According to Fanning, the original background in process engineering, the history in food processing and the quality of the education system gives Ireland a strong advantage when high-level skills are a priority. “A key target is to grow out the sub-supply base, both in terms of manufacture and services. Ireland has attracted a number of the global CRO (clinical research organisations) companies, including Quintiles, PPD, Parexel and Icon, using Ireland as a base to support their international activities,” Fanning said. Clinical trials environment is key When it comes to discovery and clinical trials, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) interfaces with both the pharma industry and health services in Ireland to increase clinical trials and boost discovery. IPHA CEO Oliver McCarthy believes that Ireland’s ability to facilitate discovery and clinical research is an asset, but we need to move faster in terms of adoption of proven drugs by our health services. ‘We think Ireland can do well as a promoter, developer and adopter of innovation across the value chain’ – OLIVER MCCARTHY “We represent the research-based pharma industry that is producing and researching and offering new medicines based on research. We work with over 47 companies here in Ireland, including 39 that are involved in making prescription drugs. “In the value chain of biopharma, we would be involved in advocating for policies and improvements in the areas of discovery and adoption, [to] improve access to medicines in Ireland through clinical trials and research.” McCarthy said that a welcome development has been the establishment of the Health Research Board’s Clinical Research Coordination Ireland (CRCI) network of clinical research hubs. McCarthy said this is essential to the successful conduct of world-class, patient-focused research. “We have seen the intensity of clinical trials increase in the last few years and the CRCI is definitely helping in this regard. “It is a crucial part of the ecosystem and how we position Ireland as an innovation island. When companies look at Ireland, they often see the return on investment, the corporation tax and, of course, the people. “But I think companies in this space also like to know that this is an environment where the innovation they are interested in capturing – from a discovery and translational research aspect – is being adopted too, and that there is an openness in the value chain for adoption of these companies’ medicines in our health services.” McCarthy said companies that invest increasingly look at this kind of environment and assess the whole innovation ecosystem. “There is room to improve. We are not satisfied that it is as good as it should be and we are calling on State authorities to improve the efficiency of processes to get faster results.” He said Ireland currently ranks 16th out of 26 countries in terms of the number of medicines approved for use in health services. “That’s not the best and we want to improve. “We have a fantastic base here. We think Ireland can do well as a promoter, developer and adopter of innovation across the value chain. That’s our ambition to encourage policymakers to speed up adoption.” Capturing the next wave Matt Moran, director of BioPharmachem Ireland (the Ibec body that represents the industry) said that nevertheless, the industry’s shift in Ireland from being a process-based part of the supply chain to being at the pinnacle of product development is no mean feat. “For a long time, the industry went through a patent-cliff period where things slowed down. But Ireland has caught the new wave of capital investment in new molecule and biotech. In a single decade, anything up to €10bn in capital investment has been announced. New and existing companies are investing – companies like BMS, Lilly and Mallinckrodt – and are driving a significant expansion of the sector. ‘It’s a good time in the industry. Its agility and responsiveness, reputation for high standards and compliance makes it a magnet for further investment’ – MATT MORAN “It used to be just process and product, but you are also seeing shared services roles, and most are tacking on R&D to what was traditionally a manufacturing hub.” Just like the digital sectors, Moran warns that finding people is difficult. “Talent is a challenge. Competitiveness is a challenge. The main problem is getting enough people to work in an expanding sector. It is an opportunity as well as a challenge, and we need more people coming out of college with STEM degrees. “The work that needs to be done in promoting the industry is enormous and we are working with the Institute of Technology, for example, to create apprenticeship model for people with non-traditional skills to be trained to work in the sector.” Moran said the infrastructural supports that have grown in recent years have been substantial, from the creation of NIBRT to the SSPC (Solid State Pharmaceutical Cluster), one of the Science Foundation Ireland Centres for Science, Engineering and Technology. “You are seeing infrastructure growing up around the industry, resulting in a more integrated life sciences cluster. The key has been a supportive and responsive government that gets it. “Overall, the industry has never been stronger. It’s a good time in the industry. Its agility and responsiveness, reputation for high standards and compliance makes it a magnet for further investment. “What we are seeing is a shift from small molecule manufacturing to large molecule manufacturing, and BMS, Alexion, Regeneron and Pfizer are all hiring people.” I put it to Moran that, as traditional pharma companies downsize, can’t the skills be shifted to the newer operations? “That’s the beauty of the sector. There is a lot of mobility in the sector if you have chemical engineering skills and qualifications, and that’s where NIBRT also comes in very useful in terms of training and upskilling.” But, ultimately, Moran warns, the difficulty is encouraging parents and new generations of schoolkids to foster a love of science and consider rewarding careers in an industry that keeps giving. “It’s a constant challenge. That’s why we hope our BioPharma Ambition event at Dublin Castle in February will help raise the profile of the industry. “The industry has a job of outreach to do. When you bring people to these facilities, they get it and their eyes light up. Also, the rise of entrepreneurs like Nora Khaldi of Nuritas, and Mark Barrett and Brian Glennon of APC, will help shine a light on the cluster,” said Moran. A Pentium moment for pharma As well as the rise of life sciences entrepreneurs, the opportunity for greater cross-pollination between the pharma and the technology industries is ripe for exploration, explained Colin Mac Hale, industry director (EMEA) for health and life sciences at Intel. “Technology has redefined what is possible for life as we know it. The $2.7bn, 10-year international research effort to map all of the genes of our species that [was] completed in 2003, referred to as the ‘Human Genome Project’, will be viewed by historians as one of the most important medical research projects ever. ‘It’s an understatement to say that the life sciences industry is in the middle of the most dramatic transformation it has ever seen’ – COLIN MAC HALE “10 years after that historic milestone, the industry became capable of building high-volume genome sequencing instruments that could sequence 18,000 human genomes per year, breaking the ‘$1,000 genome in one day’ barrier. This opened the door to population studies and clinical usage models that had not been possible before. Soon, we will be at the cusp of the $100 genome, where doctors will be able to unravel the DNA of a patient’s entire genome in an hour, opening the door to routine personalised diagnosis and treatment plans. This will transform our understanding of disease detection and prevention. “Technology is underpinning all of this. It’s an understatement to say that the life sciences industry is in the middle of the most dramatic transformation it has ever seen. This is one of the most striking examples of Moore’s Law in action. Moore’s Law democratises computing. It’s a pretty powerful law of economics. It says that by advancing semiconductor manufacturing capability at a regular cadence, we can bring down the cost of any business model that relies on computing. “Genomics data is the biggest of big data, and high-volume genome sequencing generates an enormous amount of it. That data needs to be analysed as fast as it is produced. Intel has teamed up with leaders in the life sciences industry to bring to market fast, scalable and affordable analytics solutions that have freed genomic data to be widely accessible for research around the world.” Mac Hale cited the collaboration between Qiagen Bioinformatics and Intel to create a platform that could enable the full analysis of human genomes for as little as $22 each. Qiagen’s Clinical Insight (QCI) platform was used by Rigshospitalet, one of Denmark’s largest and most specialised hospitals, to implement a precision medicine capability for more than 700 advanced cancer patients. Using actionable insights delivered by the QCI platform, doctors found clinically actionable onco-driver mutations and therapies in 40pc of those patients. More than half of those patients were able to enrol in clinical trials to receive drug therapies targeted at their genetic profile. Mac Hale said that just like the moment when the Pentium processor made the PC mainstream, advances in precision medicine, genome sequencing and biologics are changing the game in areas such as oncology, paediatrics, pharmacogenomics and reproductive health. And Ireland is in the right place at the right time. “Our goal is to make healthcare a lot more precise for every individual that healthcare delivery organisations care for. We see a day where every individual suffering from disease will have molecular drivers of that disease clarified, and have new treatment doors opened up for them that [are] as unique as they are. In that regard, we are on the cusp of a Pentium-type era in life sciences.” In-Depth: Life Sciences Week, More on IDA Ireland Related: life sciences, funding and investment, IDA Ireland, employers, research, Intel, Ibec, Pharma, government & policy, biotech 66 DAYS 4 HOURS 26 MINUTES Get your early bird tickets now!

"The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medecins Sans Frontiers team that is arriving (in Congo) today to validate the protocol with the technical teams," Jonathan Simba, a health ministry spokesman, told Reuters by telephone. The vaccine was developed by Merck and is known as rVSV-ZEBOV. It has not been licensed yet but it has proven to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials that were published last December. The vaccine was studied in a trial in Guinea in 2015 involving a total of 11,841 people. Of the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine, according to the study reported in the journal Lancet. The rVSV-ZEBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. As of Friday, DR Congo has 52 suspected cases of Ebola, World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone. He added that the situation appears to be under control. The details of the vaccination campaign are to be presented at a meeting of the health ministry and its partners either today or on Tuesday. The biggest concern appears to be the logistics of getting the vaccine to the region, which is isolated and without roads.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Meet the Cancer Therapy that Could Become the Second Best-Selling Drug in the World by Year's End Conservatively, this cancer drug is expected to generate between $8 billion and $8.3 billion in full-year sales. Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) May 29, 2017 at 8:21AM The pharmaceutical industry is big business. According to the International Trade Administration's Top Markets Report on pharmaceuticals last year, the global drug market is expected to grow from about $1 trillion in sales in 2015 to $1.3 trillion by 2020, representing about 5% annual growth. And at the center of that growth trend is the U.S. market. U.S. drugmakers are thriving The U.S. is an optimal target for drug developers for a variety of reasons. To begin with, the U.S. lacks a universal healthcare system, meaning Congress has no true ability to cap or limit drug pricing. The Food and Drug Administration also grants exceptionally long patent protection periods for novel therapies, which prevent the entrance of cheaper generic medicines. Additionally, insurers have a tendency to accept rather than fight drugmakers' pricing for fear of losing members by excluding a popular drug. And, of course, who can forget that demand for pharmaceuticals is higher in the U.S. than any other country in the world. This laundry list of catalysts makes the U.S. an optimal market for drugmakers to thrive -- and thrive they have. Image source: Getty Images. Last year, AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) anti-inflammatory drug Humira, the best-selling drug in the world, tallied $16.08 billion in sales. A little more than $10.4 billion of this was recognized in the United States, with strong pricing power helping to push sales of its leading therapeutic up 24% year-over-year domestically. Another major success story was Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) with its hepatitis C drug Harvoni. Even though sales of Harvoni, which has a list price of $94,500 for a standard 12-week treatment, dipped in 2016 as a result of Gilead having hit the "low-hanging fruit" and treating the sickest HCV patients in 2014 and 2015, the drug still generated $9.08 billion in full-year sales. Nearly $5 billion of that came from the U.S. In fact, five drugs in total managed to eclipse the $8.5 billion annual sales mark in 2016. After Humira and Harvoni were Amgen's (NASDAQ: AMGN) and Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) anti-inflammatory drug Enbrel, Roche's (NASDAQOTH: RHHBY) and Biogen's cancer drug Rituxan, and Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) and Merck's anti-inflammatory therapy Remicade. Big changes are in the offing for the world's top-selling drugs However, we appear to be on the verge of seeing some major shifts atop the best-selling drug leaderboard. For example, Remicade is dealing with the entrance of Inflectra, a biosimilar drug (essentially a copycat version of a biologic drug) that's priced at a 15% discount to its list price and is being marketed by Pfizer. Sales of Remicade dipped by more than 10% in 2016, largely driven by weakness in Europe. Without pricing power, Remicade sales are liable to fall again in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Likewise, increased competition in the anti-inflammatory space and the signing of new supply contracts has put the kibosh on Enbrel's pricing power. Amgen has been regularly using hefty price increases on Enbrel to drive growth, but that came to a crashing halt in the first quarter. Sales of Amgen's former lead drug dropped by 15% in Q1. Roughly 12% of this decline came from a reduction in sales volume, while about 2% came from a decrease in Enbrel's price. Even Gilead's Harvoni could see further pressure in 2017. Increasing competition in the HCV space from the likes of Merck, which priced its HCV drug Zepatier nearly $40,000 below Harvoni for a standard 12-week treatment, have Gilead forecasting $7.5 billion to $9 billion in full-year hepatitis C sales. Mind you, this includes sales from Sovaldi and Epclusa, its respective first and newest HCV drugs, not just Harvoni. The one exception this year, other than Humira, which is leaving its competition in the dust on an annual sales basis, is Rituxan. Roche reported a 4% increase in sales of the drug during the first quarter. Nonetheless, biosimilars of Rituxan may be ready to hit pharmacy shelves sooner than investors realize, and Rituxan's patents won't last that much longer either. Even Rituxan could see its sales reverse sooner rather than later. This cancer drug could ascend to the No. 2 spot in 2017 With some of the top-selling drugs potentially seeing their sales decline in the quarters and years that lie ahead, it looks as if Celgene's (NASDAQ:CELG) multiple myeloma blockbuster Revlimid has an outside chance of claiming the No. 2 spot among best-selling therapies in 2017. Celgene stuck by a forecast for $8 billon to $8.3 billion in full-year Revlimid sales, although it's been notoriously conservative with its sales estimates throughout the years.  Image source: Getty Images. Revlimid's success has been based on a confluence of factors. To begin with, demand for Revlimid is on the rise. An increase in multiple myeloma diagnoses, which is a result of an increase in population and earlier detection of the disease, has lifted demand for a go-to drug used as a first- and second-line therapy. Celgene also has exceptional pricing power with its lead drug. Though list prices of cancer drugs are often a well-kept secret, Celgene has had little trouble passing along higher price points to insurers and patients. Considering its exceptional market share in treating multiple myeloma, Revlimid shouldn't face much in the way of pricing pressure short of federal legislation that caps drug prices (which is unlikely). Celgene also notes that duration-of-use for its key therapy has helped its sales growth. Improvements in the multiple myeloma treatment process have allowed patients to remain on Revlimid for a longer period of time, ultimately boosting sales for Celgene. Lastly, Revlimid has multiple label expansion opportunities beyond multiple myeloma. These include first-line follicular lymphoma, relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoma, and first-line ABC-subtype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These aren't major money indications for Celgene like multiple myeloma, but they provide a channel to nicely increase sales. This is what sets Revlimid apart from the rest of its peers However, there's an additional factor that sets Revlimid apart from the group. In Dec. 2015, Celgene worked out a settlement with a number of generic-drug manufacturers over Revlimid. One manufacturer will be allowed to introduce a limited generic supply of the drug beginning in March 2022 and extending through 2025. By Jan. 31, 2026, a flood of generic Revlimid can finally enter the market. In effect, Celgene cleared a decade-long runway for its lead drug to keep growing. Image source: Getty Images. On the other hand, we're seeing a clear decline in sales of Harvoni, Enbrel, and Remicade, and Rituxan and even AbbVie's Humira are just a few years away from losing sales due to patent expirations. In other words, Revlimid may have a path to not only generate $10 billion-plus in annual sales -- it could become the best-selling drug in the world by the early 2020s. There's obviously a lot that could happen between now and the early 2020s, including new competition in multiple myeloma, as well as the introduction of a new therapy that ramps up quicker than Revlimid. An example would be Biogen's experimental Alzheimer's disease drug aducanumab. If successful in late-stage trials and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it could have $10 billion in peak annual sales potential, if not more. Nevertheless, Revlimid has a clear path to higher sales for at least the next couple of years, and if things go Celgene's way it could become the second best-selling drug in the world by the end of this year.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Wednesday that it could not recommend routine use of the medicine in newly diagnosed patients, given the drug's high cost and uncertainties about overall survival benefits. But the agency backed Keytruda use within the Cancer Drugs Fund, signalling that it had the potential to satisfy the criteria for routine use on the National Health Service (NHS) for this group of patients but needs more investigation. The decision follows data presented at a medical meeting last year showing that Keytruda could help lung cancer patients whose tumours have a high level of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. Keytruda is already approved as a cost-effective second-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have previously taken chemotherapy but no longer respond.

Moreover, presence of drugs such as Doxil, Abraxane, and Emend is attributive for higher revenue generation ·         Presence of substantial number of products manufactured through the use of microbial sources can be attributed for the largest share ·         In-vitro diagnostics is expected to witness lucrative progress as a result of R&D carried out in this segment ·         Asia Pacific is estimated to witness the fastest growth over the forecast period ·         Key players operating in this industry include Pfizer Inc., Ablynx NV, Nanotherapeutics Inc., Nanoviricides Inc., Abraxis Inc., Arrowhead Research Inc., Celgene Corporation, Bio-Gate AG, and Merck ·         Active expansion strategies are undertaken by a number of the major market entities in order to strengthen their position ·         North America dominated the industry in 2016, accounting for a 42% of total revenue The global nanomedicine market is anticipated to reach USD 350.8 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. Development of novel nanotechnology-based drugs and therapies is driven by the need to develop therapies that have fewer side effects and that are more cost-effective than traditional therapies, in particular for cancer. Application of nanotechnology-based contrast reagents for diagnosis and monitoring of the effects of drugs on an unprecedented short timescale is also attributive drive growth in the coming years. Additionally, demand for biodegradable implants with longer lifetimes that enable tissue restoration is anticipated to influence demand. As per the WHO factsheet, cancer is found to be one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases in 2012 and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths. Thus, demand for nanomedicine in order to curb such high incidence rate is expected to boost market progress during the forecast period. Solutions such as nanoformulations with triggered release for tailor-made pharmacokinetics, nanoparticles for local control of tumor in combination with radiotherapy, and functionalized nanoparticles for targeted in-vivo activation of stem cell production are anticipated to drive R&D, consequently resulting in revenue generation in the coming years. Biopharmaceutical and medical devices companies are actively engaged in development of novel products as demonstrated by the increasingly growing partnerships between leading enterprises and nanomedicine startups. For instance, in November 2015, Ablynx and Novo Nordisk signed a global collaboration and a licensing agreement for development and discovery of innovative drugs with multi-specific nanobodies. This strategic partnership is anticipated to rise the net annual sales of the products uplifting the market growth. However, in contrary with the applications of nanotechnology, the entire process of lab to market approval is a tedious and expensive one with stringent regulatory evaluation involved thereby leading investors to remain hesitant for investments. Further key findings from the report suggest: Therapeutics accounted for the largest share of market revenue in 2016 owing to presence of nanoemulsions, nanoformulations, or nanodevices These devices possess the ability to cross biological barriers. Moreover, presence of drugs such as Doxil, Abraxane, and Emend is attributive for higher revenue generation Presence of substantial number of products manufactured through the use of microbial sources can be attributed for the largest share In-vitro diagnostics is expected to witness lucrative progress as a result of R&D carried out in this segment Introduction of nano-enabled biomarkers, vectors and contrast agents with high-specificity and sensitivity are attributive for projected progress Clinical cardiology is expected to witness the fastest growth through to 2025 owing to development in nano-functionalization and modification of surfaces for increased biocompatibility of implants in treatment of late thrombosis Moreover, an abundance of research publications and patent filings from European region with a share of about 25% in nanomedicine-related publications is supportive for revenue generation from European economies Asia Pacific is estimated to witness the fastest growth over the forecast period Factors responsible include government and regulatory authorities that have implemented a framework to encourage R&D collaborations and framework extension. Key players operating in this industry include Pfizer Inc., Ablynx NV, Nanotherapeutics Inc., Nanoviricides Inc., Abraxis Inc., Arrowhead Research Inc., Celgene Corporation, Bio-Gate AG, and Merck Active expansion strategies are undertaken by a number of the major market entities in order to strengthen their position North America dominated the industry in 2016, accounting for a 42% of total revenue Read the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p04899216/Nanomedicine-Market-Analysis-By-Products-Therapeutics-Regenerative-Medicine-Diagnostics-By-Application-Clinical-Oncology-Infectious-diseases-By-Nanomolecule-Gold-Silver-Iron-Oxide-Alumina-Segment-Forecasts.html About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

Development of novel nanotechnology-based drugs and therapies is driven by the need to develop therapies that have fewer side effects and that are more cost-effective than traditional therapies, in particular for cancer. Application of nanotechnology-based contrast reagents for diagnosis and monitoring of the effects of drugs on an unprecedented short timescale is also attributive drive growth in the coming years. Additionally, demand for biodegradable implants with longer lifetimes that enable tissue restoration is anticipated to influence demand. As per the WHO factsheet, cancer is found to be one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases in 2012 and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths. Thus, demand for nanomedicine in order to curb such high incidence rate is expected to boost market progress during the forecast period. Solutions such as nanoformulations with triggered release for tailor-made pharmacokinetics, nanoparticles for local control of tumor in combination with radiotherapy, and functionalized nanoparticles for targeted in-vivo activation of stem cell production are anticipated to drive R&D, consequently resulting in revenue generation in the coming years.

The major trends, growth drivers as well as issues being faced by the market are discussed in detail in this report. The four major players: Pfizer Inc., Novartis AG, Merck & Co., Inc. and Allergan Plc. are being profiled along with their key financials and strategies for growth. The report contains a comprehensive analysis of the global glaucoma market along with the study of the US market. Though glaucoma cannot be cured completely, the disease progression can be controlled with the help of available treatments. There are three types of modalities available for treatment of glaucoma: Drugs, Laser and Invasive Surgery. Further, based upon the approaches employed for the medication, it can be segmented into two parts: PGA Medication and Non-PGA Medication. The PGA approach reduces IOP with the help of prostaglandin (PGA). The non-PGA medication can be further divided into four sub segments: Beta blockers, Alpha blockers, Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) and Combination Products. Several factors such as rising prevalence of diabetes, growing geriatric population and rising health care expenditure along with increasing disposable income and growing obese population will drive the market growth in the next few years. Development of new drugs & devices and drug therapy focused upon IOP are the few notable market trends. However, high cost of treatment, severe side effects and hasty drug approval processes act as a major roadblock for the market growth. Key Topics Covered: 1. Overview 2. Global Glaucoma Market 3. Regional Markets 4. Market Dynamics 5. Competitive Landscape 6. Company Profiles – Allergan Plc. – Merck & Co., Inc. – Novartis AG – Pfizer Inc.

Amy Maxmen 30 May 2017 Article tools Rights & Permissions John Moore/Getty Images Ebola vaccines have been used before, but only in trials such as this one in 2015 in Liberia. Regulatory and ethics-review boards in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have approved the use of an experimental Ebola vaccine to combat an ongoing outbreak of the virus, officials announced on 29 May. If they decide to deploy the vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, health-care workers will offer it to those at highest risk of contracting the disease. Uncertainties over the outbreak’s magnitude mean that Congolese authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) must determine whether the small number of confirmed cases justifies the cost and logistical complexity that comes with deploying the vaccine, says Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general of health systems and innovation at the WHO’s headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Officials have confirmed only two cases of Ebola since they started getting reports of people with Ebola-like symptoms in late April. There are 17 suspected cases in the DRC awaiting a diagnosis, as of an update from the WHO dated 28 May. Sixty-seven percent of the computer simulations run by officials predict that there will be no further cases in the next month. Handle with care Nonetheless, officials have spent the past two weeks preparing to transport the vaccine to the outbreak’s epicentre in Likati, a remote part of the Bas-Uélé province, a part of the country that borders the Central African Republic. Workers will need to use a combination of helicopters and motorcycles, because the heavily forested province — nearly twice the size of Ireland — doesn’t have paved roads. Another option is to use small boats to traverse the region on narrow rivers. Furthermore, a lack of electricity in the area will require portable freezers capable of storing the vaccine doses at –80 °C. The WHO and the Congolese authorities will also need to train nurses on how best to roll out the immunizations, says Eugene Kabambi, a WHO communications officer based in Kinshasa, DRC. And communities must be educated about the vaccine so that there are no misunderstandings about its safety or its benefits, given the danger of Ebola. In the meantime, the Congolese Ministry of Health and the WHO have arranged for the deployment of two mobile laboratories in Bas-Uélé, where researchers with the Congolese National Biomedical Research Institute can run diagnostic tests for Ebola. And a group from the aid organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders) has set up and staffed a 10-bed Ebola treatment unit near the outbreak’s epicentre. In case of emergency In April, a WHO working group recommended the use of rVSV-ZEBOV should an outbreak occur, on the basis of promising results from a clinical trial conducted in 2015 during the Ebola crisis in Guinea1. There are 300,000 doses of the vaccine available, owing to an agreement made in 2016 between the international organization Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and Merck, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures rVSV-ZEBOV. The key to Merck’s vaccine is a protein expressed on the surface of the Zaire strain of Ebola, collected during a 1995 outbreak in Kikwit, DRC. This is nearly identical to the strain circulating in the country now. The protein triggers a person’s immune system to produce antibodies that fight the virus. Should the vaccine be deployed, staff at MSF will vaccinate health-care workers in the hot zone and the initial group of people who had contact with those infected with Ebola, as well as a secondary group who had contact with the initial crowd. This ‘ring-vaccination’ strategy was used in Guinea in 2015 to protect those at highest risk of exposure. The infrastructure, including laboratories and equipment, and the personnel required to address the Ebola epidemic in the DRC won’t come cheap. The Congolese government has estimated that its response will require US$14 million. But a humanitarian crisis in the Kasai region in central DRC is also draining resources from the government and international donors. The United Nations stated in April that it will cost at least $11 million to meet the immediate nutritional, health and educational needs of more than a million people who have been displaced by escalating conflicts in the region. “Ebola outbreaks are tragic but expected,” says Mark Feinberg, president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative based in New York City. “And this is an important opportunity to test how prepared countries are to decide whether or not they want to deploy new vaccines, and how, before they are licensed.” Journal name: Nature DOI: doi:10.1038/nature.2017.22024 References Henao-Restrepo, A.

Analyst Christian Orquera reiterated his BUY rating and decreased the price target from EUR 40.00 to EUR 39.00. Abstract: On 16 May, Noxxon closed an agreement with the National Centre for Tumour Disease (NCT) in Heidelberg. At this leading cancer centre, Noxxon will conduct the Phase II study of its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in a total of 20 metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients. This is good news and we expect enrolment to start soon. A few days earlier Noxxon published FY/16 results which were slightly better than we expected, and closed a capital increase raising EUR1.0m. The company also converted most of Kreos’ outstanding EUR2.6m debt and secured up to EUR20m financing through the issue of EUR10m of convertible notes with warrants to subscribe to a further EUR10m. We currently expect Noxxon to raise only EUR4.5m through the notes (giving rise to a further EUR4.5m in warrants) which will suffice to generate the required Phase II top-line data of NOX-A12. Overall we view the deal as positive as it secures funding through 2018. However, the dilutive effect (substantial discount to the current share price) has a slightly negative impact on our valuation. We have therefore lowered our price target to EUR39.00 (previously EUR40.00). We reiterate our Buy rating. First Berlin Equity Research hat ein Research Update zu NOXXON Pharma NV (ISIN: NL0012044762) veröffentlicht. Analyst Christian Orquera bestätigt seine BUY-Empfehlung und senkt das Kursziel von EUR 40,00 auf EUR 39,00. Zusammenfassung: Am 16. Mai schloss Noxxon eine Vereinbarung mit dem Nationalen Zentrum für Tumorkrankheit (NCT) in Heidelberg ab. An diesem führenden Krebszentrum wird Noxxon die Phase-II-Studie seines Arzneimittelkandidaten NOX-A12 in Kombination mit Mercks Medikament Keytruda (Pembrolizumab) bei insgesamt 20 metastasierten kolorektalen und pankreatischen Krebspatienten durchführen. Das ist eine gute Nachricht und wir erwarten, dass die Patientenrekrutierung bald beginnt. Ein paar Tage zuvor veröffentlichte Noxxon FY/16-Ergebnisse, die etwas besser waren als wir erwartet hatten, und schloss eine Kapitalerhöhung von EUR1,0 Mio ab. Das Unternehmen hat auch die meisten bei Kreos ausstehenden EUR2,6 Mio. Schulden umgewandelt und sich bis zu EUR20 Mio. Finanzierung durch die Ausgabe von EUR10 Mio. Wandelanleihen und EUR10 Mio. Optionsscheine gesichert. Wir erwarten derzeit, dass Noxxon nur noch EUR4,5 Mio. durch die Wandelanleihen (plus weitere EUR4,5 Mio. durch Optionsscheine) abruft, was ausreicht, um die benötigten Top-Line-Ergebnisse der Phase-II-Studie von NOX-A12 zu generieren. Insgesamt bewerten wir den Deal positiv, da die nötige Finanzierung bis 2018 gesichert ist. Der verwässernde Effekt des Deals (erheblicher Abschlag auf den aktuellen Aktienkurs) wirkt sich jedoch leicht negativ auf unsere Bewertung aus. Wir haben daher unser Kursziel auf EUR39,00 (vorher EUR40,00) gesenkt. Wir bekräftigen unsere Kaufempfehlung.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dr. Eric G. Mortensen, M.D., Ph.D., Clinical Trial Veteran, Joins CytoSorbents as Chief Medical Officer MONMOUTH JUNCTION, N.J., May 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — CytoSorbents Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSO), a critical care immunotherapy leader using CytoSorb® blood purification to treat deadly inflammation in critically-ill and cardiac surgery patients around the world, announced that Dr. Eric G. Mortensen, M.D., Ph.D., will join CytoSorbents as Chief Medical Officer, starting full-time on June 1, 2017.  Dr. Phillip Chan, M.D., Ph.D., CytoSorbents’ Chief Executive Officer stated, „Dr. Mortensen has led clinical development of key programs for some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, including Pfizer’s novel rheumatoid arthritis therapy, Xeljanz®, which has achieved approximately $1 billion in annual worldwide sales. He brings more than two decades of proven and successful clinical trial development expertise to the company, as well as a wealth of knowledge and experience in immunology, inflammation, and clinical medicine. We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Mortensen to the executive team at CytoSorbents.”  Dr. Mortensen commented, „CytoSorbents is at an exciting phase in the clinical and scientific validation of its unique immunotherapy approach, and I am eager to contribute my significant clinical development experience to advance this important technology. CytoSorb has been used successfully in a wide range of challenging inflammatory conditions, demonstrating the promise of blood purification as an alternative to drugs and biologics. Our goal now is to design and execute the appropriate, well-designed studies to make CytoSorb standard of care for many of these conditions. I look forward to building upon the recent REFRESH I cardiac surgery trial to advance CytoSorb through a registration trial towards potential U.S. approval. In addition, I am fascinated by the easily modified core polymer, which has led to many new experimental treatments for blood transfusion applications, hyperkalemia, drug overdose, and toxin-mediated disease. This flexibility, as well as the ability to be adapted to many different modes of administration, creates a wealth of opportunities to develop new therapies. I believe that CytoSorb and our related technologies represent a breakthrough paradigm in the approach to inflammation and critical care.” As Vice President & Therapeutic Area Clinical Head for Inflammation and Immunology at Pfizer from 2014 to 2016, Dr. Mortensen led the company’s global, late-stage development organization for programs in inflammatory diseases including studies for Enbrel® and Xeljanz®. As the Clinical Inflammation Development Strategy Lead and co-chair for Inflammation’s Therapeutic Area Strategy Team (TAST), he ensured an integrated approach to the development of medicines across the different indications within Inflammation and Immunology. Dr. Mortensen previously held positions of increasing responsibility as the Vice President, Global Medicine Development Group Global Lead for Xeljanz and Assistant Vice President and Global Therapeutic Area Director for Enbrel. Previously at GlaxoSmithKline, he led clinical programs for the reintroduction of alosetron to the US market, the registration program for alvimopan, and medical affairs programs for assets within Women’s Health, Urology, Acute Care, Gastrointestinal and Ophthalmologic business units.  Prior to this, at Merck Research Laboratories, he was responsible for registration studies of the COX2 inhibitors rofecoxib and etoricoxib. Dr. Mortensen received an A.B. in Biochemistry from Harvard College, an M.D. from the Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST), and a Ph.D. in Biophysics at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences where he studied the transduction of membrane-bound hormone receptor’s binding into intracellular activation of metabolic activity and cellular proliferation. Dr. Mortensen completed an internship and residency in Internal Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital and a fellowship in Gastroenterology at the University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor. CytoSorbents also announced that Dr. Robert H. Bartlett, M.D. will retire as Chief Medical Officer, but will continue working closely with the company as a consultant and as Co-chair of the Cardiac Surgery Advisory Board with Dr. Joseph Zwischenberger, M.D. through the next anticipated REFRESH 2 cardiac surgery trial. Dr. Chan stated, „For nearly nine years, Dr. Bartlett has served as Chief Medical Officer of CytoSorbents and has helped guide the company through multiple key clinical studies, including the successfully completed REFRESH I cardiac surgery trial, our European Union approval of CytoSorb, and commercialization of CytoSorb worldwide. A trusted advisor, an experienced and practical clinician, and a legend in the field of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, we are pleased to continue working with Dr. Bartlett on a consulting basis. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire company, we thank Dr. Bartlett for his many outstanding contributions towards the success of the company.” About CytoSorbents Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSO) CytoSorbents Corporation is a leader in critical care immunotherapy, specializing in blood purification. Its flagship product, CytoSorb® is approved in the European Union with distribution in 43 countries around the world, as a safe and effective extracorporeal cytokine adsorber, designed to reduce the „cytokine storm” or „cytokine release syndrome” that could otherwise cause massive inflammation, organ failure and death in common critical illnesses such as sepsis, burn injury, trauma, lung injury and pancreatitis, as well as in cancer immunotherapy. These are conditions where the risk of death is extremely high, yet no effective treatments exist. CytoSorb® is also being used during and after cardiac surgery to remove inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and free hemoglobin, which can lead to post-operative complications, including multiple organ failure. CytoSorbents has completed its REFRESH (REduction in FREe Hemoglobin) 1 trial – a multi-center, randomized controlled study that has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of free hemoglobin reduction with intra-operative CytoSorb® use in a heart-lung machine during complex cardiac surgery.  In 2017, the company plans to initiate a pivotal REFRESH 2 trial intended to support U.S. FDA approval.  CytoSorb® has been used safely in more than 23,000 human treatments to date. CytoSorbents’ purification technologies are based on biocompatible, highly porous polymer beads that can actively remove toxic substances from blood and other bodily fluids by pore capture and surface adsorption. Its technologies have received non-dilutive grant, contract, and other funding in excess of $18 million from DARPA, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and others. The Company has numerous products under development based upon this unique blood purification technology, protected by 32 issued U.S. patents and multiple applications pending, including CytoSorb-XL, HemoDefend™, VetResQ™, ContrastSorb, DrugSorb, and others.  For more information, please visit the Company’s websites at www.cytosorbents.com and www.cytosorb.com or follow us on Facebook and Twitter Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

June 05, 2017 0440 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:193809 Publish Date: Tue, 30 May 2017 13:23:24 GMT Service: Health Congo approves use of Ebola vaccination to fight outbreak Democratic Republic of Congo's Health Ministry has approved the use of a new Ebola vaccine to counter an outbreak in its northeast that has killed four people, a spokesman said. Quoting Jonathan Simba, a Health Ministry spokesman, reuters.com reported, "The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medicines Sans Frontieres team that is arriving (in Congo) to validate the protocol with the technical teams.” The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and developed by Merck, is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. Congo had registered 52 total suspected cases, including two that have been confirmed, the World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone, adding that the situation appeared to be under control. Simba said that the details of the vaccination campaign would be announced after a meeting of the health ministry and its partners. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in Geneva that vaccination would be deployed should an EVD (Ebola virus disease) laboratory confirmed case be identified outside already defined chains of transmission. Jasarevic said, “In that case, it would be offered to contacts and contacts of contacts of a confirmed EVD case, including healthcare workers and field laboratory Workers.” A vaccination campaign would present logistical challenges in Congo's isolated northeastern forests, including transporting and storing the vaccine in special containers at the required minus 80°C.     KeyWords Congo approves Ebola   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Pregnancy after breast cancer doesn’t raise recurrence risk, finds study Should you eat three big meals or many mini-meals?

Now there’s a Medecins Sans Frontieres team that is arriving [in Congo] today to validate the protocol with the technical teams,” Jonathan Simba, a Health Ministry spokesman, said by telephone. The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and developed by Merck, is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. As of Friday, Congo had registered 52 total suspected cases, including two that have been confirmed, the World Health Organization spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone, adding that the situation appears to be under control. Simba said that the details of the vaccination campaign would be announced after a meeting of the health ministry and its partners set to take place on Monday or Tuesday. A vaccination campaign would present logistical challenges in Congo’s isolated northeastern forests, including transporting and storing the vaccine in special containers at the required minus 80 degrees Celsius.

CC0 / Pixabay / World Health Organization: Adolescent Digital Screen Addiction Major Health RiskHealth authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) gave conditional approval for an Ebola virus vaccine to be administered in the country on Monday. After working to control at least eight outbreaks of the deadly disease over the past 10 years, officials with DRC Health Ministry gave their approval for the new vaccine, developed by US pharmaceutical giant Merck. "The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medecins Sans Frontieres team that is arriving [to the DRC] today to validate the protocol with the technical teams," stated DRC health ministry spokesman Jonathan Simba, according to Reuters. The Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine remains unlicensed, but has been shown to be effective against Ebola in clinical trials. Four deaths attributed to the Ebola virus have been recorded in northeastern regions of the DRC in recent weeks, according to the Turkish Anadolu news agency, as officials again move quickly to stem another outbreak, according to reports for the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO has confirmed 52 new cases of the deadly disease in the most recent wave, but has added that the situation is under control. The logistical challenge of a wide-ranging vaccination campaign in the deep forests of the central African country is compounded by the need to transport and store the vaccines in custom-built containers kept at temperatures of minus 80 degrees Celsius prior to their use. ...

Companies and Nine Academic Institutions - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 29 May, 2017, 16:30 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Genetic Disorder Cluster Muscular Dystrophy Drug Development Pipeline Review, 2017" report to their offering. This report provides an overview of the genetic disorders pipeline landscape. The report provides comprehensive information on the therapeutics under development and key players involved in therapeutic development for Becker and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (BMD and DMD) and features dormant and discontinued projects. Both indications covered are inherited muscular dystrophies, a group of genetic, degenerative diseases primarily affecting voluntary muscles. BMD, the first type of muscular dystrophy, leads to symptoms include pain and sensation, difficulty with running, hopping, and jumping, toe walking, breathing problems, cognitive problems and frequent falls. There are a total of six products in development for this indication, by six seperate companies; the companies operating in this pipeline space are all small pharmaceutical enterprises, and consist of Armgo Pharma, Cardero Therapeutics, Milo Biotechnology, PTC Therapeutics, ReveraGen BioPharma and Sarepta Therapeutics. DMD is a condition which causes muscle weakness, and is an X-linked disorder. The gene for DMD is present on the X chromosome. It codes for a protein named dystrophin. Dystrophin is essential for providing structural support inside muscle cells. Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and may appear as early as infancy. They include fatigue, learning difficulties, intellectual disability, muscle weakness and progressive difficulty walking. There is a far larger pipeline for DMD than for BMD; there are a total of 108 products in development for DMD, by 57 companies and nine academic institutions. Key companies operating in this pipeline space include Sarepta Therapeutics, PTC Therapeutics, WAVE Life Sciences, Solid Biosciences, Summit Therapeutics and Catabasis Pharmaceuticals. Of particular importance are Sarepta, who are developing twelve distinct pipeline products for DMD. As with BMD, these are all smaller enterprises, although there is some involvement from larger pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer and Merck in the DMD pipeline. The majority of pipeline products for DMD target dystrophin which, as mentioned, is the causative gene for the disease. However, a number of products act on other molecular targets such as growth differentiation factor 8, nuclear factor kappa B and utrophin. The first two of these make up the pipeline for BMD, along with forkhead box protein 1B. Scope - Which companies are the most active within the pipeline for genetic disorder therapeutics? - Which pharmaceutical approaches are the most prominent at each stage of the pipeline and within each indication? - To what extent do universities and institutions play a role within this pipeline, compared to pharmaceutical companies? - What are the most important R&D milestones and data publications to have happened in the field of genetic disorder therapeutics? Key Topics Covered: 1. Report Guidance 2. Executive Summary 3. Introduction 4. Genetic Disorder Cluster Muscular Dystrophy Report Coverage 5. Therapeutics Development 6. Therapeutics Assessment 7.

Continue Reading Below The approval was granted by Congo's health ministry, spokesman Simba Kai said. The ministry must now decide whether to use the vaccine, which was developed by Merck & Co. The ministry, the World Health Organization and the medical aid organization Doctors Without Borders were discussing plans for the vaccine, Mr. Kai said. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company "stands ready to ship vaccine, if and when" Congo decides to use it. There have been only two confirmed cases of Ebola in the latest flare-up, and at least three more who likely had it. It isn't clear if the virus is still spreading. While some 52 cases have been registered, most have been designated as potential cases and are under investigation. Experts from the WHO say the delays in Congo's approval of the vaccine have been an impediment in efforts to contain the latest eruption of the disease, which was confirmed May 12. The current outbreak in Congo is the first since 2014-16, when at least 28,600 people were infected in West Africa, including 11,310 who died--by far the largest Ebola outbreak in history. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Reports in the aftermath of that epidemic called for major overhauls in global health financing and in the WHO, which took on most of the blame for a delayed response that allowed the disease to spiral out of control. Since then, it has established new guidelines and procedures for responding to reports of telltale symptoms of the disease. Monday's announcement that the vaccine had been approved for use in Congo came after Congolese experts finished a review of the protocol for using the vaccine, Mr. Kai said. Merck announced earlier this month that it was ready to release the vaccine but because the serum isn't yet licensed, it can only be administered under a clinical study, which must be approved by government. The company has agreed with the international vaccine alliance GAVI to ship doses of the vaccine to the location of the latest outbreak. The development of an Ebola vaccine is a significant breakthrough, especially for Congo, which has been afflicted by more outbreaks of the disease than any other nation in the world. The latest isn't far from the Ebola River, after which the virus was named in 1976. But Congo is sub-Saharan Africa's most sprawling country, and any vaccination campaign will be complicated by the remoteness of the current outbreak, centered in Likati, about 800 miles northeast of the capital Kinshasa. There are no road or rail links between Likati and Kisangani, the nearest city. Health officials are relying on motorbikes to reach the forested region, near Congo's border with the Central African Republic. To be effective, the anti-Ebola vaccine must be stored in special containers at a temperature of minus 80 degrees Celsius. Equipment to safely ship and store the vaccine has arrived in Congo from Guinea, where trials of the vaccine during the large outbreak in 2015 were effective, said the WHO spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi.

(AP Photo/Aurelie Marrier d'Unienville) Share Written by Yomi Kazeem Obsession Contagion May 29, 2017 Quartz africa In its battle to stop the spread of the Ebola after a recent outbreak, a new WHO-backed vaccine is the Democratic Republic of Congo’s weapon of choice. On May 12, the World Health Organization declared an Ebola outbreak in DR Congo after it confirmed three deaths. At the time, the United Nations health agency said there was no cause for panic. Now, with as many as 52 suspected cases, DR Congo’s health ministry is stepping up its response and has approved the use of a new experimental vaccine to stop the outbreak. In published findings from tests of the vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV, it showed a 100% protection rate. During trials conducted in Guinea, thousands of people tested were all confirmed as virus-free within 10 days. While WHO said at the time that the vaccine will not be available for mass use until 2018, pharmaceutical giants Merck, backed by GAVI, a global vaccine alliance, made 300,000 doses of the vaccine available in the event of an outbreak. That foresight could yet pay off in DR Congo where officials claim that up to 400 people that may have had contact with some of the individuals suspected of carrying the virus are now being tracked down. In a previous outbreak mainly in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the Ebola virus killed over 11,000 people as health services were ill-prepared to respond to the outbreak. For its part, WHO also admitted to a slow response to the outbreak. In contrast, the Congolese government reacted quickly (link in French) to its outbreak, sending a team of doctors and scientists to the affected area to treat the suspected cases and investigate the extent of infection. DR Congo’s relative containment of the virus so far has been attributed to the outbreak’s occurrence in a remote part of the country’s northeast. But that may yet prove a pitfall as the remoteness of the area could hamper a vaccination campaign as officials will have to deal with issues such as difficult logistics and storage for the vaccine which needs to be kept in containers set at a temperature of -80 degrees Celsius.

"The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medecins Sans Frontieres team that is arriving (in Congo) today to validate the protocol with the technical teams," Jonathan Simba, a health ministry spokesman, said by telephone. The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and developed by Merck , is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. As of Friday, Congo had registered 52 total suspected cases, including two that have been confirmed, the World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone, adding that the situation appeared to be under control. Simba said that the details of the vaccination campaign would be announced after a meeting of the health ministry and its partners. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in Geneva that vaccination would be deployed "should an EVD (Ebola virus disease) laboratory confirmed case be identified outside already defined chains of transmission". In that case, it would be offered "to contacts and contacts of contacts of a confirmed EVD case, including health care workers and field laboratory Workers", Jasarevic said. A vaccination campaign would present logistical challenges in Congo's isolated northeastern forests, including transporting and storing the vaccine in special containers at the required minus 80 degrees Celsius.

Oncologic therapeutics cannot cure cancer and yet in 2014, the overall market for cancer therapeutics stood at about $84.3 billion. Any drug that can provide a reasonable survival of more than five years for cancer patients can achieve a blockbuster status. Within cancer therapeutics, immunotherapeutic drugs have gained worldwide acceptance, because they are targeted drugs targeting only cancer cells. Today, cancer immunotherapy drugs have captured nearly 50% of the overall oncology drugs market, generating about $41.0 billion in 2014 alone. This report describes the evolution of such a huge market in 20 chapters supported by over 180 tables and figures in 317 pages. Key Questions Answered in this Report • What is the global market for cancer immunotherapeutics by product class such as MAbs, vaccines and non-specific immunotherapies, through 2020? • What is the global market for cancer immunotherapeutics by geography, through 2020 • What is the global market for cancer immunotherapeutics by indication, through 2020? • What is the global market for MAbs by type such as naked MAbs and ADCs, through 2020? • What are the market values for Herceptin, Avastin, Erbitux, Yervoy, Mabthera, Adectris, and Keytruda? • What is the global market for cancer vaccines? • What is the global market for cytokines in cancer immunotherapy? • The projected market values for Nivolumab, RG7446, DCVax-L, MEDI4736 ? • What immunotherapies were approved between 1986 and 2016? • What monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were approved by the FDA to treat different types of cancers?

Immunomedics Inc. Janssen Biotech Inc. Juno Therapeutics Inc. Merck & Co., Inc. Oxford BioTherapeutics Ltd. Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc. Roche Holdings Inc. Seattle Genetics Inc. Sorrento Therapeutics Inc Kite Pharma Novartis Executive Summary Prior to the launching of Yervoy, the five-year survival rate for patients with early stage melanoma was 98%; but the five-year survival rate for late-stage melanoma was just 16%. Yervoy has been reported to have a survival rate of 25% when tested alone. When tested as part of a combination therapy treatment with Bristol’s nivolumab, the two-year survival rates rose to 88% for patients with late-stage cancer. Increase in patient survival rates brought about by cancer immunotherapy treatment is similar to that seen when bone marrow transplantation changed our conception on how blood cancer was treated.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline Plc., Merck & Co., Inc., and AbbVie Inc. According to TMR, the global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market will reach US$245.8 bn by the end of 2024, from US$86.7 bn in 2015. If these figures hold true, the global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market will exhibit a strong CAGR of 12.6% between 2016 and 2024. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/monoclonal-antibody-th… Use of Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics in Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases to Remain High Monoclonal antibody therapeutics are used in the treatment of diseases such as autoimmune diseases, cancer, hematological diseases, and ophthalmological diseases. Of these, the demand for monoclonal antibody therapeutics in the treatment of autoimmune diseases is expected to showcase a phenomenal rise. As per TMR, between 2016 and 2024, the autoimmune diseases segment will exhibit a CAGR of 13.5%. Regionally, North America is forecast to continue dominating the global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market. By the end of 2024, North America is expected to hold a little short of 38% of the global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market. Rising Cancer Cases Worldwide to Fuel Demand for Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics The rising incidence of chronic ailments will give impetus to the market worldwide. The rising health concerns besides increasing diagnoses of cancer at various stages has fuelled the demand for effective therapeutics in the last few years. As a per the latest studies by the World Health Organization (WHO), the cancer cases worldwide will witness a massive spike of 70% in the near future, of which 60% cases will be attributable to Asia, Africa, and Latin America. To counter this looming threat to human lives, nations have collaborated in the fight against chronic ailments. Hence incremental approvals in monoclonal antibody products is expected across the U.S. and Europe. According to TMR, nearly five or six monoclonal antibodies get approval each year in the aforementioned regions. Moreover, among the 60 monoclonal antibodies, which received approval in Europe, 48 have already hit the market. This widening product portfolio, which is available at a diverse price range, has helped in accelerating the pace of gains for the market players. This in turn will enable the global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market gain considerable momentum in the coming years. Fill The Form To Gain Deeper Insights On This Market @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Advent of Biosimilars Pose Significant Threat Despite forecasts of strong growth, the market is expected to get overshadowed by a few restraints. For instance, the rising production of biosimilars that have proven helpful in the treatment of chronic ailments and autoimmune diseases is lurking to swallow the market share of monoclonal antibody therapeutics in the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, the patient cliff to diverse products will have adverse impact on the overall revenue generated by the market. Also the high cost of monoclonal antibodies will create bottlenecks for the market. Stringent regulations across certain nations will pose threat to the market as well.

"The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medecins Sans Frontieres team that is arriving (in Congo) today to validate the protocol with the technical teams," Jonathan Simba, a health ministry spokesman, said by telephone. The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and developed by Merck , is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. As of Friday, Congo had registered 52 total suspected cases, including two that have been confirmed, the World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone, adding that the situation appeared to be under control. Simba said that the details of the vaccination campaign would be announced after a meeting of the health ministry and its partners. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in Geneva that vaccination would be deployed "should an EVD (Ebola virus disease) laboratory confirmed case be identified outside already defined chains of transmission". In that case, it would be offered "to contacts and contacts of contacts of a confirmed EVD case, including health care workers and field laboratory Workers", Jasarevic said. A vaccination campaign would present logistical challenges in Congo's isolated northeastern forests, including transporting and storing the vaccine in special containers at the required minus 80 degrees Celsius.

Although the Tipperary man, who now heads up the human health division of one of the country's biggest healthcare employers, MSD Ireland, qualified as a nurse, he knew he was destined for a career in the drugs business. But the path was far from smooth. "I remember when I used to do the drug rounds," he says. "I'd be going through the packages to see if I could get contact details. And I used to write to these guys individually and someone said to me one day 'What have you really done to try and get into this job?'. I said 'As motivation I keep my PFOs'." "I had over 100 'thank you very much for applying for this position, we have you on file, blah, blah, blah'." For several years, it was a fruitless pursuit until the model for employing drugs reps in Ireland began to change. "I was going to recruitment agencies but then a company called Innovex came onto the scene and they kind of brought in a new model that was contract reps. "So, Innovex were bringing in nurses and people who had done science and giving us six-month contracts so that got the door open for me." Once the door was opened, there was no turning back for Brennan (44). Working his way up through pharma giants such as Bayer and Wyeth, he joined MSD in 2010, taking on a number of senior international positions. He took over the senior role in Ireland last August. As well as being managing director of the group's human health business in Ireland, Brennan is head of MSD's country council for Ireland which oversees the development of MSD's presence here. Less than a year into the job, he is overseeing significant investment here, with the group announcing last month that it will invest €40m in its manufacturing facility in Ballydine, Co. Tipperary this year. It is part of a €75m spend over the last three years to upgrade the site's facilities. Among the developments being invested in is the installation of a new spray-drying facility at the plant - a technology used in a number of products to increase their solubility and improve how the medicines are absorbed by patients. It is all part of ensuring Ireland remains a cutting-edge location for the group in an ever-more competitive global pharmaceutical sector. And in February, MSD announced that it is to expand its clinical trials programme in Ireland, with a particular focus on the latest developments in the treatment of cancer. That saw the company commit up to €25m to Irish-based clinical trials and related R&D activities over the next three years. "We're here 50 years and we have eight sites," says Brennan. "Why are we still investing in Ireland? You know, one of the strong things I think we come across is the talent in our people in Ireland. Now it would be remiss of me if I didn't mention the tax breaks and the 12.5pc corporate tax, but is that the main driver? I don't think so." Ireland is a key location in terms of size for the group although it has scaled back operations in some locations. It is about to close a plant in Swords, for example, which employed 570 people. "That's going to shut down in the next couple of weeks," says Brennan. "But I suppose the big thing there, we were able to delay that shutdown by over two years." Read more: Drug giant MSD's €40m upgrade 'a vote of confidence' While some operations have wound down, other businesses have expanded, such as the site in Ballydine. "With 1,800 employees we would be one of the largest operations for MSD globally. And the testament on that is at the end of this month, we have 1,500 MSD executives flying in for a three-day conference in the convention centre. "You know 50pc of the top 20 MSD products globally are manufactured here in Ireland." One of the more recent concerns facing the Irish pharma sector has been a pledge by US president Donald Trump to bring drug production back to the US. Brennan believes it is not something to be concerned about. "I think we've responded very, very quickly to President Trump when he made that narrative," says Brennan. "Our own CEO has had two meetings with the President and he basically gave the commitment to the President that yes, there will be manufacturing and future manufacturing in the US for US drugs." "Outside of the US we need to have manufacturing for drugs that we actually commercialise in Europe so President Trump wasn't as familiar with the whole supply chain at that time," he adds. "Is it a concern for me today? Absolutely not. We've just announced the €75m in Ballydine. We have the significant investment we're going to announce over the next couple of months in our other facilities and also Keytruda, which is our leading oncology drug that globally we're manufacturing out of Carlow." Keytruda, one of MSD's most exciting new drugs, uses the latest in biotechnology to fight cancer. "We have the body acting as the chemotherapy in targeting the cancer cells," says Brennan. Finding new drugs to fight Alzheimer's is also high on the agenda. "We're all looking for the target, this compound that will actually curtail the progression of the disease. I mean that's going to be a game-changer, whoever can identify that." The company's large workforce requires a diverse set of skills. "Our medics, our medical advisers, they're all doctors or consultants in very specialised areas. If I look at our commercial organisation here, all the people have basic degrees and higher. "Then when I get into the manufacturing process, we have very high-skilled labour here, so we've technicians, we have a lot of PhD students, a lot of engineers," says Brennan. "Because when you're dealing with biotechnology, it's a rapid, rapid process so we need to bring in the brightest minds, a lot of people with significant experience. The challenge is keeping them." Nine of the 10 top pharma firms are in Ireland, so Brennan says it is "extremely competitive". Wage inflation is "not an issue for us but it's something we do a lot of work on so it doesn't become an issue", he says. While fears over Trump's statements on pharma production may have been put to one side, Brexit does pose some potential challenges. "To be fair, people are really not sure what way this is going to look. "However, supply chain is going to be a challenge for us because we've a centralised pact with the UK - as do many pharmaceutical companies," says Brennan. "So if there's no way where we can put kind of a holding agreement in place to allow us to actually take a step back and say OK, how do we change this ... that to me is probably what would keep me awake at night. That we don't have interruption to our supply chain." There are opportunities, however. Health Minister Simon Harris is making a serious effort to bring the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMA) to Ireland. Brennan says it would bring huge benefits to Ireland. "We would be seen as a major player when it comes to pharmaceuticals. If I look at our footprint from a manufacturing perspective and then you have the EMA on side...I mean we've heard some companies say they would move their organisations to where EMA sits." However, other countries are fighting hard to win over the agency and there is some scepticism in the industry about Ireland's chances of succeeding. Having taken up his role in August, Brennan is keen to have MSD's voice heard at a government level and has strong views about the future of healthcare in Ireland. "I suppose one thing that I'm very passionate about is that at MSD Ireland, we don't want just to be seen as a pharmaceutical company in the corner," he says. "This year we set up a policy and government affairs department and that brought in a very strong policy and government affairs leader [former minister of state and Road Safety Authority chair Liz O'Donnell] for us in that space. And the idea is that we can work with government around Stem (science, tech, engineering and maths) so that they will come to us to collaborate rather than you're just going in to discuss bringing new products to the market. It's more about thinking the long term and the more holistic approach," he says. There has been a lot of discussion about the cost of medicines in Ireland in recent years. Brennan believes it has gone in the right direction. "I'm very pleased with the new deal," he says of the drugs agreement with the State made last June. "That will save nearly €800m over a four-year agreement." Another development impacting on production is the shift towards artificial intelligence, automation and augmented reality. However, Brennan does not believe it will have much downside for employment numbers. "I think on the biotech side it's at a fairly automated process as is, but still requires a level of staffing. For example, in Carlow - which is probably one of the most advanced technology plants - we still have nearly 400 people employed there. While a lot of it is automated, you need to have a lot of quality and control within the process so it won't take it away, no." However, Brennan does see medicine and patient care changing fast due to technological advancements. "Augmented reality is the new buzzword and we're in that space too."

Image: Deborah Benbrook/Shutterstock Ireland is a home for 24 of the world’s top biotech and pharma companies by Elaine Burke 6 days ago952 Shares Life Sciences Week on Siliconrepublic.com kicks off with a breakdown of the top players in the industry that have made a home for themselves in Ireland. Roughly 20 years ago, Ireland had about 50 biopharma companies dotted throughout the country. Recent numbers put that figure at more than 300 companies. New life sciences players are regularly moving in while those that have been here long-term have set down roots for future growth. It’s no surprise, then, that we see regular announcements on Siliconrepublic.com showing that biotech and pharma companies are one of the most active in recruitment. Out of the world’s 25 largest (by market capitalisation) independent, public biotech and pharma companies, only one – Celgene – has decided to forgo an office on these shores. Celgene UK and Ireland was established as an affiliate office in London in 2006. And so we are left with the two dozen others, profiled below, starting with the largest first. Johnson & Johnson Familiar to millions as a household brand, Johnson & Johnson is the largest biotech in the world, employing more than 125,000 people across 60 countries. The Johnson & Johnson family of companies has been operating in Ireland for 80 years, with almost 3,000 employees across a network of locations including Johnson & Johnson Vision Care in Limerick, DePuy Synthes in Co Cork, and multiple Janssen operations in Cork and Dublin. Roche Headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, Roche started out as a provider of vitamins and was the first company in the world to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C. These days, it is a multinational pharma and diagnostics healthcare powerhouse with a commercial operation in Citywest, Dublin and a manufacturing site in Clarecastle, Co Clare. The latter is a manufacturing centre of excellence for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are used to develop medicines at other Roche facilities around the world. Pfizer Pfizer has seven locations across four counties in Ireland, employing more than 3,300 people in all. Pfizer was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to locate in Ireland when it set up in 1969, and the work carried out here includes R&D, manufacturing, shared services, treasury and commercial operations. The company has invested more than $7bn in its Irish operations in its almost 50 years here, including a $30m lab in Ringaskiddy, Co Cork that opened in 2014. Novartis Even before Pfizer, there was Novartis, which arrived in Ireland in the 1950s. Also headquartered in Basel, Novartis employs about 1,500 people in Ireland. The Dublin team provides scientific and commercial services, IT, HR operations and procurement. In Cork, two Ringaskiddy manufacturing sites produce active pharmaceutical ingredients for a range of oncology, respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatology, central nervous system and transplantation medicines. The multinational’s Irish footprint also includes Alcon’s facility in Cork, as Novartis acquired the eye care company in 2012. MSD MSD (Merck Sharp & Dohme) also has a long legacy in Ireland that stretches back over the last 50 years and, in that time, the company has invested more than $2.5bn in expanding and developing its facilities here. Over the half-century, MSD has developed treatment methods in the areas of diabetes, heart disease, immunology, oncology, infectious diseases, women’s health and anaesthesia. MSD’s Irish sites – in Dublin, Carlow, Cork and Tipperary – are involved in the production of more than 60pc of the company’s global top 20 products. Learn about Life at MSD Life at MSD Amgen US biopharma Amgen’s Irish activity stems back to its purchase of Pfizer’s Dún Laoghaire facility back in 2010, spending $300m and five years revamping the site in its own image. The development included the construction of a new production plant, a cold-chain warehouse and a full refurb of existing buildings. A new syringe-filling facility positions the Dún Laoghaire plant as a key location within Amgen’s plans, with state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities bulking up the company’s global operations. Its other office in Ireland is in Santry, Dublin. Sanofi Sanofi Waterford was born out of Sanofi-Aventis SA’s $20.1bn purchase of Genzyme back in 2011, creating a global pharma force. Employing around 600 people in Ireland, its products are focused on rare inherited disorders, kidney disease, orthopaedics, cancer, transplant and immune disease, and diagnostic testing. In 2013, €44m was put into the Waterford campus to increase production of insulin product Lantus. AbbVie After Abbott Laboratories separated into two publicly traded companies, AbbVie came into being as a research-based biopharmaceutical manufacturer in 2013. AbbVie is spread across five sites in Ireland, comprising three manufacturing facilities in Sligo and Cork, and two Dublin offices performing commercial and operations activities. In January this year, the US multinational announced a partnership with Irish start-up Genomics Medicine Ireland to map the genomes of 45,000 Irish people for use in improved drug development. GlaxoSmithKline GSK’s Irish operations are spread across Dublin, Sligo, Waterford and Cork. Active ingredients for nine of GSK’s medicines (including treatments for cancer, depression and Parkinson’s disease) are manufactured in Cork. The Sligo site manufactures 40 different formulations of skin healthcare products, while familiar pharmacy brands Panadol and NiQuitin come from the Waterford site in Dungarvan. Bayer Though Bayer has been in Ireland for almost 50 years, it has one of the smaller employee footprints, with around 100 people headquartered in Dublin. The German chemical and pharma giant focuses on healthcare and agriculture, developing new molecules to help improve the health of humans, animals and plants. Last year, the company was named as one of the Best Workplaces by Great Place to Work Ireland. Eli Lilly Hiring Now Life-changing career opportunities for you Helping the world be well. Work for what matters. Always at the cutting edge of new innovation The largest employer in northwest Ireland American pharmaceutical business Eli Lilly and Company has had an Irish presence since the 1970s, beginning with the development of a manufacturing facility in Kinsale, Co Cork. Eli Lilly’s medicines are used in the treatment of cancer, diabetes, depression, osteoporosis, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and many other illnesses. Taking into account the firm’s other facilities in Dublin and Cork city (sales and marketing, and global business solutions, respectively), Eli Lilly employs more than 800 people in Ireland. Gilead Sciences American biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of therapeutics and medicines. Gilead’s Ireland operations are responsible for manufacturing, quality control, packaging, and the release and distribution of the company’s products in the European Union and other international locations, such as the countries supported by the Gilead Access Programme. Its most notable products are the hepatitis C drugs, Harvoni and Sovaldi. Bristol-Myers Squibb Globally, pharma giant Bristol-Meyers Squibb (BMS) employs more than 27,000 people, including about 550 in Ireland as part of its global manufacturing and supply (GMS) and commercial operations. BMS’s Irish workforce is spread across four facilities, including two pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facilities and a drug testing facility in Dublin, and another manufacturing facility in Shannon, Co Clare. It produces medicines that tackle diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis and psychiatric disorders. Learn about Life at Bristol-Myers Squibb Life at Bristol-Myers Squibb Allergan Pharma company Allergan directly employs almost 1,700 people in Ireland and, according to economic consultants DKM, this supports a further 600 jobs in the supply chain and 500 jobs in the wider economy. Marking 40 years of business in Ireland this year, the company confirmed an additional investment of €42m in its Irish operations in 2017, as well as a €50,000 Innovation Award Programme with Irish colleges. Headquartered in Dublin, Allergan operates two manufacturing facilities in Dublin and Westport, Co Mayo. AstraZeneca Anglo–Swedish multinational AstraZeneca is a science-led biopharma business producing medicines for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and oncology and respiratory patients.

The Irish operations are focused on delivering locally manufactured healthcare solutions designed specifically for this market – specifically, science-based nutritional products, diagnostic tools and medical devices. Abbott’s vast Irish network takes in Clonmel, Cootehill, Donegal, Longford, Dublin and Sligo, and includes manufacturing as well as commercial and support facilities. Novo Nordisk Novo Nordisk has a global workforce of 42,000 employees, almost half of whom are based in the company’s native Denmark. The company’s five key product areas are diabetes care, obesity and weight management, haemophilia management, growth hormone therapy, and hormone replacement therapy. Novo Nordisk maintains an Irish foothold with offices in Dublin and, in January, it made a defiant post-Brexit decision to invest £115m (€134m) in a new research centre in Britain at the University of Oxford. Biogen Biogen is an American multinational biotech headquartered in Massachusetts. Biogen develops, manufactures and markets innovative treatments for neurological, neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases. The company has committed to providing an inclusive workplace and, for two years in a row, has held a 100pc Corporate Equality Index score from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, which rates US workplaces on LGBTQ equality. Biogen maintains an Irish office at United Drug House, Dublin. Shire Earlier this year, Shire Pharmaceuticals officially opened a new city centre Irish HQ, having moved from west Dublin. The global manufacturer of medicines for rare diseases expects to house 300 employees at the 76,000sq ft Miesian Plaza office, including commercial and technical operations (supply chain and IT). Last year, Shire revealed plans for a manufacturing operation in Co Meath, with 400 employees required on the 120-acre site. This operation will employ the latest bioprocessing techniques and flexible production strategies, enabling it to supply both clinical and commercial-scale products. Stryker Medtech multinational Stryker Corporation is active in more than 100 countries worldwide. Its presence in Ireland began in 1998 and, over the last 17 years, Stryker has built its research, development and manufacturing operations here through investment and acquisitions.

Regeneron Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a New York-headquartered biotech company founded in 1988, opened its first facility outside of the US in Dublin in 2013. Dublin is home to the firm’s EMEA headquarters, and houses Regeneron’s business operations in Europe, from regulatory affairs to pharmacovigilance. When Regeneron arrived in Ireland in 2013, the company also invested €310m in developing a facility in Limerick, this time devoted to manufacturing. This Industrial Operations and Product Supply (IOPS) facility in Raheen launched in 2015 and works to produce medicines for patients around the world. Teva Teva Pharmaceuticals is an Israeli multinational pharmaceutical company headquartered in Petah Tikva. In March, Teva announced that it will close a testing laboratory in Dundalk, Co Louth next year amid worldwide cost-cutting. Dundalk is the seat of Teva’s commercial arm in Ireland, managing the sales and support services for Teva’s large portfolio of products for cardiovascular, central nervous system and respiratory health, as well as pain relief and infection control.

One of the largest suppliers to hospitals and home patients, Baxter has 50,000 employees worldwide, serving patients and clinicians in more than 100 countries. Baxter has offices in Dublin and Belfast as well as manufacturing sites in Dublin and Mayo. The company primarily focuses on products to treat haemophilia, kidney disease, immune disorders and other chronic and acute medical conditions.

Now, the company employs around 300 staff across its three facilities, and has announced several phases of local expansion. First, the acquisition of a site in Athlone, Co Westmeath, which now houses an aseptic vial fill-finish facility; followed by the acquisition of a 41-acre site at College Park in Blanchardstown. The latter now serves as the company’s new global supply chain and operations headquarters, with laboratory, office, packaging and warehouse facilities in one location. Blanchardstown will also be home to a new 20,000sq m bulk biologics manufacturing facility that is currently under development, and the Athlone facility is also being expanded to house another biologics manufacturing facility on-site.

The accord, confirmed by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston, will resolve a lawsuit against the pharmacy operator filed in 2007 by two former employees of drugmaker Organon USA Inc on behalf of the federal government and various states. CVS in a statement said the alleged conduct at issue took place before it acquired Omnicare in 2015. Omnicare neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The lawsuit claimed that from 1999 to 2005, Omnicare and certain pharmacies it acquired sought and received kickbacks from Organon in the form of discounts in exchange for promoting the antidepressants Remeron and Remeron SolTabs. The lawsuit said that as a result, Omnicare violated the False Claims Act by submitting kickback-tainted claims to Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, for reimbursement. The lawsuit was filed by Richard Templin and James Banigan, both of whom were former employees of Organon, which reached a related $31 million settlement in 2014. Organon, originally based in the Netherlands, was acquired in 2007 by Schering-Plough Corp, which later merged with Merck & Co Inc. Under the False Claims Act, whistleblowers can sue companies on the government's behalf to recover taxpayer money paid out based on fraudulent claims. If successful, whistleblowers receive a percentage of the recovery. While the U.S. Justice Department can intervene in such lawsuits, in this case, the U.S. government and the 28 states named in the complaint declined to intervene, leaving the ex-Organon employees to pursue it on their own. Joel Androphy, a lawyer for Templin and Banigan, called the settlement "a fair resolution for all concerned." According to settlement papers, Omnicare agreed to pay the federal government more than $12.8 million and nearly $10.2 pursuant to state settlement agreements.

Vaccination is the process of injecting, or oral vaccine ingestion to stimulate the immune system of the individual. The vaccine is made up of inactive, partially killed or dead microbes, to activate the immune system against the particular microbe and produce antibodies against it. A vaccination influences immune system to attack the microbe. The antigen stimulates the immune system to identify the threat, destroy and memorize so that if the same microbe occurs later it can be recognized and destroyed.

Login Register Public Release: 30-May-2017 Penn studies show hope for multiple cancers with pembrolizumab combination therapies New research will be presented at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Share  Print  E-Mail IMAGE: Dr. Tara Gangadhar. view more  Credit: Penn Medicine PHILADELPHIA - The combination of pembrolizumab and the checkpoint inhibitor known as epacadostat is leading to promising responses and is generally well tolerated in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, and several other cancers, according to researchers from the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Their findings also showed that adding pembrolizumab to standard therapies for breast cancer improved the number of patients achieving a pathological complete response. The results of these combination therapy studies will be presented at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in Chicago. Pembrolizumab is an intravenous drug that targets the programmed cell death (PD-1) receptor - a protein that weakens the body's immune response by suppressing T-cell production. The drug was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma in 2014, and trials testing its use for other cancers are ongoing. As part of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, researchers from Penn and other institutions gave patients the drug in combination with epacadostat, an indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor. The drug functions in a similar way to pembrolizumab by boosting T-cell production, but it's taken orally and targets a different protein. It's specifically designed to switch off IDO1, an immunosuppressive enzyme associated with tumor progression and shortened survival for patients. Researchers broke down the results by cancer type and analyzed the outcomes, including: Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma (Abstract #4503) Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (Abstract #6010) Non-small cell lung cancer (Abstract #9014) Triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer (Abstract #1103) Advanced renal cell cancers (Abstract #4515) They also looked at the drug's general safety across multiple tumor types (Abstract #3012). "In each patient group, the combination did not add any significant increase in side effects compared to what patients experience with the PD-1 inhibitor alone," said Tara Gangadhar, MD, an assistant professor of Hematology Oncology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who led five of the new analyses. Separate research looked at the combination of pembrolizumab with standard treatments prior to surgery for patients with high-risk breast cancer (Abstract #506). As part of the multi-institutional I-SPY 2 trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel with or without the PD-1 inhibitor. The addition of pembrolizomab tripled the pathologic complete response rate in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, with 15 of 21 responding (71.4 percent) compared to 16 of 83 (19.3 percent) in the control group. The rate doubled in patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer, with 7 of 25 responding (28 percent) compared to 13 of 88 in the control (14.8 percent). "This is incredibly exciting news for patients with aggressive cancers and the beginning of generating new and better curative options at diagnosis," said Angela DeMichele, MD, MSCE, the Alan and Jill Miller Professor in Breast Cancer Excellence in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Chair of Trial Operations for the study. DeMichele also noted that this trial uncovered new, previously unrecognized side effects of pembrolizumab. Four patients experienced adrenal insufficiency while another had hypophysitis - an inflammation of the pituitary gland. "These findings reflect a growing body of knowledge about how these drugs interact with the immune system that will lead to safer use of PD-1 inhibitors in future studies," DeMichele said. The Abramson Cancer Center is leading a new trial investigating pembrolizumab in head and neck cancer patients who are at high risk for recurrence or those with low-volume residual disease. Joshua Bauml, MD, an assistant professor of Hematology Oncology, is the principal investigator of the multi-site trial, which is currently enrolling patients. He will present an overview at the upcoming ASCO meeting (Abstract #TPS6095). "PD-1 inhibitors have already been shown to be effective in recurrent and metastatic head and neck cancer, but we want to specifically look at patients who have curable disease but are at risk for relapse," Bauml said. "In patients who have undergone front-line treatments, the standard approach calls for observation. We want to know if giving them this inhibitor can be an effective way to take an active role in preventing relapse." ### Gangadhar's research was supported by Incyte Corporation. Bauml's trial is funded by Merck, which manufactures pembrolizumab. Penn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care. Penn Medicine consists of the Raymond and Ruth Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (founded in 1765 as the nation's first medical school) and the University of Pennsylvania Health System, which together form a $6.7 billion enterprise.

Their findings also showed that adding pembrolizumab to standard therapies for breast cancer improved the number of patients achieving a pathological complete response. The results of these combination therapy studies will be presented at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in Chicago.   Pembrolizumab is an intravenous drug that targets the programmed cell death (PD-1) receptor – a protein that weakens the body’s immune response by suppressing T-cell production. The drug was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma in 2014, and trials testing its use for other cancers are ongoing. As part of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, researchers from Penn and other institutions gave patients the drug in combination with epacadostat, an indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor. The drug functions in a similar way to pembrolizumab by boosting T-cell production, but it’s taken orally and targets a different protein. It’s specifically designed to switch off IDO1, an immunosuppressive enzyme associated with tumor progression and shortened survival for patients. Researchers broke down the results by cancer type and analyzed the outcomes, including: Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma (Abstract #4503) Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (Abstract #6010) Non-small cell lung cancer (Abstract #9014) Triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer (Abstract #1103) Advanced renal cell cancers (Abstract #4515) They also looked at the drug’s general safety across multiple tumor types (Abstract #3012) “In each patient group, the combination did not add any significant increase in side effects compared to what patients experience with the PD-1 inhibitor alone,” said Tara Gangadhar, MD, an assistant professor of Hematology Oncology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who led five of the new analyses. Separate research looked at the combination of pembrolizumab with standard treatments prior to surgery for patients with high-risk breast cancer (Abstract #506). As part of the multi-institutional I-SPY 2 trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel with or without the PD-1 inhibitor. The addition of pembrolizomab tripled the pathologic complete response rate in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, with 15 of 21 responding (71.4 percent) compared to 16 of 83 (19.3 percent) in the control group. The rate doubled in patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer, with 7 of 25 responding (28 percent) compared to 13 of 88 in the control (14.8 percent). “This is incredibly exciting news for patients with aggressive cancers and the beginning of generating new and better curative options at diagnosis,” said Angela DeMichele, MD, MSCE, the Alan and Jill Miller Professor in Breast Cancer Excellence in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Chair of Trial Operations for the study. DeMichele also noted that this trial uncovered new, previously unrecognized side effects of pembrolizumab. Four patients experienced adrenal insufficiency while another had hypophysitis – an inflammation of the pituitary gland. “These findings reflect a growing body of knowledge about how these drugs interact with the immune system that will lead to safer use of PD-1 inhibitors in future studies,” DeMichele said. The Abramson Cancer Center is leading a new trial investigating pembrolizumab in head and neck cancer patients who are at high risk for recurrence or those with low-volume residual disease. Joshua Bauml, MD, an assistant professor of Hematology Oncology, is the principal investigator of the multi-site trial, which is currently enrolling patients. He will present an overview at the upcoming ASCO meeting (Abstract #TPS6095).  “PD-1 inhibitors have already been shown to be effective in recurrent and metastatic head and neck cancer, but we want to specifically look at patients who have curable disease but are at risk for relapse,” Bauml said. “In patients who have undergone front-line treatments, the standard approach calls for observation. We want to know if giving them this inhibitor can be an effective way to take an active role in preventing relapse.” Gangadhar’s research was supported by Incyte Corporation. Bauml’s trial is funded by Merck, which manufactures pembrolizumab.     ### Penn Medicine is one of the world’s leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.

Request free sample: http://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/europe-sleep-aids-market-1792/request-sample Everyone has trouble sleeping from time to timestressful life events like having to take a test the next day, or dealing with worries about home or work can keep you from falling asleep or staying asleep. Sleeping problems that happen once or twice a month can be annoying, but usually will resolve on their own. Sleep aids can't replace healthy sleep habits; good sleep practices are the foundation of proper treatment for insomnia. Especially if your insomnia is long-standing, it's important to use non-medical approaches, such as proper sleep hygiene, and cognitive behavioural treatments for insomnia. For some, a combination of medical and behavioural treatments may be the best way to manage insomnia symptoms, and for others a sleep aid is used at the beginning of treatment and behavioural techniques take over as a long-term approach. Some sleep aids are available by prescription only. This is because it's important to work with a doctor to decide on the best type, dose, and plan for taking a sleep aid. Over-the-counter sleep aids work for some people, but it's not a good idea to use these regularly for a long period of time. The best practice is to use a sleep aid with the input of your doctor.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Tropical Spastic Paraparesis Market: Technological Advancements & Global Outlook 2024 Tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) also called as HTLV-1–associated myelopathy (HAM) is a type of tropical myeloneuropathies caused by the human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV-1). Although initially described in tropical countries, TSP has also been found in temperate regions such as southern Japan. HTLV-1 virus belongs to the Retroviridae family, and preferentially infects CD4 lymphoid cells. The virus has been known to cause certain kinds of leukemia and lymphoma and is transmitted through exposure to infected blood, sexual contact, and use of illegal intravenous drugs. As the virus is also known to spread through breast milk, mothers infected with HTLV-1 virus must avoid breast feeding. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/tropical-spastic-parap… According to an article published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology in 2012, the HTLV-1 virus is prevalent in certain regions including the Southwestern part of Japan, sub-Saharan Africa and South America, the Caribbean area, and certain areas of Middle East and Australo-Melanesia. The study also estimates that 5 million to 10 million individuals have been affected globally with HTLV1 virus, however various other publications estimate the global prevalence of 10 million to 20 million. HTLV-1-associated myelopathy mostly affects the spinal cord, and results in an upper motor neurone syndrome, that usually affects lower limbs. Spastic paraparesis or paraplegia is the main characteristic of the infection. Tropical spastic paraparesis results in demyelination, inflammation and necrotic lesions in spinal cord. The progressive disease is associated with degeneration of neurons in the spinal cord, and results in gradual paralysis of the lower limbs. Other rare symptoms include optic atrophy, reduced ankle reflex and cranial nerve lesions. An article published in journal Revue Neurologique in 2012, more than 90% of the tropical spastic paraparesis cases, the neurological features involved urinary bladder disturbance, spasticity and/or hyperreflexia of the lower extremities, and lower extremity muscle weakness. Various immunoassay kits are available for diagnosis of HTLV-1 virus. Companies manufacturing such diagnostic kits include MP Biomedicals LLC, Fujirebio, Inc., Quest Diagnostics, DiaSorin S.p.A. Although the disease cannot be cured completely, medications are available for management of symptoms. Corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone are prescribed to decrease the inflammation of the spinal cord, while pain is treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Make an Enquiry @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Symptoms of urinary dysfunction can be treated by prescribing darifenacin, oxybutynin, tamsulosin, terazosin, and other drugs which reduce the activity of bladder muscles. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is currently conducting phase I clinical trials for Hu MiK-Beta-1. The investigational drug is monoclonal antibody directed toward IL-2/IL-15R-Beta Subunit which blocks IL-15 action. Washington University School of Medicine in association with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. is also conducting phase II trials for Raltegravir. Various other institutes are also conducting research programs for discovering new and effective treatment options for Tropical spastic paraparesis. Scientists have also tried antiretroviral agents for treatment of HTLV-1 infections. Gradual progress in the research activities is expected to launch more treatment drugs and expand the market in the future. Due to low and restricted geographical prevalence of the disease, the market for tropical spastic paraparesis is small. Government initiative for increasing awareness of the disease and its available treatment may curb the spread of infections. Lack of sufficient information on geographical prevalence, and epidemiology has restricted the research activities. These factors will also be responsible for a slower global market growth.

Although initially described in tropical countries, TSP has also been found in temperate regions such as southern Japan. HTLV-1 virus belongs to the Retroviridae family, and preferentially infects CD4 lymphoid cells. The virus has been known to cause certain kinds of leukemia and lymphoma and is transmitted through exposure to infected blood, sexual contact, and use of illegal intravenous drugs. As the virus is also known to spread through breast milk, mothers infected with HTLV-1 virus must avoid breast feeding. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/tropical-spastic-parap… According to an article published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology in 2012, the HTLV-1 virus is prevalent in certain regions including the Southwestern part of Japan, sub-Saharan Africa and South America, the Caribbean area, and certain areas of Middle East and Australo-Melanesia. The study also estimates that 5 million to 10 million individuals have been affected globally with HTLV1 virus, however various other publications estimate the global prevalence of 10 million to 20 million. HTLV-1-associated myelopathy mostly affects the spinal cord, and results in an upper motor neurone syndrome, that usually affects lower limbs. Spastic paraparesis or paraplegia is the main characteristic of the infection. Tropical spastic paraparesis results in demyelination, inflammation and necrotic lesions in spinal cord. The progressive disease is associated with degeneration of neurons in the spinal cord, and results in gradual paralysis of the lower limbs. Other rare symptoms include optic atrophy, reduced ankle reflex and cranial nerve lesions. An article published in journal Revue Neurologique in 2012, more than 90% of the tropical spastic paraparesis cases, the neurological features involved urinary bladder disturbance, spasticity and/or hyperreflexia of the lower extremities, and lower extremity muscle weakness. Various immunoassay kits are available for diagnosis of HTLV-1 virus. Companies manufacturing such diagnostic kits include MP Biomedicals LLC, Fujirebio, Inc., Quest Diagnostics, DiaSorin S.p.A. Although the disease cannot be cured completely, medications are available for management of symptoms. Corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone are prescribed to decrease the inflammation of the spinal cord, while pain is treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Make an Enquiry @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Symptoms of urinary dysfunction can be treated by prescribing darifenacin, oxybutynin, tamsulosin, terazosin, and other drugs which reduce the activity of bladder muscles. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is currently conducting phase I clinical trials for Hu MiK-Beta-1. The investigational drug is monoclonal antibody directed toward IL-2/IL-15R-Beta Subunit which blocks IL-15 action. Washington University School of Medicine in association with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. is also conducting phase II trials for Raltegravir. Various other institutes are also conducting research programs for discovering new and effective treatment options for Tropical spastic paraparesis.

Democratic Republic of Congo's health ministry has approved the use of a new Ebola vaccine to counter an outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever in its northeast that has killed four people, a spokesman said on Monday.   "The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medecins Sans Frontiers team that is arriving [in Congo] today to validate the protocol with the technical teams," Jonathan Simba, a health ministry spokesman, said by telephone.   The experimental vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV, was partially designed by the Canadian government and is being developed by the U.S.-based Merck & Co. It is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. Ebola vaccine success in Guinea praised by WHO chief As of Friday, Congo had registered 52 total suspected cases, including two that have been confirmed, the World Health Organization spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone, adding that the situation appears to be under control.   Simba said that the details of the vaccination campaign would be announced after a meeting of the health ministry and its partners set to take place on Monday or Tuesday.   A vaccination campaign would present logistical challenges in Congo's isolated northeastern forests, including transporting and storing the vaccine in special containers at the required minus 80 degrees Celsius.  With files from CBC News © Thomson Reuters, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Top News Headlines 'He held her and watched her die in his arms': Canadian killed in London was struck on bridge Libyan-Canadian cleric linked to Manchester bomber plans return to Canada to clear his name 'It's not going to stop me': Londoners defiant in wake of terror attack 'I lost everything': Regina couple says province's witness protection program failed them What we know about the London attack so far video Latest Health News Headlines Is sunscreen safe for kids?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Glaucoma Market Size, Share, Rising Growth, Industry Analysis & Outlook (2017-2021) Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss. The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side vision may begin to decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness, if not treated. Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent. Though, glaucoma cannot be cured completely but the disease progression can be controlled with the help of available treatments. There are three types of modalities available for treatment of glaucoma: Drugs, Laser and Invasive Surgery. Further, based upon the approaches employed for the medication, it can be segmented into two parts: PGA Medication and Non-PGA Medication. The PGA approach reduces IOP with the help of prostaglandin (PGA). The non-PGA medication can be further divided into four sub segments: Beta blockers, Alpha blockers, Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) and Combination Products. Several factors such as rising prevalence of diabetes, growing geriatric population and rising health care expenditure along with increasing disposable income and growing obese population will drive the market growth in the next few years. Development of new drugs & devices and drug therapy focused upon IOP are the few notable market trends. However, high cost of treatment, severe side effects and hasty drug approval processes act as a major roadblock for the market growth.

Now there’s a Medecins Sans Frontiers team that is arriving (in Congo) today to validate the protocol with the technical teams,” Jonathan Simba, a health ministry spokesman, said by telephone. The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and developed by Merck , is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. As of Friday, Congo had registered 52 total suspected cases, including two that have been confirmed, the World Health Organization spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone, adding that the situation appears to be under control. Simba said that the details of the vaccination campaign would be announced after a meeting of the health ministry and its partners set to take place on Monday or Tuesday. A vaccination campaign would present logistical challenges in Congo’s isolated northeastern forests, including transporting and storing the vaccine in special containers at the required minus 80 degrees Celsius.

I have used this fact several times over the years and find that it holds true. All you have to do is kill a few flies, cut their bodies into three, and put the body parts on window sills and at doors in order to avoid them flying in. A refugee camp once surrounded it's border with dead flies in order to avoid these disease carriers. My point is, this also works with mosquitoes, and is a free way of avoiding malaria, not only can property be protected in this way, but so can the individual when easily killed mosquito corpses are kept in pockets. If scientists could find the chemical given off by the dead body of a mosquito that repels others then we could have a an effective mosquito spray on our hands. (This will not work with wasps).

Biogen Idec Inc.x Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Cellectis Cellerant Therapeutics Inc. Celldex Therapeutics Eli Lilly and Co. EMD Serono Inc. Genentech Inc. Genmab AS GlaxoSmithKline ImmunoGen Inc. Immunomedics Inc. Janssen Biotech Inc. Juno Therapeutics Inc. Merck & Co., Inc. Oxford BioTherapeutics Ltd. Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc. Roche Holdings Inc. Seattle Genetics Inc. Sorrento Therapeutics Inc Kite Pharma Novartis Executive Summary Prior to the launching of Yervoy, the five-year survival rate for patients with early stage melanoma was 98%; but the five-year survival rate for late-stage melanoma was just 16%. Yervoy has been reported to have a survival rate of 25% when tested alone. When tested as part of a combination therapy treatment with Bristol’s nivolumab, the two-year survival rates rose to 88% for patients with late-stage cancer. Increase in patient survival rates brought about by cancer immunotherapy treatment is similar to that seen when bone marrow transplantation changed our conception on how blood cancer was treated.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Wednesday that it could not recommend routine use of the medicine in newly diagnosed patients, given the drug's high cost and uncertainties about overall survival benefits. But the agency backed Keytruda use within the Cancer Drugs Fund, signalling that it had the potential to satisfy the criteria for routine use on the National Health Service (NHS) for this group of patients but needs more investigation. The decision follows data presented at a medical meeting last year showing that Keytruda could help lung cancer patients whose tumours have a high level of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. Keytruda is already approved as a cost-effective second-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have previously taken chemotherapy but no longer respond. MSD, as Merck is known outside North America, has agreed to provide Keytruda to the NHS at an undisclosed discount.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE As Novartis considers asset sales that could raise $50 billion, investors are worried any cash raised may give the Swiss drugmaker firepower for another unsuccessful megadeal. Novartis's $52 billion takeover of U.S.-based eye care giant Alcon, completed in 2011, saddled it with a business whose sales and profit have faltered two years running. Now, Chief Executive Joe Jimenez is reviewing Alcon's surgical devices and contact lens businesses, suggesting they could be valued at $25-$35 billion if he unloads them. The American CEO is also considering disposal of a roughly $14 billion stake in cross-town rival Roche, as well as his over-the-counter (OTC) drugs venture with GlaxoSmithKline , worth some $10 billion. Given Alcon missteps, however, investors are wary about arming Novartis with a pile of cash, for fear managers eager to refocus on cancer drugs as they address a sales hit from patent expiries might blunder into a big takeover. "We would applaud selling those stakes, generally," said Stephen Anness of Invesco Perpetual, Novartis's 23rd largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. "But what do you do with that money?" Anness said. "I would be very cautious about selling stakes...in things to raise a war-chest to go and do a massive deal, only for that deal to go and be another poor deal." To be sure, Jimenez has said Novartis's M&A focus remains on smaller transactions, including lower-risk drug licensing deals, ranging up to $5 billion. Still, Jimenez has not dismissed the notion of a larger transaction. He suggested last year the Roche stake - amassed during former chairman and CEO Daniel Vasella's unrequited merger aspirations two decades ago - could be sold once another, potentially more significant transaction is lined up to absorb the proceeds. "We're always monitoring what's going on but have not changed our position regarding our M&A strategy or potential disposals," Novartis spokesman Michael Willi told Reuters. Novartis, which is holding a two-day investor event in Boston yesterday and today, has portfolio holes a major deal could help fill. Where rivals including Roche, Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb have immuno-oncology drugs (I-O) on the market for a range of cancers, Novartis has only investigational molecules in this hot new therapy area. Speculation that Novartis might buy AstraZeneca sparked a brief jump in the British company's stock last year. There has also been talk of its interest in Bristol-Myers.

Of these, the segment of combination drugs is presently the leading segment. It accounted for a 54% of the U.S. and China asthma and COPD drugs market in 2015 and is expected to continue to dominate throughout the report’s forecast period. Combination drugs benefit from the recommendations from agencies such as Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), which regard combination drugs as the safer course of managing asthma and COPD. The segment of monoclonal antibodies is expected to emerge as a prominent drug class for the management of asthma and COPD in the next few years.

Companion animals include pets such as dogs, cats and horses; although in recent years the market has expanded reasonably for avian pets, reptiles and exotic fish. The healthcare products have transformed the health and quality of life for millions of pets across the world. The greatest challenge of maintaining pets is seeking the keenness to understand if an animal is sick and creating the proper diagnostic tests to look out for the most likely illness that affects the animal. Due to environmental factors such as the weather, flora and fauna in the immediate vicinity, each veterinary medical professional has to rely on knowledge of the surroundings and each case of illness in different region presents specific challenges for treatment. Meanwhile, the range of products for animal health keep increasing with newer anti-infectives, anti-bacterials, anti-parasitics, reproductive aids, prosthetics, and topical solutions and imaging devices. This report focuses on the global emerging demand for companion animal healthcare products. Conventionally the companion animal segment received low attention due to sheer lack of volume associated since only households with stable income. In 2012, U.S. households had approximately 160 million pets and spent close to US$ 500 annually on preliminary veterinary visits and can spend up to US$ 10,000 for taking care of serious illnesses. Surgeries such as cataract and insulin injections along with pain management medications are a regular norm now. Yet, this is a stark picture in front of the actual potential worldwide, since a significant percentage of households in developing countries and negligible number of welfare and adoption centres. There are over 10,000 animal shelters across North America and EU5, and maintain health of companion animals such as dogs and cats. The annual expenditure on healthcare products of a shelter housing 30-40 animals spends approximately US$ 50,000 annually to operate whereas large sized shelters that can handle over 1000 animals spend approximately US$ 500,000 each year. In emerging countries, awareness of animal illnesses is increasing drastically prompting significant expenditure for animal care.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Antibacterial Drugs Market: Business Challenges, Emerging Technologies & Competitive Landscape A new market research study, titled “Antibacterial Drugs Market – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2015 – 2023,” has been published by Transparency Market Research. As per the study, in 2014, the global antibacterial drugs market was worth US$43.9 bn. The market is projected to exhibit a 1.30% CAGR between 2015 and 2023, declining in value to touch US$38.9 bn by the end of 2023. An antibacterial drug is an antimicrobial agent that interferes with the reproduction and growth of bacteria. The growth of this bacteria can cause severe infections in animals and humans. The administration of antibacterial drugs helps in inhibiting the growth of the bacteria or completely killing it. At present, several antibacterial drugs in different formulations are available and are widely used for treating tuberculosis, legionellosis, like pneumonia, diarrhea, diphtheria, tetanus, and other diseases. Some of the prominent consumers of the global antibacterial drugs market are private clinics, hospitals, patients, and physicians. This 110 page report gives readers a comprehensive overview of the antibacterial drugs market. Browse through 9 data tables and 40 figures to unlock the hidden opportunities in this market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antibacterial-drugs-ma… The growing prevalence of infections and other diseases across the globe and increasing government support for research and development activities are some of the key drivers of the global antibacterial drugs market. However, the upcoming patent expirations and growth in drug-resistant species are projected to curtail the growth of the market in the coming years. The decline in the markets valuations will primarily be attributable to this negative factor. In 2014, the β-lactams segment accounted for a 58% share in the global antibacterial drugs market and is estimated to be in the topmost position in the next few years. In the same year, the quinolones segment accounted for a 17% share in the global market and is expected to exhibit negative growth rate in the forecast period. Furthermore, the miscellaneous antibacterial segment is projected to witness significant growth owing to the growing demand for therapies against bacterial infections and rising geriatric population. The strong pipeline in the global antibacterial drugs market includes RHB-105, Eravacycline, Ozenoxacin, Arikace, Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009), Surotomycin (MK-4261), SYM-1219, Solithromycin (CEM-101), Plazomycin, Ciprofloxacin/Fluocinolone Acetonide, SPL7013, Actoxumab/Aezlotoxumab, (MK-3415A), Omadacycline (PTK-0796), Zempia (E-101), Cadazolid, Delafloxacin, and Delamanid. The major players are making constant efforts to commercialize these drugs, which is estimated to propel the global antibacterial drugs market in the near future. At present, Asia Pacific accounts for the largest share in the global antibacterial drugs market and is projected to grow at a fast pace throughout the forecast period. The rapid growth of this region can be attributed to the strong presence of generic pharmaceutical ingredients and generic manufacturers, a growing geriatric population, and expanding population. In addition, the growing incidence of several bacterial infections including MRSA and TB, developing healthcare infrastructure, and rising purchasing power of consumers are some of the other factors anticipated to drive global antibacterial drugs market in the coming years. Request a sample of this report to know what opportunities will emerge in the rapidly evolving antibacterial drugs market during 2015 – 2023: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Asia Pacific is followed by North America and Europe. These regions are expected to witness sluggish growth throughout the forecast period. The slow-paced growth of the North America and Europe antibacterial drugs markets can be attributed to the strict regulatory requirements, market maturity, and shortened product lifecycle. The prominent players engaged in the global antibacterial drugs market include Bayer AG, Forest Laboratories, Inc., Allergan plc, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca plc, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly & Co., Novartis AG, Merck & Co., Inc., and Pfizer, Inc. These players are leading the overall market and witnessing intense competition amongst each other. Among these players, Pfizer, Inc. is considered as a dominant player owing to its significant contribution towards the global antibacterial drugs market.

Research and Markets 29 May, 2017, 09:45 ET Share this article Dublin, May 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Drug and Devices Market - Analysis and Forecast 2017-2023 (Focus on Device Type, Drug Type, Market Share Analysis, Patent Landscape and Country Analysis)" report to their offering. The GERD market is mainly driven by the dearth of treatment options. Most of the blockbuster drugs have gone off patent paving way for the generic & OTC products in the market. Due to low safety, efficacy & poor reimbursement of devices & procedures, these are not popular among physicians & patients alike. The lack of new regulatory approved medication as well as limited acceptability of devices are the major limitations of the market. The drug market is occupied by generics & OTC products. By drug class, the market can be classified into antacids, proton pump inhibitors (PPI), histamine-2 receptor blockers (H2RA), prokinetics & complementary & alternative medicines. The antacid class has the largest market share as they provide quick relief and are available over-the-counter. The PPIs constitute the next major market share & are the first line treatment in moderate to severe GERD. H2RA are also prescribed in combination with PPIs or alone where required. The long term use of PPIs is associated with increased risk of bone fractures, low magnesium absorption, C.difficile infections etc. This is prompting patients to look for other treatment options. With the advent of generics & OTC products the growth in GERD drugs market has decreased. The absence of patent protected & new regulatory approved medicines are the restraints for the growth of this market. The global GERD drugs market has a low growth potential in future and will account to $5.38 billion by 2023. Due to side effects of drugs on long term use, patients who fail to respond to medication & the availability of new technology, the device market is set to grow in future. The market is dominated by drugs as they are the first line treatment for the early & mild cases of GERD. But the number of drugs in the pipeline are less & market is well established in the drugs segment. The GERD Therapy Market is divided into drugs & devices segment based on product type. The drugs segment is an established market offering antacids, PPIs, H2RAs & prokinetics. The drugs market will not show much growth in future due to loss of patent protection & absence of novel treatment options. The device segment is growing at a CAGR of 15.3% from 2017 to 2023. The devices can be categorised into invasive & non-invasive treatment procedures. Currently available devices are MUSE, LINX reflux device, Stretta & GERD-X among others. The devices are classified as invasive & non-invasive based on the procedures followed. Invasive procedures include LINX management system & MUSE while the non-invasive include EsophyX, Endostim, Stretta, Durasphere, GERD-X. The diagnostic devices include Bravo reflux management system & Digitrapper. The key players in the device market are Endogastric Solutions, Medigus Ltd., Medtronic Plc, Carbon Medical technologies, Johnson & Johnson etc. The gold standard in surgery for the treatment of GERD is Nissen Fundoplication. Among all the geographical regions, North America has the highest GERD prevalence of 18.1-27.8%. In North America, the U.S. has the highest prevalence of 26.2%. Asia pacific has lower prevalence of 5-17%. The eastern countries have a lower prevalence rate than the western countries. North America is the highest revenue generating market with a value of $2.21 billion in 2016. The region is expected to grow at a CAGR of 0.3% for the forecast period from 2017 to 2023. RoW has the highest CAGR for the same forecast period.

Considerable progress in the animal health biotechnology took place recently when biotechnology applications were utilized in both detecting and treating various infectious and parasitic diseases of animals. This has led to the development of a range of applications and procedures, which will benefit both domestic and wild animals. This will also improve the health of various companion animals, help in improving sporting animals’ performance and the productivity of farm animals. However, the globalised trade in live animals, animal products, and their feeds is leading to a continuously increasing threat of infectious diseases worldwide. Thus, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) emphasizes the importance of very rapid, accurate, highly specific and sensitive detection and identification of infectious agents; and prompt and effective control of those diseases. Obtain Report Details @www.transparencymarketresearch.com/animal-health-biotechn… Animal Health Biotechnology Market: Current Outlook Presently, various reagents and diagnostic techniques have been developed, which are more specific, sensitive, rapid, reproducible and robust that have been updated through recent discoveries in biochemistry, immunology and molecular biology (monoclonal antibodies, nucleic probes, DNA amplification and others). The development of new vaccines, such as subunit vaccines, synthetic vaccines, recombinant vaccines and anti-idiotype vaccines, which combine efficacy, innocuity, duration of protection, ease of use, stability and multivalence. The availability of new anti-parasitic and anti-infective agents and immunomodulatory therapeutic agents specifies that biotechnology is continuing to find new applications in the field of animal health. These new vaccines, diagnostic techniques, and therapeutic substances will add to the knowledge, which, in future, will extend to the development of transgenic animals with improved genetic potential and will be more disease resistant and more productive at the same time. Thus, the most important objective of animal health biotechnology is to serve human healthcare as well as its environment at the same time.
