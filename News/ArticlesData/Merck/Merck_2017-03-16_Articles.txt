Merck will initially focus on diabetes, a chronic, progressive disease that currently affects 415 million people around the world. “Merck has a deep heritage of tackling chronic diseases through our medicines, and we have been expanding into other ways to help, beyond the pill.” said Kimberly Park, vice president, Customer Strategy & Innovation, Global Human Health, Merck. “We are excited to leverage the AWS Cloud to find innovative ways to leverage digital solutions, such as voice-activated technology, to help support better outcomes that could make a difference in the lives of those suffering from chronic conditions like diabetes.” “We are pleased to work with Merck to explore how Merck can use the AWS Cloud to help create new solutions within health care that can connect people with information to help improve management of their own health” said Steve Halliwell, director of health care and life sciences, AWS. This collaboration will leverage the expertise of both organizations — Merck’s expertise in epidemiology, drug development, observational research, medication adherence and patient education programs, and Amazon’s expertise in web services, connected devices and voice interfaces. In addition, Merck is sponsoring an open innovation challenge that calls on developers to create a skill for Alexa, the cloud-based voice service that powers the Amazon Echo, to help support people living with diabetes. - See more at: http://www.merck.com/about/featured-stories/merck-amazon.html#sthash.ILj3s1HK.dpuf Life Sciences Related Reads Bright Computing Releases Version 7.3 of Bright Cluster Manager™ and Bright OpenStack™ GPU-Accelerated Cloud Computing Gets Boost With New Amazon AWS Instances 'Smart Speakers' Are Angling to Colonize Your Living Room Novartis, Pfizer Cut Prices to Win UK Approval for Cancer Drugs Advertisement Advertisement View the discussion thread.

Not surprisingly, opinions concerning what went wrong with the Global Fund's executive director selection process vary, depending on who you ask. Many of the people we spoke to in preparation for this article - including Board delegations - were reluctant to comment at all, let alone publicly. Therefore, this article reflects our own observations, those of stakeholders that either spoke publicly or submitted comments to the Board, and those of journalists and other commentators. The Global Fund Board was expected to choose a new E. D. at its retreat on 27-28 February. Its Executive Director Nomination Committee (EDNC) had submitted a final report listing and ranking three names, in the follow order: Dr Muhammad Ali Pate, a visiting scholar at Harvard's Chan School of Public health, a former World Bank health specialist, and a former health minister of Nigeria; Subhanu Saxena, a drug executive who in August 2016 stepped down as chief executive of Cipla, a major Indian pharmaceutical company; and Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and a former prime minister of New Zealand. As everyone knows by now, the Board did not select anyone and decided instead to re-launch its search process. So, what went wrong? One thing everyone seems to agree on is that the process was too rushed. The selection process was approved by the Board on 16 November 2017. (The process is described on the Fund's website here.) The goal was to have the new E.D. selected by 1 March. That's 105 days or three-and-a-half months (including the year-end holidays). In comparison, in 2012, the process that resulted in the selection of Mark Dybul as E.D. took 187 days, or just over six months. Given that Dr Dybul informed the Board two years ago that he would be leaving at the end of his term (on 31 May 2017), why did it take so long for the Board to launch a process to find a new executive director? In a post on the website of Humanosphere, an independent non-profit news organization, on 2 March, Tom Murphy referred to the selection process as a "train wreck." He identified three main causes: leaks; questions of conflicts of interest; and a generally disappointed response to the finalists. Let's look at each one in turn. Leaks There definitely were leaks. Scores of people appear to have had a copy of the extremely confidential final report of the EDNC almost as soon as it was delivered to Board members and alternates on 13 February. One of those people was Donald McNeil, veteran New York Times reporter. McNeil revealed the names of the three finalists in an article on 15 February. He said that all three candidates might not be palatable, for different reasons, to the U.S., which is by far the Fund's largest donor. A number of media outlets picked up on McNeil's story. Some of them added to it as more information became available, primarily through other leaks. Writing in ScienceInsider on 27 February, Jon Cohen quoted one person familiar with the Board's deliberations as saying that "there were real concerns that because of the leaks, the process wasn't fair." The leak of the final report of the EDNC certainly appeared to destabilize the process. Shortly after the report was leaked, Helen Clark, who was ranked third by the EDNC, withdrew her name from the race. She stated it was because she had concerns about the process. Some observers speculated that it was because she had been ranked in last place. Whether or not the leak of the final report was responsible for Ms Clark pulling out of the race, it did not paint the Global Fund in a good light. A process that was intended to be done very much in private had now become public, without the safeguards that presumably would have accompanied a public process, had a public process been intended. Conflicts of interest Various conflicts of interest were alleged. In his article, Murphy said that Subhanu Saxena's ties to the pharmaceutical industry posed a potential conflict of interest because the Global Fund works with governments and drug-makers to set favorable prices to purchase life-saving drugs. (Mr Saxena was, until recently, CEO of Cipla, a large pharmaceutical company for whom the Global Fund has been a major customer.) An anonymous email sent to the board said that Mohammed Pate had a possible conflict of interest because he serves on the advisory board of Merck for Mothers; and because the current executive director, Mark Dybul sits on the board of Pate's Big Win Philanthropy Foundation. There was an implication in the allegations that the EDNC had failed to identify or consider these conflicts of interest. However, in a memo to Board members sent on 18 February, Jan Paehler, Chair of the EDNC, refuted the allegations. With regards to Saxena, Paehler said that it was inaccurate to assert that the EDNC did not consider his past role as CEO of Cipla. Paehler said that the committee "carefully considered and discussed" this factor. "Having a prior role as a private sector supplier to the Global Fund does not represent a current or future conflict of interest..." Paehler added that the role of Dr Pate serving on the advisory board of Merck for Mothers "was in fact disclosed and carefully evaluated and discussed by the Committee, with guidance from the Ethics Officer. To assert otherwise is inaccurate." Finally, concerning Dr Dybul, Paehler said that the committee was also made aware that he served on the board of Pate's Foundation and that "to assert otherwise is inaccurate." Response to the finalists The third cause of what Tom Murphy called the "train wreck" was "a generally disappointed response to the finalists." Various commentators echoed the concerns raised in Donald McNeil's New York Times article that all three finalists might be unpalatable to the U.S. In addition, in a post on Devex, a media platform for the global development community, on 24 February, Michael Igoe said that Devex had spoken to several "well-placed" global health and development leaders about their impressions of the finalists. "Each expressed mixed feelings and some disappointment that the selection process had not generated candidates known for visionary global health leadership." Other concerns about the process "The board is committed to a process that adheres to the highest possible standards, and is fair, transparent, merit-based, and conducted with due diligence and professionalism," Board Chair Norbert Hauser said in a news release. However, the process was far from transparent, as Tom Murphy pointed out in his article. Information about the status of the candidates came to light through leaks, not official releases by the Global Fund. Clark's withdrawal was in part due to the way the process unfolded, Mr Murphy said. In a letter to Mr Hauser, believed to have been sent on 14 February, Ms. Clark said: "I have had concerns for some time now that the appointment of a senior strategic leader, as envisaged in the terms of reference for the position that were approved by the Fund's Board, was not likely to be the outcome of the manner in which the process of selection has been undertaken to date. "The report of the Nomination Committee to the Board, which I have seen today, bears out my concern. I do not believe the process undertaken has prioritized the broad skill set envisaged in the TOR. The due diligence process undertaken to date has contributed to the failure to which I refer. It has concentrated on superficialities rather than having had regard to relevant and publicly available information on, for example, the performance, values, and social media history of candidates." The most thorough analysis of what went wrong came from John Zarocostas, writing on 7 March in an article in The Lancet. Mr Zarocostas cited the head of a major Geneva-based U.N. agency as saying "given the process was tainted, the Global Fund Board had no alternative but to restart the proceedings." According to Mr Zarocostas, a health aid executive tracking the Board developments said that an anonymous email to the Board criticizing the shortlisting of Pate and Saxena and the poor due diligence of the process, plus a leak of the selection committee report to the New York Times, were to blame for poisoning the proceedings. Mr Zarocostas reported that several diplomats and executives of health advocacy groups underscored that "due diligence had not been done thoroughly," in what he said was a veiled criticism of Russell Reynolds Associates (RRA), the executive search firm commissioned to assist the Nomination Committee. In addition, Mr Zarocostas cited a source close to the Board as saying that "there was wide agreement across the board [that] the selection process had been too speedy, there had been an inability to do due diligence, and new information had come to light." As a result, the source said that there was a strong sense the board felt the process had "not given them full confidence to proceed." The withdrawal of one candidate, the source said, contributed to the board's impasse. Mr Zarocostas quoted a global health consultant as saying that the outcome indicates each of the finalists faced a "blocking minority" and that a consensus could not be reached. (Under the Board's rules, candidates need to secure a two-thirds majority from both the implementer and donor constituencies.) Finally, Mr Zarocostas quotes Ellen 't Hoen, a researcher in the Global Health Unit, University Medical Center, Groningen University, Netherlands, as saying: "I think considering the financial support for the Global Fund depends on public support, the more transparency the better." She noted that the World Health Organization's selection process for its Director-General "used to be opaque" but "now you can follow developments, and get an idea of the candidates." She said that the process to select a new leader for the Global Fund should be the same. On 20 February, Allan Maleche and Natlya Nizova, respectively Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board's Implementer Group (ImG), sent a letter to the Board leadership in which they said that the implementer constituencies "expressed grave concern" about the process because "key facts" about candidates were missed. "It is difficult to assess how much was missed, "the ImG said, "because the due diligence outlined in the Executive Director Selection Process information note was not included or even referenced in the EDNC final report." (The information note said that in the EDNC's final report, the due diligence process would be described in detail. The process included steps such as interviews with the candidates conducted by the search firm, RRA; the referencing done by RRA; and psychometric testing carried out by an independent expert on the three finalists.) "The decision to keep the names of the short-listed candidates out of the public eye, always a challenge for the Fund, then led to media attention and stakeholder questions that have also not enhanced the institution's reputation," the ImG said. In its letter, the ImG recommended that a new search be undertaken and that a much more open process be used. The letter said that the public should be more engaged with the process, and that this could be achieved by announcing publicly the names of the short-listed candidates; holding a public Q&A session with the candidates; holding a town hall for Secretariat staff; and providing regular updates on the selection and nomination process. (The ImG letter has not been made public. However, in his second article on the E.D. selection, Donald McNeil of the New York Times cited parts of the ImG letter.) In an earlier article in The Lancet (on 22 February), Mr Zarocostas said that "the opaque nature of the Global Fund's selection procedure has come under criticism by both major donor members and health community advocates." Writing in the Center for Global Development's Global Health Policy blog, Amanda Glassman said that "although the Global Fund is lawfully a private Swiss Foundation, its Board should not act as such. Advocates exert strong influence over the Global Fund through the media and big donors have veto - so its E.D. selection process should acknowledge the realpolitik and vet candidates broadly and in the public domain, while giving due consideration to candidates' capacity to navigate difficult political and financial headwinds." A person familiar with the deliberations of the Board said that concerns were expressed about the short list being too short. In its final report, the EDNC submitted only three names (from a pool of more than140 candidates). The committee had been mandated to submit up to four names. During the deliberations, there were suggestions that when the new search process is launched, the nomination committee should be mandated to submit five names. This person said that concerns were expressed about the fact that the short-listed candidates were ranked in the EDNC's final report. It was felt that this may have contributed to the decision by the third-ranked candidate, Helen Clark, to withdraw from the race. The EDNC had not been asked to rank the candidates. In a statement released on 29 February, the Communities Delegation to the Board said that as the Board reopens the search process, it will be "closely monitoring" the situation to ensure that the process engages a more diverse group of stakeholders, including communities and civil society, when reference checks are done; and to ensure that the process includes information on the candidates' history of working in human rights, gender equality and community systems strengthening. In John Decostas' 7 March article in The Lancet, an executive from a major European advocacy group fighting AIDS, speaking on the condition of non-attribution, is quoted as saying, "We are looking for a candidate with a broad global health background, strong managerial experience, and an ability to raise funds."

Do Adamas Pharmaceuticals and Amicus Therapeutics have the potential to power your portfolio higher? David Liang (Pfoolishly) Mar 16, 2017 at 10:41AM With literally hundreds of biotech and pharmaceutical stocks to choose from, most investors either buy the well-known names (Johnson & Johnson, Gilead, Merck) or an index (IBB, VHT). However, for the investor willing to go the extra mile, a little bit of digging often results in the discovery of diamonds in the rough. Two such potential gems in today's market are small cap biotech firms Adamas Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ADMS) and Amicus Therapeutics (NASDAQ:FOLD) Adamas Pharmaceuticals Adamas Pharmaceuticals is a small-cap pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics targeting disorders of the central nervous system. Their lead product in development is ADS-5102, a product being studied for Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia (LID) associated with Parkinson's disease. In December 2015 and April 2016, Adamas released positive data from two separate phase 3 studies of ADS-5102 for the treatment of LID. Image source: Getty Images. Parkinson's disease is a life-threatening neurodegenerative illness characterized by a progressive decrease in patient motor functions. The disease impacts an estimated 1 million Americans. While the combination treatment of oral levodopa (LD) and carbidopa (CD) is considered the "gold-standard" in Parkinson's treatment, there are several shortcomings with this current method of care.Due to the nature of its oral administration, oral LD/CD suffers from a short half-life as well as low absorption/availability within the body. This results in LD levels within the patient to fluctuate wildly -- leading to erratic "off" and "on" periods in which the patient experiences a loss of motor control. Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia (LID) is a movement disorder that frequently occurs in patients with Parkinson's disease after long‑term treatment with levodopa. Patients with LID suffer from involuntary non‑purposeful movements and reduced control over voluntary movements. Adamas estimates that over time, approximately 90% of patients on levodopa treatment will develop LID. As of today, there are no drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of LID. In April of 2015, ADMS received Orphan Drug Status for ADS-5102, guaranteeing 7 years of market exclusivity. The company submitted ADS-5102 to the FDA in October of last year and is set to receive a decision by August 24th of this year. While companies with neither revenues nor official FDA approval are notoriously difficult to price, analysts have pegged annual prices between $5,000 and $10,000 per annual treatment -- making this a potentially blockbuster indication. Amicus Therapeutics Amicus Therapeutics is a small-cap biotech focused on the orphan (i.e. ultra-rare) disease space. The company's only commercial product is Galafold (migalastat), an orally administered drug for the treatment of Fabry disease, a rare genetic disorder which affects an estimated 5,000 patients worldwide. While this is a small total patient population, due to the disease's orphan nature, this single indication could be worth as much as $1.2 billion. Fabry disease is a genetic disorder caused by an enzyme malfunction that allows a type of fat called GL-3 to accumulate in cells. Over time, this disease has a progressively negative effect on the kidneys. Currently, the disease is treated with what are called enzyme replacement therapies (ERT's). The two ERT's available are Replagel, which is marketed by Shire in Europe, and Fabrazyme, which is sold by Sanofi in the U.S. and EU. These treatments function by replacing the enzyme alpha-gal A, which is missing or damaged in patients with Fabry disease. For full year 2016, Replagel and Fabrazyme's sales totaled $453 million and $747 million, respectively. Rather than competing versus these therapies, Galafold has a different mechanism of action. Galafold binds to and stabilizes alpha-gal A which improves the enzyme's ability to break down GL-3. However, Galafold is only effective in a certain range of mutations for the disease -- making it potentially effective in 35% to 50% of the overall Fabry disease population. In May of last year, Galafold was approved in Europe for treatment of Fabry disease. However, following this good news, in a somewhat questionable decision, the FDA requested more trial data before approving Galafold for commercial sale in the U.S. With the follow-up clinical trial not set to complete until 2019 and FDA decision by 2020, investors will have to wait a while for U.S. approval. While the delay of U.S. approval is disappointing, the U.S. only represents around a fourth to a third of the overall Fabry market -- and management believes the EU could represent the other two-thirds. Doing a back-of-the-napkin calculation, with an estimated price tag of $200,000 per treatment, and an estimated 3,500 patients in the EU, and being able to treat between 35% to 50% of these patients, the overall European market comes in at between $245 million and $350 million annually. The better buy? In terms of size, while Amicus is currently trading at just a billion dollar market cap, this is still substantially larger than Adamas' $400 million valuation. However, I believe this valuation is justified as Adamas' product has not been approved in any country, while Galafold has been approved in the EU. While I believe Adamas may have the potential to offer investors a higher return in the future, it's generally the safer choice to go with the company whose drug is already on the market -- and Amicus has several other irons in the fire as well. One pipeline candidate that stands out to me is Zorblisa, an orphan disease drug that could potentially treat up to 40,000 patients globally. The company is also progressing a product known as ATB200-02 into early stage clinical trials for Pompe disease. For these reasons, I believe Amicus has some additional optionality not baked into the stock price with the potential to substantially reward long-term shareholders. While I believe both companies have strong upside potential, I'd call Amicus the better buy today.   David Liang owns shares of Adamas Pharmaceuticals.

An EPA is a document that allows you (the "donor" of the EPA) to appoint another person (your "attorney") to make decisions on your behalf in case you are later incapable of making those decisions yourself. There are two types of EPA - EPAs in relation to property, and EPAs in relation to personal care and welfare. There are some differences between when each type of EPA can come into effect, and who can be appointed as your attorney. From 16 March 2017, new EPAs must be made using the new forms to ensure they comply with changes to the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 and the Protection of Personal and Property Rights (Enduring Powers of Attorney Forms and Prescribed Information) Regulations 2008. The new forms include an option to revoke EPAs you have previously made. Also, as a donor, you will now be able to revoke the appointment of an attorney without revoking your entire EPA, as long as you are competent to make that decision and have named a successor attorney who can take over. Authorised witnesses to the donor’s signature to an EPA must use the new witness certificate. They will need to certify, in addition to current requirements, that the donor understands the nature of the instrument, the potential risks and consequences, and is not acting under duress. Authorised witnesses may use the standard explanation to help explain the effects and implications of the EPA to their clients. It will now be possible for the same authorised witness to be the witness for two people who are making each other their attorney, as long as the authorised witness is satisfied that doing so constitutes no more than a negligible conflict of interest. Health practitioners determining whether somebody is capable of making decisions in relation to their property or their personal care and welfare no longer have to use a prescribed form of medical certificate. However, they must ensure that their certificate includes the information prescribed in regulation 5 of the Regulations.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 March 2017 by Military News Market Research on Controlled-Release Drug Delivery Technology Market 2017 and Analysis to 2027 Specific focus on the quality-by-design (QbD) approaches for the robust design of dosage forms is expected to change the future landscape of controlled-release drug delivery technologies.  While conventional hydrophilic matrix based technologies such as Accuform are being used in the market for several years, recent advancements in the development of oral drug delivery systems such as gastro-retentive drug delivery for controlled release, buoyant systems, mucoadhesive systems for regulated release of anti-viral medications etc. would increase the penetration of controlled-release drug delivery technologies in the global pharmaceuticals market. Acuform polymer-based patented technology is widely being used in a number of controlled-release formulations such as NUCYNTA ER, Gralise (Depomed Inc.), Janumet XR (Merck), Glumetza (Salix Pharmaceuticals) etc. Wurster coating technology is being used in the drug coating for controlled release of drug since 1976. Corplex transdermal technology has largely been commercialized in P&G’s Crest product line. Plenty of new controlled-release technologies are in phase to be commercialized in next few years. For instance, MicroCor PTH using MicroCor transdermal technology is being evaluated in phase IIa.  OROS technology which delivers drug in controlled manneris being used in more than 17 commercially available drugs. In case of oral controlled drug delivery, elderly persons and pediatrics constitute the large proportion of consumers for controlled-release drugs due to increase adherence to dosage regime. Some of the commercially available medications using controlled-release drug delivery technology include Prozac (polymer matrix based system), Avinza (polymer coating), Capoten (enzyme activated system), GLUCOPHAGE XR (polymer matrix based system), Alza (osmotically activated system) etc. Controlled-Release Drug Delivery Technology Market: Drivers and Restraints The global market for controlled-release drug delivery technology is driven by increasing the need for pediatric controlled release dosage forms, high acceptance of CR dosage forms due to once-a-daily dosing nature, etc. However, some of the major factors restraining the global market for controlled-release drug delivery technology are fewer excipients are deemed acceptable for pediatric use, the requirement of a high dose of API, promising development of CR dosage forms that impart abuse resistance, a higher price of controlled-release systems compared with traditional pharmaceutical formulations, etc. Moreover, some of the biopharmaceutical challenges for development of controlled-release drug delivery systems such as establishing desired release profiles for new chemical entities, risk management of dose dumping, selection of biocompatible and biodegradable materials with desired controlled-release properties, etc. Request Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-2833 Controlled-Release Drug Delivery Technology Market: Segmentation The global controlled-release drug delivery technology market has been segmented on the basis of technology, release mechanism, application, and geography.

March 16, 2017 7:32am NYSE:PJP ShareTweet From Zacks: 2016 turned out to be a challenging year for pharma stocks with the sector facing a lot of criticism for rising drug prices. Although the election results provided a breather for the sector on hopes that drug pricing would not be a key focus area under a Donald Trump presidency, the relief rally turned out to be short-lived with the President clarifying his stand on rising drug prices. Trump’s statements about not liking price increases and the industry “getting away with murder” ensured that drug pricing is an issue that will remain in the limelight this year as well. Another factor that weighed on pharma stocks is the noticeably lower number of FDA approvals in 2016. Last year, only 22 treatments gained FDA approval, well below 45 approvals in 2015 and 41 in 2014. The industry was also hit by some high profile R&D failures as well as mixed results, slower-than-expected new product launches and increasing competition. All these factors led to a 9.7% decline in the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index in 2016. Will the Drug Approval Process Speed Up? At a meeting with pharma majors earlier this year, President Trump spoke about speeding up the FDA approval process. The President said that the FDA will be streamlined and the drug approval process will be much faster. The recently signed 21st Century Cures Act is a step in this direction. With the passing of this Act, expectations are that there will be more innovation in the sector and, maybe, a surge in new drug approvals. Some of the key drugs currently under FDA review with decisions expected in the next few months include Sanofi/Regeneron’s dupilumab (atopic dermatitis), AstraZeneca’s ZS-9, ARIAD’s brigatinib (cancer), Tesaro’s niraparib (cancer) and Lilly/Incyte’s investigational rheumatoid arthritis treatment, baricitinib. M&As to Pick Up in 2017? There has been a lot of consolidation in the pharma industry over the last few years with quite a few deals being announced/completed in 2016. Expectations are high that M&As will increase as the year progresses — potential tax reform and cash repatriation are expected to lead to a boost in this area. We could see several M&A agreements being announced in the coming quarters though companies are wary of bidding wars leading to over-priced deals. Companies with innovative technologies and pipelines are highly sought after. Niche disease areas like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), immuno-oncology and multiple sclerosis are in demand. Treatments for orphan diseases are also much sought after with quite a few deals being signed in these areas. Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large pharma companies look to cut costs and streamline operations. Most of these companies are re-evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs with an unfavorable risk-benefit profile. Catalyst Rich 2017 Pharma companies continue to work on bringing innovative new treatments to market, and there could be significant catalysts in the coming quarters in the form of important new product approvals as well as major data read-outs especially in key therapeutic areas like immuno-oncology, Alzheimer’s, central nervous system disorders, and immunology/inflammation. Meanwhile, sales of products that gained approval over the last two years as well as line extensions should ramp up and boost growth. Pharma ETFs in Focus Highlighted below are some pharma ETFs – ETFs present a low-cost and convenient way to get a diversified exposure to the sector.

The Cambridge biotech said Thursday that it’s planning to launch a new clinical trial aimed at winning approval of the treatment in the United States. The drug is based on bacteria from the human microbiome — an army of trillions of microorganisms — to fight a stubborn intestinal infection known as clostridium difficile, or C. diff, the most common hospital-acquired infection. Advertisement After the summer findings showed the experimental drug failed to reduce risk of the infection recurring for up to eight weeks, Seres shares sank by nearly 70 percent. But despite the setback, the company has continued to move forward with its drug development programs. It had 127 employees at the end of last year, up from 87 a year earlier, according to regulatory filings. Seres, which raised $134 million in a high-profile 2015 initial public offering, had been viewed as a pioneer in so-called bugs-to-drugs development after it reported positive results from an early-stage clinical study.

Sign up for more newsletters here Chief executive Roger Pomerantz said in an interview that he has now reached agreement with Food and Drug Administration regulators on the design of a new mid-stage study that could demonstrate the drug’s effectiveness in a larger group of patients and provide the “pivotal” data that would support FDA approval of the treatment, known as SER-109, for US commercial use. The drug has won breakthrough and orphan disease status from the agency, meaning it could be approved without a late-stage study if the data prove strong enough. “They agreed with us on our analysis as well as our path forward,” said Pomerantz, a former head of infectious disease research at drug giant Merck & Co. who has led the development of 10 FDA-approved treatments. “We were able to put our heads down in a root cause analysis” that identified how to improve the drug’s effectiveness in a new trial, he said. Investors were cheered by the news — the company’s stock jumped 37 percent to $12.71 in trading Thursday. Advertisement Under the new approach, Seres will use a different diagnostic to identify a toxin that disrupts the large intestine and give patients higher doses of its experimental drug, which Pomerantz said has proved safe in the earlier trials. He said the new trial will include 320 patients at dozens of clinics in the United States and Canada. Half will be given SER-109 after they take a standard course of antibiotics, while the remainder will just be given the antibiotics. The earlier midstage study had enrolled just 89 patients. Seres has amassed a library of bacteria from the human microbiome to use as a drugmaking platform in an effort to develop a class of “healthy gut” drugs to treat infections and metabolic disorders. Its first target, C. diff, causes diarrhea, dehydration, and more serious intestinal conditions. “This is a totally new field of medicine,” Pomerantz said. “We look at it as a new organ of medicine, only made up of bacteria cells rather than human cells.” Robert Weisman can be reached at robert.weisman@globe.com.

Sleep disorder occurs due to changes in sleeping pattern of a person which can be caused by physical disturbances, medical issues, psychiatric problems, and environmental issues. Globally, the sleep aids market is witnessing significant growth due to rising incidence of sleep disorders due to growing geriatric population, increasing demand for sleeping pills due to stressful modern lifestyle and rising initiatives by various health organizations to increase awareness about sleep disorders. However, factors such as side effects associated with sleep aids medications and patent expiration of major sleep drugs are key restraints for the growth of the global sleep aids market. The global sleep aids market was valued at US$ 58.1 Bn in 2014 and expected to account for US$ 80.8 Bn by 2020 at a CAGR of 5.7%.

Shaun C. Van Doren "I want to thank Rob for his dedication, commitment and service to the citizens of Hunterdon County," Van Doren said in a news release. The Hunterdon County GOP will endorse candidates running in the primary at its convention being held at the Flemington Elks at 6 p.m. on March 29. Candidate screening interviews will take place on Wednesday. Walton said he decided not to seek reelection after discussions with his wife and family, according to a post on his Facebook page. He was appointed to the board in 2009, filling now state Assemblyman Erik Peterson's seat. "Hunterdon County is blessed with many municipal elected officials and private citizens who can ably fill my seat and be an independent voice for the conservative principles I have championed," Walton, a former mayor of Hampton, wrote. He was sometimes a dissenting voice on the all-Republican board, opposing projects that did not align with his conservative values. This included opposition to the construction of a permanent clubhouse at the county-owned Heron Glen Golf Course. Committeeman named to Elected Officials Hall of Fame Van Doren, elected to the township committee in 1996, was recently inducted into the New Jersey Elected Officials Hall of Fame in February. "I have had the honor to serve the residents of Tewksbury Township as one of five elected officials and I now believe it is time to apply my experience, knowledge and ability to work with others to the Hunterdon County Board of Chosen Freeholders," he said. Van Doren said he would promote a fiscally conservative platform aimed at keeping the county affordable for young families and seniors on a fixed income, according to the news release. He added he will "take a hard look at the issues" brought before the board, and listen to all sides. "Hunterdon County is a great place to live and work, but working together with the Freeholders we can make it even better," said Van Doren. "The freeholders have done a tremendous job of holding the line on taxes and spending increases, reducing county debt and maintaining important services. I can bring my extensive municipal experience to continue that hard work." Van Doren currently serves as a member of the Hunterdon County Agricultural Development Board, where he has also been the township liaison for the past 20 years. He has served 20 years on the Hunterdon County Shade Tree Commission until 2015. He currently is president of the Tewksbury Historical Society, treasurer and director for the New Jersey Planning Officials and is a member of the New Jersey League of Municipalities Legislative Committee on Land Use. Van Doren's professional background includes an Master's of Science in Management from Steven's Institute of Technology and a bachelor's of science in chemistry from Trenton State College. He is a project safety engineer at Merck & Co., Inc. in Rahway. The Tewksbury Township Republican Municipal Committee will also be meeting on March 28 to screen candidates for the township committee. One, three-year term will expire at the end of 2017. All registered Republicans in Tewksbury are eligible to run. Those interested in running must Van Doren, who is committee chairman, at scvd123@embarqmail.com with a letter of interest and a resume and biographical information no later than March 23.

Thursday, March 16, 2017 by: Vicki Batts Tags: MMR vaccine, mumps outbreak, priority, vaccines (Natural News) Mumps outbreaks have been on the rise, but not among those who are unvaccinated. In what appears to be a rather ironic twist, it seems that the majority of people affected by the disease are those who have received inoculations to “protect” them from mumps. In 2016, more than 5,000 cases of mumps were reported, making it the worst year for the disease since the massive outbreak in 2006. Nineteen of the outbreaks that have occurred in the last few years have taken place on college campuses. Even the mainstream media has been forced to admit that mumps is cropping up among people in areas with high vaccination rates, and where most have had the two recommended doses of the mumps vaccine. Typically, children are given two separate doses of the MMR vaccine, which is intended to protect against measles, mumps and rubella. But does the MMR vaccine really do what it’s intended to do? Vaccines have been suspected of causing a myriad of adverse health effects, and the MMR vaccine is certainly no exception. A recent review of the MMR vaccine by the Rand Corporation even suggested that the jab was related to febrile seizures and anaphylaxis. But the MMR scandal doesn’t just end with harmful after-effects; it turns out that the vaccine is not only ineffective, but it may even help spread the diseases it proclaims to prevent. Is the mumps vaccine a total flop? Failure of the mumps vaccine is nothing new, though it doesn’t appear to be widely publicized. A 1994 study, led by Dr. William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University’s School of Medicine, examined an outbreak that occurred in Tennessee between January and July of 1991. At the high school where the mumps outbreak predominantly occurred, 98 percent of the students had been vaccinated against the disease. Shockingly, all but one of the 68 students that contracted mumps had been inoculated against the illness — or so they thought. In their abstract’s conclusion, the researchers stated, “Vaccine failure accounted for a sustained mumps outbreak in a highly vaccinated population. Most mumps cases were attributable to primary vaccine failure. It is possible that waning vaccine-induced immunity also played a role.” A more recent study, published in 2008, was inspired by the massive outbreak in 2006 that affected more than 5,700 people. The researchers, led by the CDC’s Mona Marin of the Division of Viral Diseases at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, investigated two colleges in Iowa that had experienced mumps outbreaks. They found that 90 percent of the student population between the colleges had received the recommended two rounds of vaccine. And of the 108 students affected in total, 97 of them had been given both doses. The team found that there was no notable difference in vaccine efficacy between those who had been given one or two doses of the mumps vaccine. This, of course, calls the validity and necessity of the two doses into question. Some research has even shown that the MMR vaccine may help to spread mumps, rather than prevent it. Once vaccinated, a person begins to shed the virus they were inoculated with, essentially making them an incubator for disease. An outbreak of mumps in the Netherlands was attributed to MMR vaccine shedding. Couple all that with the former Merck employees who have filed a complaint against the company for falsifying data on the mumps portion of the MMR vaccine’s efficacy, and there are many other questions to be answered. One of these is: Why is the government forcing people to vaccinate their children with a concoction that most likely doesn’t even work, and may actually spread disease? However, instead of admitting that the vaccine simply is not effective enough to be worth the risks it poses, federal officials will reportedly be investigating whether or not a third round of the MMR jab needs to be administered. Of course, this is not entirely unexpected; why make the manufacturer fix its faulty product when you can simply trick the public into buying more of it?
