Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Sep 7, 2016 at 9:21AM Image source: Getty Images. Despite a few recent setbacks, the enthusiasm for immunotherapy stocks hasn't dampened all that much. Led by an insatiable appetite for therapies based on chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR-T, several biopharmaceutical companies have found it easier than ever to raise money and attract partners. Early results from several programs have been promising, but investors suffering from "Fear Of Missing Out" should know that CAR-T isn't the only play in immunotherapy stocks. One potential opportunity is Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN), which is focused on "activating the body's own natural immune mechanisms." If that sounds familiar, it should -- it's essentially the exact elevator pitch used for CAR-T therapies. While Agenus isn't working on CAR-T therapies, it has several pipeline immunotherapy programs partnered with Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) and Merck & Co (NYSE:MRK) that you should know about. The pipeline Agenus considers itself an immuno-oncology company developing therapies based on cancer vaccines and checkpoint antibodies, although most of the company's value resides in the latter. Research and Development efforts are supported by a unique antibody generation platform that increases discovery throughput, reduces the time from discovery to clinic-ready candidates, and allows for more streamlined manufacturing. The technology platform was acquired in 2014 for just $10 million upfront in stock. What's a checkpoint antibody? Antibodies regulate signals within biochemical pathways involved in disease progression by linking up with specific receptors. There are two types of checkpoint antibodies: checkpoint inhibitors that reduce the output of specific proteins (antagonist) and checkpoint modulators that increase the output of specific proteins (agonist). While there's an alphabet soup of nine different antibody-receptor couplings being investigated at the moment, the two most advanced targets, CTLA-4 and GITR, are in phase 1 trials. The remainder are still being investigated in preclinical settings, but Agenus expects to initiate additional phase 1 trials in the second half of 2016.  A program investigating a CTLA-4 antagonist could be a potentially lucrative asset for partners if clinical data prove promising, even though Agenus must pay milestones and royalties to a research institution if successfully developed and commercialized. Tumor cells secrete CTLA-4 to block the activation of T cells and evade the immune system. Therefore, inhibiting CTLA-4 production could potentially allow the immune system to hone in on several types of cancer cells more efficiently. The melanoma drug Yervoy, which had sales of $1.1 billion in 2015 for Bristol-Myers Squibb, is a first-in-class CTLA-4 antagonist.   AGEN data by YCharts In early 2015 Incyte signed a $410 million agreement with Agenus to access the aforementioned antibody discovery platform. The deal included $25 million in cash upfront, the purchase of $35 million in Agenus stock, and $350 million in potential milestone payments for the successful development and commercialization of a slate of checkpoint antibodies. The most advanced asset in the partnership is being investigated in a phase 1 trial. The GITR agonist could enhance the production of certain types of T cells capable of targeting various cancer cell types, with the current trial investigating effectiveness against solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. The company's unique antibody discovery platform has also landed Merck, which recently selected its first checkpoint antibody for an undisclosed indication. The decision triggered a $2 million milestone payment to Agenus. Future developments could trigger up to $98 million in additional milestone payments, while successful commercialization would result in royalties on global sales.  Financials Agenus bolstered its cash position with a unique transaction in late 2015, in which it sold rights to 100% of the royalties it would have received from potential sales of two vaccines developed by GlaxoSmithKline. The vaccines -- for shingles and malaria -- each contained an adjuvant product called QS-21 Stimulon developed by Agenus, announced positive phase 3 results in recent years, and are up for approval in certain global regions. But rather than wait for royalty payments to trickle in, Agenus sold the rights to a capital fund in return for $115 million that it needs to advance its more promising, early stage checkpoint antibody programs. The transaction shows up as (non-dilutive) debt on the company's balance sheet, although it can repurchase the loan at any time if there's more upside to the vaccine sales than originally envisioned. However, I wouldn't expect the company to be in a position to do that anytime soon. While potentially lucrative, Agenus' early stage checkpoint antibody pipeline will prove costly to develop. The good news is that partnerships with Incyte and Merck will help to reduce the company's financial burden and have the potential to infuse cash in the form of milestone payments over the next decade. However, the company will need to decide if it wants to shoulder all of the costs associated with mid- and late-stage trials for its promising CTLA-4 antagonist. That depends on results from the current trial, but with about five quarters' worth of cash left in the bank at the end of 2Q 2016, there isn't much breathing room. What does it mean for investors? Agenus isn't quite the partner of choice in immunotherapy, but it has garnered industry attention for its antibody discovery platform. And with a market cap of just $540 million -- a fraction of leading CAR-T stocks -- it could represent considerable upside for investors. It also has a fraction of the cash on hand, which investors need to take into account. Milestone payments may not be enough, or may not be triggered soon enough, for the company to avoid raising dilutive capital by issuing shares. Given the early stages of development for the company's pipeline, I'm going to closely watch how things develop at Agenus in the next several quarters before I consider starting a position.

MerckManuals.com Sep 07, 2016, 08:03 ET Share this article KENILWORTH, N.J., Sept. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck Manuals (called MSD Manuals outside of the United States and Canada), one of the world's most widely used medical resources since 1899, today announced the release of its new Consumer and Professional mobile apps. For the first time, the completely redesigned apps will provide users with free access to thousands of in-depth articles, videos, animations and other resources without the need for an internet connection. The launch of the apps comes on the heels of an online survey highlighting the need for readily accessible medical information. The survey, conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Merck Manuals, revealed that one in 10 Americans has wanted to access medical information on a mobile device but were not able to because they did not have internet access. Continue Reading The Merck Manuals Consumer App provides free, offline access to thousands of medical resources "In today's mobile world, both consumers and medical professionals expect critical health information at their fingertips, with or without an internet connection," said Robert S. Porter, M.D., Merck Manuals Editor-in-Chief. "Whether you're a health care provider in an ER or serving patients in a remote area of the world, having a dependable medical reference in your pocket can make all the difference. We're also seeing tremendous interest in the consumer version from parents, caregivers, travelers and anyone who needs reliable access to first aid and symptom information." The Merck Manuals apps contain a comprehensive library of reference articles on diseases, symptoms and treatments, plus more than 800 photos and illustrations. Once the app is downloaded, this content is stored on the device and accessible without an internet connection.  Over 200 additional animations and videos are also available to download to the app for offline viewing. When an internet connection is available, the apps have online-only content that features continually updated medical news, interactive quizzes and drug reference information. The survey of 2,000 adults found that more than half of respondents who own a smartphone/tablet (54 percent) would be more likely to search for medical information on their mobile device if they knew the content was credible. Respondents would also be more likely to search if they can access content without needing to provide personal information (50 percent), without registering for the site/app (45 percent), without seeing any advertising (39 percent), and without needing internet access (23 percent). The Merck Manuals content is authored by 350 independent medical experts. The apps are free of advertisements and do not require users to register or share personal information, removing many of the barriers that prohibit users from accessing the content they need to make personal health decisions. The apps will also be available in Spanish by the end of this year. Following the Merck Manuals' transition from a medical textbook to an all-digital platform in 2015, the launch of these new apps is the next step in Global Medical Knowledge 2020, the Manuals' mission to make the best current medical information freely accessible to nearly 3 billion consumers and health care professionals by 2020. Both mobile apps are available in the Apple iTunes Store and Google Play Store. About The Merck Manuals and MSD Manuals First published in 1899 as a small reference book for physicians and pharmacists, The Merck Manual grew in size and scope to become one of the world's most widely used comprehensive medical resources for professionals and consumers. As The Manual evolved, it continually expanded the reach and depth of its offerings to reflect the mission of providing the best medical information to a wide cross-section of users, including medical professionals and students, veterinarians and veterinary students, and consumers. In 2015, The Merck Manual and MSD Manual kicked off Global Medical Knowledge 2020, a program to make the best current medical information accessible by up to three billion professionals and patients around the world by 2020.

Merck previously reported a numeric imbalance in adjudicated stroke events in the pivotal Phase 3 fracture outcomes study in postmenopausal women. The company has decided to discontinue development after an independent adjudication and analysis of major adverse cardiovascular events confirmed an increased risk of stroke. The data from the analysis will be presented at the American Society for Bone Mineral Research (ASBMR) in September. “We are disappointed that the overall benefit-risk profile for odanacatib does not support filing or further development,” said Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D., president, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are very thankful to the researchers and patients who participated in the odanacatib clinical development program. We have learned that odanacatib treatment reduces the risk of osteoporotic fractures. At the same time, we believe that the increased risk of stroke in our Phase 3 trial does not support further development.” About Merck For 125 years, Merck has been a global health care leader working to help the world be well.

Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Sep 7, 2016 at 9:21AM Image source: Getty Images. Despite a few recent setbacks, the enthusiasm for immunotherapy stocks hasn't dampened all that much. Led by an insatiable appetite for therapies based on chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR-T, several biopharmaceutical companies have found it easier than ever to raise money and attract partners. Early results from several programs have been promising, but investors suffering from "Fear Of Missing Out" should know that CAR-T isn't the only play in immunotherapy stocks. One potential opportunity is Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN), which is focused on "activating the body's own natural immune mechanisms." If that sounds familiar, it should -- it's essentially the exact elevator pitch used for CAR-T therapies. While Agenus isn't working on CAR-T therapies, it has several pipeline immunotherapy programs partnered with Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) and Merck & Co (NYSE:MRK) that you should know about. The pipeline Agenus considers itself an immuno-oncology company developing therapies based on cancer vaccines and checkpoint antibodies, although most of the company's value resides in the latter. Research and Development efforts are supported by a unique antibody generation platform that increases discovery throughput, reduces the time from discovery to clinic-ready candidates, and allows for more streamlined manufacturing. The technology platform was acquired in 2014 for just $10 million upfront in stock. What's a checkpoint antibody? Antibodies regulate signals within biochemical pathways involved in disease progression by linking up with specific receptors. There are two types of checkpoint antibodies: checkpoint inhibitors that reduce the output of specific proteins (antagonist) and checkpoint modulators that increase the output of specific proteins (agonist). While there's an alphabet soup of nine different antibody-receptor couplings being investigated at the moment, the two most advanced targets, CTLA-4 and GITR, are in phase 1 trials. The remainder are still being investigated in preclinical settings, but Agenus expects to initiate additional phase 1 trials in the second half of 2016.  A program investigating a CTLA-4 antagonist could be a potentially lucrative asset for partners if clinical data prove promising, even though Agenus must pay milestones and royalties to a research institution if successfully developed and commercialized. Tumor cells secrete CTLA-4 to block the activation of T cells and evade the immune system. Therefore, inhibiting CTLA-4 production could potentially allow the immune system to hone in on several types of cancer cells more efficiently. The melanoma drug Yervoy, which had sales of $1.1 billion in 2015 for Bristol-Myers Squibb, is a first-in-class CTLA-4 antagonist.   AGEN data by YCharts In early 2015 Incyte signed a $410 million agreement with Agenus to access the aforementioned antibody discovery platform. The deal included $25 million in cash upfront, the purchase of $35 million in Agenus stock, and $350 million in potential milestone payments for the successful development and commercialization of a slate of checkpoint antibodies. The most advanced asset in the partnership is being investigated in a phase 1 trial. The GITR agonist could enhance the production of certain types of T cells capable of targeting various cancer cell types, with the current trial investigating effectiveness against solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. The company's unique antibody discovery platform has also landed Merck, which recently selected its first checkpoint antibody for an undisclosed indication. The decision triggered a $2 million milestone payment to Agenus. Future developments could trigger up to $98 million in additional milestone payments, while successful commercialization would result in royalties on global sales.  Financials Agenus bolstered its cash position with a unique transaction in late 2015, in which it sold rights to 100% of the royalties it would have received from potential sales of two vaccines developed by GlaxoSmithKline. The vaccines -- for shingles and malaria -- each contained an adjuvant product called QS-21 Stimulon developed by Agenus, announced positive phase 3 results in recent years, and are up for approval in certain global regions. But rather than wait for royalty payments to trickle in, Agenus sold the rights to a capital fund in return for $115 million that it needs to advance its more promising, early stage checkpoint antibody programs. The transaction shows up as (non-dilutive) debt on the company's balance sheet, although it can repurchase the loan at any time if there's more upside to the vaccine sales than originally envisioned. However, I wouldn't expect the company to be in a position to do that anytime soon. While potentially lucrative, Agenus' early stage checkpoint antibody pipeline will prove costly to develop. The good news is that partnerships with Incyte and Merck will help to reduce the company's financial burden and have the potential to infuse cash in the form of milestone payments over the next decade. However, the company will need to decide if it wants to shoulder all of the costs associated with mid- and late-stage trials for its promising CTLA-4 antagonist. That depends on results from the current trial, but with about five quarters' worth of cash left in the bank at the end of 2Q 2016, there isn't much breathing room. What does it mean for investors? Agenus isn't quite the partner of choice in immunotherapy, but it has garnered industry attention for its antibody discovery platform. And with a market cap of just $540 million -- a fraction of leading CAR-T stocks -- it could represent considerable upside for investors. It also has a fraction of the cash on hand, which investors need to take into account. Milestone payments may not be enough, or may not be triggered soon enough, for the company to avoid raising dilutive capital by issuing shares. Given the early stages of development for the company's pipeline, I'm going to closely watch how things develop at Agenus in the next several quarters before I consider starting a position.

Additionally FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this indication. The pivotal phase 3 KEYNOTE-024 study has shown that the monotherapy showed superior progression-free survival as well as overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1. The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the availability of promising new therapies that are planned for use, alone or in combination, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Keytruda is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells.

Argentina to Present Immensely Lucrative Options for Players  Based on product type, the LATAM pharmaceutical products market is led by the finished dosage form segment, accounting for a share of just under 86% in 2015. This segment is projected to amount to US$244.4 bn by 2024, retaining its lead throughout the forecast period. "The API and ingredients segment, on the other hand, has been witnessing strong growth in Latin America and is projected to register a 9.8% CAGR during the forecast period," the analyst predicts. The CMO market in Latin America was led by the API and ingredients segment, with the finished dosage form segment registering a high growth rate from 2016 to 2024.

View exclusive Global strategic Business report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/latin-america-pharmaceutical-products-cmo-market.html Rising R&D Cuts to Encourage CMO Activities  "Several LATAM countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Colombia have been undergoing an improvement in their regulatory frameworks and a more streamlined manner of processes," the author of the study has observed. The open business environment has attracted multinational pharmaceutical companies and encouraged drug makers to invest in LATAM. Swift drug approvals and a traditional inclination toward free trade has worked in the favor of the healthcare sector in most LATAM countries and this has driven the pharmaceutical products market in the region. The CMO market in Latin America is primarily driven by the fact that a number of blockbuster drugs are going off patent in the next few years. "Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry has taken a hit owing to rising R&D cuts by federal banks and a decline in the productive outcomes of R&D," the analyst states. "This, combined with patent expirations, have compelled large companies to seek synergies with CMOs through mergers and acquisitions."

Hit With HCV Patent Suit Yet Again: A Serious Blow? The lawsuit comes at a crucial time for the biotech as it already faces declining growth of its HCV franchise By Nida Ahmed on Sep 6, 2016 at 7:50 am EST Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), the once undisputed leader in the fast expanding market of HCV drugs, is hit with a blow to its highest yielding HCV drugs franchise yet again. The biotech’s key compound of all its three HCV drugs, sofosbuvir, has been targeted with another patent challenge, this time by the University of Minnesota. It is yet to be seen if this patent suit results in a major blow to Gilead’s HCV sales. The biotech’s stock has been declining since August 29, 2016 when the patent suit was first put forward. GLD stock has lost 3.61% in the last five trading sessions, only further adding to its gloomy performance. Gilead’s shares have fallen 24.73% so far this year, significantly underperforming the market; the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (IBB) lost 17.67% during the same period. The recent lawsuit against Gilead’s key HCV compound puts blame on biotech for intentionally infringing upon a patent held by the school. The university states that sofosbuvir was originally discovered by Dr. Carston Wagner, who currently works at the university affiliated with its College of Pharmacy as the endowed chair in medicinal chemistry. The school claims that Mr. Wagner first won the patent, ‘830, on his work on nucleotide prodrugs in 2014 after which the patent rights were transferred to the institution. Since sofosbuvir is the main element in all of Gilead’s three main HCV drugs, Harvoni, Sovaldi, and recently-approved Epclusa, the latest lawsuit claims that all these drugs prove to infringe upon ‘830 patent. The school has clearly stated that it had first approached Gilead, informing it of the suspected infringement last year in July and also discussed the matter in detail in August 2015; the company failed to accept any blame. If this lawsuit holds true, it can translate into a serious dent to Gilead’s future growth since its HCV drugs franchise has been the main reason for propelling the biotech amongst the top players of the industry. Since Sovaldi’s entry into the market in 2013—Gilead’s first ever HCV drug—the three drugs have shored up a hefty $40 billion in worldwide sales, contributing to striking growth over a period of less than three years. The lawsuit stated: "Gilead has infringed, and continues to infringe, the University’s intellectual property rights by, among other things, selling medicines containing the drug sofosbuvir, including brand name drugs Sovaldi, Harvoni, and Epclusa." However, this is not the first time that Gilead has encountered such a lawsuit against its top selling products. It has faced a number of such lawsuits, but most of them did not prove to be much of a threat. The most recent one which gained much interest from investors was that from pharmaceutical giant, Merck. It was sued for infringing upon its HCV patents, claiming not only damages but also royalties on future sales of Gilead’s HCV drugs. Merck surprisingly won the lawsuit winning $200 million in damages; however, the decision from federal jury was later overturned when it was revealed that Merck’s attorney had lied in the court. Gilead stood victorious in protecting patent on its top selling cash cows. Considering the past events, Jefferies recently released a research note on this issue holding the stance that “the lawsuit clearly holds a low probability of success." However, until the suit’s first proceeding is held, it remains uncertain whether the matter will hit the company’s stock and gain any attention in the market. The lawsuit Adds to Gilead’s Troubles The lawsuit comes at a crucial time for the biotech, which is already facing troubles at the hands of declining growth in its leading HCV drugs portfolio. The company’s HCV drugs franchise consists of two top blockbusters that have been reaping surprising growth since their launch. Sovaldi turned out to be a major breakthrough and proved to shorten the treatment duration by a considerable amount compared to standard HCV treatments. The other HCV drug, Harvoni, was advanced version of Sovaldi and won the final nod from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October, 2014. These two drugs yielded $12.4 billion for fiscal year 2014 (FY14) in combined sales, which went on to hit $19.1 billion in FY15. Aforementioned records from the blockbuster drugs were not a piece of cake for Gilead as it faced numerous lawsuits to defend their patents. In addition to that, the company has been severely criticized for hefty price tags on these two HCV drugs; Solvaldi costs $84,000 for a 12-week treatment, while Harvoni carries an even higher price of $94,500 for 12-week treatment. The biotech firm was pressurized by insurers and various public health officials to offer discounts on its blockbuster drugs, so as to increase their affordability for a large HCV population. These hefty discounts further explain the dent received by the company’s total HCV revenue. In addition to discounts, these drugs shorten the HCV treatment duration, and it leaves a smaller share of untreated population with more patients successfully treated; Gilead’s strength has thus resulted in its own blow too. The aforementioned reported their first ever sales decline in the first quarter (1Q) of fiscal 2016 this year; Sovaldi sales fell 17.5% on a quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) basis to $1.28 billion while that of Harvoni’s stood at $3.02 billion, with a 9.8% decline QoQ. Since Gilead’s HCV franchise generates more than 60% of the company’s total revenue, the decline was meant to hit the company hard. For the 1Q, Gilead’s revenue stood at $7.79 billion, an 8.46% decrease QoQ. However, the sales decline is expected to face a turnaround soon on the back of Gilead’s new HCV molecule, Epclusa; the drug received FDA approval in June this year as the first ever pan-genotype HCV drug meant for treating all genotypes of the debilitating liver disease. Epclusa can be the new generation HCV drug in the market, bringing a much needed turnaround to revenue decline of the leading biotech.

The top five companies, namely BASF SE, Bayer AG, Pfizer, Inc., Novartis AG, and Merck & Co., Inc., jointly accounted for approximately 23% of the total market in 2015. Interpret a Competitive outlook Analysis Report with free PDF Brochure: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=14009 Transparency Market Research states in a new report that the success of players in this market depends mainly on the development of innovative products that can address changing and unmet customer needs. Features and benefits that differentiate one company from its competitors are of utmost importance in the pharmaceutical products and CMO market. Expansion in regions with high growth potential is also a key strategy adopted by players to strengthen their position in the market. Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH has, over the past three years, expanded its footprint in China by investing an estimated EUR 22 mn in the construction of a new clinical research center. The opportunity in the Latin America pharmaceutical products and CMO market was pegged at US$127.9 bn in 2015 and is projected to be worth US$286.2 bn by the end of the forecast period, registering a strong CAGR of 9.3% therein. Argentina to Present Immensely Lucrative Options for Players  Based on product type, the LATAM pharmaceutical products market is led by the finished dosage form segment, accounting for a share of just under 86% in 2015. This segment is projected to amount to US$244.4 bn by 2024, retaining its lead throughout the forecast period. "The API and ingredients segment, on the other hand, has been witnessing strong growth in Latin America and is projected to register a 9.8% CAGR during the forecast period," the analyst predicts. The CMO market in Latin America was led by the API and ingredients segment, with the finished dosage form segment registering a high growth rate from 2016 to 2024. Brazil leads the LATAM pharmaceutical products as well as CMO market in terms of value. Fueled by the growing focus on research, this market is projected to value US$67.3 bn by the end of the forecast period. Argentina, on the other hand, is anticipated to emerge as one of the most lucrative markets by 2024, registering an impressive 11.6% CAGR from 2016 to 2024. View exclusive Global strategic Business report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/latin-america-pharmaceutical-products-cmo-market.html Rising R&D Cuts to Encourage CMO Activities  "Several LATAM countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Colombia have been undergoing an improvement in their regulatory frameworks and a more streamlined manner of processes," the author of the study has observed. The open business environment has attracted multinational pharmaceutical companies and encouraged drug makers to invest in LATAM. Swift drug approvals and a traditional inclination toward free trade has worked in the favor of the healthcare sector in most LATAM countries and this has driven the pharmaceutical products market in the region. The CMO market in Latin America is primarily driven by the fact that a number of blockbuster drugs are going off patent in the next few years. "Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry has taken a hit owing to rising R&D cuts by federal banks and a decline in the productive outcomes of R&D," the analyst states. "This, combined with patent expirations, have compelled large companies to seek synergies with CMOs through mergers and acquisitions."

Keytruda won a breakthrough therapy designation and priority-review status based on data from the Phase 3 Keynote-024 trial, released in June, which showed that the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor had significant progression-free survival and overall survival when compared with chemotherapy. Keytruda was ok-ed as a second-line therapy for NSCLC in October. The FDA will review the drug as a first-line therapy with a target action date of December 24. “Chemotherapy has been the foundation of first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer for decades, so the significant improvement in survival in patients with high PD-L1 expression seen with Keytruda compared to chemotherapy is welcome news,” said Merck R&D chief Roger Perlmutter in a statement. In contrast, a clinical trial of Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo, also a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, did not show an advantage over chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. In fact, these results suggest that oncologists will more often choose Keytruda as a treatment option, noted Reuters. Both drugs were approved by U.S. regulators last year for previously treated patients with NSCLC.

Being the third such request I’d received in as many weeks, I figured it was time to take a closer look at the shingles vaccine. Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, can cause a serious and very painful rash. Judy’s friend Jane was urging her to get vaccinated for shingles. Jane’s husband Stan had a case of shingles that Stan described as “worse than anything he has ever known, including spinal surgery.” Sometimes, open sores accompany the rash and the pain is so severe people have trouble walking and sleeping. In rare cases, the complications of shingles can last for months and sometimes years. That fact surely caught Judy’s attention. In fact, she admitted she had a profound fear of the disease having seen her aunt go through postherpetic neuralgia where the pain continues to last even after the rash and blisters have disappeared. In her opinion, any level of pain seems bearable if you know it will eventually end, but the thought of living with such pain for life made a compelling argument for getting vaccinated. So what could I say about the vaccine called Zostavax being promoted to prevent shingles? I always like to start my research by looking at the pointy end of things: the marketing. If there is one principle in play, it’s that the marketing diverges from the science. And since the advertising is what patients and physicians will likely see first, that’s a good place to start. The ads for Zostavax, made by drug giant Merck, lay out the hook in bold letters: “Have you had your shingles vaccine yet?” In typical marketing style, that innocent question is driven home by the fear factor, reminding us that this is something we all need to be worried about. In smaller print, the ad says, “In Canada, it is estimated that nearly 1 in 3 people will develop shingles in their lifetime.” Ok, if true, this establishes that shingles doesn’t seem to be such a rare condition. Most of us who have had chicken pox as children are susceptible and it usually strikes people over 60, though no one is really sure how or why this happens. Many of us know someone, maybe our mother, friend or neighbour, who has a horror story to tell about the unbearable pain shingles can deliver. I didn’t have to go far to hear some anecdotes. I asked my mother about it and learned that she had had shingles a few years ago that lasted several weeks, which included three visits to the hospital and incredible pain across her stomach. Treatment for shingles usually involves antivirals (drugs such as acyclovir), which, if given early enough, can help shorten the length and intensity of the rash. The vaccine marketer captures the disease’s potential for serious pain with graphic ads featuring a lot of flames and thorns with a clear and unspoken question: “Do you want your life to be a living hell?” Now that we’ve established the nastiness of the disease, the first question has to address the science: “Does the Zostavax vaccine work?” If a vaccine is about protecting you from a disease, you need to know your likelihood of getting the disease in the first place. One study from the British Medical Journal says that for people over 50, approximately two to three people out of a thousand per year get shingles; that increases to about eight per thousand for those 70 and over. The average doctor with 1,500 patients in his care would see about three to five cases per year. A 2005 study in the New England Journal of Medicine enrolled over 38,000 people over 60 and reported that, over three years, the vaccine Zostavax “reduces the occurrence of herpes zoster by 51.3%.” Wow. So if you know 100 people who got vaccinated, the vaccine would prevent half of them from getting shingles, right? Wrong. Remember, if the average doctor sees five cases a year in his practice and he manages to reduce that load by 50%, he’d only see maybe 2.5 cases per year. But how many thousands would he have to vaccinate to prevent those other 2.5 cases? A lot. This study of the vaccine, which was a gold standard, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, measured the incidence, severity and duration of the pain caused by shingles. Let’s focus on just one of those: incidence. Basically, how many people were prevented from getting shingles? The study noted there were 315 shingles cases among those vaccinated and 642 among placebo recipients, concluding that it reduced the rate of shingles by 51.3 percent. Another way this is expressed is in “1,000-person years” where the effects are examined in 1,000 people for one year. The study found that the vaccine dropped the rates of shingles per 1,000 person-years from 11.12 (those on placebo) to 5.42 (those given the vaccine). What this means is the vaccine ‘helps’ about 5.7 people per thousand per year (11.12 minus 5.42= 5.7). Where did the “51.3 % reduction” come from? Well, when you drop the rate from 11.12 to 5.42, that’s about half the rate, or a 51.3% reduction. To summarize, here are two ways of presenting the same data: 1) “The vaccine helps five people per thousand vaccinated. Or 2) “The vaccine helps 50% of the people vaccinated.” Hmmm. You can imagine which one gets the most traction with the marketers. So let’s talk cost. If you have to vaccinate 1,000 people per year at $150 a shot, it would cost $150,000. That’s a fair bit of money to save five people from getting shingles. In other words, the cost of avoiding shingles is about $30,000 per person per year. Does that sound like a bargain? Depends on whom you ask. If you asked Judy’s friend Jane, she’d probably say that not seeing her husband in such pain is “priceless.” If you ask governments to pay for the vaccine, seems they think it’s too high a price to pay and it isn’t covered in BC. It’s not that the vaccine doesn’t work; it’s that it hardly works. And that’s before you wander into the other side of the equation: the vaccine’s potential for adverse effects. By August 2011, in the US, the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) had received 442 serious vaccine adverse reports following Zostavax vaccination, including 36 reported deaths. While these are ‘associations’ and not causations, it still makes one pause before hitting the “jab” button. The kinds of serious shingles vaccine reactions included things like joint and muscle pain, fever, abnormally swollen glands and so on. Some might ask, “Is it possible the vaccine can actually cause shingles?” A good question to which there is no definitive answer, but rashes akin to chicken pox are mentioned on the vaccine’s label as one of the potential adverse effects. At the end of the day, facts can be twisted in any way to make a point, especially when the ‘point’ comes at the end of a syringe. But back to Jane who was caring for her husband and his very nasty bout of shingles. Seeing Stan in such pain was enough for her. She begged Judy and her other friends to get vaccinated. She went and paid the $150 to get herself vaccinated. And a few weeks later? You guessed it; she too came down with a new diagnosis. That’s right, shingles. — Alan Cassels is a pharmaceutical policy researcher at the University of Victoria and the author of Seeking Sickness: Medical Screening and the Misguided Hunt for Disease (Greystone, 2012).

This was the only article I could find not funded by the Government or Pharma with a clear analysis to the actual vaccine. I’m still in search of an ingredient list of the vaccine, and other information for her. Thanks again. Reply Tara Charles / November 26, 2012 Do you have any thoughts, or found any evidence that the rate and intensity of Shingles is increasing in North America? From what I’ve read, the U.K. didn’t implement the chickenpox vaccine for children because it feared that doing so would affect the cases of Shingles. And OMG…I work in healthcare and although this is only my anecdotal observation, Shingles is now extremely prevalent, painful, and can even lead to vision problems. (I’ve also talked to a GP who firmly believes it to be rather self evident that there has been a dramatic upswing and severity in cases of Shingles. She points to the vaccine as a likely candidate. ) Reply mary alexander / March 2, 2013 I got the vaccine about 4 years ago. I currently have a very painful Shingles. My breast and back have the rash – no itch, but horrible, horrible pain. The vaccine did not work for me Reply Sandy Foley / March 20, 2013 Is it possible that the injection is a money scam and of all the people who have received the vaccine The ones who did not get shingles, would probably never have gottem them in their life Anyway? Is there any proof to show that it really helps? Reply Lilla / March 21, 2013 I am 68 year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. I’m just getting over Shingles and I still have pain and can’t sleep because of that even if I take extra strength Tylenol…! After reading your studies regarding the Shingles Vaccine, I’ve decided to not get vaccinated for any future bouts with Shingles…! (Hopefully it won’t find me again…!) Do you have any information on how to alleviate this pain??? Thank you Lilla Reply Beth Gessinger / May 23, 2013 According to my book “Prescription for Nutritional Healing”, it advises to “avoid taking medications that contain acetaminophen (Tylenol, Datril, and others), as they may prolong the shingles. Perhaps you should try another pain killer? Good Luck, Beth Reply Carol Marica / April 12, 2013 I am 86, had shingles about 5 years ago.I had mild chest pains over my heart for about two weeks, A doctor that I went to see, spotted one blister on my back. He gave me a prescription for valacyclovir 500mg I started the pills right away and had no further pain or blisters.After reading this article I may not get the vaccination that I was contemplating. Carol Reply Chard Breed / May 12, 2013 brilliant, and so true. Thanks! Reply John Arkelian / June 16, 2013 Revised (to fix some small typos): In your article, you pose the question: “Is it possible the vaccine can actually cause shingles?” A good question to which there is no definitive answer…” Well, I know of one case in which the vaccine indisputably did cause the very illness it was intended to prevent. And neither the pharmaceutical company that made the drug (Merck Canada), nor Canada’s or Ontario’s health ministers, nor the FDA in the United States showed the slightest interest in investigating or reconsidering (or even quantifying) the vaccine’s potential risks. My published op-ed article on the case appears at this link — though you will have to scroll down to find the article, titled “When the Cure Causes the Disease…” http://artsforum.ca/ideas/regional-perspectives John Arkelian Canada Reply Larry Phillips / January 11, 2014 Like the author and many of the readers, I too have my doubts about the efficacy of the shingles vaccine. However, I question the $30,000 calculation cost to prevent one case. I believe the vaccine lasts for 10 years so wouldn’t the cost per year be $3,000. Certainly still a significant sum. Reply Kevin Friesen / January 21, 2014 While most of the numbers stated are correct (although the $30000 per person is not right, but 30000 per case of shingles avoided may be), the 5 cases per 1000 patient years is slightly misleading. By the time you are sixty, you have a 30% chance of having shingles, if you live to 80, you have a 50% chance. Imagine 100 patients observed for 60 years. This is 6000 patient years. If you have 5 cases per 1000 patient years, this ends up with 30 cases. Thirty cases in 100 people is 30%. The thing is that citing incidence rates can be very misleading unless you know how to interpret them. When I was first learning how to do population research I started by learning about zoster. When I heard about the vaccine, I to thought that if the incidence is only 5 per 1000 patient years why even bother, especially since it is only 50 to 65% effective (different studies have had different results, but the 50% is pretty good). But when you consider that you have a 30% chance of getting it by the time you are sixty, and 50% by the time you are eighty (I plan on living that long anyways), then it seems a bit more likely. More important though, in my mind, is that it is 67% effective in preventing post herpetic neuralgia, which is that intense burning nerve pain that is so extremely difficult to treat that can follow shingles. It is true that there are adverse reports, most of them are mild, but yes, a self limited rash is possible. Whether full outbreak of shingles could occur is not so obvious. We already have the virus, all of us, sleeping in all of our spinal nerves, it is not like the vaccine will wake it up, rather, it will cause the immune system to suppress it. That being said, anything can happen, but just because she got it does not necessarily mean it was from the vaccine, she might have gotten shingle anyways. Whether I think the public should pay for it, well, it is pretty expensive on a nationwide basis for how well it works, so I don’t know. Reply Dick de Seve / September 5, 2016 The problem is that these manufacturers state that ANYBODY has a 1 in 3 chance of getting shingles in their lifetime. That is absolutely false. My physician, who combines homeopathy and standard medicine, states that the actual number is more like 11%. For that, I will not be getting the vaccine. Another medical scam. Reply RJ Patterson / November 22, 2014 My interest in reading this article is that I have just had a shingles like outbreak, although the appears and symptoms are consistent my doctor has yet to examine me. The original discussion fails to consider that the ZOSTAVAX vaccination is a once in a lifetime vaccination. A booster is not recommended. As one comment noted the study population was not comprised only of seniors with elevated incidence rates. Once these issues are considered group cost of prevention is reduced substantially, by a factor of at least 30, possibly by as much as 60 ~ 90. So the cost per case of shingles prevention is reduced to as little as $350, otherwise as much as $1000. Much less than the suggested $30,000. If you get the ZOSTAVAX vaccination before you are 60 years old, you are on average providing yourself with nominally 30 years of protection, or reduction of severity. Even with only a 50 ~ 65% effectiveness rate it is a minor cost for an average budget. So, with that said, I will have the vaccination what ever my doctor advises the rash to be! Reply Cheryl / February 1, 2015 Recent studies demonstrate that immune system antibodies from vaccine are quite low after just two years. Most researchers now agree that vaccine provides a maximum of five years protection. So it is doubtful that this is a one time vaccine. As people age, incidence of shingles increases. So vaccinate a 60-year-old and he/she will have NO protection at age 70, when even more vulnerable to shingles. I will wait for vaccination until age 70. If I get Shingles before then, I will take antivirals immediately to shorten length and severity. A second bout is rare so having a case before getting vaccinated would decide that I don’t need to get vaccinated. Reply Justin White / February 18, 2016 Thanks for this – been seeing a poster at my local Coop pharmacy, and they’ve started putting it in their flier too. The ‘1 in 3 people will develop shingles’ seemed sketchy to me, I thought shingles were pretty rare. Seeing these numbers help – but where do these posters get off saying ‘1 in 3’ people will develop shingles in their lifetime? If we take into account the number of children that die, that means pretty much everyone who reaches a certain age will get it. I simply don’t believe it. Reply Reg Reid / February 20, 2016 After carefully considering the over-the-top marketing and speaking to others, I have to say the type of scare-mongering practiced by Merck pharma doesn’t have me convinced of the benefit of the vaccine. It does have me convinced the company has an ethics problem though. Reply victoria / April 26, 2016 I am a healthy person, but couple of years ago my Dr. urged me to get this vaccine, which I would not touch with 10 foot pole. When the Gov. and the doctors are suggesting the medicine, I am very sceptical. However, my friend developed a small rash on her behind, achy, itchy and blistery. As I study, read and try home remedies with anything that ails me or my friends. I suggested to her to put toothpaste on her blisters or Apple cider vinegar. IT WORKED, even the pain was gone. A lot of people are not aware, when in blisters, it is contagious if touched with body fluids. The wife who was vaccinated and then came up with diagnose of shingles, she probably got it from her husband and vaccine just made it worse.

I am trying to find out if it is possible to get shingles a second time. Do I need to get the vaccine? Reply daryl / September 20, 2016 I have a viral inner ear infection.

The EpiPen, so prominent in the news lately, delivers about $1 worth of the hormone through an easily administered auto-injector. The story of how the price skyrocketed six-fold evinces both the genius and the folly of the American healthcare system. Christopher Hopkins Christopher Hopkins Photo by Contributed Photo /Times Free Press. The device that became the Epi- Pen was invented in 1974 as a means for U.S. soldiers to quickly treat symptoms of poison gas on the battlefield. In 1987, the device was approved for delivery of epinephrine (the trade name for adrenaline) to treat anaphylaxis. The manufacturer was acquired by Pfizer, which sold the marketing rights to Merck. In 2007, Mylan Pharmaceuticals purchased the marketing rights to the product. At that time, a single-dose injector sold for around $50. Mylan embarked upon a brilliant strategy: to stimulate additional demand by encouraging the stockpiling of EpiPen devices in public venues. It was a masterstroke of promotion that also saved lives, as the company relentlessly raised awareness of the risk of severe allergic reactions in children. Ultimately, Congress passed a bill in 2013 encouraging schools to keep emergency supplies of the injectors on hand. This was a classic case study in marketing that enriched shareholders as well as Mylan's executives as sales spiked from $200 million in 2007 to $1.1 billion last year. Thanks to the byzantine and mysterious mechanism of rebates, discounts and revenue sharing with pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies, virtually no one paid the full retail price. This began to change as high-deductible health care plans gained market share. And while the trend was already under way, Obamacare accelerated the rush to high-copay plans. This means many more patients are now confronted with the full $300 bill for an EpiPen until their deductible is satisfied. While never anticipated by Mylan, the significant cost shift toward patients has now created a major public relations nightmare for the company. Many of the same politicians who mandated EpiPen distribution in the schools now rail against the resultant price hikes. One might reasonably inquire as to why a century-old drug in a 30-year-old package has not been replaced with generics. Recall Ronald Reagan's prophetic quip about the most terrifying words in English: "I'm from the Government and I'm here to help you." As it turns out, there exist both a less expensive branded competitor to Mylan's EpiPen and a generic equivalent. But under current FDA rules, they cannot be freely substituted without a specific prescription, although it is unclear how they could differ substantially enough to warrant exclusion. Nevertheless, these alternatives have struggled to attain barely 10 percent of the market. Meanwhile, the FDA has been woefully slow to evaluate and approve additional generic substitutes. According to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, there are over 4,000 generic drug applications awaiting FDA approval, including potential EpiPen replacements. Contrast that with the European equivalent of the FDA, with a backlog of just 24 applications. Not surprisingly, the European version of the EpiPen sells for a fraction of the cost. It is indeed rare that we look across the Atlantic for a model of economic efficiency, but in this case the U.S. FDA has actually protected Mylan's effective monopoly and inhibited the market's inherently competitive response to a pricing imbalance. Mylan is responding to the negative attention with a generic of its own, and it looks like FDA approval for a Teva Pharmaceutical version may finally be forthcoming in 2017. Once the force of competition is unleashed, expect the price to decline rapidly. And expect the EpiPen to star in future case studies of both what is right and what is wrong with American healthcare.

português suomeksi svenska China Animal Vaccine Industry Report, 2016-2020 News provided by ReportBuyer Sep 06, 2016, 17:00 ET Share this article LONDON, Sept. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Animal vaccine is a kind of biological agent that enables inoculated animals to produce active immunity for disease prevention. In recent years, European and American animal vaccine markets have seen slower growth due to quality safety, high maturity and other factors, while the animal vaccine markets in emerging countries including China have developed rapidly. The Chinese animal vaccine market size grew from RMB1.4 billion in 2004 to RMB14.0 billion in 2014 at a high rate of 25.9%, and is expected to hit around RMB16.9 billion in 2015, a year-on-year increase of 20.7%. In China, animal vaccines fall into two categories: 1. Epidemic disease vaccines subject to national compulsory immunization programme (compulsory immunization vaccines include highly pathogenic avian influenza vaccine, foot-and-mouth disease vaccine, highly pathogenic PRRS vaccine, swine fever vaccine, and PPR vaccine in Xinjiang and Tibet); 2. Epidemic disease vaccines beyond national compulsory immunization programme (non-compulsory immunization vaccines). As the problems like low price and low quality caused by the system of purchasing by invitation to bid have greatly impacted the development of livestock and poultry breeding in China, the government has been piloting reform of the tendering system in multiple regions, planning to advance the marketization of vaccines through direct subsidies to farmers. Large breeding companies, out of overall consideration based on economic benefits, are increasingly inclined to buy high-quality market-oriented vaccines which are 5-15 times as expensive as vaccines purchased under policy. Hence, the Chinese animal vaccine market size is expected to grow significantly in the future, reaching RMB41.2 billion in 2020. Despite a large number of animal vaccine companies (about 100) in China, the industry is less concentrated. In 2015, China Animal Husbandry Industry Co., Ltd. (CAHIC) held the largest share (7.4%) of the Chinese animal vaccine market in 2015, followed by Jinyu Bio-technology (7.2%), Qingdao Yebio Biological Engineering (5.0%), Xinjiang Tecon Animal Husbandry Bio-Technology (4.6%), Pulike Biological Engineering (2.8%), and Tianjin Ringpu Bio-technology (2.8%). Although the Chinese animal vaccine market is primarily controlled by domestic companies with a share of 90% or so, the high-end vaccine market, such as pet vaccines, is occupied by foreign brands including Zoetis (formerly Pfizer's animal health division), Fort Dodge, Intervet, Merial, and BoehringerIngelheim. These foreign players not only directly sell vaccines in China but also have been increasing their investment in the country. In 2014, the animal vaccine manufacturing base, with total investment of EUR55.5 million and jointly founded by BoehringerIngelheim and Taizhou China Medical City, started construction. Some pig vaccines will be first commercialized in the China Medical City after the manufacturing base is completed in 2016. Intervet Holding BV and CAHIC signed a cooperation agreement in 2015, planning to jointly explore domestic and foreign markets and enhance competitiveness. However, Chinese local animal vaccine companies are also scaling up efforts for research and development, making their presence in high-end vaccines and expanding varieties of vaccines. There were 25 kinds of registered animal vaccines in China in 2015, a year-on-year growth of 78.6%, including 10 kinds of pig vaccines, 10 kinds of poultry vaccines, and 5 kinds of other animal vaccines like Mink Hemorrhagic Pneumonia Bivalent Vaccine, Inactivated (Serotype G, Stain WD005 + Serotype B, Stain DL007) and Turbot EdwardsiellatardaVaccine, Live (Strain EIBAV1). Moreover, great progress has been made in pet vaccines. Rabies vaccines, inactivated produced by Pulike Biological Engineering, Tianjin Ringpu Bio-technology, and Shanghai Hile Bio-Technology are expected to be approved and go on the market at the end of 2016 or in 2017.

Please sign up for it here. We offer our view of odd provisions in Michael Weinstein’s two initiatives, turn to Fox News’ settlement with Gretchen Carlson in her sexual harassment case, and give our recommendation on Dean Cortopassi’s Proposition 53. Nice concept. Wrong prescription. Take a job Michael Weinstein has a fine job as head of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. And yet in the two initiatives he is promoting on the Nov. 8 ballot, he seems to be seeking a new position: defender of Propositions 60 and 61. Proposition 60 attacks the porn industry. Proposition 61 attacks the pharmaceutical industry. Both are worthy targets, though whether the measures should be approved is a question for another day (soon). Both initiatives include virtually identical and equally odd provisions. If the attorney general refuses to defend them in court, they say, the people of the state of California declare that the proponent of the measures could step in because he has “a direct and personal stake” in the outcome. That would be Weinstein. The language gets stranger. The proponent would become a state employee who would take the official oath of office, could only be fired by a majority vote of the Legislature for “good cause,” and would be indemnified by the state for actions related to defending the initiatives. Nice protections. Attorney Thomas Hiltachk, who visited our editorial board as part of the No-on-61 contingent Tuesday, theorized that the provision stems from the 2013 U.S. Supreme Court case challenging Proposition 8, the 2008 initiative banning same-sex marriage. Attorney General Kamala Harris, a proponent of marriage equality, declined to defend Proposition 8. So the measure’s backers stepped in, or tried to. A majority of the justices declined to rule on the merits of the case. The reason, they held, was that the proponents had no “direct stake” in the outcome. Propositions 60 and 61 aren’t nearly as weighty as Proposition 8 was. But lest the Supreme Court have any doubt, Weinstein would have a direct and personal stake in the outcome. Take a number: $86.6 million Proposition 61 implications aren’t altogether apparent. But by altering how the state purchases pharmaceuticals, the initiative threatens drugmakers’ bottom line. Clearly, Gilead, Merck, Purdue Pharma, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, Astra Zeneca and the rest understand the implications. They’ve raised $86.6 million to kill it, and the election is still two months away. Our take Editorial: The Roger Ailes scandal gives Fox a chance to disprove ongoing reports that Ailes was abetted by male managers who remain with the corporation. They can start with a fairer, more balanced, more respectful, perhaps even – dare we say it? – politically correct treatment of women, both off and on the air. Endorsement: In the guise of combating government debt, Proposition 53 could increase construction costs and add unnecessary layers of complexity and uncertainty to an already unwieldy state government. Also opposing Proposition 53 are The Mercury News of San Jose, The Bakersfield Californian and The Santa Rosa Press Democrat. Emily Rusch’s Soapbox: Senate Bill 1107 would empower small campaign donors over special interests and megadonors. David Vander Griend’s Soapbox: Biofuels present a solution to harmful airborne chemicals. Their take L.A. Times: No on Proposition 59. Don’t amend the Constitution over Citizens United. We don’t rule out supporting an appropriately crafted constitutional amendment in the future, but we see no reason to rush. We took a different view. Dallas Morning News: Donald Trump is not qualified to serve as president and does not deserve your vote. Miami Herald: Donald Trump’s gift to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi deserves a closer look. Charlotte Observer: John Koskinen’s imperfections almost surely fall far short of the “high crimes and misdemeanors” that impeachment requires. Syndicates take Ruben Navarrette: To judge Clinton on immigration, look at the company she’s kept. David Brooks: The incredible shrinking Obamacare. Mailbag: It is unacceptable and unconscionable that a city asks its citizens to participate in and support its events but makes no effort to provide basic and decent accommodations. – Sondra Olson, Davis And finally, All might not be lost for Patti “Patris” Miller, the Oak Park activist and business owner on the verge of losing her studio space to gentrification. Dozens of people have contributed to a GoFundMe page set up to help her purchase the building she leases at 35th Street and Second Avenue. Miller remains short of her goal of $50,000. Give a little to someone who gave a lot. Miller has lived in Oak Park for 25 years and helped transform it from a haven for drug dealers to one for hipsters. – Erika D.

The immediate purpose of the collaboration is to support health equity by reducing adult immunization disparities. The collaboration also seeks to support minority-serving practices in meeting the requirements of value-based payment reforms. Adult immunization disparities offer an immediate opportunity to improve an essential healthcare process. Approximately 11.6 percent and 14.6 percent of African-Americans and Hispanics respectively receive herpes zoster vaccination compared with 32 percent of non-Hispanic Whites. Less than half of African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian/Pacific Islanders receive the pneumococcal vaccine compared with 65 percent of non-Hispanic Whites. "Seventy percent of our nation's African-American and Hispanic or Latino populations reside in 6,000 of the 38,000 residential zip codes in the United States," said Gary A. Puckrein, PhD, president and CEO of the National Minority Quality Forum.  "This collaborative program will build on the Forum's powerful data analytic capabilities which can pinpoint zip codes where African-Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics are the majority of the population." ACP is working with The Forum to identify its members who serve patients in these zip codes, distinguishing those who are leading the effort to provide this crucial preventive service. The goal is to understand their strategies for successful vaccination and to share that information and direct support with all ACP members working with racially and ethnically diverse populations. "Given that African Americans, Latinos, and other minorities experience a large and growing disparity in adult immunization rates, this program will help physicians and their health care teams bridge the gap in preventing disease and death among our most vulnerable citizens," said Wayne J. Riley, MD, MPH, MBA, MACP, ACP's Immediate Past President and Clinical Professor of Medicine and Adjunct Professor of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, who will serve as chair of the project's national advisory council. "Furthermore, these physicians and health care teams often have the least resources to be successful in the value-based payment environment." QHC brings to the program health quality expertise and a commitment to patient education and engagement, with a significant focus on health literacy. "It will be critical to provide health care teams with culturally relevant, health literate information and resources so they can effectively convey the importance of vaccination," said Bernard Rosof, MD, MACP, QHC's CEO. The initiative is being launched in September 2016 and is an extension of ACP's I Raise the Rates program, which works with primary care practices in several states supporting education and quality improvement activities to increase practice-based immunizations. Major support for this project is provided through an educational grant from Merck. Additional support comes from Pfizer, Inc., and Sanofi Pasteur. About the National Minority Quality ForumThe National Minority Quality Forum (The Forum) is a Washington, DC-based not-for-profit, non‘partisan, independent research and education organization dedicated to improving the quality of healthcare that is available for and provided to all populations. The Forum develops user-friendly, web-based disease indices that provide a unique two-dimensional view of the prevalence and impact of diseases by zip code, including diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease and HIV/AIDS.

XiaoZhi Lim1 06 September 2016 Corrected: 16 September 2016 Article tools PDF Rights & Permissions Jasiek Krzysztofiak/Nature In her 1794 book, An Essay on Combustion, Scottish chemist Elizabeth Fulhame noted a peculiar fact: substances such as coal and charcoal burned better when they were damp. After many experiments to understand why, she concluded that the water briefly split into hydrogen and oxygen, which interacted with the other compounds in a way that made the combustion go faster. Yet at the end, Fulhame wrote, the process “forms a new quantity of water equal to that decomposed”. Many historians consider this to be the first scientific account of a catalyst: a material that speeds reactions by making or breaking chemical bonds, without being consumed. It was hardly the last: modern chemistry would be almost inconceivable without catalysts. “They not only make transformations accessible, but also direct them in new ways,” says Susannah Scott, a chemist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “That's very powerful.” Catalysts are used in some 90% of processes in the chemical industry, and are essential for the production of fuels, plastics, drugs and fertilizers. At least 15 Nobel prizes have been awarded for work on catalysis. And thousands of chemists around the world are continually improving the catalysts they have and striving to invent new ones. That work is partly driven by an interest in sustainability. The aim of catalysis is to direct reactions along precisely defined pathways so that chemists can skip reaction steps, reduce waste, minimize energy use and do more with less. And with growing concerns about climate change and the environment, sustainability has become increasingly important. Catalysis is a key principle of 'green chemistry': an industry-wide effort to prevent pollution before it happens. Catalysts are also seen as the key to unlocking energy sources that are much more inert and difficult to use than coal, oil or gas, but much cleaner. Catalysis can make it more economically feasible to split water into oxygen and hydrogen fuel, or can open up new ways to use raw materials such as biomass or carbon dioxide. “These are feedstocks that are ripe for advances in catalysis,” says Melanie Sanford, a chemist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. These challenges have led to an explosion in catalyst innovation, with the annual number of publications on the subject tripling in the past decade. Many groups are coming up with new small-molecule complexes or are chemically tailoring biological enzymes in search of radically new catalytic activity. Others are pursuing advances in nanotechnology, which allow them to engineer the action of solid catalysts at the atomic scale. Still others are experimenting with catalysts that are activated by light, or that incorporate the DNA double helix. And everyone in the field is trying to streamline the search for better catalysts with modern computational modelling tools. The pace of innovation is such that even the experts are struggling to keep up, says Scott, who leads the US Department of Energy's efforts to develop benchmarks for the new catalysts' performance1. “We need to make sure we are advancing the science that's most efficient,” she says. And the scope of catalysis is increasing rapidly. “Twenty years ago,” says John Hartwig, a chemist at the University of California, Berkeley, “catalysis to make molecules that were complex did not exist.” Anyone who wanted to modify a large complicated structure would have to tear it down and build it back up, says Sanford. But now, chemists can often edit parts of a molecule precisely. “It's incredibly enabling,” she says. Cut-price catalysts Using a catalyst is like bulldozing a shortcut between reactants A and product B, bypassing convoluted chemical pathways that might otherwise take forever. Using a really good catalyst is like building a multilane superhighway. And some of the best are the 'homogeneous' catalysts: free-floating molecules that are mixed in with the reactants. Industrial catalysts in this category most often consist of a metal ion that does the hard work of making or breaking chemical bonds, surrounded by 'ligands': connected groups, often carbon-based, that control the reactants' access to the ion. Much of the research in this field comes down to tailoring these ligands to produce a catalyst that performs only a desired reaction. Unfortunately, many of the successes so far have come through the use of scarce and expensive metals such as palladium, platinum, ruthenium and iridium. Today, chemists are increasingly striving to build catalysts around cheaper, 'Earth-abundant' elements such as iron, nickel or copper — or to do without metals altogether. “Chemists are striving to build catalysts around cheaper, 'Earth-abundant' elements such as iron, nickel or copper.” Nickel is a particularly attractive candidate for mimicking the chemistry of palladium and platinum because it sits directly above them in the periodic table, and therefore has similar properties. At the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, for example, synthetic chemist Xile Hu and his group are working with a remarkably versatile nickel complex2 that they first reported in 2008. The complex consists of a nickel ion surrounded by a single, large ligand that binds to it in three places, leaving a fourth binding spot available for catalysing reactions. A similar ligand is already used in certain palladium catalysts. But the radius of a nickel ion is almost 20% smaller than that of a palladium ion, so Hu had to shrink the ligand to fit it more closely around the nickel. To do so, he replaced phosphorus atoms in the ligand with smaller nitrogen ones. The result is a rigid ligand that stabilizes the nickel ion as it performs a wide array of reactions3, 4, 5. The original nickel catalyst is already available commercially, and Hu is systematically modifying the ligand to make a whole family of catalysts. In 2008, chemists discovered that certain standard catalysts could be made more powerful by combining them with a technique known as photoredox catalysis. When photoredox catalysts absorb light, an electron leaps from the metal ion to the ligand and becomes stuck there, leaving the molecule in an unstable state. “The catalyst becomes desperate to fill the hole in the metal and get rid of the electron in the ligand,” explains David MacMillan, a chemist at Princeton University in New Jersey who first reported6 the idea in collaboration with chemist David Nicewicz from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But the only way the photoredox system can accomplish this is to trade electrons with the standard catalyst, supercharging it and triggering chemical transformations that were previously impossible. As a bonus, the photoredox catalysis drives the process with energy that it absorbed from light, reducing the heat required to keep the reaction going. Nicewicz and MacMillan have independently used photoredox catalysis to make major improvements to the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction, which is frequently used to bond carbon with nitrogen when making drugs. Typically, the reaction requires the use of palladium salts, expensive, phosphorus-based ligands and difficult-to-make reactants. But in 2015, Nicewicz's group announced7 that it had not only made a carbon–nitrogen bond using a completely metal-free catalyst, but had done so starting from cheaper and more accessible reactants; it is already being used by pharmaceutical companies, says Nicewicz. In June, MacMillan's group and its collaborators at Merck Research Laboratories in Rahway, New Jersey, reported8 making the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction work with minute amounts of an iridium light absorber and a nickel salt, eliminating the need for ligands. A specific challenge for many researchers is to find better ways of creating the carbon–fluorine bonds at the heart of fluorinated compounds that are widely used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and medical imaging. Currently, the bonds are made using expensive specialized reagents or the highly corrosive gas hydrogen fluoride. In 2013, a team of researchers led by Sanford showed9 how to make such bonds with a safer potassium fluoride salt using a copper catalyst. First, the catalyst is exposed to a compound that strips away three of its electrons. This leaves the catalyst so hungry for electrons that it can pull some from a nearby fluoride ion, which holds them in a notoriously tight grip. The fluoride is then so desperate for a replacement electron that it will readily bind with a carbon atom to get it. Pebbles in a stream Despite their versatility, many homogeneous catalysts are fragile. Their internal bonds weaken after prolonged exposure to heat and collisions with reactant molecules, and their ligands start disintegrating. “They die after a while,” says Sanford. That is a big reason why large-scale industry tends to use 'heterogeneous' catalysts: solid materials that are fixed in place while the reactants stream past. A classic example is the mix of powdered platinum and other metals found in the catalytic converters that clean vehicle exhaust gases. In the past, chemists had a tough time designing heterogeneous catalysts with atomic precision because it was difficult to make and study the active sites, where catalysis occurs, in a solid material. Mostly they had to optimize the catalysts through trial and error. But what's changing, says Scott, “is the synthetic control that we can exert over the materials”. In particular, rapid advances in nanotechnology are allowing chemists to work towards systems with the robustness of solid catalysts and the high performance of homogeneous ones. At the Chinese Academy of Sciences' State Key Laboratory of Catalysis in Dalian, director Can Li has used platinum and cobalt oxide nanoparticles to create a catalyst for splitting water with sunlight10 (see 'Light splitter'). He starts by sticking the nanoparticles to crystals of a semiconductor called bismuth vanadium oxide, with each type of particle carefully isolated on a specific face of each crystal. Then, when he immerses the crystals in water and exposes them to light, photons strike the semiconductor and loosen electrons. The result is a flow of current that the nanoparticles use to break water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Oxygen gas comes bubbling off the cobalt oxide sites, while positively charged hydrogen ions migrate to the platinum particles. “We separated the active sites to block the reverse reaction,” says Li — that is, a dangerously explosive conversion of hydrogen and oxygen back into water. (To simplify the experimental set-up, the hydrogen ions are currently captured by a separate compound rather than turned into gas.) The process is not yet efficient enough to be economically viable, says Li. But his team is testing combinations of semiconductors and metal catalysts to refine the design. Nik Spencer/Nature Audrey Moores, a chemist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, is tackling a bothersome issue in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food industries, which often use heavy-metal-ion catalysts. Ions of palladium, ruthenium and platinum are toxic, so products made with them cannot be sold until they have been through a series of meticulous and expensive cleansing steps. Moores is working on alternative catalysts based on iron, which is much safer. In 2014, her research group prepared a series of hollow, magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for making benzaldehyde11: a molecule that smells like almonds and is widely used in flavourings. It is typically manufactured by reacting certain electron-hungry compounds with styrene: a sweet-smelling but hazardous liquid that is better known as a raw material for plastics. The process tends to generate a relatively small amount of benzaldehyde mixed with other molecules. But Moores' iron nanoparticles catalyse a more controllable reaction between styrene and oxygen, yielding almost pure benzaldehyde. And as an added advantage, iron is magnetic, so at the end of the reaction the iron nanoparticles can be extracted for reuse with a magnet. Even-handedness When making large, complex molecules such as steroids, antibiotics or hormones, a major challenge involves chirality, or the 'handedness' of a carbon atom. Such an atom carrying four different groups can have two configurations that are mirror images of each other, like human hands. A complex molecule may contain many such carbon atoms — and if even one of them has the wrong configuration, the compound can end up interacting badly with the human body. One notorious example is thalidomide, a drug developed in the 1950s for treating morning sickness in pregnant women. One chiral configuration seems to have been effective and safe for that purpose. But many chemists believe that its mirror image, which was present in the over-the-counter drug, is what caused babies to be born with severe limb deformations. Molecules from biomass feedstocks contain a wide variety of chiral carbon atoms in a chain, and it is almost impossible to distinguish one from another. “A small-molecule catalyst wouldn't recognize it,” says Hartwig. Instead, chemists are turning to biological enzymes, which can be large enough to recognize the overall shape of the target molecule and home in on the bond where the reaction should occur. Enzymes also have the advantage of using water as a solvent and working at body temperatures, which makes them more environmentally friendly than processes that require toxic solvents and large amounts of heat. Naturally occurring enzymes don't always catalyse the reactions that chemists want, however — which is why one frontier of catalysis research is to rework these proteins so that they do. Hartwig has been looking at the haem enzyme, which is similar to the compounds that carry oxygen in red blood cells, and has developed12 an artificial enzyme that substitutes an iridium complex for the haem's iron centre. Although this runs contrary to the goal of replacing precious metals with Earth-abundant ones, says Hartwig, iridium can work with strong bonds such as those between carbon and hydrogen, which iron cannot. His team is using crystallographic data to study the enzyme's structures near the iridium site and is systematically modifying them so that they can precisely transform a carbon–hydrogen bond into a carbon–carbon bond with the desired chiral configuration — a formidable challenge. The chemists can prepare hundreds or even thousands of new enzymes in this way, limited only by the time it takes to test them and analyse their activity. Still, enzymes are very specific to their target, and although they yield a product with a single chiral configuration, it is often the configuration that isn't wanted. “If you're interested in the other, you're in trouble,” says Stellios Arseniyadis, a synthetic chemist at Queen Mary University of London. To address that problem, Arseniyadis is collaborating with Michael Smietana of the University of Montpellier in France to make catalysts from DNA. Although most natural DNA spirals in only one direction, it is possible to make an artificial version that twists in the opposite direction. The two researchers and their teams make their catalysts by choosing a natural or non-natural helix of DNA and then attaching a metal ion inside it. The spiral grooves align the reactants so that they fuse with the desired chiral configuration. In 2015, Arseniyadis and Smietana reported a recyclable DNA–copper catalyst13 that created the correct chiral products as reactants flowed past. With endless combinations of base pairs and metal ions, “there's a plethora of parameters that you can fine-tune”, says Arseniyadis. Chemists are continuing to push the boundaries of catalysis research. Li, for example, is experimenting with housing enzymes inside nanoparticles14 to help them last longer. Others are synthesizing completely artificial enzymes15 using techniques from synthetic biology. And earlier this year, an international team of researchers reported16 using an electric field to catalyse the formation of ring-shaped carbon compounds. These ideas are starting to constitute entire new research fields in which conventionally distinct disciplines overlap — for example, combining chemical synthesis and DNA. That, says Arseniyadis, leaves “a lot of room for serendipity”.

Both have experienced mental health issues. Photo: Vanessa Sellick and Getty. Share Tweet Whatsapp Email Share Mum launches petition to warn parents about asthma medication after son tried to commit suicide - Yahoo7 Pinterest Tumblr A Melbourne mother has called for new warning labels on a common asthma medication, after her young son tried to commit suicide and experienced severe mental health issues while taking it. WARNING, DISTRESSING CONTENT. Vanessa Sellick, 40, told Yahoo7 her two sons Harrison and Austin had been prescribed the medication Singulair (Montelukast) at two-years-old. Vanessa Sellick and her two sons Harrison and Austin. Photo: Vanessa Sellick. Singulair is prescribed to children aged between two and 14, who experience frequent intermittent, mild persistent or exercise-induced asthma. The drug is a chewable tablet that is easy to give to children and considered ‘less traumatic’ than other asthma treatments. The medication has since been linked to psychotic episodes in children. Ms Sellick said Harrison, who is now ten, started to experience behavioural problems and suicidal thoughts while taking the medication. Harrison took the medication for about three years and has been off it for almost six, however Ms Harrison claims her son still experiences side effects. Harrison and Austin had both taken the medication Singulair since they were two years old. Both had experienced mental health issues since being prescribed the medication. Photo: Vanessa Sellick. Singulair is prescribed to young children as it is considered 'less tramatic' than other asthma medications. Photo: Getty. “When my son first went on Singulair the side effects weren’t actually acknowledged. When they were made known they weren’t communicated to us,” Ms Sellick told Yahoo7. “If you could see the horror that my son and so many others have endured, it’s really heartbreaking,” Ms Sellick said. She said Harrison would beg her to "let him die" after he started experiencing suicidal thoughts at only four-years-old. “It gradually got worse, he did have a suicide attempt,” she said. “I don’t know whether he fully understood it. Vanessa Sellick said her son's mental health had dramatically improved since ceasing use of the drug Singulair. Photo: Vanessa Sellick. “He would say ‘I’m going to run out on the road and get hit by a car’ or ‘I’m going to jump off the balcony and go splat on the concrete’… that was a common one.” Ms Sellick said she had sought countless mental health and medical assistance for her son including regular psychologist appointments. Harrison had also been tested for Asperger’s syndrome a number of times but she said the tests always came back negative. She also undertook a psychology degree to try and learn ways she could help her son. Since stopping the medication Ms Sellick said Harrison has still experienced depressive episodes, but his mental health had improved dramatically. “All his teachers at school have been supportive, they have seen a huge change in him,” she said. In 2013, a safety alert on the drug was issued by the Australia's Therapeutic Goods Association. By this stage Harrison had already stopped taking the medication. However, his younger brother Austin was still using it as a treatment for asthma. Ms Sellick said when she saw the TGA alert she immediately took Austin off the medication. “We didn’t make the link prior,” she said. “Because you put the child on it at two, you put it down to the terrible twos … but I knew deep down it wasn’t normal.” Between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2013 the TGA received reports of neuropsychiatric adverse events in 58 children who had been prescribed (Singulair) Montelukast. Neuropsychiatric reactions reported to the TGA included nightmares, altered mood and insomnia. On Monday night Ms Sellick has started a Change.Org petition demanding warning labels be added to the Singulair’s packaging to warn parents of the serious side effects. “Children that take this medication are often unable to communicate the horror they are experiencing so they rely on their parents to identify the side effects,” she wrote in the petition. “A list of the potential side effects is buried deep in the product information which is not often provided with the prescription. “We ask that a fluorescent warning label be placed on the outside of the Singulair (Montelukast) packaging in order to educate parents and adult users of these severe side effects.” Ms Sellick said she took her son Austin off the medication after finding the TGA report, Harrison was no longer using it. Photo: Vanessa Sellick. Singulair (Montelukast) was first made available in Australia in 1998. Ms Sellick was concerned that many children had suffered long-term side effects after taking the drug. The drug's producer, Merck, Sharp and Dohme has claimed millions use the drug safely worldwide. “The health and safety of patients who use our medicines is our highest priority. We take any report received about our medicines very seriously,” a spokesman told Daily Mail. The spokesman said it was a GP’s responsibility to keep up to date with side effects of medications and inform patients appropriately. Ms Sellick’s petition has sparked other mothers to also come forward about their experiences with the drug. Leanne Mackey wrote her son had been taking the medication for nine months as a four-year-old. “He became over time, violent, moody, despondent, he talked of wanting the world to go black,” she wrote. “He had the sensation of pins and needles in his arms and legs for long periods of time, became forgetful, and started certain ocd behaviors (sic).” She claimed within a week of stopping the medication, her son started to “come out of the fog”. “He's now 11 and happy, while still suffering with asthma, but NEVER again would I allow him on Singulair. I tell everyone i know about the dangers of Singulair. (sic)” Yahoo7 have also approached MSD for comment as to whether they feel the warnings on the drug Singulair were adequate.

Vanessa Sellick said her son Harrison was prescribed asthma medication when he was two years old but started experiencing behavioural problems and suicidal thoughts. The drug, which is called Montelukast or Singulair, is usually prescribed to children with asthma between two to 14 years of age.  Harrison Sellick tried to kill himself when he was five years old when he was taking a brand of asthma medication that has been linked to psychotic episodes in children Harrison, who is now 10, took the medication for three years.  'He started having really long meltdowns that would last for an hour and a half. There was general comments about death and self-loathing,' Ms Sellick told Daily Mail Australia.   Ms Sellick said her son tried to kill himself when he was just five. 'It was a deliberate attempt - he was in severe psychological pain,' she said. Ms Sellick said doctors were unable to explain his psychological issues and said she made the link to his medication after Australia's Therapeutic Goods Association put out a safety alert about the drug in 2013. Harrison had already stopped taking the medication by this time.  Harrison, who is now 10, took the medication for three years. His mother Vanessa said he experienced severe behavioural problems during this time The drug, which is called Montelukast or Singulair, is usually prescribed to children with asthma between two to 14 years of age Harrison, pictured as a baby, was prescribed asthma medication when he was two years old In the update it said between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2013 the TGA had received reports of neuropsychiatric adverse events in 58 children and adolescents being treated with Montelukast. Among these adverse events were five reports of suicidal thoughts, five reports of depression and eight reports of agitation. Other neuropsychiatric reactions reported to the TGA included nightmares, altered mood and insomnia and in many cases, patients had experienced multiple neuropsychiatric reactions. The company who produces the drug, Merck, Sharp and Dohme, said it had been used safely by millions of people around the world and was first made available in Australia in 1998. 'The health and safety of patients who use our medicines is our highest priority. We take any report received about our medicines very seriously,' a spokesman said. 'The decision to prescribe or to discontinue treatment is taken jointly by the doctor and their individual patient, as only they can weigh-up the potential benefits against any potential risks in a given individual case. 'The doctor has a responsibility to keep themselves up-to-date with the effects of that medicine.'  Harrison, pictured with his younger brother Austin, started having really long meltdowns when he was about three. He started having suicidal thoughts soon after Vanessa Sellick said her youngest son Austin (right) also suffered side effects from the drug but not as severe as Harrison (left) and he bounced back immediately after stopping Ms Sellick has started a Change.org petition to campaign for warning labels to be added to the drug to warn parents that some, but not all, children can suffer severe side effects.     'We want fluorescent warning labels on the packaging. We think it's really important that this extra step is taken - it will help parents make the link between medication and neuropsychiatric side effects,' she said.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Asthma tablets linked to depression and suicidal thoughts in...

Share this article Share 242 shares 'There’s no consumer information on the package at all. The only time people get information is when they get a prescription.' Ms Sellick urged parents not to make a knee jerk reaction about their children's asthma medication.  'It is important that decisions about asthma management are made in consultation with a doctor and that alternative preventer medication is organised prior to coming off,' she said.  Harrison suffered insomnia while taking the drug and his fear of sleeping resulted in him staying with his young brother Austin most nights Ms Sellick has started a Change.org petition to campaign for warning labels to be added to the drug to warn parents that some, but not all, children can suffer severe side effects 'We acknowledge that not all people suffer the neuropsychiatric side effects of Montelukast (Singulair) however those who do can suffer significantly, in ways such as anxiety and suicide.' She said her youngest son Austin also suffered side effects from the drug but his reaction was not as severe and he bounced back after he stopped taking the medication.  'His improvement was instant and drastic and noticed by those who knew him. His social skills improved immediately,' Ms Sellick said. 'He became able to mange his temper, he suddenly tried at swimming lessons, he started trying new foods and was very happy.'
