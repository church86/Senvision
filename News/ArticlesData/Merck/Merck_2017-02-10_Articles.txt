His pacemaker told police… YOU WANT MORE TRUMP? BECAUSE THIS IS HOW YOU GET MORE TRUMP: … » February 10, 2017 GOOD: Doctors See Gains Against ‘an Urgent Threat,’ C. Diff. Infection rates seem to be dropping, as hospitals take infection-control more seriously. Plus: As for new treatments, experts see encouraging prospects: • In the next few weeks, the drug maker Merck will begin marketing bezlotoxumab (brand name: Zinplava), shown to reduce C. diff recurrences. A study in The New England Journal of Medicine last month reported that the drug, which uses an antibody against a C. diff toxin, reduced recurrences to 16 to 17 percent. With a placebo, the infection recurred in 26 to 28 percent of patients. The drug is expensive, at $3,800 for a one-time intravenous infusion, but Merck has said its patient-assistance program will cover Zinplava for those unable to pay. • Dr. Gerding and his team have conducted trials of an orally administered liquid containing spores of a C. diff strain that does not produce toxins or cause illness, but supplants the toxic strains. His small study of 168 patients, published in JAMA, showed that the most effective dose brought the recurrence rate down to 5 percent. (Dr. Gerding receives consulting fees from several pharmaceutical firms.) • Several dozen studies of another promising method of reducing recurrence, the gross-sounding fecal transplant, are underway at research centers. I don’t know why people are so grossed out about fecal transplants. And honestly, that looks the most promising.

Also participating were Merck Ventures (NL), Ysios Capital (ES) and Sunstone Capital (DK). Prexton, of Naarden, the Netherlands, is a biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic compounds for the treatment of central nervous system conditions. PRESS RELEASE Naarden, The Netherlands, 7 February 2017 – Forbion Capital Partners (“Forbion”), one of the leading Dutch Venture Capital firms investing in world-class healthcare technologies, today announced the closing of a Series B financing round of EUR 29 million (USD 31 million) for Prexton Therapeutics (Prexton). Prexton is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutic compounds for the treatment of Central Nervous System (CNS) conditions. Forbion and Seroba Life Sciences (IE) co-led the financing round, which includes current investors Merck Ventures (NL), Ysios Capital (ES) and Sunstone Capital (DK). Marco Boorsma (Forbion) and Alan O’Connell (Seroba) will join the Board of Prexton. The Series B funding will be used to finance two phase II studies of Prexton’s lead product, Foliglurax (formerly known as PXT002331) in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The phase II trials will start in 2017 and will take place in specialist centers in Europe and the US. PD is a devastating progressive neurological condition affecting around 6.3 million people worldwide1. The disease is caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic brain cells and the main symptoms are resting tremor, muscle rigidity (“OFF-time”) and uncontrolled movements (“Dyskinesia”). Current treatments aim to replace dopamine or to mimic its effects. Patients are administered with the dopamine precursor, L-DOPA. This treatment provides adequate symptomatic relief initially, but over time, it loses efficacy as the disease progresses and patients experience serious debilitating side effects, such as dyskinesia. Prexton’s approach is to stimulate a compensatory neuronal system that is unaffected by PD. Instead of targeting the dopaminergic system, Foliglurax activates a specific target of the glutamatergic system (mGluR4). The aim of this product candidate is to treat the motor symptoms of PD. A phase I trial with Foliglurax was successfully completed in September 2016. The results showed that Foliglurax was safe and well-tolerated at doses well above those that produce robust effects in PD primate models. “It is a testament to the potential of Foliglurax that we have successfully completed such a significant funding round from high quality investors,” said Francois Conquet, CEO of Prexton Therapeutics. “We have developed a strong package of preclinical and phase I clinical data with Foliglurax. We are now keen to begin our phase II efficacy trials and continue the development of Foliglurax as a potential new therapeutic for Parkinson’s disease.” “We have been very impressed with the science behind Foliglurax and the alternative route being explored by Prexton to treat this difficult disease. Early data is encouraging and we believe Prexton’s approach could make a significant difference to developing new treatment options for patients.” said Forbion’s Marco Boorsma. “As part of the funding round, we are helping Prexton set up operations in the Netherlands and supporting the company in starting trials. We look forward to working with the team” 1 The European Parkinson’s Disease Association: www.epda.eu.com/en/pd-info/about-parkinsons/?gclid=CPawttbG0NECFVTNGwod4RQHkA Fundraising?

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Feb 10, 2017 at 4:20PM Hope that a big drugmaker will bid to buy Tesaro (NASDAQ:TSRO) has sent this company's shares skyrocketing 40% this year. That's impressive, but there could be room to run higher. Why? Because Tesaro could be about to land its second FDA approval, and this next approval could be a biggie. Been there, done that, and doing it again Tesaro is run by Lonnie Moulder, an industry veteran with a history of biopharma M&A. In the 2000s, Moulder was the CEO of MGI Pharma, a company that successfully commercialized the chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting drug Aloxi. Moulder built Aloxi into a nine-figure top-seller before orchestrating a $3.9 billion deal to sell MGI Pharma to Eisai, a major Japanese drugmaker. Image source: Getty Images. After MGI Pharma, Moulder spent a brief stint in the top spot at Abraxis Biosciences prior to founder Patrick Soon-Shiong selling it to Celgene for $2.9 billion in 2011. Moulder also served on the board of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, which was eventually bought by Merck & Co. for $9.5 billion in 2015. Today, Moulder is attempting to catch lightning in a bottle again as CEO of Tesaro. At Tesaro, Moulder has successfully launched Varubi, an oral CINV drug he licensed from Opko Health, and he's successfully completed registration-ready clinical studies on an IV formulation of Varubi, and niraparip, a cancer drug. Best in class? If approved, the IV formulation of Varubi will open up it up to the lion's share of its addressable market, and that could be worth nine figures. That's a lot of money, but Varubi's peak sales potential may pale in comparison to niraparib. Niraparib is a PARP-inhibitor that Moulder paid Merck & Co. the bargain basement price of $7 million for back in 2012. PARP-inhibitors limit a cancer cell's ability to repair damage due to cancer treatment, and this class of drug's appears quite effective in ovarian cancer, and potentially, in breast cancer. So far, two other PARP-inhibitors have won FDA approval. The first is Lynparza, an AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) drug OK'd for use in heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer patients with BRCA mutations. The second is Rubraca, a Clovis Oncology (NASDAQ:CLVS) drug that got the FDA nod in December, and is also approved for use in heavily pre-treated BRCA positive patients. Niraparib, however, could end up leap-frogging those two therapies. About 85% of ovarian cancer patients have their disease return following platinum-based chemotherapy, and unfortunately, the amount of time between relapses shrinks over time. While Lynparza and Rubraca are approved for use after three and two prior lines of chemotherapy,respectively, niraparib maintenance therapy extended time between relapses, suggesting it could get used ahead of Lynparza and Rubraca. Furthermore, niraparib delayed disease progression in both BRCA positive and BRCA negative patients, suggesting it could be used much more widely than these other two drugs. Overall, only 15% to 20% of the 22,280 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in the U.S. annually are BRCA positive. If the FDA green lights niraparib with a label that's more favorable than Lynparza and Rubraca, it could reshape patient treatment. And, since Lynparza and Rubraca both carry six figure annual price tags, niraparib's more widespread use could translate into hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales for Tesaro. Looking ahead Global spending on cancer treatment eclipses $100 billion annually, according to IMSHealth, and that's got big pharma eager to expand their exposure to the indication, both via internal R&D and M&A. That eagerness is leading to big paydays for pure-play commercial-stage cancer drug companies like Tesaro. In 2014, AbbVie spent $21 billion to buy Pharmacyclics to share commercialization rights with Johnson & Johnson on Imbruvica, a fast-growing lymphoma and leukemia drug. And, in 2016, Pfizer spent $14 billion to share commercialization rights to the prostate-cancer drug Xtandi with Astellas. Since Tesaro owns 100% of the global rights to niraparib, and niraparib could have billion dollar blockbuster potential, it wouldn't be out of the question for Tesaro to fetch a premium in a deal. Currently, the company boasts a market cap of $10 billion. Ultimately, Tesaro's success depends on FDA approval of niraparib, and niraparib's ability to outflank other PARP inhibitors depends on its prescribing label. If the FDA balks, or the label isn't as good as hoped, then it could make Tesaro a little less appealing to a suitor. But given that there are already two PARP inhibitors on the market, and there's a big unmet need for new ovarian cancer treatments, I think this one has a good shot at a regulatory OK.

Quotes in the article Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC RBGLY ▼ 17.63 -0.52 -2.87% Mead Johnson Nutrition Co MJN ▲ 87.72 +4.67 +5.62% Bayer AG BAYRY ▲ 113.01 +0.47 +0.42% Merck & Co Inc MRK ▼ 64.15 -0.24 -0.37% The U.K. company, which owns Durex condoms and Scholl footcare, earlier this month disclosed that it was in talks with Mead after The Wall Street Journal reported on the potential deal. It will pay $90 a share in cash for the Glenview, Ill.-based company, which makes a range of nutritional products including Enfamil infant formula and the Sustagen milk supplement for children. Including debt, the deal is valued at $17.9 billion. The acquisition caps a yearslong search by Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who lost out to Bayer AG in a bidding war for Merck & Co.'s consumer business in 2014, and has since been looking to do a big deal. Reckitt's growth has slowed lately, leaving the Slough, England-based company in need of a new avenue to jump-start sales. Friday, the company reported organic revenue growth of just 3% for 2016, its weakest in over a decade. Sales have been hit by a string of issues lately, including a failed foot-care innovation, a scandal in South Korea that led to its product being delisted, disruption in India after some high value bills were taken out of circulation. Shares rose as much as 2% in early trading in London but lately were down 0.8%. Reckitt on Friday forecast 2017 like-for-like growth of 3%, which is below analyst estimates. Mr. Kapoor said Mead Johnson fits into Reckitt's consumer-health portfolio tangentially, just like its condom and foot-care brand acquisitions have in the past. "Our strategy is about healthier lives and homes," he said. "Their mission is about enabling healthier lives from the very beginning." He identified child nutrition as a solid opportunity, saying the category is projected to grow sales by 3% to 5% over the medium to long term. Mead reported net sales of $3.7 billion in 2016, down 8%. Half the company's sales came from Asia, with 17% coming from Latin America and the rest from North America and Europe. The deal will turn China into Reckitt's second-biggest market, increasing its emerging-markets footprint by two-thirds. The deal will also significantly boost the company's exposure to the U.S., which remains its No. 1 market. However, buying Mead won't necessarily be the silver bullet Reckitt is looking for. Analysts have noted few obvious synergies between the two companies beyond some distribution and head-office cuts. "This deal does have elements of desperation about it," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jeff Stent following Reckitt's initial confirmation that it was in talks to buy Mead. "Mead has zero overlap with Reckitt." The company said the Mead deal would boost per-share earnings by a double-digit percentage by the third year after closing, which Mr. Stent on Friday described as "very conservative," likely driven by low savings and the high cost of funding the deal. Reckitt forecast cost savings of GBP200 million ($249.9 million). Still, investors had cheered the deal when initially announced, which could raise Reckitt's exposure to faster growing, higher margin categories in the long term, while Mead's struggling performance lately made it a good time for an approach despite the pound's decline following Brexit. Mead's shares have fallen sharply in the past two years--as the company grappled with sluggish sales in its key Asia market--and were down 2.7% since the start of this year, before news of the deal broke. "I don't think you should read too much into the timing," Mr. Kapoor told journalists on conference call, saying Reckitt had been looking at Mead and other companies "for a number of years." Reckitt on Friday reported 1% like-for-like sales growth for 2016 in Europe and North America, and said emerging markets grew by over 8%. Net income rose 5% to GBP1.83 billion. Robey Warshaw, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and HSBC advised Reckitt. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley advised Mead Johnson.

The U.K. company, which owns Durex condoms and Scholl footcare, earlier this month disclosed that it was in talks with Mead. It will pay $90 a share in cash for the Glenview, Ill.-based company, which makes a range of nutritional products including Enfamil infant formula and the Sustagen milk supplement for children. Including debt, the deal is valued at $17.9 billion. The acquisition caps a yearslong search by Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who lost out to Bayer AG in a bidding war for Merck & Co.'s consumer business in 2014, and has since been looking to do a big deal. Reckitt's growth has slowed lately, leaving the Slough, England-based company in need of a new avenue to jump-start sales. Friday, the company reported organic revenue growth of just 3% for 2016, its weakest in over a decade. Sales have been hit by a string of issues lately, including a failed foot-care innovation, a scandal in South Korea that led to its product being delisted, disruption in India after some high value bills were taken out of circulation. Shares rose just 1.2% in early trading in London after Reckitt estimated 2017 like-for-like growth of 3%, which is below analyst forecasts. Mr. Kapoor said Mead Johnson fits into Reckitt's consumer-health portfolio tangentially, just like its condom and footcare brand acquisitions have in the past. "Our strategy is about healthier lives and homes," he said. "Their mission is about enabling healthier lives from the very beginning." He identified child nutrition as a solid opportunity, saying the category is projected to grow sales by 3% to 5% over the medium to long term. Mead reported net sales of $3.7 billion in 2016, down 8%. Half the company's sales came from Asia, with 17% coming from Latin America and the rest from North America and Europe. The deal will turn China into Reckitt's second-biggest market, increasing its emerging-markets footprint by two-thirds. The deal will also significantly boost the company's exposure to the U.S., which remains its No. 1 market. However, buying Mead won't necessarily be the silver bullet Reckitt is looking for. Analysts have noted few obvious synergies between the two companies beyond some distribution and head-office cuts. "This deal does have elements of desperation about it," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jeff Stent following Reckitt's initial confirmation that it was in talks to buy Mead. "Mead has zero overlap with Reckitt." The company said the Mead deal would boost per-share earnings by a double-digit percentage by the third year after closing, which Mr. Stent on Friday described as "very conservative," likely driven by low savings and the high cost of funding the deal. Reckitt forecast cost savings of GBP200 million ($249.9 million). Still, investors had cheered the deal when initially announced, which could raise Reckitt's exposure to faster growing, higher margin categories in the long term, while Mead's struggling performance lately made it a good time for an approach despite the pound's decline following Brexit. Mead's shares have fallen sharply in the past two years--as the company grappled with sluggish sales in its key Asia market--and were down 2.7% since the start of this year, before news of the deal broke. "I don't think you should read too much into the timing," Mr. Kapoor told journalists on conference call, saying Reckitt had been looking at Mead and other companies "for a number of years." Reckitt on Friday reported 1% like-for-like sales growth for 2016 in Europe and North America, and said emerging markets grew by over 8%. Net income rose 5% to GBP1.83 billion.

Mark Zuckerberg Isn't Only Billionaire Trying To Save Lives, So Are Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg And Ray Dalio By Marcy Kreiter @marcykreiter On 02/09/17 AT 9:44 PM Close Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn’t the only billionaire trying to eradicate diseases. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Bridgewater Associates Chairman Ray Dalio also have ponied up big bucks to eliminate such scourges as polio. Berkshire Hathaway genius Warren Buffett has donated billions. Zuckerberg and his wife, Chan, established a billion-dollar philanthropy organization in 2015 to "cure, prevent or manage all disease" by 2100 and has hired 47 scientists to begin researching and designing long-term strategies. Now the medical component, Biohub, has been funded with $50 million. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which was founded in 2000 and is the largest transparently operated privately funded foundation in the world, launched the Global Health Investment Fund in 2013 with $108 million to develop drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and “other interventions against diseases that disproportionately burden low- and middle-income countries.” Among the foundation’s partners are JPMorgan Chase & Co., GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and the Pfizer Foundation. Gates also invited fellow billionaires Bloomberg and Dalio last year to aid in the fight to eradicate polio, raising an additional $70 million for the effort. The World Health Organization reported 42 new cases of the paralytic disease last year and one new case so far this year, mostly concentrated in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria where terrorist groups have made vaccination efforts dangerous. Polio no longer is a problem in the Americas, Europe or Australia but before the vaccine was introduced in 1955, the United States reported 10,000 to nearly 29,000 cases annually. Efforts to eliminate polio have nearly succeeded. Above, a medical worker administers polio drops to an infant in Agartala, India, Jan. 18, 2015. Photo: Jayanta Dey/Reuters Related Stories WHO Confirms Cases Of Vaccine-Driven Polio Outbreak In Ukraine, Mali Malaria Helped Kill Off Roman Empire: Study The Gates Foundation also is active in the fight against malaria, a major killer of children. Nearly half the world’s population is at risk of the disease, with 212 million cases reported in 2015 and an estimated 429,000 deaths. Since 2019, malaria rates have fallen 29 percent. Buffett donated $31 billion to the Gates Foundation in 2006, in hopes the money would be used to fight AIDS. Approximately 78 million people worldwide, 1.1 million in the U.S., are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, with 2 million new cases reported in 2014. The scourge started in the last 1970s and by the end of 1985, there was at least one case in every region of the world. Genentech CEO and Apple Chairman Arthur D. Levinson heads up Calico, which uses Google’s cloud and data centers to mine data on disease and aging. Google CEO Larry Page has indicated the project’s aim is to extend human life by as much as 100 years. Among the other diseases, the Gates Foundation has targeted are enteric and diarrheal diseases, neglected tropical diseases, pneumonia and tuberculosis.

(Nasdaq:ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, today announced that the compensation committee of Alnylam’s board of directors, which is composed entirely of independent directors, approved a grant, effective as of February 6, 2017, to a vice president level employee of the Company, of a non-qualified stock option to purchase 50,000 shares of Alnylam’s common stock. This option was granted as an inducement material to the employee’s entering into employment with the Company in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). The stock option has a ten-year term and an exercise price of $43.01, equal to the per share closing price of Alnylam’s common stock as reported by NASDAQ on the date of grant. The stock option will vest over four years, with 25% vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remainder vesting ratably at the end of each three-month period thereafter over the remaining three years, assuming the employee remains continuously employed by Alnylam as of such date. Alnylam is providing this stock option information in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).

By Chris Lange February 10, 2017 8:35 am EST Print Email Tweet Pharmaceutical companies usually are involved in a lengthy process in getting their drug candidates to market through clinical trials. There is a fair amount of risk involved, should a study come back negative or a candidate not be approved. Conversely, if a drug gains FDA approval or passes a clinical trial, there can be big upside. The Trump administration has promised reforms in the health care sector, such as changing the bidding process for drugs and shortening the FDA approval process. It has yet to be seen how much headway Trump can actually make with these reforms, but so far the reaction has been quite positive. Keep in mind that short sellers betting against big pharma are taking on an added risk. They have to pay out the ongoing high dividends on top of the cost of borrowing the shares. The January 31 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and short interest moves in these selected pharmaceutical stocks mostly increased. Short interest in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) decreased to 34.30 million shares from the previous 37.93 million. Its shares were last seen at $32.38, within a 52-week trading range of $28.74 to $37.39. The number of Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) shares short increased to 18.36 million from 15.95 million in the previous period. Its shares were trading at $64.39, in a 52-week range of $48.28 to $65.46. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s (NYSE: TEVA) short interest increased to 20.99 million shares, compared to the previous level of 19.98 million. Shares were trading at $32.25, in a 52-week range of $31.90 to $59.35. The short interest rise in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY) was to 13.45 million shares, compared to the previous reading of 12.18 million. Shares were trading at $51.51, within a 52-week range of $46.01 to $77.12. The number of shares short in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) decreased to 30.98 million, compared to the previous 33.44 million. The stock was trading at $60.84, in a 52-week range of $51.60 to $68.12. Eli Lilly and Co.’s (NYSE: LLY) short interest increased slightly to 10.82 million shares from the previous 10.72 million. The stock was trading at $77.70. The 52-week range is $64.18 to $83.79.
