Recent Posts Area Sports Briefs: Catawba baseball eliminated from tournament Rowan Museum brings re-enactors to Confederate Prison site Local nonprofits close Sexual Assault Awareness Month with moving service Salisbury City Council to consider Catawba College rezoning My Turn: Treat Fibrant as an asset, not a liability Smart Start’s Read to Me program takes children on a reading journey By Staff Report Email the author Published 12:05 am Sunday, April 30, 2017 By Susan Shinn Turner Smart Start Rowan SALISBURY — Last week, more than 30 community members and members of the Smart Start Rowan board fanned out across the county to read in N.C. Pre-K classes and childcare centers. Smart Start Rowan coordinates these visits for the Read to Me program each year during the Week of the Young Child. This program nearly doubled in size from last year. The week culminated on Saturday with the agency’s annual Early Childhood Conference at First Baptist Church, attended by more than 100 childcare providers in Rowan County. But the best part might have taken place in the classrooms. This is Smart Start Rowan board member Jimmy Greene’s third year participating in the Read to Me program. “On reading day, I showed up and was greeted with all smiles,” he said. “A table full of well-mannered children gazed upon this tall, goofy man. All of their eyes locked in with wonder, worry, shyness, uncertainty, and excitement all rolled into one. After some small talk, we opened our book and began our journey, and it was a wonderful journey!” Greene added, “I was reminded, as I am every year, about love. The joy of reading to a child will enhance you. It is a blessing. Go share a journey with a child through a book.” Amy Brown, Smart Start Rowan’s executive director, agreed with Greene. “The kids love it, and the teachers love it,” she said. “But the folks who get the most of out it are our volunteers who visit the classroom.” One of those volunteers was Crystal Merck, elementary instructional lead teacher for Rowan-Salisbury Schools. She visited the N.C. Pre-K program at Granite Quarry Elementary School on Friday morning. “Now sit crisscross, applesauce on your letter,” Merck told the children, as they scrambled to find their spots on the alphabet carpet. If she sounds like a teacher, that’s because she spent 13 years in the classroom as an elementary school teacher. Coincidentally, she began her career at Granite. “I can’t see!” more than one child said as they got settled. “I promised I will show every single person the picture,” Merck said, and she did just that, reading with a variety of animated expressions and volume levels — both of which held the children’s attention. As she read, she asked the children questions about the story — what the characters were doing, how they were feeling. Thanks to Smart Start Rowan, all volunteers leave the books they read in the classrooms. “They love to interact and imitate,” lead teacher Teresa Davis said of the children. “This helps build their communication skills. We love for visitors to come. When the children heard we were having a visitor, they dropped everything in their centers and ran for story time.” “Thank you so much for letting me come and read,” Merck told the children before she left. “I’m so excited about your graduation to big kids’ school. I can’t wait to come back.” Being in the classrooms is Merck’s favorite part of her job, she said. “It’s such a privilege to get to do this,” Brown said. “I’ve been out two times this week.” Meanwhile, over at Cornerstone Child Development Center on Webb Road, Flora Calderon-Steck was reading to a classroom of 18 N.C. Pre-K students. As 11 of the students were Spanish speakers, Calderon-Steck read her book, Margaret Wise Brown’s “Away In My Airplane,” in English and Spanish, translating as she went. “Muy bien!” she said, as all of the students repeated the Spanish words. They loved the book’s bright pages, commenting on everything they saw as the airplane flew overhead: the sun, the rain, a mouse, people, a fair. They loved the colorful tent and balloons on that page. “I’ve been to the fair!” one little girl piped up. “Isn’t this an exciting book?” Calderon-Steck asked. One page had many airplanes. She and the children counted together — one, two, three, four, five. They repeated the numbers in Spanish. “You guys are so good!” Calderon-Steck said. “I’m so glad a nice number are Spanish speakers,” she said afterward. “They really responded well.” While the children returned to their centers, Calderon-Steck spent some time visiting with lead teacher Beverly Parker. “When our Spanish speakers came here at the beginning of the year, they spoke not one word of English,” Parker noted. “Now they are talking to me. It just makes me feel so good. They’re my babies. But I don’t want them to lose that Spanish. I’m gonna learn Spanish so I can communicate with them better.” “The students were so attentive and engaged, and they used their imaginations,” Calderon-Steck said. She and Brown walked to the parking lot together. “That was fun,” she told Brown. “We’ll do it again next year.”   Smart Start Rowan is a United Way member agency.                         Comments comments Print Article Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The field of oncology is wide comprising a varied type of application area. The focus of researchers is gradually shifting towards the immunotherapies. The immunotherapy makes the use of body’s own components to fight cancer. Immune checkpoints are molecules that stimulate or inhibit the immune cells. Yervoy was the first drug launched in the immune checkpoint inhibitors domain. This anit-CTLA-4 drug was followed by many other drugs such as Keytruda and Opdivo. Besides these molecules there are several others under clinical development. There is an ongoing competition between the immune checkpoint inhibitors market contributors to emerge as a leader. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Market: Drivers and Restraints The immune checkpoint inhibitors market is driven by the number of research developments undertaken by industry contributors as well as academic institutes. The immune checkpoint inhibitors market is experiencing a lot of collaborations wherein companies are combining their core competencies to fasten their research programs. For instance, Merck known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada along with Dynavax Technologies Corporation are investigating the potential synergistic effects by combining Dynavax's SD-101 with two of Merck’s immunotherapies Keytruda and MK-1966.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 5 Big Drugmakers With Important Catalysts in May Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Regeneron, and Sanofi await big FDA decisions in May. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Apr 30, 2017 at 11:41AM April showers bring May flowers. And as every grade-schooler knows, Mayflowers bring Pilgrims. The month of May also brings key catalysts for five big drugmakers: Merck (NYSE:MRK), Novartis (NYSE:NVS), Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), and Sanofi (NYSE:SNY). Here's what's coming around the corner. Image source: Getty Images. Merck: Two decisions on the way Merck anticipates two approval decisions by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May. The more important is for Keytruda. An FDA decision on approval of the drug in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is expected by May 10. Keytruda already won approval as a monotherapy for first-line treatment of NSCLC. However, many observers think that combination treatments could hold even greater potential for battling the disease. The pharmaceutical company also awaits an FDA decision for Isentress in combination with other antiretroviral therapies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. That decision is expected by May 27. Isentress first won approval for treating HIV in 2007. Novartis: Hope for patients with two rare diseases On Nov. 14, 2016, the FDA granted priority review to Novartis' PKC412 (midostaurin) in treating rare diseases acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and advanced systemic mastocytosis. That means an approval decision should be announced by May 14. PKC412 targets treatment of adult AML patients with an FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) mutation. This mutation occurs in around one-third of patients. Novartis collaborated with Invivoscribe Technologies to develop a companion diagnostic test to identify patients with the FLT3 mutation. A premarket approval application (PMA) for this companion diagnostic was also accepted for review by the FDA. If approved, PKC412 could be a game changer for both targeted indications, but particularly for AML. Treatment approaches for AML haven't changed dramatically for years. Novartis' drug could be the first FLT3-mutated AML therapy to demonstrate a survival benefit.  Novo Nordisk: Looking to expand its hemophilia franchise Novo Nordisk already claims three hemophilia drugs on the market. The Danish drugmaker would like to make that number go up to four soon. The company expects an FDA decision on experimental hemophilia B drug nonacog beta pegol by May 16. The FDA's blood products advisory committee already met on April 4 to review the drug.  Efficacy shouldn't be an issue. Novo Nordisk's pivotal clinical studies involving 115 patients with severe or moderately severe hemophilia B found significant reduction in bleeding and sustained maintenance of factor IX, the clotting protein which is missing or defective in hemophilia B patients. The primary hurdle Novo Nordisk has is the safety of nonacog beta pegol. The FDA advisory committee noted two concerns. One was related to whether the monitoring of neurologic function in Novo Nordisk's clinical studies was adequate to detect all clinically important neurologic signs or symptoms. The other was a question about whether the number of patients involved in the studies was sufficient to evaluate the safety of the drug. Regeneron and Sanofi: The second time could be the charm Regeneron and Sanofi got turned down by the FDA on their initial attempt to win approval for Kevzara (sarilumab) in treating rheumatoid arthritis. The agency pointed to manufacturing issues at the Sanofi facility where the drug was made as the reason for its rejection. The two partners hope that the second time will prove to be the charm. Regeneron and Sanofi recently announced the FDA had accepted the resubmission of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for Kevzara. An approval decision is expected by May 22.  If approved, Kevzara would add to the growing list of drugs in which Regeneron and Sanofi have partnered. The two companies already market cholesterol drug Praluent and recently won regulatory approval for atopic dermatitis drug Dupixent.  Biggest impact? I suspect that the biggest impact of these looming FDA decisions will be the one for Kevzara. Analysts expect the drug to reach sales of $1.8 billion by 2020, if approved. A positive decision would help both Regeneron and Sanofi, but Regeneron's share price would likely benefit the most. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Paris:ALNOX) (Alternext Paris: ALNOX), a biotechnology company focused on improving cancer treatment by targeting the tumor microenvironment, today announced its financial results for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The consolidated financial statements of NOXXON Pharma N.V. and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU). Aram Mangasarian, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of NOXXON commented: "The year 2016 was an important time for NOXXON as we completed our transition to a clinical-stage, cancer-focused company. By narrowing our focus to our lead clinical program, NOX-A12, we were able to take major steps towards securing a stronger financial future: We significantly decreased costs, completed a public listing and converted the majority of outstanding debt to equity. He continued: "Already by the end of 2016 we saw our new strategy bear fruit: We entered a collaboration with Merck to evaluate NOX-A12 with Keytruda® in tumor types that traditionally have not responded to treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor alone. We also non-exclusively licensed our Spiegelmer® technology and assigned our preclinical Spiegelmer® programs in a deal that provides NOXXON with potential upside as these programs advance and without our incurring additional costs." Recent Business Highlights September 2016: Private placement executed consisting of equity contributions, a debt-to-equity conversion and further contributions. Under a new agreement, 7.0 million of 9.6 million debt converted to equity. September 2016: NOXXON becomes public company, lists on Alternext Paris. Fall 2016: Preclinical data presented at major medical conferences. Synergy demonstrated between NOX-A12 and therapies working through T cells, such as checkpoint inhibitors, or through NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). December 2016: Clinical trial collaboration with Merck & Co./MSD consummated to evaluate NOX-A12 and anti-PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), in patients with metastatic solid tumors that do not usually respond to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy. January 2017: NOXXON announces that it licensed preclinical Spiegelmer® program to Aptarion in exchange for cash, royalties and equity stake in Aptarion. February 2017: Experienced industry cancer clinician Dr. Jarl Ulf Jungnelius increases his involvement with NOXXON to serve as Chief Medical Officer. Of relevance to NOXXON is his prior experience in immune-oncology and his involvement with two therapeutics that have been approved for pancreatic cancer, one of the indications pursued in the upcoming clinical trial of NOX-A12. 2016 Financial Summary Revenue was 83 thousand for 2016 compared to 43 thousand for 2015. Research and development expenses decreased by 30% to 5.3 million (2015: 7.6 million). In third quarter of 2016, NOXXON decided to focus all of its business activities on the NOX-A12 clinical program. This strategic change in focus and the related headcount reduction, decreased personnel expenses by 1.0 million in 2016. Other operating income increased from 74 thousand to 437 thousand in 2016, mainly due to income from government grants related to research and development projects of 385 thousand compared to nil in 2015 and income from the sale of financial assets and property, plant and equipment of 20 thousand compared to nil in 2015. General and administrative expenses decreased by 48% to 3.8 million (2015: 7.3 million). This decrease was mainly due to lower legal and consulting expenses related to financing transactions. Additionally, restructuring costs and settlement benefits, which were mainly related to the restructuring initiated in July 2015, decreased in 2016 compared to 2015. Restructuring expenses were 22 thousand for 2016 compared to 510 thousand in 2015; settlement benefits were 33 thousand in 2016 compared to 521 thousand in 2015. Finance income was 1 thousand for 2016 (2015:  0), and finance cost was 2.1 million (2015: 1.3 million), mainly related to the interest incurred on financial liabilities, applying the effective interest rate method, the modifications of and the debt-for-equity conversion on two venture loans. Net loss for the full year 2016 was 10.8 million, compared to 16.1 million in 2015, a reduction of 33%. The decrease was primarily due to the 6.2 million decreased operating loss (2016: 8.6 million; 2015: 14.8 million). As of December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents amounted to 2.2 million, compared to 4.1 million at December 31, 2015. The consolidated financial statements for 2016, approved by the board of directors on April 28, 2017, are available on NOXXONs website (www.noxxon.com). 2016 Financial Results NOXXONs key financial figures for fiscal year 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 are summarized below:           [in  thousands]       2016     2015 Revenues       83     43 Other operating income       437     74 Research and development expenses       (5,327)     (7,587) General and administrative expenses       (3,780)     (7,319) Foreign exchange losses       (12)     (41) Loss from operations       (8,599)     (14,830) Finance income       1     0 Finance cost       (2,127)     (1,294) Loss before income tax       (10,725)     (16,124) Income tax       (27)     22 Net loss       (10,752)     (16,102)   Outlook 2017 As disclosed in the financials and the annual report available on NOXXONs website (www.noxxon.com), NOXXON expects to sign shortly a financing agreement composed of 1) a private placement for an amount of 1.0 million financed by existing investors and a new investor and 2) a convertible bond vehicle financed by a new investor for up to 10.0 million, of which 3.5m may be received at the discretion of NOXXON over the 12 months following the transfer of the NOXXON shares from the "private placement compartment to the "public offering compartment of Alternext Paris, provided that certain conditions are met, principally the approval of a prospectus relating to such transfer by the Dutch regulator, the AFM, which will then be passported to France and approved by the French regulator the AMF. NOXXON expects to see rapid and significant progress in the achievement of clinical data points. Based on these findings, NOXXON expects a sufficient data base to enable a Go/No-Go for pivotal studies with NOX-A12 as a combination therapy with Keytruda® in microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and/or pancreatic cancer. NOXXON also plans to initiate clinical combination trials of NOX-A12 and radiotherapy for the therapy of glioblastoma. Additional financing is needed to secure the execution of the planned clinical trials, including the collaborative trial evaluating the combination of NOX-A12/Keytruda®. About NOXXON NOXXON Pharma N.V. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving cancer treatment by targeting the tumor microenvironment. NOXXONs goal is to significantly enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments including immuno-oncology approaches (such as immune checkpoint inhibitors) and current standards of care (such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy). NOXXONs Spiegelmer® platform has generated a proprietary pipeline of clinical-stage product candidates including its lead cancer drug candidate NOX-A12, which is the subject of a clinical immuno-oncology collaboration agreement with Merck & Co. / MSD (NYSE: MRK) to study NOX-A12 combined with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in pancreatic and colorectal cancer.

First-quarter earnings will keep rolling in this week as data will reveal if there was a rebound in April from a seemingly weak economy in March.  Apple reports Tuesday afternoon and will be as closely eyed as expectations around the firm's new iPhones continues to grow. Pharma giants Merck and Pfizer are also due on Tuesday. Media companies CBS, Viacom, and Time Warner will all report this week. We'll be listening in for management commentary on how they're navigating the changing content landscape.

Other reports include BP, Tesla, and Yum Brands. The Fed meets during the week and will make a rate decision on Wednesday. The market overwhelming expects rates to remain unchanged, but the statement may still offer some clues as to what the path of increases will look like. Friday will bring April's employment report, which comes after a disappointing March. Consumption data on Monday, along with its underlying inflation gauge, will also be in focus.

Chief Executive Pascal Soriot believes 2017 will mark the trough for the British group, as it starts to put generic losses behind it and builds up sales of recently launched and experimental cancer medicines. "The pipeline continued to deliver in what we expect will be a pivotal year," he said. "The total revenue performance reflected the transitional impact of recent patent expiries, which is expected to recede in the second half of the year." Despite income from disposals and external deals, first-quarter revenue fell 12 percent to $5.4 billion, although core earnings per share (EPS) rose 4 percent in dollar terms to 99 cents - helped by a $161 million one-off gain on the sale of short-term investments. Industry analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $5.4 billion and earnings of 82 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data. So-called "externalisation" revenue, which some analysts argue unduly flatters AstraZeneca's results, rose 2 percent to $562 million, while product sales fell 13 percent to $4.8 billion. "Earnings quality concerns persist," said Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, who rates the stock 'market-perform'. Shares in the company were down 0.5 percent by midday, with analysts noting that several key new drugs had missed consensus sales forecasts, including heart drug Brilinta, Lynparza for ovarian cancer and diabetes treatment Farxiga. AstraZeneca reiterated its expectation that full-year revenue would decline at a low to mid single-digit percentage rate, with core EPS dropping by a low to mid-teens percentage. BIG BET ON CANCER For investors, owning AstraZeneca shares represents a major bet on the company's oncology portfolio. It is already doing well with new lung cancer pill Tagrisso, but the really big opportunity lies in cancer immunotherapy. Results from its closely watched MYSTIC immuno-oncology (I-O) trial in previously untreated lung cancer patients are expected mid-year. Merck &amp; Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche already have similar drugs approved for lung cancer but AstraZeneca hopes to carve out a market by proving the value of combining two I-O drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab. "If combination works in a large range of patients, then certainly our market share should be expected to be pretty high," Soriot told reporters. It is a big 'if' for shareholders, who are waiting to see evidence that AstraZeneca can thrive as an independent company after spurning a takeover bid from Pfizer in 2014. "For long-term investors, the jury remains out on the CEO, who rebuffed the 70 billion pounds ($90 billion) offer made by Pfizer," said EdenTree Investment Management fund manager Ketan Patel. Analysts at Jefferies see a $20 billion opportunity for I-O drugs in first-line, non-small cell lung cancer, with sales split between I-O monotherapy (administering one such medicine on its own); I-O plus conventional chemotherapy; and combinations of two I-O drugs, as in AstraZeneca's approach. Outside cancer, AstraZeneca dropped development of an experimental respiratory treatment licensed from Synairgen , lopping 47 percent off the value of the small British biotech firm.

Summary The Global Therapeutic Vaccines Market is estimated at USD XX Million in 2016, and is poised to reach USD XX Million by 2021 with a CAGR of 33.6%. Currently, in pipeline several approaches are being developed in order to boost the immune response to various infectious and cancerous cells. The vaccine Market is different from any other product market. Compared to the pharmaceutical market it is relatively small, although growing at a fast rate. There are presently close to 120 new vaccines in the pipeline of various multinational companies across the globe set to hit the market in the next few years. The vaccine market is rather concentrated on both supply and demand sides. It is highly regulated and mostly dependent on public purchasers and donor policies. It has very distinct features which increase the complexity of assessing and understanding pricing and procurement in their context. Increase in funding’s from government for vaccine development, rise in investments by the major market players, rising prevalence of disease, technological advancements, initiatives by NGO’s are some of the factors that are propelling the market growth. However, massive capital expenditures and stringent regulatory policies, high cost associated with treatment are few factors inhibiting the growth of the market. The Global Therapeutic Vaccines Market is segmented by the type of disease into Autoimmune Disease Vaccines (Type I Diabetes), Cancer Vaccines (Multikine, PR1 Peptide Vaccine, TroVax, CYT004-MelQbG10 etc.), Neurological Disease Vaccines (ACC-001, CAD106, Parkinson’s Disease Vaccine, Alzheimer's Disease and Other Disease Vaccines), and Infectious Disease Vaccines (Hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS and Other Infectious Disease Vaccines). Furthermore, based on geography the global market is analyzed under various regions namely, North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle-East & Africa. North America accounts for the large portion of revenue in the therapeutic vaccine market. The growth of this market will be boosted owing to the presence of advanced and active R&D establishments in the region. Multinational vaccine companies historically have conducted much of the innovation, research, and development in the field of vaccine production. They have used significant revenues, global size, and deeper expertise to fund. Some of the key players influencing the global preventive vaccine market are Agenus, GlaxoSmithKline plc., Merck and Company, Bavarian Nordic, Novartis AG, Pfizer, Inc., CureVac, Dendreon, Affiris AG, Transgene S.A and Vaccinogen.

Denise Roland 15 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL GE to break ground May 8 on new Boston headquarters Tesla halting door-to-door sales for SolarCity amid slowdown © Scott Eisen/Bloomberg News Pfizer Inc. executives hope the late-stage clinical trials on its new sickle-cell-anemia treatment will show strong benefits for sufferers of the blood disease. But if they don’t, there will be a small silver lining: Pfizer didn’t pay for the trials. Quotes in the article Pfizer Inc PFE ▲ 33.92 +0.06 +0.18% Merck KGaA MKGAF ▲ 117.78 +0.68 +0.58% Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▲ 82.06 +0.73 +0.90% GlycoMimetics Inc GLYC ▼ 4.30 -0.21 -4.66% Last year, NovaQuest Capital Management LLC, a private-equity firm focused on life sciences, agreed to pay for Pfizer’s Phase 3 trial program for the drug, called Rivipansel. Phase 3 is typically the final and costliest trial period. NovaQuest is one of a bevy of investors dedicated to funding late-stage clinical trials. Such deals are becoming increasingly common as the pharmaceutical industry seeks to limit risk. The strategy takes a page from Hollywood, where big production companies have long sought to attract upfront investment—in exchange for a cut of box-office sales or royalties—as they gamble on the next blockbuster film. Large pharmaceutical companies, like big movie production houses, must contend with “most innovation occurring outside your walls, and your cost structure varying over time and project type,” said Richard Evans, an analyst at SSR LLC. NovaQuest is one of the more active trial backers, and over the years has counted Sanofi SA, Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co., Allergan PLC and Eli Lilly & Co. as its partners in cost-sharing ventures that have spanned drug launches as well as research. Rivipansel is an experimental drug Pfizer acquired from GlycoMimetics Inc. in 2011, while it was undergoing midstage trials, in a deal worth $340 million. For the final push, NovaQuest has agreed to pay up to $200 million, a sum Pfizer figures will cover the trial and all other development costs. If the drug is successful, NovaQuest could receive a series of payments totaling as much as $267 million, plus royalties on sales, for the next eight years. “People look at us as an alternative,” said NovaQuest founding partner William Robb. One of the main attractions of the strategy, he said, was that returns rely on the success of the drug program rather than market or deal-making sentiment. “Our investment structure and thesis provides something uncorrelated to the public markets,” he said. The structures of its deals vary, he said, and in most cases, NovaQuest pays for a proportion of a given clinical trial rather than shouldering the entire cost. A Pfizer spokeswoman said that while the company still self-funded most of its clinical trials, it was increasingly seeking to collaborate with external partners to “increase the potential of our innovation activities.” Drug makers, facing declining returns on their research dollars, are using various strategies to supplement their fixed annual research-and-development budgets. These include striking up collaborations with one another to pool the costs and rewards of drug programs they consider especially risky or expensive. They also trim their own research investment by selling the rights to promising pipeline drugs that fall outside of their own areas of interest. The drawback: sharing risk also involves sharing the rewards. Such collaborations involve the company in question agreeing to relinquish some of the drug’s profit to its partners. “We said, ‘Gosh, we can be an alternative to this, a capital provider for some of these drugs,’” said NovaQuest founding partner John Bradley, who as an employee at drug-industry outsourcer Quintiles came up with the idea with several co-workers in 2000. The group that became NovaQuest was housed under the umbrella of Quintiles, now Quintiles IMS Holdings Inc., until it was spun out in 2010. “R&D has periods of feast and famine,” said Luciano Rossetti, head of global research and development at Merck KGgA. The German company recently reached a deal with Avillion LLP, a London-based group set up in 2013 that finances and executes clinical trials for drugmakers. Under that deal, Avillion will bankroll and execute the Phase 2 and 3 development of an experimental psoriasis drug. Dr. Rossetti said the deal meant Merck wouldn’t have to abandon or delay the program at a time when other, late-stage research is “absorbing all internal [financial] resources and talent.” Merck and Avillion didn’t disclose the terms of the deal, but Dr. Rossetti said it involved Avillion taking on the development risk, mainly in return for royalties down the line. For now, just a handful of clinical trials are bankrolled by outside investors. But Mr. Evans believes drugmakers should open the majority of their trials up to external bidders. Such a move, he says, would mean that only the highest-quality projects received funding and that the level of research investment could vary substantially from year to year. Opening their entire pipelines to external scrutiny would mark a sharp departure from the industry’s usual secrecy, especially in the most competitive areas. But as companies accept the benefits of collaboration in areas where they may lack funding or research expertise, those attitudes are changing, Dr. Rossetti said. “Many companies are willing to take a little risk of sharing information in order to get the right approach to fully leveraging their pipelines,” he said.

The findings point to new strategies for increasing the supply of organs for the nation’s more than 97,000 patients who are awaiting kidney transplants – often for as many as five or more years. In 2016, Penn Medicine launched an innovative clinical trial to test the effect of transplanting kidneys from donors with HCV into patients currently on the kidney transplant waitlist who do not have the virus, and who opt in to receive these otherwise unused organs. Recipients were then treated with an antiviral therapy in an effort to cure the virus. Early data from the study were presented today by David S. Goldberg, MD, MSCE, an assistant professor of Medicine and Epidemiology in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, at the 2017 American Transplant Congress in Chicago, and were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.   “We started this trial in the hopes that, if successful, we could open up an entirely new pool of donor organs, and effectively transplant hundreds, if not thousands, more patients who are awaiting a lifesaving organ,” Goldberg said. “Historically, Hepatitis C-infected kidneys were often discarded, and were thought to be damaged or too ‘high-risk.’ Our pilot data demonstrate the ability to cure the contracted virus following transplantation in this patient population. If future studies are successful, this may be a viable option for patients who may otherwise never see a transplant.” Goldberg, who co-led the study with Peter Reese, MD, MSCE, an assistant professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at Penn and chair of the Ethics Committee for the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS), approached and enrolled participants who relied on dialysis treatments to stand in for their damaged kidneys. Participants were between 40 and 65 years of age and had been waiting for a transplant for at least a year and a half. A three-step process of education and consent was used during pre-enrollment to ensure patients, and their loved ones were provided with a comprehensive understanding of the risks. Once enrolled, and as organs became available, the team performed HCV donor genotyping during the allocation process, selecting only kidneys that were considered “high quality.” In the first phase of the study, to date, 10 patients have received transplants using the protocol. On average, patients received a transplant 58 days after enrolling in the trial—some in as quickly as 11 days, while others waited for over 100 days. At three days after surgery, patients were tested for HCV, and all 10 tested positive for the disease. Next, the participants were treated with the standard 12-week course of elbasvir/grazoprevir, commonly known as Zepatier, a recently-approved and highly effective oral medication prescribed to eradicate HCV. All 10 patients have been cured of their contracted HCV. “For so long, HCV was a virus with a very negative stigma associated with it, especially among physicians. So it was interesting to see that patients were quick to jump at the chance to get this transplant, despite the possibility that they could get Hepatitis C permanently,” Reese said. “Going into the study, we knew it was a possibility that some or all of the patients would contract HCV, and that they could have the disease for the rest of their lives if we were unsuccessful. But for these patients, getting off of dialysis and getting back to their normal lives was very much worth the risk.” Following the early positive results, the research team was granted an extension of their study, which will allow them to transplant and treat an additional 10 patients—20 patients in total. The research team is designing a new clinical trial that will study this same approach in patients who are heart transplant recipients, and in the future they hope to examine the efficacy of this approach in liver and lung transplants. Researchers note there is a need for longer and larger trials to continue evaluating the effectiveness of HCV-positive to HCV-negative transplantation followed by antiviral therapy in a broader population. Additional Penn Medicine experts involved in this study span disciplines including infectious diseases, transplantation surgery, gastroenterology, hepatology, and pathology and laboratory medicine, including Deirdre Sawinski, Roy Bloom, Raj Reddy, Emily Blumberg, Jennifer Trofe-Clark, Vivianna Van Deerlin, Midhat Farooqi, Peter Abt, Matthew Levine, Paige Porrett, Susanna Nazarian, Ali Naji, Maureen McCauley, and Anna Sicilia. The study is supported by a research grant from the Merck Investigator Initiated Studies Program, and Merck supplied the antiviral drugs used in the study. ### Penn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.
