The worldwide material supply and licensing agreement means Merck can immediately start marketing Nanoco’s cadmium-free quantum dots and to ultimately establish its own production facility to meet growing market demand. Merck will begin marketing Nanoco’s technology in the near term by selling cadmium-free quantum dots manufactured at Nanoco’s expanded production plant in Runcorn. A Nanoco spokesman said cadmium-free quantum dots enable the production of ultra-bright displays with a substantially extended colour range while reducing electricity consumption. He said that in conventional displays, the colours blue, green, and red are filtered out of the original white light of the LED light source. A great deal of light is lost in this process. Because a blue LED in combination with red and green quantum materials only generates the blue, green and red light that is perfectly transmitted through the filters, there is much less absorption. This increases the display’s brightness, reduces electricity consumption and leads to much purer and potentially stronger colors. The financial details of the agreement are not being disclosed, but Nanoco will receive a licence fee and royalties on Merck’s sales of the Nanoco cadmium-free quantum dots that Merck manufactures. Michael Edelman, Nanoco chief executive, said: “This agreement with Merck is another major endorsement of the world-class quality of our cadmium free quantum dot technology. “We are convinced that Merck can leverage its position in the display industry with these innovative materials.” Walter Galinat, member of the Merck executive board, said: “The agreement is in line with Merck’s strategy to sustainably secure its position as the global market and technology leader in display materials. “With cadmium-free quantum dots, a remarkable increase in the colour range and a significant reduction in power consumption can be achieved. “These cadmium-free quantum dots are eco-friendly and also complement our product portfolio for the display industry.” Nanoco chief executive Michael Edelman Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @LivEchonews Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Runcorn news all Most Read Most Recent NetherleyPensioner hit in drive-by shooting thought to be nan of notorious Kirk Bradley 73-year-old believed to be close relative of infamous gun and grenade gangster Liverpool NewsThree men who admitted drugs trafficking sentenced to 35 years in prison: recap Merseyside Police seized luxury cars, motorbikes, cocaine, cannabis, a stun gun, mobile phones and thousands of pounds in cash after raids PropertyWirral couple appear on Grand Designs - but neighbours 'hate' their house Neighbours told Kevin McCloud they hated the "garden shed" house CrimeDrug lord who gifted dirty cash to Everton churches boasted he was “swimming in gear” Michael Barlow’s gang trafficked millions of pounds worth of cocaine and heroin but were being secretly filmed by police Rebecca FergusonRebecca Ferguson reveals she was sexually abused in children's home The X Factor star broke down as she revealed her pain on Loose Women today PoliticsMersey politicians slam 'lacklustre' Autumn statement Chancellor criticised for continuing austerity measures PrescotMan, 30, dies after fire at Prescot flat Victim was being treated in hospital for severe burns St HelensMan still in police custody after suspected stolen car driven into St Helens lake 41-year-old from Formby was dragged from the Audi TT by police officers before it sank TVWife of soldier killed with one punch forgives the man who threw the blow in emotional TV scenes Channel 4 documentary looked at death of Wirral's David Ryding Liverpool CouncilAutumn Statement 2016 summary - who are the winners and losers?

Through the organisation’s ‘Merck More Than A Mother’ initiative which aims to define interventions to reduce the stigma and social suffering of infertile women, empower them and raise awareness about male infertility, the pharmaceutical company would support Jackline Mwende, the recent victim of infertility stigma, throughout the rest of her life. ‘Merck More Than A Mother’ initiative will provide Mwende with a monthly income of $250, then will establish a business for her in which she will be able to generate a sustainable monthly income of not less than $250. At the same time, Merck will provide her with prosthetic hands in addition to the needed physical and physiological rehabilitation to enable her to support herself and stand on her own two feet despite the challenge of her brutal disability that was caused by the stigma of infertility – even though her husband was the one who was found with the infertility problem. In a release to announce the support, Hon Joyce Lay, Member of Parliament and the Ambassador for ‘Merck More Than A Mother’ in Kenya, said, “It is so shocking that someone would go to such an extent to batter his own wife and leave her nearly dead. Infertility should never be a reason to separate, hurt or kill your partner. There are so many options out there available to manage infertility.” “Mwende didn’t deserve what she went through and especially that her husband is the one who was found with the infertility problem and not her. Society, government and all stakeholders need to continue to join hands with Merck in their campaign to encourage the acceptance people live with infertility because the stigma associated with infertility puts pressure on them to a point where they do crazy and criminal things. We need to know that it’s a shared responsibility, not just for the couple but for the society too,” Joyce Lay added. “No sane person should torture a woman for failing to produce children. Men should not think that their failure to be a biological father is due to women’s infertility. Why torture a fellow human being and inflict such permanent bodily harm for a fault that could be yours? No amount of justice in the courts of law will bring back Mwende’s arms. Justice will only prevail if Mwende’s case marks a turning point in society that appreciates one fact- “that women are women irrespective of their ability to bear children. They need to be respected,” Hon Sarah Opendi, Uganda Minister of State of Health and Uganda Ambassador of ‘Merck More Than A Mother’, emphasized.

The launch of several new lipid-targeting therapies, which offer clinical effectiveness for statin-intolerant patients and patients who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein C (LDL-C) in combination to statin therapy, will drive the ACS market, according to research and consulting firm GlobalData. The companys latest report states that this growth, which will occur across the seven major markets (7MM) of the USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and Japan, can be attributed to launches of the first proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9 inhibitors), Repatha (evolocumab) and Praluent (alirocumab) by 2016, the launch of ETC-1002 by 2021, and increases in the global prevalence of ACS. Michela J. McMullan, GlobalDatas analyst covering cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, explains: 'At present, a large proportion of patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease cannot reach guideline recommended levels of LDL-C with the standard of care therapies, which leads to recurrent ACS events.' 'However, the revolutionary PCSK9 inhibitors Repatha and Praluent have both truly demonstrated their efficacy in lowering LDL-C in their pivotal Phase III trials, as 57% and 58% reductions in LDL-C from baseline compared to placebo were observed for evolocumab and alirocumab, respectively,' she added. Esperions ETC-1002, a novel lipid-lowering drug, is another therapy set to drive the ACS market. It has shown impressive efficacy in its Phase IIb study and is initiating a sweep of Phase III trials in 2016. As the drug is an oral, once-daily treatment, GlobalData believes that Esperion may be a viable competitor in the latter half of the forecast period by capturing the majority of patient share from the statin-intolerant patient population. McMullan continues: 'Generally speaking, the ACS market is a highly lucrative area for pharmaceutical companies to invest in drug development. Historically, Merck & Co. was the leading innovator in this space, boasting a multitude of therapies to combat atherosclerosis, such as the first-in-class statin Mevacor (lovastatin), as well as Zocor (simvastatin) and the cholesterol absorption inhibitor Zetia (ezetimibe). 'However, all of these drugs will lose patent exclusivity within the first half of the forecast period, so it is unlikely that Merck will maintain a competitive position during the forecast period. Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron, developers of the newly launched PCSK9 inhibitors Repatha (evolocumab) and Praluent (alirocumab), respectively, are now seen as the leading innovators in the lipidlowering arena,' McMullan concluded.

Meet the Contributors → Heron Gains FDA Support For Nausea Drug After A Year Under Review David Holley August 10th, 2016 @xconholley @xconomy Like Us Xconomy San Francisco —  The decision that Heron Therapeutics has been waiting on for almost a year is finally in: The FDA has approved the Redwood City, CA-based company’s drug for nausea and vomiting associated with certain chemotherapy regimens. Heron (NASDAQ: HRTX) first submitted a new drug application for the treatment, granisetron (Sustol), to the FDA in September 2015. The regulatory agency extended its expected decision date three times, most recently in April. Now, with the approval in hand, Heron says it hopes to begin selling the drug in the fourth quarter of this year. Granisetron is an extended-release, injectable drug that aims to help cancer patients—particularly those with breast cancer—deal with both immediate and delayed nausea and vomiting resulting from chemotherapy, for up to five days. The drug works to counter the side effects of a couple of the most commonly prescribed types of chemotherapy, such as anthracycline and cyclophosphamide combinations, Heron says. The company’s stock rose about 9.8 percent from yesterday’s closing price, to $21.80, as of 9:57 a.m. in New York. Waltham, MA-based Tesaro won approval in September 2015 for another anti-nausea drug being sold as rolapitant (Varubi), which ran into trouble after it missed clinical goals in the first two of its three late-stage trials. The company’s third attempt at a Phase 3 trial hit all of its primary and secondary goals, as Xconomy previously reported. There are a number of other drugs that aim to aid patients with chemo-induced nausea, including Merck’s aprepitant (Emend) and palonosetron (Aloxi), which is marketed and distributed by Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai. In its news release, Heron says it aims to make granisetron stand out by noting its ability to potentially protect patients for up to five days. In particular, Heron says that other drugs, “including palonosetron, are generally effective for 48 hours or less.” On the palonosetron website, the drug is touted as being used to treat nausea on the day of chemo, as well as up to five days following chemotherapy. Heron didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on pricing of the newly approved drug. David Holley is Xconomy's national correspondent based in Austin, TX.

The Brexit referendum first buoyed the stock as the pound slumped ahead of the U.K.’s likely departure from the European Union, reducing research and manufacturing costs for local companies like AstraZeneca, whose largest market is the U.S. The next month, Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot kindled takeover speculation when he touted the company’s prolific product pipeline -- offerings that were highlighted again last week when rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. reported a research setback. “Astra is showing a bit of leg this year because of pipeline missteps by others,’’ said Daniel Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital LLP, who owns Astra stock. “It wouldn’t surprise me if the shares move up more from here. The pipeline is coming into view.’’ Also to Astra’s benefit, having the best data or being the first to sell a new treatment aren’t the only ways to win market share in the U.S. anymore, Mahony said. With pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts and CVS increasingly having a say in which drugs patients get access to, the ability to offer the best prices to payers, especially for costly combination products, could also determine success. Opdivo Failure Astra shares rose to a record last week, while Bristol-Myers plunged the most in 14 years after the U.S. company announced that its immune oncology drug Opdivo had failed in a lung cancer trial that would have been the basis for widely expanding use of the treatment. The U.K. drugmaker’s stock slumped 0.3 percent to 5,146 pence as of 9:28 a.m. local time on Friday. With Bristol-Myers’s stumble, Astra got a leg up in the immune oncology race, where it has long been a laggard. Competitors Bristol-Myers, Merck & Co. and Roche Holding AG are already on the market with their checkpoint inhibitors, and Merck KGaA could file for approval of its drug this year, putting Astra in fifth place.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter Astra is betting on its combination of immune oncology agents to give it an edge over competitors that have to work with other drugmakers to create combination treatments. It’s conducting a late-stage trial, called the Mystic study, of its immune oncology drug durvalumab, which is used in combination and also alone as a first-line treatment for patients with lung cancer. Securing an approval for such use would give the drugs a much wider potential market than Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo, which isn’t currently approved as a first-line therapy. Mystic Trial Data As fund managers position their portfolios for the coming year, Astra’s Mystic data, set to be announced in the first half of next year, could make its shares a compelling buy. Meanwhile, analysts at Citigroup Inc. published a note on July 27 calling Astra the “most attractive” acquisition target for Novartis AG to pursue, from among a field including Bristol-Myers and Incyte Corp. “There’s a huge amount of potential pipeline value riding on the outcome of that clinical trial,” said Dani Saurymper, manager of the AXA Framlington Health Funds in London, who oversees $875 million in healthcare stocks. “Novartis would be taking on significant risk if they were to pursue an acquisition of AstraZeneca prior to the announcement of those clinical trial results.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

World GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT WATCH Op-Ed Can river blindness enter the elite club of eradicated diseases? Impact of River Blindness in Burkina Faso.

(World Health Organization African Region) Dr. Matshidiso Moeti It has been 44 years since a World Bank president traveled to drought-stricken Upper Volta in West Africa — today called Burkina Faso — and encountered a startling and disturbing scene. Blind people were everywhere, with children often leading adults around. The cause of their blindness was a tiny worm, called a “filarial nematode,” transmitted by bites from black flies that swarmed the rivers and streams of Burkina Faso. Strangely, the worms do their damage by dying, which generates toxins that can create lesions on the skin and on the cornea of the eyes. Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa. World Health Organization Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa. Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa. (World Health Organization) The buildup of cornea lesions from several years of exposure to the disease causes permanent blindness. That’s why, though technically known as onchocerciasis, it’s more commonly called river blindness. In the wake of that impressionable 1972 visit, the world mobilized to tackle the problem on a large scale. Fast-forward to the present, and river blindness is once again bringing disease experts back to Burkina Faso. But they are coming to mark a milestone in the global onchocerciasis control effort. Disease control has been so successful in Burkina Faso and other affected countries that we’re ready to move beyond merely containing the disease. Elimination of river blindness is the new goal — both from its key strongholds in Africa, where 99% of the disease occurs, and from smaller pockets of infection in Latin America and Yemen. Completely eliminating onchocerciasis from all areas where it is known to exist would take the world to an extremely rare place: disease eradication. Disease experts don’t use the term eradication lightly. The club of the eradicated human disease is supremely elite. It has only one member, smallpox. There are other candidates. Polio is perhaps closest to gaining entry into this club. But disease experts and policymakers are now considering how 40 years of work combating onchocerciasis in Africa has made eradication a plausible scenario.

Now in at least 10 West African countries, it is no longer considered a public health threat. Other areas are not far behind. An analysis published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases of Poverty found that in one large swath of disease hot spots outside West Africa, infections have plummeted to at or near zero. The battle against river blindness has been waged with two key weapons. Insect control is one factor, but the most decisive intervention involves treating entire communities repeatedly with the anti-parasite medication ivermectin. Merck, the drug’s key manufacturer, has been donating the medication to the World Health Organization, allowing it to be deployed forcefully against river blindness in mass treatment campaigns in which everyone in an area at risk is treated regardless of symptoms. Repeating mass treatment over several years can eventually eliminate the disease from an endemic region. It does this by breaking the cycle of infection, the passage of onchocerciasis larvae from flies to humans and from humans back to flies. Mass treatment campaigns have reached well over 100 million people. Several weeks ago, in Ouagadougou, Burkino Faso’s capital, I witnessed the administration of the 1-billionth tablet of ivermectin in the fight against river blindness.  A nurse in Kouadioa-Allaikro, Ivory Coast, gives medicine against onchocerciasis, commonly called river blindness, in 2008.

(Issouf Sanogo / AFP/Getty Images) The success against onchocerciasis is having a profound influence on the broader effort to fight other “neglected tropical diseases.” It has prompted WHO to launch the new Expanded Special Project for Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases. This initiative will continue the fight against river blindness while targeting several other diseases for elimination, including lymphatic filariasis (also known as elephantiasis) and debilitating helminth infections, which are transmitted through soil carried by parasitic worms. Also, these campaigns involve a significant effort to mobilize resources that empower local communities to strengthen their primary healthcare capabilities. The focus on developing integrated health programs at the local level is precisely one of the approaches that is needed as countries strive to attain universal health coverage. But fighting infectious diseases is like riding a bicycle. To move forward, you have to keep pedaling. It is extremely important that we keep pedaling against river blindness, all the more vigorously because we are entering what may be the crucial last mile that leads to eradication. By maintaining support for the battle against river blindness, we will continue to blaze a trail toward elimination for other neglected diseases to follow — to a point in the not too distant future when the club of the eradicated disease may have several new members.

The cost estimate for drug launches are often overestimated, a study from the Partnership for Health Analytics Research found. The study looked at predictions for 14 drugs launched since 2012 and found that on average cost predictions were 11 times higher than the actual sales generated by the drugs after they hit the market. (Drug Store News) 2. An investigation by The New York Times into the death of an Abbott sales representative in India alleges that the company pushed reps to create “health camps” that would offer free screening tests and were used as a way to drum up business for the physician and Abbott. (NYT) 3. A viewpoint in JAMA Oncology criticized Bristol-Myers Squibb's direct-to-consumer ad for its immuno-oncology drug Opdivo, adding to the backlash the ad has already received. “It is difficult to conceive that a medical oncologist would fail to discuss the potential use of nivolumab or another immunomodulatory agent for second-line therapy of squamous non-small cell lung cancer,” wrote Dr. Lowell Schnipper, who argued that the ad does not encourage a productive conversation between physicians and patients. (JAMA) 4. Critics have called Merck's advertisements promoting awareness of the human papillomavirus “manipulative,” saying that the ads are trying to guilt trip parents. Some doctors, however, are saying that parents should feel uncomfortable given the low levels of vaccinations. (WaPo) 5. The U.S Preventive Services Task Force said there is insufficient evidence to give all children blood tests to check for high levels of lipids — an indicator of dyslipidemia or other lipid disorders such as familial hypercholesterolemia. The task force came to the same conclusion in 2007. Lipid disorders are tied to heart disease in adults.
