Cancer treatments are poised to become the biggest earner in the pharmaceutical industry 06 January 2017 - 16:27 PM Agency Staff Picture: THINKSTOCK Berlin — Years before becoming a top cancer specialist, Eric Winer used to save money on his own medical care by talking US pharmacists into giving him expired treatments free of charge. Winer, who has a bleeding disorder known as haemophilia, knew the drugs would still work for a brief time after the official use-by date. The young physician was trying to stay within his insurer’s spending limit and avoid having to pay out of pocket one day. Decades later, he recollects that anxious time as he tries to make sense of the soaring prices of drugs for his own cancer patients. "Cancer is just viewed differently in our society," said Winer, 60, who is chief strategy officer and director of the Breast Oncology Centre at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. "It evokes more fear. And somehow, I think the manufacturers of these drugs are able to take advantage of that in terms of the prices they set." WHO says more Africans are at risk of chronic illness That cancer angst, combined with prices that have surpassed $200,000 a year for revolutionary new treatments, is poised to give oncology medicines the biggest share of the $519bn global pharmaceuticals market this year, eclipsing drugs for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases for the first time. And while drug makers claim the revenue will propel innovation, the costs are stoking patients’ distress and creating a rift between manufacturers, health authorities and payers in many markets. Take the new lung-cancer drugs from Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche, for instance. They are part of a new class of treatments known as immune therapies, which harness the body’s own cells to fight tumours and tantalise doctors with the possibility of defeating one of the most common causes of death in the developed world. The drugs are a game-changer for some patients, helping them live more than twice as long. They are also expensive: from $12,500 to $13,100 per month of therapy. And now they are being combined with other medicines. Bristol-Myers estimates a cocktail of its Opdivo drug with another immune product Yervoy, for melanoma patients, costs between $145,000 and $256,000 a year. It has received "very little push-back on the pricing," says chief commercial officer Murdo Gordon, because patients are living long enough to come back for annual checkups for the first time. "What about the people who can’t get coverage?" Winer asked in December. "Nobody can afford this." The prices also mean doctors must wrestle with how much benefit is worth the cost, even as they try to focus on which treatment is best for individual patients, he said. No death sentence Merck’s Keytruda, which harnesses the immune system and can help patients with a form of skin cancer that was once a death sentence, costs about $12,900 per month. Merck is studying biomarkers in the body to target the patients who will benefit most from the drug, and believes its value is being reflected appropriately, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Global revenue from branded oncology treatments may rise 12% to surpass $100bn this year, according to a Bloomberg Industries survey of analysts’ estimates, before climbing to about $150bn by 2020. Costly new medicines should not take all of the blame, because at least two other factors are at play. Drug makers are taking advantage of the rising tide to lift prices on older treatments as well, and cancer patients live longer, meaning they are left paying for drugs for a longer time. "That’s a mixed blessing," said Steven Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts Holding, one of the biggest managers of prescription-drug benefits in the US, the world’s largest market for pharmaceuticals. "We’re going to be able to help people who previously weren’t able to be helped, and so we’re very excited about that. On the other hand, it’s going to beg the question: Are we going to be able to afford it?" Deaths caused by lung and cervical cancers jump in SA Pricing principles Last year just two drugs, Celgene’s Revlimid and Novartis’s Gleevec, accounted for more than one-fifth of oncology spending through Express Scripts, one of the key intermediaries that negotiate with drug makers for rebates on the list prices on behalf of their customers. Novartis raised the price of Gleevec 19% in 2015, before it faced generic competition last February, according to Express Scripts. Neither drug is brand-new: Gleevec was first approved in 2003 and Revlimid in 2005. Celgene said it has "pricing principles" designed to keep developing cutting-edge medicines, but account for varying levels of affluence in countries around the world. Novartis points out that Gleevec’s US price has not budged since 2015 and drug makers need to recoup their research investment and fund further innovation. Express Scripts and its rivals have started pushing back. CVS Health in August said it will no longer cover some treatments for cancer in 2017, including Novartis’s leukaemia treatment Tasigna, and Medivation’s prostate cancer drug Xtandi. This is the first time brand-name oncology drugs have been taken off its standard formulary list. Express Scripts, which handles price negotiations on behalf of clients for pills and drugs that patients inject themselves, expects the cancer-drug spending it oversees to spike about 20% annually for the next three years. Pay for results? In response, the benefits manager says it is expanding a programme that allows for different prices depending on how effective drugs are, and grants refunds when treatment ends early. Express Scripts will not disclose details of the drugs involved, but the goal is to cover nearly one-quarter of the oncology pharmacy spending that it will oversee this year, up from 5% in 2016. Government authorities are taking note — and pushing back as well in some cases. US president-elect Donald Trump has declared himself an opponent of high drug prices, and said he would favour allowing the import of treatments from abroad. In Germany and the UK, the health systems rely on expert panels to assess whether new medicines help patients more than old ones, and pricing power follows. Unhealthy South Africans the lure for multinational drugs companies The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has turned down funding for a handful of new cancer medicines lately, saying their benefits do not justify their cost. It is currently debating a new Roche treatment for breast tumours called Kadcyla. Pay-for-performance would in theory be a way to maintain prices for cancer medicines that work and winnow out those that do not. But such a system is hard to introduce in the US, the world’s biggest pharmaceuticals market, where federal and private insurers are often on different reimbursement structures, said Nicolas Dunant, a spokesman for Roche. The company has been in talks with 20 European countries since 2012 on outcomes-based pricing and has already introduced package prices for some cancers in Italy and Switzerland. "We would welcome a system where we could price a medicine based on how it performs," Dunant said. "In order to pursue such an approach, we need data." In the meantime, patients — and especially those with inadequate insurance — are the ones left juggling financial worries alongside medical ones. Bloomberg Please login or register to comment.

The country introduced discussion of infectious diseases to the G8 Summit’s agenda in Okinawa in 2000, a move that paved the way for the establishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global Fund) two years later. Today, Japan is the fifth-largest contributor. Infectious diseases, particularly those termed the Big Three — HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis — have been an international priority since the establishment of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals in 2000. Many healthcare-oriented nonprofits, such as the Global Fund, aim to eliminate these threats that are so prevalent in the developing world. One such organization, the Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund, has adopted a novel approach to fighting disease. Launched in Japan just three-and-a-half years ago, GHIT was founded on the principle of open innovation — also referred to as product development partnership. This approach to research and development (R&D) facilitates tie-ups between Japanese and international entities from the public, private, and civil/nonprofit sectors to streamline drug development. ORIGINS The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is among the nine founding partners of GHIT. Hannah Kettler, senior program officer, Life Science Partnerships at the foundation, commented: “The Global Health Innovative Technology Fund is a unique partnership model that brings together the government of Japan and private funds, and leverages Japan’s industry and academic expertise to fight infectious diseases in developing countries. Public–private partnerships like this are essential to developing new global health tools, and we are thrilled to support the important work of the fund.” The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is also a founding partner. Dr Mandeep Dhaliwal, director of the HIV, Health and Development Group, said: “It remains important that governments scale up their investments in promoting innovation in new medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics — as well as the building of resilient and sustainable health systems in low- and middle-income countries—so that universal health coverage and good health and well-being can be attained for all. UNDP salutes the vision and leadership of the government of Japan in supporting both innovation and access to health technologies.” GHIT’s founders also include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and five Japanese pharmaceutical firms: Astellas Pharma Inc; Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd; Eisai Co Ltd; Shionogi & Co Ltd; and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd. The fund was conceived in a conversation between GHIT CEO Dr BT Slingsby and Dr Tachi Yamada, a US physician who envisioned “Japan’s first truly international nonprofit.” At the time of founding, Slingsby — who was involved with the project from day one — worked for Eisai, where he developed new business models for R&D and oversaw market access in the developing world. He possesses both a strong business background — having aided numerous start-ups in Japan and the United States — as well as medical expertise, with a Medical Doctorate from George Washington University. Slingsby described the origins of the fund, which are rooted in business practices, namely leveraging the principles of product development used in the private sector for public purposes. “Our internal management practices reflect those of the private sector, affecting how we define strategy, structure the organization, etc; this is one of the reasons we have grown so quickly,” he said. By September 2013, GHIT’s first year of operation, the fund had logged $8.8 million in investment into novel R&D using Japanese innovation. By March 2016, the figure had risen to $96 million. Affiliate Partner GlaxoSmithKline K.K. (GSK) took part in the GHIT Fund as one of the first global pharmaceutical companies to contribute to Japanese research and development to fight neglected diseases around the world. “GSK is a science-led global healthcare company and has three world-leading businesses that research, develop, and manufacture innovative pharmaceutical, vaccine, and consumer healthcare products,” Communications Division Head Yukimi Ito told The Journal. “We wish to contribute to innovations originating from Japan as the company is committed to widening access to drugs, so that more people can benefit, no matter where they live in the world or what they can afford to pay.” Merck, the world’s oldest pharmaceutical and chemical company, said that there are two important relationships with GHIT — one as a leader of a consortium developing a new pediatric formulation of praziquantel, a drug used to treat parasitic worm infections, and more recently, its role as an affiliate partner. As this collaboration will expand investment into research and development for neglected diseases worldwide, it perfectly aligns with Merck’s contributions to improving the health of underserved populations. “As a partner of GHIT, we are part of a network of global and Japanese partners with proven excellence in global health,” Head of Corporate Communication Japan Ritsuko Shibagaki told The Journal. “This represents an important aspect for our current and future programs on infectious diseases, considering that our operating model is based on partnerships and collaborations with leading global health institutions and organizations. By joining forces with GHIT, our overall ability to provide the most vulnerable populations with suitable health solutions should increase.” 50-PLUS PROJECTS Investments managed by GHIT are stringently selected and monitored to ensure that product development milestones are met and donor dollars are not wasted. All 50-plus projects currently in its portfolio include drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics for malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases such as Chagas. According to UN figures, three in seven people worldwide are at risk of developing infectious diseases; one in seven are already infected. Multiple investments involve partners from the United States. Currently, one of GHIT’s top-funded projects to fight malaria brings together the expertise of Eisai, St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., and Swiss nonprofit Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). The product under development is a single, multi-component drug that would cure an affected patient after just one exposure to malaria, and provide substantial post-treatment protection from reinfection. Each partner has a well-defined role: Eisai will handle manufacturing of the pharmaceutical ingredients; St. Jude’s will manage the project and carry out initial studies at its facility; MMV will oversee the next phase of studies and define the drug protocol. Discussing the product development partnership model of R&D, Slingsby explains: “Products to treat infectious diseases are not naturally generated by the market. That is why we exist. A lack of profit [for pharmaceutical companies] necessitates a public–private model to propel R&D in this space. “The science is also very difficult. Maybe a company has the technology to develop an effective malaria treatment, but has no skilled scientists in that field; thus, we facilitate international partnerships. Or perhaps a research institute needs funding for a promising venture; we can provide that. These links define the virtual health/open innovation approach.” Shigetaka Komori, chairman and CEO of Fujifilm Corporation—a GHIT partner—applauds the open innovation approach. “The Ebola crisis reinforced for us both the urgent need for global health innovation as well as how effectively industry and the global health community can mobilize together to create and deliver new solutions. Partnering with the GHIT Fund helps us engage even more meaningfully in global health over the long term, enabling us to leverage our history of innovation,” he said. GSK’s Ito said, “Our commitment to open innovation, widening access, and transparency is aligned with the vision of the GHIT Fund and we believe this partnership will certainly add value to the research and development initiatives from Japan.” A pillar of GHIT’s mission is providing products that are “accessible and affordable to the poorest of the poor.” Founders believe that improved access to healthcare in the world’s poverty-stricken nations will have a direct impact on the economic potential of such countries. Healthy citizens are better prepared to innovate and work; thus, health makes wealth. Ko-Yung Tung, senior counsellor at Morrison Foerster LLP, serves on the Board of Directors at GHIT. As previous general counsel of the World Bank, Tung oversaw the establishment of the Global Fund. He notes how GHIT is particularly valuable in its provision of grants to R&D projects addressing neglected tropical diseases, which are not pursued by commercial pharma companies. Morrison Foerster is a sponsor of the fund, providing legal services and advice in accordance with its pro bono mission to help those who are marginalized. “GHIT is a unique public–private partnership that is vigorously supported by the Japanese government as part of the third arrow of Abenomics. Though it’s been in existence for only three years, GHIT has already shown impressive results,” Tung told The Journal. “From 1995 to 2004, a total of 1,556 new drugs were approved in the US. Only 1.3 percent of these new treatments were developed to fight infectious diseases in developing nations,” explained Miyoko Tanaka, director of communication and public affairs, Medical Company, Johnson & Johnson K.K. “We envision a world where everyone has the means to be healthy and can thrive. We are committed to using our capabilities, expertise, resources, and partnerships to fulfill our role in making the world a better, healthier place for generations to come.” Tanaka added: “We hope that our partnership with the fund enables the organization to continue investing in new, innovative technology for neglected diseases, as well as promising candidates that have recently entered clinical trials, or will eventually enter late-stage trials.” None of the fund’s managed products have hit the market yet, but several are in later stages of development such as clinical trials. Within the next few years, Slingsby said, we should see the launch of some exciting new technologies. In the private pharmaceutical sector, vaccines and treatments can take a decade or more to go to market. GHIT strives to get its products into the hands of people who need them most within five to 10 years. SCIENCE POWERHOUSE Apart from its open innovation approach, GHIT is distinct in its close collaboration with the Japanese government. In addition, each investment (grant) application must include at least one Japanese and one international partner. Projects may include as few as two or as many as six partners. Because it is a matching fund, every dollar committed by the government is matched by donors, be they private-sector companies or civil foundations. Tung highlights how, at the 2015 G7 Ise-Shima Summit, the Japanese government specifically named GHIT as an important initiative in a joint declaration on global health. It also doubled its funding commitment to projects fighting disease in the developing world. “The Japanese government has always been very committed to global health and international cooperation, seeking to approach problems through innovation. Innovation comes from science, and Japan is a science powerhouse. The potential for innovation is enormous here, but it’s questionable how much that has been realized in healthcare products; that is our role at GHIT. The government’s decision to invest in R&D specific to global health is rather novel, yet has become a prominent pillar of current government policy,” Slingsby adds. The Japanese government’s investment in the GHIT Fund is a direct realization of the country’s 2013 Strategy on Global Health Diplomacy, which is closely linked to the Healthcare and Medical Strategy, launched the same year. Kumi Sato, president and CEO of COSMO PR and American Chamber of Commerce in Japan Chairman Emeritus, serves as an advisor to the fund. Her company, which focuses on the healthcare field, supports nonprofits such as GHIT with similar missions. “Global health is a concept that was, until recently, relatively unknown or misunderstood. Given the importance of the topic, we wanted to be part of efforts to build the awareness needed for GHIT’s success. This is one of the reasons why I am personally excited to be involved with this organization,” Sato told The Journal. “As one of the first funds of its type in the country, GHIT demonstrates that the government recognizes the importance of this kind of new collaborative model, and gives Japan the ability to deploy investment into the field. In fulfilling a purpose previously unmet here — a public–private partnership designed to tackle the most complex challenges of global health — GHIT serves as a catalyst for substantive change, and the results of that change will speak for themselves.” Custom Media publishes The Journal for the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan.

Slideshow A place where many roads (and a few rails) lead Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon What road should you take to get to Upper Gwynedd? Unlike many locations in the region, this Montgomery County township gives you a choice, which makes a visit there all the more interesting. A favorite route is Sumneytown Pike, which will take you through North Wales. Or there are Route 202 and Welsh Road, both of which take you through Lansdale. Upper Gwynedd provides a fabulous interactive map at app.skyline.carrigangeo.com/view/3GYXHA8ua5D - not so much to help you find Smile Lane, but to give you a better feel for the township's real estate. (For those rail-riders among you, SEPTA's Doylestown Line trains stop at Pennbrook station in Upper Gwynedd and North Wales.) It's very clear that Upper Gwynedd is interested in managing the growth that can often overwhelm towns in areas that are targeted by both residential and commercial developers. That's why it supports the 240-acre Gwynedd Wildlife Preserve, which, in turn, supports a diverse variety of habitats, including ponds and wetlands, open meadows, wildflower meadows, hedgerows, deciduous forests, and conifer plantations. Upper Gwynedd is also the home of Merck & Co., the pharmaceuticals giant and one of the area's major employers, with facilities in the West Point section and elsewhere in the 8.1-square-mile township. According to Diane Williams, an agent with Weichert Realtors in Blue Bell who sells in the township, Upper Gwynedd has 35 active listings, ranging from a condo flat going for $109,900 to a 4.5-acre estate priced at $1,390,000. "Property sales are averaging 17 a month, meaning that the price absorption rate is two months," Williams says. In the last year, 225 properties sold here, with an average price of $315,397, she says; sale prices ranged from $93,000 to $660,000. Average time on market for a property is 53 days, she notes. Nineteen sales are pending, ranging in price from $115,000 to $525,000, Williams says. In the last three months, 54 homes sold in Upper Gwynedd, compared with 74 in the same three months of 2015, according to Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Fox & Roach Realtors HomExpert Market Report. The median sale price was $283,450 (half the homes sold for more, half for less). That was up 3.3 percent from $274,325 in the same three-month period of 2015, according to HomExpert. Williams says there is one new-construction project in Upper Gwynedd, called the Preserve at Gwynedd. Featured at the Preserve, built by Better Living Homes, are 19 townhouses and four single-family detached homes. The townhouses sell for $329,000 to $404,900, while the singles are going for $499,990. Bob Acuff, of Re/Max Services in Blue Bell, is the listing agent for the Preserve at Gwynedd. Upper Gwynedd is in the 12,719-student North Penn School District, which has three middle schools and 13 elementary schools. Its high school ranks 46th in Pennsylvania, and 1,526th nationally. The district plays an oversized role in the real estate of Upper Gwynedd and the other municipalities that comprise it: the Boroughs of North Wales, Lansdale and Hatfield and Towamencin, Montgomery and Hatfield Townships. "Montgomery Township has a higher average resale price, at $340,000," Williams says, but Upper Gwynedd has a higher average resale price than Hatfield Township or Towamencin Township." There are three over-55 communities in Upper Gwynedd, Williams says. Two offer homes priced from $195,000 into the $200,000s: Gwynedd Commons and Gwynedd Woods. The Reserve at Gwynedd is higher-end, Williams says, and includes several high-rise buildings with "attractive flats, twins, carriage houses, and singles." The flats range from the mid-$200,000s to mid- $300,000s. The twins, carriage houses, and singles range from the high $400,000s to $558,000. aheavens@phillynews.com 215-854-2472 @alheavens Real Estate Tools Looking for a new home?

By Robert Weisman Globe Staff  January 07, 2017 The new boss at Biogen Inc. speaks six languages, worked for drug makers in half a dozen countries, and ran marathons on three continents. But the peripatetic Michel Vounatsos — a 55-year-old French national of Greek extraction who was born and raised in Morocco — had never been a chief executive before Friday, when he assumed the top job at the Cambridge-based company. Advertisement In the coming months, Vounatsos is expected to lay out a path forward for Biogen as investors look for Massachusetts’ largest biotech to make a major move. He plans to bring a more global perspective to a company that’s now focused primarily on North America and Europe. Those are the key markets for its trio of industry-leading — and highly lucrative — multiple sclerosis drugs. And he’s also gearing up for a challenge that will be watched the world over: producing a breakthrough treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. One key goal is expanding the company’s geographic footprint, especially in Asia. Biogen doesn’t have business operations in China, South Korea, and Taiwan, three of the largest markets.

Sign up for more newsletters here “I’m a global leader who has been exposed to operating in different parts of the world and being educated on different cultures and societies,” Vounatsos said during an interview at Biogen’s headquarters. Speaking in heavily accented English, he cited his past roles leading biopharma divisions in farflung locales — from Poland to Saudi Arabia to China — for drug giants Merck & Co. and Novartis predecessor Ciba-Geigy AG. “We want to continue on the Biogen tradition of innovating, but also explore opportunities always in the US — it is the No. 1 market — but also beyond the US,” he said. “If you think about putting patients first, how can one ignore the most populous market?” Vounatsos’s wife, Martine, is a doctor, and two of their three children studied at universities in Boston. The family traveled the world together for 25 years as Vounatsos logged the many miles of his career path. The experiences along the way have made him especially flexible and strategic as an executive, said Peter Kellogg, chief financial officer of Celgene Corp. Kellogg worked with Vounatsos at Merck and sometimes plays tennis with him. Advertisement “He understands how markets are evolving and where opportunities are,” Kellogg said. “For someone to run businesses in Poland and France and then go to China, he’s obviously very adaptable.” Jonathan Wiggs/Globe staff/File 2015 Biogen is gearing up for a challenge that will be watched the world over: producing a breakthrough treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. Just after Biogen announced his appointment last month, Vounatsos, who only joined the company eight months ago as chief commercial officer, got an early Christmas present when the Food and Drug Administration approved Biogen’s Spinraza as the first treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, the leading genetic cause of death for infants. “We can bring hope to the infants and the toddlers” with the muscle-wasting disease, he said, calling it a “big responsibility.” It’s also a big money-making opportunity — Biogen priced Spinraza at $125,000 per dose. That amounts to between $625,000 and $750,000 in the first year of use, and about $375,000 annually in subsequent years. Most of the huge costs are expected to be covered by insurance for the thousands of spinal muscular atrophy patients. While acknowledging pricing is a sensitive issue — President-elect Donald Trump, like many other politicians, has said he wants to “bring down drug prices” — Vounatsos makes no apology for charging so much for a medicine that helps patients with no other options. He said Biogen executives consulted with dozens of health insurers as part of a “thorough” pricing analysis. “We want to be responsible; we want to be good citizens and price at the right level of value,” he said. “The unmet medical need here is significant. It’s a disastrous disease in terms of mortality and disability, and the value the drug brings is tremendous. We need to think about the return for shareholders, and we need to think also about how we fund other projects.” Unlike its top-selling MS medicines Avonex, Tysabri, and Tecfidera, which bring in billions of dollars annually and ring up 60 percent of their sales in the US market, Biogen expects to eventually generate about 60 percent of its revenue from Spinraza outside the United States. Vounatsos considers that a model for the company as it moves to expand its drug portfolio beyond multiple sclerosis. Spinraza’s launch this winter “will be a very good way to prepare the organization to be ready for Alzheimer’s,” he said, referring to the company’s quest to win approval of the first medicine for the neurodegenerative disease that afflicts about 47 million people worldwide. “Alzheimer’s is certainly the next huge opportunity that we have,” Vounatsos said. “This is the No. 1 epidemiology priority everywhere. The company that succeeds in this space will succeed big-time in terms of public health impact but also for the company.” Biogen’s experimental Alzheimer’s drug, called aducanumab, targets the buildup of plaque in the brain. It got a boost last month when Biogen released encouraging findings from an early-stage study not long after the clinical-trial failure of a rival Alzheimer’s drug from Eli Lilly & Co. Some analysts say Biogen is now in the best position to crack the Alzheimer’s puzzle, though it still needs to conduct years of testing before accumulating enough data for regulatory approval. In themeantime, after Spinraza starts shipping, the likelihood of Biogen bringing other new drugs to market anytime soonlooks slim — unless it takes a shortcut and buys a smaller biotech that’s got a medicine nearing the approval stage. Failing that, as Biogen faces slower growth from its MS drugs, some Wall Street analysts have suggested that it could be a takeover target itself. The board’s decision to tap Vounatsos — already on the inside and with more of a commercial background than a scientific one — could be a signal that it might be interested in selling the company if an attractive offer is made, biotech analyst Eric Schmidt at Cowen & Co. wrote in a recent note to investors. “Cynics would argue that Mr. Vounatsos is very closely aligned with the board, and that his appointment as CEO indicates the board wishes to retain very tight control over the key managerial decisions at Biogen,” Schmidt wrote. “For some, this might be viewed as a positive, as there has been speculation that some board members might wish to sell the company.” If he’s supposed to be readying Biogen for a sale, Vounatsos said, it’s news to him. “The board did not share that with me,” he said. He joined the company last year because of its scientific strength, he said, and he relishes the chance to help make it a pioneer in treating Alzheimer’s. When the previous chief executive, George Scangos, said he was stepping down, Vounatsos said, “I stood up” to seek the job. “With my 25 years of experience,” he said, “I believe I am ready.” He said he won’t be distracted by speculation about a takeover bid. “Biogen has 40 years of history, and I came for the next 40 years,” he said. Biogen is “smaller, a bit more agile, a bit more flexible, and it can be a bit more speedy” than Big Pharma companies, he said. And he views his new hometown much the same way: “We see the youth; we see the dynamism. It’s a privilege living here.” Robert Weisman can be reached at robert.weisman@globe.com.

Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jan 8, 2017 at 7:21AM Most investors' idea of impressive earnings growth is, say, 20% or more per year. So what does that say about companies that grow their earnings by more than 100% in a year? That's what Wall Street expects three biotechs to achieve over the next year. Here's how Corcept Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CORT), Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY), and Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) just might double their earnings in 2017. Image source: Getty Images Corcept: A low starting point helps Wall Street analysts expect Corcept Therapeutics to grow earnings by a whopping 500% in 2017. That would be a tremendous feat, but there's one minor detail to note: Corcept's earnings for last year will probably only be around $5 million, making 2016 the company's first profitable year ever. A low starting point helps make growth look a lot better on paper. Nonetheless, there's no doubt that Corcept is on a roll. The biotech has one product on the market, Korlym. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Korlym in 2012 for treating Cushing's syndrome, a condition caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol. There are around 20,000 patients in the U.S. with Cushing's syndrome. Korlym will continue to be Corcept's primary growth-driver for a while. Corcept recently announced positive results from a phase 1/2 study of the drug in combination with Halaven in treating triple-negative breast cancer. The company also has one other clinical candidate in its pipeline: CORT125134. Enrollment is under way for a phase 2 study evaluating the selective cortisol modulator in treating Cushing's syndrome and another phase 1/2 study of the drug in treating solid tumors.  Incyte: All "JAKked" up Incyte has a couple of things in common with Corcept. The biotech was unprofitable until recently, and it makes most of its money from one drug, JAK inhibitor Jakafi. Analysts project that Jakafi will power earnings growth of 129% this year. Jakafi generated revenue of more than $675 million in 2015, including royalties received from sales outside of the U.S. by the biotech's partner Novartis. In just the first three quarters of 2016, revenue for the drug topped $709 million. Peak annual sales for Jakafi are expected to reach around $1.5 billion. Incyte has more than just Jakafi going for it, though. The biotech has another product on the market in Europe, cancer drug Iclusig, which Incyte licensed from Ariad Pharmaceuticals. Incyte also licensed JAK inhibitor baracitinib to Lilly in 2009. Lilly expects an approval decision by the FDA this month for baracitinib in treating rheumatoid arthritis. The company's pipeline includes several other experimental cancer drugs. Epacadostat is furthest along in development. The selective inhibitor of the enzyme IDO1 is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials, including a pivotal late-stage study in combination with Merck's Keytruda in treating melanoma.  Exelixis: Soaring even higher Thanks to kinase inhibitor cabozantinib, Exelixis ranked as one of the best biotech stocks of 2016. Exelixis markets the drug under two brand names, Cometriq and Cabometyx. Wall Street expects the biotech's earnings to increase over 110% during the next year, primarily on the growth prospects from Cabometyx. Cometriq hit the market first, winning regulatory approval in late 2012 to treat medullary thyroid cancer. Exelixis really hit its stride, though, with the launch of Cabometyx this year as a treatment for kidney cancer. In a short time, Cabometyx has gained around 20% market share as a second-line treatment for kidney cancer and 35% as a third-line treatment. The biggest opportunity for Cabometyx still awaits. A late-stage study found that the drug outperformed the current leader, Sutent, as a first-line treatment of kidney cancer. Exelixis is moving forward with the regulatory approval process for the additional indication. There's also the potential for Cabometyx to be used in combination with other drugs.  Double in price? With expectations for doubling earnings in the coming year, are all three of these stocks on their way to doubling also? Probably not. The market is always looking ahead. Significant earnings growth is already baked into the price of all three stocks. However, I think each of these biotech stocks should still perform well in 2017. My view is that Exelixis, in particular, still has room to move higher. I also think the company could become an acquisition target down the road. So could Corcept and Incyte, for that matter. Impressive earnings growth tends to attract a lot of attention. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Exelixis.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) are compounds which interfere with this function of histone deacetylase. HDIs display promising potential in oncology for applications such as diagnosis, cancer detection and prognosis. HDIs are emerging class of oncology therapeutics for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. Based on the classes, histone deacetylase are classified into class 1, class 2 and class 3 HDAC. HDAC inhibitors leads to accumulation of acetylated nuclear histones in both tumor and normal tissues, providing an alternate marker for the biological activity of HDAC inhibitors. Inhibition of HDAC also results in acetylation transcription factors such as GATA-1, p53 and estrogen receptor-alpha. HDIs are potent anti-proliferative agents with moderately little effect on normal tissues. Get Sample Research Report: http://bit.ly/2ijrcHQ Based on applications, histone deacetylase inhibitors are categorized into oncology, neurology and others diseases. Presently there are four approved HDI products in the market namely Vorinostat (Zolinza), Romidepsin (Istodax), Vidaza and Dacogen. Consequently, global biopharmaceutical companies are conducting research for its application in different indications. North America leads the histone deacetylase inhibitors market with rapid acceptance of these products in this region.
