Both products help to improve key steps of assisted reproductive treatment (ART) - an area where laboratory technologies play a vital role for treatment success. The launches represent the seventh and eighth product launch in 18 months for the Fertility Technologies unit at Merck, demonstrating the company's healthcare strategy to deliver innovation through best-in class assets. Gavi' enables clinics to preserve human egg cells, also called oocytes, and embryos at the main stages of ART, while Geri' medium supports undisturbed cultivation of embryos. "Undergoing fertility treatment means looking at a lot of individual variables to ensure that everything is done for a successful outcome. During this process, couples want to be assured that their healthcare providers have the right tools at hand to assess those variables and help them make their dream of having a baby become a reality," said Rehan Verjee, Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer at Merck's biopharma business. "With our two new products, we provide laboratories with important instruments that support fertility treatment tailored to the clinic and to the individual needs of patients." Preserving oocytes or embryos for future in vitro fertilization and embryo transfers by cooling them to deep sub-zero degrees is a key step in the laboratory. Gavi' is the world's first automated instrument for this preservation technique, also called vitrification. With its latest product innovation, Gavi' provides clinicians with added flexibility when taking important treatment decisions with and for their patients. Geri' medium was developed to help improve another critical factor for successful treatment, embryo cultivation. After fertilization, the embryo needs to grow and develop before it is transferred into a woman's womb. With the single-step culture medium, Merck now provides a way to support undisturbed incubation and optimal embryo development. Both products, developed and manufactured by Australian fertility technologies company, Genea Biomedx, will be available in Europe, with Gavi' also launching in Canada and additional regions to follow soon. They are commercialized as part of the partnership between Merck and Genea Biomedx that started in 2015. About Gavi', Geri' and Gems' Gavi' is the world's first automated vitrification instrument, developed with the aim to achieve a consistent and standardized vitrification process. Geri' is a benchtop incubator with individually controlled incubation chambers per patient to minimize disruptive events to the early-stage embryo. It also incorporates a time-lapse camera to capture images of embryos as they develop. Gems' is the latest generation of Genea Biomedx's culture media suite for high-quality embryo cultivation. Gavi', Geri' and Gems' received the CE mark clearance in Europe, and also the consumables for Gavi' and Geri' are certified. The three devices are not yet cleared for use in the USA. GaviTM, GeriTM and GemsTM are created by Genea Biomedx. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

All photos are courtesy of Merck.  When one discusses the creative giants of medical advertising's past half century, talk usually turns to artists enshrined in the Medical Advertising Hall of Fame — Ernie Smith and his iconic depiction of the “Benadryl fathead,” say, or Sal deRouin and his canny use of construction hard hats to connote product attributes (the safety of heart drug Cardizem). Such discussions might also reference any number of marketing agencies, both living entities and shops subsumed into a larger organization via merger or acquisition, and the path they paved by pushing reluctant pharma companies to broaden their aesthetic horizons. One of the names less likely to pop up in such conversations is Merck. Granted, few pharma giants have established themselves as Rx Club mainstays, or even endeavored to do so. But there has always been a sense that, more than its peers, Merck had less interest in artistic exploration than it did in meat-and-potatoes message conveyance. Which, obviously, is fine — marketing effectiveness has never hinged on artistic virtuosity. Nobody's demanding that an ad for Zontivity must deliver a master class in sketchwork with compressed charcoal. See also: Creative partners should push pharma clients to tell better stories The problem is that this perception of Merck's creative bona fides is, well, wrong. The unveiling of hundreds of images created at the company's request by artists like Norman Rockwell, Dr. Paul Peck, and Joel Nakamura suggests that Merck might have been among the pharma world's most progressive-minded organizations, at least when it comes to cultivating ­museum- grade artwork. Taken collectively, the freshly rediscovered images — thousands of them — serve as a history of the industry's artistic evolution writ small. In the late 1990s, artist Joel Nakamura suggested alleviating the effects of migraine through Maxalt (rizatriptan). INDUSTRY SUPPORT DECLINES Peter Plante, creative director of Merck Creative Studios and lead of Merck Archival Services, does not seek credit for this. “If you paint me as an ‘industry legend,' I'm going to get laughed out of this building,” he says. “I'm just a guy who's had some unique experiences in his career.” At the same time, Plante's off-the-clock efforts served to liberate the Merck artwork from back-office obscurity. “I curated a lot of it at my house on Friday nights because I needed room to sort it,” he says. “I just couldn't bear the thought of all this beautiful, important work being thrown out or left in some room collecting dust.” Plante was assisted on his quest by two other Merck execs who share his interest in preserving a neglected part of its historical record. “We call ourselves the Monument Men of Merck, even though it's me and two women,” he deadpans. Their expeditions paid off in the form of finds like an original Rockwell. “Nobody even knew it was on the wall,” he says. See also: Pharma's complexity calls for a closer look at creativity Indeed, it's quite a stash. Nearly 73,000 creative assets have been digitized. It took eight tractor trailers to transport the 4,100 linear feet of physical assets to Merck's formal archive, now located in what a rep describes as a “disaster-prepared, geo-secure warehouse that exceeds national archival standards.” The decision to relocate the artwork to a fortified facility may or may not have been prompted by a fire that claimed much of the artwork Merck inherited on acquiring Schering-Plough, in 2009. Only those works with titles commencing with the letters A through C (hello, Claritin) survived. To browse the Merck archives is to be reawakened to a part of the industry's creative past that informs its present. The works date to the 1930s and '40s, when Merck formally established an in-house creative group. In the 1960s, the group was expanded to include a fuller complement of on-site art directors. This decision explains why Merck was able to devote considerable resources to medical illustration and other fine artistry (it had people on hand who made such projects a top priority). It also might explain why Merck's creative reputation failed to keep pace with the caliber of the work it produced: Many top agencies, Plante believes, declined to work with Merck, knowing that its in-house artists and art directors would have final say on all things creative. Once America's favorite realist painter and illustrator, Norman Rockwell showed what an interrupted family sports outing — halted owing to a mumps outbreak — might look like.  MUSEUM-GRADE ARTWORK If this proved a handicap in any way, it's hard to tell from the artwork itself. Merck's artistic glory era began in 1959, when it entered into an exclusive agreement with esteemed medical illustrator Peck. The relationship ultimately produced more than 500 pieces. Similarly fruitful was the collaboration with Nakamura, whose creations on tin fueled the drugmaker's global Maxalt campaign for more than a decade. “When you show somebody the work, [the reaction is], ‘Oh, wow!' It's awe,” Plante says. “The vasculature within the hearts, the nerves pulsing through arms and hands — who'd have thought colons could be beautiful? But they are.” See also: Ogilvy's Michael Johnston on Using the Familiar in Diabetes Ads Plante believes the elaborate nature of much of the work in the Merck archives presaged the current digital era, ­especially in animated and 3-D renderings of products, processes, and procedures. As for what people will take away from the revelation of the art and advertising cache, Plante hopes it will motivate them to extend that legacy into the future. His one worry? That rights-related issues could delay sharing the artwork. “I ask around — ‘Oh, somebody at that one boutique agency in Philadelphia can get you permission.' But all those agencies got blown up or merged or whatever. I wouldn't even begin to know where to look for the contracts,” Plante laments. At the same time, he remains thrilled — as both artist and marketing professional — that Merck saw the value in saving and securing the work for posterity. “[The artwork] brought prestige to the company and helped cement relationships with customers. It brought value,” Plante says. “It tells us so much about where we've been and where we may be going.” Dr. Peck's 1960s heart rendering was intended to capture doctors' attention.  From the October 2016 Issue of MMM » Share this content: facebook twitter linkedin google Comments Print Similar Articles Merck's ePromotion tops with primary care docs FDA rejects Merck's Mevacor OTC bid PhRMA chief Tauzin urges industry to better tell its story DDR on DTC: Merck's Gardasil NEJM revamps website, adds complete archive Related Topics Advertising Creative Pharma Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Katherine Mangu-Ward from the November 2016 issue - view article in the Digital Edition EMAIL SHARE Facebook Twitter Tumblr StumbleUpon Digg Delicious Reddit Google Linkedin Kindle PRINT At the end of August, the U.S. Department of Agriculture bought 11 million pounds of cheese—that's a cheese cube for every man, woman, and child in America—in order to bail out the nation's feckless cheesemongers.

(Most of the federal government's new stockpile will go to food banks.) This bailout of Big Cheese came on top of an $11.2 million infusion earlier in the month to dairy farmers enrolled in a 2014 federal financial aid scheme. The deal comes after months of lobbying by the National Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau, and the National Milk Producers Federation, who were too antsy to wait for their next big cash cow to come ambling in with the farm bill. The same week, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R–Iowa) wrote a letter to the pharmaceutical company Mylan, demanding an explanation for why EpiPens, the epinephrine auto-injectors that severely allergic people carry in case of an emergency, have quadrupled in price since 2007. Grassley cited constituents paying $500 to fill their prescriptions. Hillary Clinton issued a statement about the price increases as well: "Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens." Donald Trump used the occasion to score points, tweeting out a story about hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to the Clinton Foundation from the disgraced company. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D–Minn.) echoed Clinton's sentiment in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission: Lamenting that "antitrust laws do not prohibit price gouging," she asked the regulatory body to look into whether Mylan has used "unreasonable restraints of trade" to keep prices high. The summer's cheese bailout and EpiPen price scandal are ideological Rorschach blots.Where one observer sees only the evils of the profit motive, another looks at the same fact pattern and sees the perils of an overweening regulatory state. Vox sided solidly with the profit shamers, declaring: "We are the only developed nation that lets drugmakers set their own prices, maximizing profits the same way sellers of chairs, mugs, shoes, or any other manufactured goods would." But pseudonymous blogger Scott Alexander of Slate Star Codex responded with a tidy reverse Voxsplanation: The cronyist Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other government forces have squelched nearly every effort to compete with Mylan's EpiPens, distorting the market beyond recognition via a process he chronicles in painful detail. Mylan acquired the EpiPen from Merck in 2007, by which time the product was already 25 years old, which means the question of paying back research costs was moot. In 2009, Teva Pharmaceuticals tried to enter the market—and Mylan sued. Teva managed to get its product to the FDA anyway, only to be told that it had "certain major deficiencies," unspecified. In 2010, Sandoz Inc. tried its luck and got bogged down in the courts, where the case still dwells. In 2011, the French drug company Sanofi made a bid to gain approval for a generic, which was delayed for years because the FDA didn't like the proposed brand name. Which brings us to this year, when Adamis decided to sell plain old pre-filled epinephrine syringes directly to patients without the fancy injector. Cue an FDA recall, on the rather vague basis that insufficient study had been done on standard administration of a drug whose medical properties have been known since the turn of the last century. And sometimes the tangled, dysfunctional relationship between big business and big government gets even more personal. The CEO of Mylan, Heather Bresch, is the daughter of U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin (D–W. Va.), which probably makes things awkward in the Senate cafeteria. But Manchin has joined his colleagues in saying that he is "concerned about the high prices of prescription drugs," which probably makes things awkward at Thanksgiving. Then again, Mylan spends over a million dollars a year lobbying, which likely goes a long way toward smoothing things over. In 2014 Congress passed the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act, which Grassley mentions in his letter. The law, he writes, "provides an incentive to states to boost the stockpile of epinephrine at schools." It was co-sponsored by Klobuchar, the same senator who now wants to sic the antitrust dogs on Mylan. That law was a top lobbying priority for Mylan that year, along with new rules that reduced competition for generics. Grassley also notes that the taxpayers are picking up the tab for kids who are getting EpiPens while on Medicaid or the state-level Children's Health Insurance Program, and he adds that some 47 states require or encourage schools and other public institutions to stock EpiPens. In other words, Congress created a huge new class of price-insensitive EpiPen customers and now wonders why the price has gone up. Meanwhile, the prescription laws still require you to get a special piece of paper from a doctor every single time you want to buy an EpiPen. If the doctor writes a brand name on that paper, it's illegal for the pharmacist to give you a cheaper generic. The story of the government cheese is just as convoluted. It's easy to be lulled by Vilsack's sell: Helping farmers and the hungry? Sounds great! But you know what else helps move a glut of cheese off the shelves and into the hands of poor people, without requiring taxpayer dollars? Lowering the price. That's something the industry isn't willing to do, and—given all the pricing rules and production quotas that have been distorting dairy markets since the 1930s—mostly can't do. With Americans eating a record 34 pounds of cheese a year, the problem isn't an unexpected drop in demand.The problem is a failure to allow the laws of supply and demand to function at all. Eleven million pounds of cheese may seem like small potatoes (to mix culinary metaphors), and it is in the larger scheme of federal spending and meddling. What's another $20 million when the debt is already $20 trillion, after all? But our typically cheerful acceptance of central control of compressed curds and injectable epinephrine shows how widespread and insidious such conditions are in our lives. What would real free market reforms look like, and how would they come about? In this issue, you'll read what Libertarian Party nominees Gary Johnson and Bill Weld would do in the (very unlikely) event that they won the presidency and vice presidency (page 30). Reason TV's Jim Epstein reports on the millennial libertarian activists in Brazil who brought down a corrupt populist president (page 50). And in Detroit, an American city where public services are essentially nonexistent, we detail how residents are building DIY alternatives (page 65). In the meantime, there is no reason to think either the tale of the EpiPens or the saga of the cheese would play out any differently under President Trump or President Clinton. Taxpayer-funded sops to farmers are as bipartisan as it gets, and there is precisely zero chance that a president from either major party would discontinue the practice. Likewise, the iron grip of the FDA on the drug approval process—and the opportunities to purchase influence in that powerful bureaucracy—will not diminish one iota, regardless of which major-party candidate becomes America's Big Cheese in January.

What about the other pharmaceutical corporations tried to enter the market and got shut down by the bribed and subsidised FDA? Sure, those corporations have a profit motive. Why else did their investors invest but to see a return? Corporations are also the investors/shareholders who FUND them. Epipens used to cost well under fifty bux till the present corporation wrangled not only control but a government enforced monopoly. Today, as the article said, they cost above $500 So WHO is after the profit here? FDA who collect HUGE sums of money and have inside connexions to SOME drug companies, that's who. On what substantive basis do FDA keep other players out of that market? I'll lay high stakes at very long odds that, given approval to two or three of these other "players" to bring competing products to market, within a few months Epipens will again cost well under fifty bux. What it will take is to remove GOVERNMENT protection of the present fiefdom now granted by FDA to the ONE provider of this product. The problem wiht gummint control is that THEY decide which products succeed and at what price. You might recall an instance in our earlier history where a government supported and enforced monopoly on stale tea whose price was augmented by a tax imposed by the government/owner of that tea, led to a principled uprising of the population forced to endure such corruption. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply Tionico|10.4.16 @ 6:20PM|# Could it happen again?

Who are we inviting to be the guest speaker at the club luncheon? Where will we build the new school? You're better off having one single decision rather than having mom cook 4 different meals, booking 3 different parks, paying for 6 hours worth of speakers, building more schools than you can afford. But central planning is only more efficient and better when having more options leads to worse outcomes for everybody. If mom's cooking spaghetti and I decide to walk up the street to McDonald's, if I ditch the company picnic to go bowling, if I read a book rather than listen to the speaker, if I home-school my kids, how is that hurting anybody else?

So ultimately, yeah, this company has been insulated by Congress from any competition whatsoever and now we're told that it's the evil's of the free market that caused this problem? Color me shocked that a government enforced monopoly is ultimately behind all of this. Obviously the company is at fault for rent seeking in the first place, but the vast majority of consumers will receive a massive price reduction through their insurance (while everyone is mandated to have insurance, which makes me question who's paying out of pocket since clearly they need to be audited by the IRS). If this company hadn't sought to suppress competition through the Federal government, perhaps they wouldn't be under investigation but for me the takeaway lesson is the FedGov shouldn't be picking winners and losers in the first place.

News Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in NewLink awarded $25 million contract for Ebola Zaire vaccine Tuesday Oct 4, 2016 at 2:35 PM Oct 4, 2016 at 4:47 PM By Grayson Schmidt, Staff Writer (gschmidt@amestrib.com) After successful initial trials, Ames-based NewLink Genetics will continue development on the Ebola Zaire vaccine (designated V920), thanks to a $25 million contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. According to a release issued by NewLink, BARDA has previously awarded $76.8 million in contracts for development of the vaccine, and the new award includes an additional $51 million of contract options. The release also said that the new funding will go towards “manufacturing facility readiness, manufacturing process qualification activities, and additional clinical trials to support regulatory approval of the V920 vaccine.” In July 2016, the NewLink and Merck and Co. reported on two key regulatory milestones for the vaccine, as the U.S Food and Drug Administration granted the V920 vaccine, “Breakthrough Therapy Designation,” and the European Medicines Agency, PRIME status, according to the release. NewLink Infectious Disease Division Chief Scientific Officer and Chief Operating Officer Thomas P. Monath, MD, said in the release, that this new contract will help accelerate production of the vaccine. “This new contract issued by BARDA will enable accelerated full-scale production of V920, once it is approved, and is a critical step in helping to make this vaccine available to the health care community as they work to control epidemics and protect medical workers and others at high risk,” Monath said. The release also said that the Ebola Zaire vaccine candidate was originally engineered by scientists at the Public Health Agency of Canada and was subsequently licensed to NewLink Genetics. Then in late 2014, Merck licensed the vaccine from NewLink Genetics to apply Merck’s vaccine expertise to help accelerate the development of this vaccine candidate. Clinical studies of the vaccine candidate are ongoing.

Merck Launches Two Innovative Technologies to Support Couples on Their Fertility Treatment Journey Merck Launches Two Innovative Technologies to Support Couples on Their Fertility Treatment Journey CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 04/10/2016 10:16 DARMSTADT, Germany, October 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Not intended for U.S. based media  Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced the launch of two innovative fertility technologies, Gavi™ oocyte protocol and Geri™ medium. Both products help to improve key steps of assisted reproductive treatment (ART) - an area where laboratory technologies play a vital role for treatment success. The launches represent the seventh and eighth product launch in 18 months for the Fertility Technologies unit at Merck, demonstrating the company's healthcare strategy to deliver innovation through best-in class assets. Gavi™ enables clinics to preserve human egg cells, also called oocytes, and embryos at the main stages of ART, while Geri™ medium supports undisturbed cultivation of embryos. "Undergoing fertility treatment means looking at a lot of individual variables to ensure that everything is done for a successful outcome. During this process, couples want to be assured that their healthcare providers have the right tools at hand to assess those variables and help them make their dream of having a baby become a reality," said Rehan Verjee, Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer at Merck's biopharma business. "With our two new products, we provide laboratories with important instruments that support fertility treatment tailored to the clinic and to the individual needs of patients." Preserving oocytes or embryos for future in vitro fertilization and embryo transfers by cooling them to deep sub-zero degrees is a key step in the laboratory. Gavi™ is the world's first automated instrument for this preservation technique, also called vitrification. With its latest product innovation, Gavi™ provides clinicians with added flexibility when taking important treatment decisions with and for their patients. Geri™ medium was developed to help improve another critical factor for successful treatment, embryo cultivation. After fertilization, the embryo needs to grow and develop before it is transferred into a woman's womb. With the single-step culture medium, Merck now provides a way to support undisturbed incubation and optimal embryo development. Both products, developed and manufactured by Australian fertility technologies company, Genea Biomedx, will be available in Europe, with Gavi™ also launching in Canada and additional regions to follow soon. They are commercialized as part of the partnership between Merck and Genea Biomedx that started in 2015. About Gavi™,Geri™ and Gems™   Gavi™ is the world's first automated vitrification instrument, developed with the aim to achieve a consistent and standardized vitrification process. Geri™ is a benchtop incubator with individually controlled incubation chambers per patient to minimize disruptive events to the early-stage embryo. It also incorporates a time-lapse camera to capture images of embryos as they develop. Gems™ is the latest generation of Genea Biomedx's culture media suite for high-quality embryo cultivation. Gavi™, Geri™ and Gems™ received the CE mark clearance in Europe, and also the consumables for Gavi™ and Geri™ are certified. The three devices are not yet cleared for use in the USA. GaviTM, GeriTM and GemsTM are created by Genea Biomedx. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

Business Biotech Celgene to develop Abide's neuro drug Alan Ezekowitz, president and CEO of Abide Therapeutics Abide Therapeutics Alan Ezekowitz, president and CEO of Abide Therapeutics. Alan Ezekowitz, president and CEO of Abide Therapeutics. (Abide Therapeutics) Bradley J. FikesContact Reporter Drug giant Celgene has exercised an option to commercialize a neurological drug from San Diego-based Abide Therapeutics for sale outside of the United States. Adibe, a privately held biomedical startup, said it will receive a $20 million payment from Celgene. Abide will retain U.S. rights to its medication, which may help manage symptoms of multiple sclerosis and work with drugs that treat the autoimmune disease’s underlying cause, said Alan Ezekowitz, the company’s president and CEO.  The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, where the technology behind Abide originated, also stands to profit if the drug or others from Abide reach the market. Abide and Celgene signed their drug development agreement in March 2014, with Abide receiving a $50 million payment upfront. In May 2014, Abide and pharma giant Merck signed a separate drug development deal worth up to $430 million. The medication that generated the latest deal between Adibe and Celgene is called ABX-1431, and it targets the endocannabinoid system. It has successfully completed a placebo-controlled Phase 1a (early stage) study for safety. More information on clinical trials for this drug can be found at j.mp/abx-1431. Three must-see headlines <h1>Hundreds block downtown streets to protest Trump victory</h1> <h1>California remains a national force in life sciences</h1> <h1>Graduation day for Pendleton Marine's inmate-trained service dog</h1> Hundreds block downtown streets to protest Trump victory California remains a national force in life sciences Graduation day for Pendleton Marine's inmate-trained service dog See more videos The study also demonstrated that the drug can be given orally once a day and bind to the target in a highly selective way, Ezekowitz said. While the endocannabinoid system is best known for the psychoactive effects it produces from smoking or ingesting cannabis, it also acts to suppress the immune system and modifies aberrant neurotransmission, he said. The drug targets the receptor CB2, which controls immune suppression. Another receptor, CB1, controls the psychoactive component. THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, targets both receptors. Multiple sclerosis is caused by an overactive immune system that removes myelin, a protective fatty sheath that insulates nerves. Symptoms include weakness, muscle spasms, tingling, blurred vision, along with cognitive and urinary problems. These symptoms usually appear in episodes with months or years of intervening relief. Technological roots Existing treatments that treat the underlying disease process may stop the disease from getting worse, but don’t treat symptoms, Ezekowitz said. But ABX-1431 holds the potential for both alleviating symptoms and working with other drugs that treat the underlying disease process. “This would be a very important breakthrough for patients,” he said. Abide is considering extending testing of ABX-1431 for other diseases, including neuromyelitis optica and movement disorders. Medical marijuana helps with pain, muscle spasms, insomnia, lack of appetite and nausea. Abide says ABX-1431 may be able to provide similar benefits. A study on the effects of ABX-1431 on the brain’s neural activity using fMRI is scheduled to start early in the fourth quarter of this year. Abide’s underlying technology identifies potential small molecule drugs that target a large and important class of enzymes called serine hydrolases. The technology, called activity-based protein profiling, was developed by TSRI professors Ben Cravatt and Dale Boger. “It’s a chemical method that allows you to label all the enzymes in that family directly, in a tissue or a cell, and that allows you to read out their interactions with inhibitors,” Cravatt said. Abide puts this platform to use to identify promising drugs, of which ABX-1431 is one. This search for a better method of finding drugs is a specialty of Cravatt’s. He led a study published in June that identified a new method of identifying small molecules that attach to proteins. It’s an advance in a field called fragment-based ligand discovery. Using these discoveries to find and develop drugs, as Abide is doing, requires a good partnership with a larger drug company, Cravatt said. And the partnership with Celgene is an example of how that’s done, he said. Partnership benefits “It’s a really good example of how early-stage partnerships between a larger, established big biotech company and a smaller company like Abide can allow the smaller company to focus on the best science they can do,” Cravatt said. “They can be focused on doing the best science they can do without having to raise money every year or two through more conventional routes. “The benefit for Celgene is they get products in areas that maybe they wouldn’t have been developing,” Cravatt said. “It can take Celgene in new directions.” And The Scripps Research Institute, where the technology originated, can expect to benefit financially from any successful Abide drug, Cravatt said — money which can ensure a stable environment for TSRI’s scientists. Ezekowitz, the Abide CEO, said the company was built with the idea of fostering innovation, which is most easily done in a small company. “We have taken ABX-1431 from first chemistry to first-in-human in three years,” Ezekowitz said. bradley.fikes@sduniontribune.com (619) 293-1020 Twitter: @sandiegoscience Facebook: facebook.com/UTBiotech Copyright © 2016, The San Diego Union-Tribune Drug Research Drugs and Medicines Pharmaceutical Industry Medical Research US Politics Latest Most Popular Jobs Homes Cars Customer Help Today's Paper 54°

Lezlie Sterling The Sacramento Bee i By Taryn Luna tluna@sacbee.com With bill signings out of the way, it’s full steam ahead until Nov. 8. Drug-makers and tobacco companies are leading special interest spending on ballot measure campaigns. Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Pfizer, Amgen, Sanofi-Aventis and more than two dozen other companies have collectively given $86.6 million to fight a measure that would cap prices by prohibiting state agencies from paying more for prescription medication than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which pays among the lowest prices for drugs. The “No on 56” campaign, largely funded by Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, has amassed $56.2 million to fight a $2 tobacco tax increase. The companies have spent more than $26 million to bombard the airwaves with ads starring a teacher and a backyard gardener referring to the measure as a “special interest tax grab.” A new ad from the health groups supporting the measure fires back, saying big tobacco preys on children and the true reason the industry opposes the measure is because it will reduce smoking. Meanwhile in the U.S. Senate race, a contentious battle between frontrunner Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez will come to a head Wednesday as the two Democrats square off in their first and only debate of the general election. MUST-READ: Following arrests, Sheriff Scott Jones has revoked dozens of the 8,000 concealed carry permits he’s issued to Sacramento County residents since he took office in 2011. BY THE NUMBERS: The California Charter Schools Association, Ed Voice and the California Teachers Association are ramping up their outside spending efforts in legislative districts around the state. Heading into this past weekend, the three groups collectively reported spending $1.4 million during the previous week, more than one-half of the total spending during that time by more than 30 independent expenditure committees. The charter school-funded Parent Teacher Alliance and Ed Voice have spent the most of any outside group, a status they also held leading up to the June 7 primary. The latest reports mark a post-primary spending jump for the CTA, which frequently clashes with charter school interests and Ed Voice in the Capitol. The CTA and Ed Voice are on opposite sides of the Democrat-vs.-Democrat race in the East Bay's 14th Assembly District, while charter schools are spending heavily in San Jose's 27th Assembly District, the Salinas-centered 30th Assembly District, and Glendale-based 43rd Assembly District.

This glamorous event was hosted by renowned British television comedian and playwright Meera Syal, with Paralympics presenter and wheelchair basketball player Ade Adepitan giving the keynote speech. This was attended by top pharmaceutical organisations GlaxoSmithKline, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Sharp Dohme and other diverse organisations, including IBM and Coca-Cola. The Scale-Up Business of the Year award, sponsored by Ernst and Young, recognises ClinTec's dynamic and entrepreneurial emergence on to the global stage as a Clinical Research Organisation (CRO) and Functional Service Provider (FSP). Earlier at the MSDUK annual conference, Dr Buttar took part in a panel discussion, sponsored by Coca-Cola, on how to Scale-Up a business. A multi-award winning and woman-majority owned full-service CRO which embraces diversity, ClinTec was formed nearly 20 years ago by its CEO and Chairman, Dr Rabinder Buttar. With capabilities in over 80 countries, ClinTec delivers innovative, customised clinical research solutions and talented functional services to the clinical development sector in a fast, flexible and focused way. ClinTec provides services to seven of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies, leading mid-market biopharmaceutical organisations, as well as small and medium-sized biotechnology companies. ClinTec's entrepreneurial solutions stem from the organisation's focus on delivering not only what the customers require now, but what they will require to meet industry challenges in the future. MSDUK, which is celebrating its own 10 year anniversary, seeks to recognise purchasing organisations and the hugely talented and entrepreneurial ethnic minority businesses in the UK for their collaborative efforts to make supply chains both inclusive and competitive. MSDUK was founded by businessman Mayank Shah, CEO, in 2006 as a vehicle to assist the very entrepreneurial ethnic minority business community to realise their ambitions. During his keynote speech Ade Adepitan shared the inspiring experience of his dreams finally coming true following his attendance at the Paralympics in Rio. He congratulated everyone at the event and MSDUK for the difference they are making in our society and encouraged all in his assertion that 'One day people will respect us'. Dr Buttar said, "I am thrilled to accept this prestigious award on behalf of ClinTec International in recognition of our ongoing expansion both in service lines and in geographical reach. As founder of the organisation, I have always believed that further success comes from the early recognition not only of what our clients want today, but also will want in the future, and then having the courage to build my company along those lines with the support of my team. Embracing diversity has always been a core pillar of ClinTec in building and developing a global team of experts in clinical research. This award endorses that approach and also recognises the major contributions made by ClinTec's management team and staff in building for our future success. This endorsement puts our achievements on the map and enhances our reputation with current and future clients." Under Dr Buttar's visionary leadership, ClinTec has organically evolved into a renowned global player within the clinical research outsourcing arena and is the most geographically diverse mid-market CRO in the world, with an operating platform on a par with its multi-billion dollar competitors. ClinTec's success lies in a twofold approach, providing flexible, bespoke solutions which meet its client's needs, whilst at the same time creating an excellent working environment that supports and nurtures its staff. In addition to driving business growth, Dr Buttar has established the Academy of Clinical Research Excellence and unique graduate programmes across multiple regions to provide continuous development opportunities for staff and attracting new talent into the clinical research sector. In 2015 Dr Buttar was admitted into Strathclyde University's Academy of Distinguished Entrepreneurs for her work in establishing and developing ClinTec and was previously named a top 10 practising entrepreneurial scientist in Britain by the British Science Council. This new award highlights ClinTec's successful year after being named Best Mid-Sized Pharmaceutical CRO in the UK by Global Health and Pharma (GHP) Magazine's International Life Science Awards in June 2016 and as a finalist in the International Business and Export category at the Scottish Life Science awards in February 2016. In addition, the awards continue to demonstrate ClinTec's strong performance in the entrepreneurial ethnic minority business arena having previously won Supplier of the Year at the MSDUK awards in 2014. Other winners on the night were: Balfour Beatty Inclusive Procurement Award; Cummins Inc -Corporation of the Year; Bri-Tek Technologies Innovation Award and Mr Shahid Sheikh of Clifton Packaging as Entrepreneur of the Year.

Eisai Enrols Patients in Global Phase III Trial to Evaluate First-line Kisplyx® (lenvatinib) Plus Pembrolizumab or Everolimus Versus Sunitinib in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma[1] Eisai Enrols Patients in Global Phase III Trial to Evaluate First-line Kisplyx® (lenvatinib) Plus Pembrolizumab or Everolimus Versus Sunitinib in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma[1] CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 03/10/2016 01:01 HATFIELD, England, October 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- FOR EMEA MEDIA ONLY: NOT FOR AUSTRIAN/SWISS JOURNALISTS   Eisai today announces the initiation of a multicentre, global, randomised phase III study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in combination with everolimus versus sunitinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in a first-line setting. Pembrolizumab is marketed under the brand name Keytruda® by Merck, Sharp & Dohme (MSD) in the European Union. Study 307 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02811861) (Comparison of the efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib in combination with Everolimus or pembrolizumab versus sunitinib alone in first-line treatment of subjects with Advanced Renal cell carcinoma) is designed to assess the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with these combinations.[1] Secondary endpoints include objective response rate, overall survival and safety. Study 307 is the first phase III trial to assess lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) immunotherapy, in previously untreated patients with advanced RCC.[1][2] Kidney cancer is among the ten most frequently occurring cancers in Western (countries) communities.[3] About 270,000 cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed globally each year and 116,000 people die from the disease.[3] Approximately 90% of all kidney cancers are renal cell carcinomas (RCC).[3] In August 2016, the European Commission issued a marketing authorisation for lenvatinib in combination with everolimus for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy.[4] The continued development of its oncology portfolio underscores Eisai's human health care (hhc) mission, the company's commitment to innovative solutions in disease prevention, cure and care for the health and wellbeing of people worldwide. Eisai is committed to the therapeutic area of oncology and to addressing the unmet medical needs of people with cancer and their families. Notes to Editors     About Study 307     Study 307, a phase III clinical trial, will enrol 735 patients with advanced RCC who have not received any previous systemic therapy.[1] Patients will be randomised 1:1:1 to receive a combination of lenvatinib (20 mg orally, once daily) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg intravenously, every 3 weeks); lenvatinib (18 mg orally, once daily) plus everolimus (5 mg orally, once daily); or sunitinib (50 mg orally, once daily), on a schedule of four weeks on treatment followed by two weeks off treatment).[1] The primary endpoint of this study is PFS; other endpoints include objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and safety.[1] More information about Study 307 may be found on ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02811861 About Lenvatinib   Lenvatinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1-3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1-4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha, and RET and KIT proto-oncogenes.[5],[6] Lenvatinib is indicated in the European Union for the treatment of adult patients with progressive locally advanced or metastatic, differentiated (papillary, follicular, Hürthle cell) thyroid carcinoma (DTC) refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI).[7] Lenvatinib is approved for the treatment of refractory thyroid cancer in the United States, Switzerland, the European Union, Canada, Russia, Australia, South Korea, Israel, Singapore, Japan and Brazil.

Through massive marketing and outreach efforts by the manufacturer, Mylan, EpiPen has become to the go-to device for anyone facing a potentially serious or life-threatening allergic reaction. It is a brand that has “become” the device, like Kleenex has “become” tissues, and Jet Ski has become the catch-all for personal watercraft. The EpiPen price has been raised 17 times in 11 years. When Mylan bought the device from Merck KgAA, a German company, in 2007, it cost $124 for a two-pack. Today, a two-pack costs more than $600. And there is no real competitor in the market, as Auvi-Q, a similar product launched in 2013 by Sanofi, was withdrawn in 2015 because of dosing issues. Mylan controls 94% of this market. Under fire from all sides for the last few weeks, Mylan announced it would rapidly bring to market a generic, but is unclear how much impact this will have. A complicated scenario Here’s what I learned when I was researching this issue: while Mylan does control the price of the product, it does not control the price to consumers — health insurance companies do. According to an article published recently by Ronny Gal, Ph.D., a senior analyst at the investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. (I found it on a fascinating website called drugchannels.net), in the wake of Sanofi pulling its drug, “Mylan was in a position to price up Epipen, which they did – by 15% in November and by another 15% in May. … The (insurance) payors got mad and raised the pain level on patients – raising copays and toughening medical policies (this is important, Mylan does not determine price to consumers, payors do). As Epipen is broadly purchased ahead of the new school year, the pain became acute for many families over the past month. There were lots of posts on mother’s networks, the media caught wind of the story and now we have multiple politicians jumping on the bandwagon.” Let’s keep the conversation going… This got me thinking about the cost of prescriptions in general. Way, way back in the good old days of the mid-1980s, when I first entered the working world, I had a $5 co-pay on my prescriptions. Over the years, as insurance plans have morphed and HMOs were invented and employers began searching for ways to save money, we had a tiered prescription plan that started at $5 for basic generic drugs and ended at $50 for really important stuff. Today, under my husband’s company’s insurance plan, we have a $3,000 annual deductible we have to meet. Until we hit that $3K, we pay out of pocket for EVERYTHING. This has ended up being quite an education, especially since we are at the age now where there are daily medications for things like blood pressure and prostate. Luckily (or unluckily), we have had a run of bad health and met the deductible for the first time, about halfway through the year. It is these broad-deductible types of plans (which I think more and more of us are opting for as a way to save up front on the premiums taken out of the paycheck) that are making many of us painfully aware of the full cost of prescription drugs. As Matthew Herper recently noted in an article on forbes.com, “If a customer is paying a $73 co-payment on a $600 device, this is a good deal. But a lot of consumers no longer simply have a co-pay on their drug purchases. They have a large deductible – an amount of money they must spend before their insurance kicks in. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey last September found 24% of consumers had high-deductible plans. ObamaCare is one reason for the rise, but another is that employers are turning to these plans more frequently.” Remember, too, that is the insurers who are determining the costs to the consumers by manipulating copays, discounts and rebates, not Mylan. And in multiple interviews, Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch has made it a point to note that Mylan “only” gets $275 of the $608 list price for two EpiPens. Hunting for affordable medications The high cost of his prescriptions led my husband on a mission to figure out the lowest-cost way we could deal with it. Because even generics — if there are any — aren’t cheap anymore. He discovered a website called GoodRX, which not only showed him the price of his medications at all our area pharmacies, but also offered a big-discount coupon. So my husband now gets his medications at WalMart, which is considerably cheaper than other pharmacies in our area, and uses the coupons. There are other similar websites out there. Another smart strategy is to always ask your doctor for samples and coupons. They have closets FULL of samples. Our son has acne, and when we went to the doctor to have it looked at, he prescribed two medications, one being Epiduo. This is $300-$400 for 1 small tube and it’s not covered by most Medicare and insurance plans (including ours). Now, acne is not life-threatening, but for a 15-year-old boy, it might feel like it. Luckily, our doctor loaded me up with samples and also gave me a one-time coupon. We filled it once, using that coupon (cost to us $45). Since then we have just used the samples. His prescription for clindamycin phosphate was almost as expensive, but I discovered there are over the counter creams that have the same ingredient, and with pharmacy coupons I can get it cheaper than it would be with prescription discounts. Hunting for discounts, rebates and coupons, asking your doctor for as many samples as they will spare, shopping from pharmacy to pharmacy to get the best price (the disparity among stores is shocking as well), and making sure you understand your insurance coverage and are getting the most out of it — these are all keys to helping to manage the cost of your medications. Needless to say, I am not looking forward to those golden years, when our medications increase and our ability to pay goes down. How about you?

If we hand you samples, you’re lucky because we feel bad about the cost of medicine and happen to have a gift. Otherwise, we just hope your insurance covers your medicines. Good Rx is useful, I use it a lot before prescribing to the uninsured. loading.... STop ignoring the obvious The “cure” is insurance companies actually negotiating with pharma, instead of investing in them. Political will, instead of “oh gosh, buy generic!” loading.... Kym I recently read about a site called goodrx.com for ways to save on prescriptions and checked it out. I found coupons for some of my daughter’s meds, including her EpiPen, and saved the cost of my co-pays. The EpiPen coupon is good for three refills, so that one will save me $120 this year. We’ve been fortunate to have access to decent health care plans through my husband’s employer, so I wasn’t aware of the rising cost of the EpiPens until recently. Goodrx.com also shows the cost of the prescriptions at several stores for comparison as well. By the way, is there anyone on earth as well-informed as Donna Freedman? I learn something new every time. Love her. loading.... Michael Maag Here’s another great tool for saving on prescription meds: https://www.blinkhealth.com. They have awesome prices on millions of prescriptions available to everyone with or without insurance. loading.... Donna Freedman Here’s an excerpt from the “Staying Healthy” chapter of my new book, “Your Playbook For Tough Times: Living Large On Small Change, For The Short Term Or The Long Haul”: Maintenance meds and short-term drug regimens alike can take a huge bite out of your healthcare budget. Some insurance plans include mail-order pharmacy privileges, which can save you some money. But not always. When I switched insurance plans I was paying $4 a month for generic maintenance meds, so I sent both prescriptions off to the mail-order pharmacy. One came in at $8 for three months’ worth. The other cost me more than $29 for 90 days. Whoops. Learn from my mistake: Read the generic medications list VERY carefully. Even if you’re not on maintenance meds, the cost of curing even a simple illness can be surprisingly high. Use one or more of the following tips to get the most for your healthcare dollars. — Common meds may be free. Some supermarket pharmacies offer certain antibiotics, generic Lipitor, prenatal and children’s vitamins, the diabetes drug Metformin and other medications without charge. Among the grocery chains providing free medications are Amigos United, Giant Eagle, Meijer, Price Chopper, Publix, Reasor’s, Schnucks, ShopRite and Wegman’s. — Ask for help. A certain number of discounted or even free drugs are available for those on extremely limited incomes. You can apply for assistance through groups like NeedyMeds (http://www.needymeds.org/), the Chronic Disease Fund (http://www.mygooddays.org/) and the Partnership for Prescription Assistance (https://www.pparx.org/). — Go generic. Wal-Mart first offered $4 prescriptions a decade ago and other stores and pharmacies jumped on the bandwagon. Use a site called MedTipster.com to find generic equivalents of the drugs you need, whether maintenance or short-term, and then check the formularies for local stores offering $4 scripts. — Split pills. If you need a 10-mg drug, it could be possible to buy 20-mg pills for about the same price, then use a pill-splitter to halve them. Note: You must ask your provider about this, since not all drugs can be safely divided. About online pharmacies: Even if you don’t have a mail-order pharmacy associated with your insurance plan, it’s still possible to buy online. Due diligence is necessary, however, since some Internet drugstores are bogus. The Mayo Clinic website notes that in some cases prescriptions have “turned out to contain no active ingredient or to contain the wrong medicine.” It is illegal to ship non-FDA-approved drugs into the United States. You should order only from online pharmacies in the U.S. Although some people think it’s safe to use Canadian virtual pharmacies, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy notes that some rogue northerners source their drugs from countries where standards may be lax and counterfeit pills more common. To find an approved source, run the pharmacy’s name through LegitScript.com. (Hope that helps!) loading.... jestjack Thank you for this timely article. Another area of concern is the rising cost of diabetes meds and testing materials. DW was diagnosed a while back and the drugs for her care have went up significantly. In addition our premiums continue to go up annually at 10% or better. Our plan is a “grandfathered” plan that does not comply with all of the ACA requirements but seems to meet our needs. It is a high deductible plan with little coverage for prescription drugs. But like you, for better or worse, it looks like we will hit our deductible by the end of September this year. Then we only pay 20% of costs until we hit our “out of pocket limit”. Then coverage is 100%. My thought is this is only going to get worse and being an informed consumer is one of the few options we have. The ACA plans which were supposed to address this problem actually made the problem worse. I viewed plans with $13K out of pocket caps and $7K deductibles. The answer I got was that folks would be more discerning when seeking treatment as they had “skin in the game”. My thought is, it makes care more expensive….causing some to do without. loading....

But research being presented this week at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC) in Toronto suggests costs could be trimmed if patients were more closely monitored by physicians and caregivers. Learn "7 Ways Your Smartphone Can Harm Your Health" and more in the AARP Health Newsletter Brain Health and More Mentoring: cognitive gains in older adults Eat to lower your risk of dementia Take the Staying Sharp Brain Health Assessment  Join AARP Today — Receive access to exclusive information, benefits and discounts “Today, Alzheimer’s is incurable and progressive, and some assume that treating dementia is an unjustified cost drain on our health-care system, but this study presents compelling arguments for prescribing the standard of care,” Maria Carrillo, chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Association, said in a press release about a new comparison of treated versus untreated patients. The study found that patients who received medications to alleviate some of the symptoms of Alzheimer’s incurred lower total health care costs and had a lower risk of dying, although that probably was not because of the drugs but because they more likely had doctors and caregivers paying attention to their health, researchers said. Researchers from Merck, the pharmaceutical company, looked at the impact of treating newly diagnosed Alzheimer’s patients with one of four available medications. (Merck does not market any of the treatments but is testing the effectiveness of an experimental Alzheimer’s medication called Verubecestat.) They identified a total of 6,553 Medicare beneficiaries who had just been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. About 35 percent of them were treated with one of the four drugs, on average 34 days after their diagnosis. Two-thirds of those treated received donepezil, the generic name for Aricept, which has been on the U.S. market the longest of all the Alzheimer’s drugs. Untreated patients tended to be older and sicker with other ailments than the treated patients, the researchers found. For an apples-to-apples comparison, the scientists matched treated with untreated patients on the basis of demographic factors such as age and health status. The study found that among the 694 impaired patients, those who were treated were less likely to die and had lower monthly total health care costs than those who were not treated. It’s unlikely the medications themselves deserve much credit, study coauthor Christopher Black of the Merck Research Laboratories told AARP. AARP Members Enjoy Health and Wellness Discounts You can save on eye exams, prescription drugs, hearing aids and more “There are currently no effective treatments to prevent, slow or halt the progress of Alzheimer’s disease, and current therapies have limited impact on symptoms,” Blacks said. But the fact that patients received treatment suggests that they were benefiting from other factors related to better health in Alzheimer’s patients, such as closer management by a physician and the presence of a caregiver, Black said. An overwhelming majority of patients in his study had other diseases that could have been made worse by their Alzheimer’s symptoms, he said. Indeed, that often appears to happen, another study concluded. Pei-Jung Lin of Tufts Medical Center in Boston and her coauthors analyzed 2013 Medicare claims data for Alzheimer’s patients. They found that 1 in 10 of the patients, or about 280,000 people, had at least one potentially avoidable hospitalization, which cost Medicare $2.58 billion. Roughly half of the avoidable hospitalizations were for acute conditions such as bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract conditions and dehydration, while the remainder were due to chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, the researchers found. Those problems “shouldn’t have become so serious that they put people in the hospital,” Lin said Monday at a press briefing. She gave the example of an Alzheimer’s patient who was hospitalized with uncontrolled diabetes. Her blood sugar had soared because her Alzheimer’s left her unable to manage it. “Admissions to the hospital are not only expensive, but they can be dangerous for someone with Alzheimer’s disease,” Lin said. “Alzheimer’s patients can become even more confused and disoriented during their hospital stay.” To fix the problem, she said, “we need to understand who is at high risk for avoidable hospitalizations."

The North American region accounted for majority of the share of the world contraceptives market in 2015.

Meet the Contributors → Taking Aim at Alexion, Ra Pharma Heads to IPO Queue Ben Fidler October 3rd, 2016 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Boston —  Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria may be an ultra-rare blood disease, but Alexion Pharmaceuticals makes over $2 billion a year by selling the only approved drug for it, eculizumab (Soliris). Ra Pharmaceuticals is one of those developing an alternative, and the Cambridge, MA, company is looking to Wall Street to help fund the clinical work. Ra filed for an IPO late Friday, aiming to fund the clinical development of an experimental drug called RA101495.  Ra plans to start Phase 2 trials of the drug early next year and release data in the latter half of 2017; the company hopes the trial will build its case that the drug is a threat to Alexion’s (NASDAQ: ALXN) eculizumab. Ra’s RA101495 is subcutaneous injection for people with PNH, a disease in which the complement system—a part of the immune system—destroys red blood cells, causing a host of problems like blood clots and organ failure. Alexion’s eculizumab—which costs more than $500,000 per patient for a year of treatment—is the only approved drug for PNH. It doesn’t cure the disease, but it stops the complement system from attacking red blood cells, which in turn lowers the risk of blood clots and other problems associated with PNH. Eculizumab, however, has to be infused bi-weekly at a clinic, and as Ra says in its prospectus, sometimes patients’ symptoms recur anyway. Ra estimates that there are about 16,000 patients with PNH worldwide. Ra is one of several companies trying to develop new drugs for PNH, including Novartis, Amyndas Pharmaceuticals, Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Akari Pharmaceuticals, and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Alexion is also developing a longer-lasting version of eculizumab. Like eculizumab, Ra’s drug blocks a protein in the complement system called complement component 5. But RA101495 is a peptide drug, not an antibody, and it’s taken via an injection just under the skin. Ra believes that a drug like this, self-administered by patients at home on a more frequent basis (either daily or weekly), could be more convenient for patients and help them better control their PNH. The drug is the first product from a platform Ra is trying to show can combine some of the best properties of antibodies and small molecule drugs. Ra is also developing RA101495 for two other autoimmune diseases, lupus nephritis and refractory generalized myasthenia gravis, which causes progressive muscle weakness. Phase 2 and Phase 1b trials, respectively, will begin in patients with both diseases next year. Ra has a collaboration with Merck on an unspecified cardiovascular disease and some other drug candidates in development, but none of them are in clinical testing as of yet. Ra was formed in 2008, and has raised a total of $86 million in equity financing. (It’s also gotten about $17.5 million so far through its partnership with Merck, and could get another $61.5 million in future payments.) Ra’s most significant shareholders are New Enterprise Associates (22.09 million shares), Morgenthaler Venture Partners (17.38 million shares), Novartis Bioventures (17.23 million shares), Novo A/S (12.50 million shares), Lightstone Capital, and RA Capital Management (both 8.33 million shares). Ra had $40.3 million in cash on hand as of June 30 and had burned through about $50 million since its inception. If it completes the IPO, Ra will trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “RARX.” Ben Fidler is Xconomy's Deputy Biotechnology Editor.

Bernie SandersBernie SandersDem senators charge: Trump not draining the swamp Poll: Majority of Democrats want to ditch Electoral College Millennials could have stopped Trump, but we didn't MORE (I-Vt.) is injecting himself in one of the most costly political battles of the year, appearing in a new television advertisement on behalf of a ballot measure proponents say will cut the cost of prescription drugs. ADVERTISEMENT "The time is long overdue for the American people to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry," Sanders says in the 30-second spot. "People are dying because they can't afford medicine." Proposition 61, dubbed the California Drug Price Relief Act, would prohibit state agencies from purchasing prescription drugs for any more than the Department of Veterans Affairs pays. Proponents hope the initiative would lower drug costs for Californians who get prescription drugs through state programs like Medicaid. Opponents say the measure could lead to price increases. The Veterans Administration does not publicize the amount it pays for prescription drugs, a cost hammered out in delicate negotiations with pharmaceutical companies. The initiative pits well-heeled industries against each other over highly-profitable products -- a recipe for an expensive contest. Together, the two sides have already collected more than $100 million for what is likely to be the second-most expensive political race of the season, after the presidential contest. Supporters led by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and the California Nurses Association PAC have raised more than $14 million to back the measure. A national nurses' union was one of Sanders's top backers in his upstart presidential bid. Pharmaceutical companies opposed to Proposition 61 have poured more than $86 million into the campaign to beat it back. Corporations such as Merck, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson have each contributed $7.2 million to the cause. "Proposition 61 is a very, very important step forward," Sanders says in the 30-second spot. "It will be great for the taxpayers of California and it will be a real blow against this greedy industry that will reverberate all over America." A similar measure qualified for the 2017 ballot in Ohio this week.  Tags Bernie Sanders   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa. View the discussion thread.

After Confusion Over EpiPen Profits, Lawmakers Want Proof Of Drug’s Actual Costs Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share After Confusion Over EpiPen Profits, Lawmakers Want Proof Of Drug’s Actual Costs Image courtesy of M October 3, 2016 5:38 pm EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave the price is right-ish epipen Mylan drugs prescription drugs When Mylan CEO Heather Bresch recently testified before the House Oversight Committee, she claimed that the company only made $50 per EpiPen, in spite of charging $608 per two-pack of the emergency allergy medicine. Mylan then said it makes around $80/EpiPen — a figure that lawmakers still doubted. Now the leadership of the Oversight Committee is asking Mylan to clear things up for everyone by turning over documents that actually show how much the company makes from EpiPen. Taxes are at the heart of this particular dispute. When Bresch gave the $50/EpiPen profit figure to Congress, she didn’t mention that this was a post-tax figure. Additionally, it was later learned that Mylan had used the statutory U.S. tax rate of 37.5% to calculate that figure, even though Mylan likely paid significantly less than that rate. In a letter [PDF], sent to Bresch on Friday by Committee Chair Jason Chaffetz (UT) and Ranking Member Elijah Cummings (MD), the lawmakers note that during the CEO’s testimony she regularly referenced a chart (seen here at right) that breaks down the purported costs and profit from EpiPen, but only mentioned taxes when talking about the company’s money-saving decision to relocate Mylan’s headquarters overseas. “Failing to disclose tax assumptions that formed the basis of the $100 profit per pack claim, despite opportunities to do so before and during the hearing, raises questions,” reads the letter, which reminds Bresch that Chaffetz and Cummings each voiced disbelief about these “dumbed down financials” shown to the committee. Because of the apparent lack of transparency from Mylan, the letter seeks information that paints a more accurate and precise picture of the costs associated with EpiPen. The committee is seeking any internal analyses or memos related to “EpiPen sales, profits, costs, manufacturing, distribution, or any other subject that could impact the costs or profitability of the drug-device combination,” along with five years of profit and loss statements for EpiPen. Instead of the vague chart provided to Congress, the letter calls for Mylan to provide a year-by-year breakdown on 18 different costs and revenue streams — including the controversial EpiPens4Schools program — since the company acquired EpiPen as part of its purchase of Merck’s generic drug business nine years ago. With regard to taxes, the committee wants to see evidence of Mylan’s actual tax rate and taxable income in the U.S., and the amount of its U.S. income paid to the IRS each year since 2007. Chaffetz and Cummings also want to know how much Mylan charges for the EpiPen in the Netherlands, along with supporting documentation. Finally, the letter asks Mylan to identify all employees involved in classifying EpiPen with Medicare/Medicaid as a “multiple source drug,” meaning the company pays a lower rebate, even though EpiPen currently controls some 95% of the epinephrine auto-injector market. This last issue is already being investigated by the West Virginia attorney general, and several U.S. senators have called for the Justice Department to investigate possible fraud. Mylan has until Oct. 7 to respond to the lawmakers’ request.

Login Register Public Release: 3-Oct-2016 IDH and CIC mutations provide prognostic information for grade II and III gliomas NRG Oncology Share  Print  E-Mail BOSTON, MA - NRG Oncology investigators have identified two biomarkers that are prognostic of overall and progression-free survival for patients with lower-grade gliomas. This combined mutational analysis using specimens from two NRG Oncology clinical trials is the first study to examine the prognostic effects of mutations within IDH1/2, ATRX, CIC, FUBP1 and the TERT promoter using rigorous multivariate analysis (MVA) in a combined cohort of grade II and grade III gliomas with prospectively-collected, well-annotated clinical data. These results were presented at the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting in Boston, Massachusetts, September 27, 2016. "The correlative study associated with RTOG 9802 and RTOG 9813 represents the very first to demonstrate independent prognostic value of IDH mutations in a combined cohort of Grade II/III gliomas in the context of well-annotated Phase III clinical studies, thereby extending the findings of TCGA and previously-reported single institution studies. In the present study, IDH gene mutations were found to be of independent prognostic value after age, treatment, extent of surgical resection, histology, and performance status were factored in. Future directions involve investigation of the predictive value of IDH and other biomarkers to guide specific therapeutic selection for Grade II/III glioma patients, which remains highly controversial in this context," says Arnab Chakravarti, MD of the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center and Richard L. Solove Research Institute and the Senior Author of RTOG 9802 and 9813. The analysis utilized a combined cohort of two prospective phase III studies' (NRG Oncology RTOG 9802 and 9813) specimens from 115 grade II and 104 grade III (n=104) glioma patients. The investigators determined IDH mutation status by immunohistochemistry and/or deep sequencing and used a custom Ion AmpliSeq DNA panel for mutation analysis. Sanger Sequencing was used to detect TERT promoter mutations. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the analyses on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Hazard ratios (HRs) on the effect of biomarkers were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard model and tested using the Wald and log-rank tests. MVAs were performed incorporating age, treatment, surgery, histology, and performance status as covariates. Marker by treatment interaction effects were tested using the combined cohort for each marker using the analysis of deviance tests. Mutations were found within IDH1/2 in 65%, ATRX in 34 percent, TERT promoter in 32%, CIC in 18 percent, and FUBP1 in 6% of the respective analyzed cases. In the univariate analysis, IDH1/2 mutations (OS: HR=0.38; p<0.001; PFS: HR=0.45; p<0.001) and CIC (OS: HR=0.48; p=0.04; PFS: HR=0.50; p=0.04) mutations were significantly associated with better OS and PFS. Upon MVA, IDH1/2 mutations were significantly associated with better OS and PFS (OS: HR=0.50; p<0.001; PFS: HR=0.52; p<0.001), whereas CIC mutations trended toward better OS and PFS (OS: HR=0.47; p=0.073; PFS: HR=0.48; p=0.059).This study defines the prognostic value of IDH mutations independent of age, treatment, surgery, histology, and performance status, while also providing evidence of the prognostic value of CIC independent of grade/histology. Tests of these markers to aid in treatment choice (marker by treatment interaction effects) did not reach statistical significance; however, efforts to increase sample size are ongoing. ### NRG Oncology RTOG 9802 and 9813 were funded by grants from the National Cancer Institute, Merck & Co., the Brain Tumor Funders Collaborative Grant, and the Ohio State University CCC. http://www.nrgoncology.org NRG Oncology conducts practice-changing, multi-institutional clinical and translational research to improve the lives of patients with cancer. Founded in 2012, NRG Oncology is a Pennsylvania-based nonprofit corporation that integrates the research of the National Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, and the Gynecologic Oncology Group. The research organization seeks to carry out clinical trials with emphases on gender-specific malignancies, including gynecologic, breast, and prostate cancers, and on localized or locally advanced cancers of all types. NRG Oncology's extensive research organization comprises multidisciplinary investigators, including medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, physicists, pathologists, and statisticians, and encompasses more than 1300 research sites located world-wide with predominance in the United States and Canada. NRG Oncology is supported primarily through grants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and is one of five research groups in the NCI's National Clinical Trials Network.

Wilson - 10/03/16 07:00 AM EDT   Ann Jablon, the longtime chief of staff to Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), is joining Capitol Counsel on Monday, the K Street firm is set to announce. Jablon has worked for Neal, her hometown congressman, for more than 26 years. She started out as an intern in his office during his freshman year in Congress, a gig she had lobbied for by writing him a letter offering to work for him. ADVERTISEMENT She spent the summer after her junior year as an intern, and once she graduated from Boston University, Jablon went back to work for Neal on Capitol Hill — and had been there ever since. In 1995, she was named Neal's chief of staff. Jablon said that she is excited about the new opportunity on K Street. “I worked for an extraordinary member, and I’ve had the best experience up here. It's time to try something new,” she told The Hill on Friday morning. She had also been a healthcare advisor for Neal — a member of the House’s tax-writing panel — and plans to specialize her advocacy on healthcare innovation and tax issues.  "Ann's years of experience working with the members and staff of the Ways and Means Committee, and her deep familiarity with the committee's important areas of jurisdiction, make her a valuable addition to our already formidable team here at Capitol Counsel," said former Rep. Jim McCrery (R-La.), a partner at the firm who once held the top GOP spot on the House Ways and Means Committee. Capitol Counsel Partner Shannon Finley lauded Jablon’s experience and connections as a boon for clients. “Given Ann’s exemplary reputation the Hill we are very proud that she chose to join us at Capitol Counsel,” she said. “I could not ask for a better colleague to be part of our efforts as we continue to grow and meet our client needs in the next Congress.” Capitol Counsel is one of the top lobbying shops in Washington, with revenue of more than $8 million in the first half of 2016. Its extensive client roster includes Amgen, Merck, the American Health Care Association, Genentech, JPMorgan Chase, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), tobacco company Reynolds American, the American Physical Therapy Association, Wal-Mart, the U.S. Sugar Corporation, Beam Suntory, the National Association of Realtors, Viacom, Rite Aid and Intuit. Jablon is restricted from lobbying Neal’s office, including staff, for one year. But she is free to advocate before other members on Capitol Hill and the executive branch.   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa. View the discussion thread.

Meeting Abstract available on the ACR Annual Meeting website News provided by Xencor, Inc. Oct 03, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article MONROVIA, Calif., Oct. 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ: XNCR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer, today announced that preliminary data from an ongoing open-label Phase 2 study of XmAb®5871 in patients with IgG4-Related Disease will be presented during an oral presentation on Sunday, November 13 at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2016 Annual Meeting. An abstract of the presentation is available on the ACR conference website at: http://acrabstracts.org/. Information contained in the abstract was at the time of submission in June 2016. An updated data set will be presented at the ACR Annual Meeting in November. Abstract: 940 Title: A Trial of XmAb®5871, a Reversible Inhibitor of CD19+ Cells, in IgG4-Related Disease Presenter: John H. Stone, Massachusetts General Hospital Rheumatology Unit, Harvard Medical School Session:  Miscellaneous Rheumatic and Inflammatory Diseases - Oral Session I Session date and time: Sunday, November 13, 2016 2:30-4:00 p.m. ET XmAb®5871    XmAb®5871 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets CD19 with its variable domain and that uses Xencor's XmAb immune inhibitor Fc domain to target FcγRIIb, a receptor that inhibits B-cell function. XmAb5871 is the first drug candidate that Xencor is aware of that targets FcγRIIb inhibition. Xencor has demonstrated in multiple animal models and in initial human clinical trials that XmAb5871 inhibits B-cell function without destroying these important immune cells, and demonstrated promising treatment effect in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as well as ex vivo results showing inhibition of SLE patient B-cell activation and humoral immunity.  About IgG4-Related Disease  IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) is a rare fibro-inflammatory autoimmune disorder that we estimate impacts up to 40,000 patients in the United States. IgG4-RD affects multiple organ systems and is characterized by a distinct microscopic appearance of diseased organs, including the presence of IgG4-positive plasmablast cells. This objective diagnostic criterion is atypical for autoimmune diseases and offers advantages for accurately identifying patients. There are currently no approved therapies for this newly recognized disorder and corticosteroids are the current standard of care. John H. Stone, M.D, MPH, director, clinical rheumatology at Massachusetts General Hospital has developed and is validating the IgG4-RD Responder Index, a proposed instrument to assess disease activity. About Xencor's XmAb® Immune Inhibitor Technology FcγRIIb (IIb), also called CD32b, is a receptor for Fc domains on B cells and other immune cells. When engaged, the IIb receptor blocks immune activation pathways and traffics bound soluble antigens out of circulation. Xencor has discovered a series of Fc domain variants with up to a 400-fold increase in binding affinity to FcγRIIb derived from just two amino acid changes. These XmAb® Immune Inhibitor Fc domains greatly heighten the properties of IIb receptor engagement and have potential as building blocks for drug candidates in autoimmune, allergic and inflammatory diseases. About Xencor, Inc. Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer. Currently, 10 candidates engineered with Xencor's XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners. Xencor's internal programs include: XmAb5871 in Phase 2 development for the treatment of IgG4-Related Disease, and also for the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; XmAb7195 in Phase 1 development for the treatment of asthma and allergic diseases; XmAb14045 in Phase 1 development for acute myeloid leukemia; and XmAb13676 for B-cell malignancies and XmAb18087 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors, both in pre-clinical development. Xencor's XmAb antibody engineering technology enables small changes to the structure of monoclonal antibodies resulting in new mechanisms of therapeutic action.  Xencor partners include Novartis, Amgen, MorphoSys, Merck, CSL/Janssen, Alexion, Novo Nordisk and Boehringer Ingelheim.

(At right: John Lewis.) Developed by Cheshire-based SOG, Deal With ItÒ is a highly effective and well-established training programme which aims to influence staff attitudes to health and safety, encouraging a change or re-evaluation of culture in the workplace and at home. It has proved an international success with SOG recently breaking into the US market. Now a new partnership with Circle Safety & Health Consultants who are based in Richmond, Virginia, offers the opportunity to introduce Deal With ItÒ to more businesses in the US. SOG aims to forge partnerships with other American safety training organisations to roll out Deal With ItÒ across the United States and wants interested bodies to contact them. John Lewis, Managing Director of SOG Group, says: “Due to our continued growth in delivering cultural safety training programmes in various countries on different continents and particularly in North America, we have reached agreement with Circle Safety for them to partner with us in marketing and delivering our courses in the US. “Circle Safety have a highly experienced team of consultants and trainers serving general industry, construction and the public sector on the Eastern Seaboard of the US. We have commenced a programme to train their staff who have already delivered a broad range of safety training to some of their clients in Virginia.” Mr Lewis added: “Deal With ItÒ has become established as an excellent vehicle to promote positive changes in safety culture to help make the workplace environment safer for all employees. We have made some significant breakthroughs in the US where we have identified a huge potential market for Deal With ItÒ but to date we have been limited by conducting the training sessions through our UK-based trainers. “This partnership, where Circle Safety will now deliver Deal With It® courses under license from SOG, marks an exciting new era for Deal With It® and means our programme can be introduced to more US businesses faster. This is a major new initiative for us and we are keen to speak to other training organisations in the US, and indeed other countries, who may wish to market and deliver our programmes to their business communities to speed up the transformation of Deal With It® into a truly global product which does make a difference.” More/2 Anna Jolly, Managing Director of Circle Safety, says: “Safety culture change is the next giant step for employee safety in the U.S. Deal With It® is the best vehicle we have seen for making real changes in how employees and ultimately whole organizations make decisions about how safely work is carried out.  The approach is not from the top down nor from the bottom up, but is across all levels at the same time.” Deal With ItÒ has already been successfully deployed by one of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies, Merck & Co Inc, for 600 workers at a plant in Cleveland, Tennessee. A training programme for 5,000 employees of Shell involved delivering sessions at some of the oil company’s US centres. Deal With ItÒ in the UK has been used by numerous leading businesses including Imperial Tobacco, Johnson Matthey, Fujifilm, Premier Foods, Cadbury’s, Warburton’s and Meggitt Polymers. To enable its use internationally parts of the programme have been translated into more than 20 different languages. SOG Group has also showcased its Deal With ItÒ programme to leading trades unions in the UK and the US who have been impressed by the innovative approach to engaging with staff to make workplaces safer. Helen Schoelzel (pictured at left), SOG’s Safety Health and Environment Manager, says: “From our customer feedback, Deal With ItÒ results are impressive. Our courses focus on safety culture and encouraging staff to think about what they do and what the implications of their actions might be – both to themselves and to their colleagues.  Changing perceptions about safety culture are key to Deal With ItÒ which really does make a positive difference. Companies have reported improved safety performance, reduced injury costs, higher staff morale and greater profitability. About Deal With ItÒ Deal With ItÒ is a highly innovative cultural safety programme that is raising the bar – helping businesses to recognise the importance of communication, engagement and empowerment to ensure the delivery of a sound, cultural approach within the workplace. The programme helps employees and companies to be more aware about safety, encouraging staff to report near misses or potential hazards to avoid unnecessary accidents – reducing unnecessary costs due to downtime, overtime, damage to equipment, increased insurance premiums, compensation pay-outs and the consequences of any prosecution. At the same time, employers benefit from a more positive and productive workforce. The benefits of the programme are: Increased staff motivation Creation of a positive safety culture Reduced accident rates Saves the company money Reduces the risk of health and safety prosecutions For more information visit www.dealwithittraining.co.uk or contact Sales Manager Neil Lancaster on +44 (0) 1928 515977 or email neil.lancaster@dwisafetyculture.co.uk For information on the world-wide partners’ programme please contact: Business Partnerships Manager Peter Thomas: Peter.thomas@dwisafetyculture.co.uk       More/3 About SOG Formed in 2000 SOG is owner and operator of The Heath Business and Technical Park which it has transformed from a once single-occupancy corporate facility into a thriving independent business park.

Fifteen years later, it's no wonder that patients, facing high rates of sharing costs, are in favor of co-pay cards — and that payers, tasked with footing the bill, are not. Drugmakers spent $7 billion on co-pay assistance programs in 2015, up 30% from 2014, according to data from IMS Health/Amundsen Group. Read more about the industry's milestone moments in MM&M's 50th Anniversary issue.  “While drug co-pay coupons may appear to help consumers, that's not actually what they're designed to do,” reads a July blog post by America's Health Insurance Plans, the health insurance industry's lobbying arm. “What drug co-pay coupons really do is keep costs high for everyone.” The popularity of these cards has exposed the increasingly high rates of patient co-pays and co-insurance. This put payers, still on the hook for covering negotiated product prices, on the defensive. To stem rising prescription drug costs, PBMs have responded in kind: They have recently begun to lean heavily on tiered formularies, prior authorization requirements, and, more recently, formulary exclusions. “These co-payments and co-insurance rates have changed dramatically,” says Ed Schoonveld, managing principal and leader of the market access and pricing practice at ZS Associates. “Many insurers and PBMs put more cost reductions in place and [required] more paperwork to make it hard to use these expensive options.” The widespread use of co-pay cards highlights the ongoing tension between drugmakers and payers tussling over value. To make a long story short: Payers are now in charge, and it doesn't look as though that is going to change anytime soon.

As a result, they are turning to big data to reinforce the value story of their products as they market them to a handful of very powerful PBMs and health insurers. “We in the U.S. have got to get to a different model of healthcare,” says Dr. Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, which covers 85 million people. “Right now, we're paying Ritz-Carlton prices for Motel 6 services.” The passage of the Affordable Care Act did more than provide insurance to millions of previously uninsured patients and new incentives to encourage a move from the traditional fee-for-service model to a fee-for-value system. It also led to a wave of consolidation among industry players. CONTINUING CONSOLIDATION Every major part of the healthcare industry — pharmaceutical companies, insurance providers, PBMs, makers of medical devices, hospitals, physicians' groups — has undergone significant consolidation, as each sector attempts to gain the upper negotiating hand. For instance, Express Scripts, CVS Caremark, and UnitedHealth Group's OptumRx — the three largest PBMs — now control about 75% of the market, putting them in a position to demand rebates on the drugs they cover. That same consolidation trend has altered the landscape for commercial insurers as well. Four of the five largest commercial insurance companies in the U.S. — Aetna and Humana, and Cigna and Anthem — are attempting to merge in two separate deals, a move that in July raised Justice Department concern about competition. See also: Express Scripts' Steve Miller takes on drug industry in pricing battle What the payer consolidation trend has done is create pricing transparency, said Kim Wishnow-Per, president of McCann Managed Markets. “They could see what other payers were paying,” she says. “That started to enable them to have control over the cost of drugs.” Finding new ways to control drug costs has become increasingly important, especially now that the drug industry has cycled out of a sluggish R&D period and into one that is bursting with Phase III trials and first-in-class product launches. There are now 7,000 drugs in clinical development worldwide, 70% of which are first-in-class medicines, according to PhRMA, the drug industry's lobbying arm. Novel therapies that treat diseases like lung cancer and hepatitis C, which were previously hard to care for, are increasingly becoming the standard of care. See also: PBMs unveil 2017 formularies, retain focus on exclusions When Gilead Sciences launched Sovaldi, its game-changing hepatitis-C cure, in 2013, its decision to charge $84,000 for a course of treatment — that translates to $1,000 a pill — took a simmering debate about drug prices from the pages of medical journals and turned it into a national conversation about how drugs are priced. It was then that Express Scripts famously declined to put Sovaldi on its formulary, choosing to wait for AbbVie's Viekira Pak to receive FDA approval a year later. “That was a really remarkable moment,” Schoonveld says. That moment also served as a warning to other drugmakers. Insurers and PBMs would no longer cover even the most-innovative drugs if they exceeded certain price points and if the outcomes didn't match the expectations of payers. See also: Drugmakers explore response to pricing debate PBMs have taken that thinking one step further, starting when Express Scripts introduced exclusions from its formularies. Traditionally, PBMs gave certain drugs non-preferred status, but rarely did they exclude coverage of a drug. But in 2017 CVS Caremark, the second-largest PBM, plans to exclude 155 drugs from its formulary. Express Scripts plans to exclude 85. “The industry needs to make it clear to a broad set of stakeholders, including payers, that they can demonstrate the value of the innovation they bring forward,” Schoonveld says. “That is more key than ever in today's environment.” As payers have developed new strategies to crack down on high-priced drugs, pharmaceutical companies have realized that market-access expertise is crucial during a product launch. Not surprisingly, they have moved to add many such experts to their brand teams. “Companies are looking at their structure,” Wishnow-Per says. “That integration is happening, and they recognize that influence and how it affects their brand.” Cigna has inked a new payment model deal with Novartis for Entresto, its heart-failure drug.  LET'S MAKE A DEAL In addition, some drugmakers are starting to collaborate with payers to test new payment models. Cigna has inked 10 value-based reimbursement models, starting with what it called a performance-based model with Merck's diabetes drug Januvia in 2009. More recently, Cigna has completed deals with Novartis for Entresto, its heart-failure drug, approved in 2015; for Harvoni, Gilead's second hepatitis-C drug; and for Sanofi's Praluent and Amgen's Repatha, a pair of competing PCSK9 inhibitors that came to market within a month of each other. Cigna, like many other insurers, has started to test new reimbursement models with healthcare providers, as well as drugmakers. According to Christopher Bradbury, SVP of integrated clinical solutions and specialty pharmacy at Cigna, the greater the alignment between “the various stakeholders in the delivery system, the better off we'll be.” See also: Amgen takes issue with yet-to-be published multiple-myeloma drug report The move toward value comes as a number of new cancer drugs are expected to be approved by the FDA. The launches of Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo and Merck's Keytruda, both immuno-oncology drugs, and Pfizer's breast-cancer drug Ibrance have already caught the attention of physicians seeking new ways to treat their patients. The new drugs are both powerful and pricey. Opdivo, approved last year, costs $150,000 for the first round of treatment; it generated $942 million in sales in its first year on the market. These and other new cancer drugs are “going to drive an acceleration of this value-based discussion,” Bradbury says. Still, the pathway toward a value-based system is not well defined and will present a host of challenges for both drugmakers and payers. Experts like Schoonveld believe there are few incentives for payers to consider the long-term benefits of a drug in the current system, in which short-term economics drive decision-making. “We are in an era of scientific discovery for therapies for previously untreated problems,” Express Scripts' Miller says. “How are we going to pay for it?” Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the types of agreements Cigna has formed with drugmakers. They are are value-based models.  From the October 2016 Issue of MMM » Share this content: facebook twitter linkedin google Comments Print Similar Articles The growing influence of payers in oncology Co-pay Programs in the Crosshairs: An Evidence-based Response to Critics Co-pay Programs in the Crosshairs: An Evidence-based Response to Critics With PCSK9s, payers say, 'Let the market decide' Survey finds pharma and payers not aligned Related Topics Formulary Insurance PBMs Risk Sharing Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Here are five products whose impacts resonate through time, and the stories behind them. 1962 | THALIDOMIDE Regulators get assertive Assertive regulators — and multiple layers of regulation — are a fact of life for any modern-day copywriter or creative in healthcare advertising. But back in the 1960s, they were novelties. Thalidomide is the reason for that positive change. By the early 1960s, lingering problems beclouded the regulatory system for drugs. For one, said FDA historian John Swann in a 2012 podcast, products made it to market without being proved effective. In 1959, Sen. Estes Kefauver (D-TN) began a series of hearings that, at the time, concerned price increases. But as they unfolded, other issues came to light, most notably the fact that many products that made it to market simply didn't work as advertised. Kefauver expanded his scope in 1961 to include the problem of ineffective drugs, introducing a bill to give the FDA enhanced control over investigations (and greater say over Rx advertising, after subpoenas to medical ad agencies demanded they defend their work). It drew substantial opposition in Congress. Read more about the industry's milestone moments in MM&M's 50th Anniversary issue.  Meanwhile, in September 1960 the FDA received an application from Cincinnati-based Richardson-Merrell for a sedative known as thalidomide, which the firm wanted to market under the brand name Kevadon. Thalidomide was already being sold in more than 40 countries to prevent morning sickness. The application hit the desk of first-year FDA medical reviewer Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey, who felt the company needed to submit chronic toxicity data to establish safety. Her refusal to approve the drug prompted a howl of protest from the company, which appealed to Kelsey's superiors. But Kelsey, who had started her job at the agency a mere month prior to the application's arrival, was unbowed. Coincidentally, clusters of a severe birth defect known as phocomelia were showing up. Phocomelia is characterized by absent intrauterine long-bone formation, which resulted in babies' hands emanating directly from shoulders or feet arising from hips. No one could account for its cause until late 1961, when a German physician and an Australian physician independently linked it to thalidomide. The drug was immediately yanked from the market. Even with this global tragedy unfolding, the FDA application remained open until March 1962, according to Swann. See also: 7 ways Viagra changed the ways drugs are marketed Meanwhile, the bill that Kefauver had introduced in 1961 was struggling for support. Kefauver decided to leak the inside story about the thalidomide application to The Washington Post, which published a front-page article on America's near tragedy and Kelsey's lead role in preventing it. Opposition to Kefauver's bill quickly melted away. The 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments completely changed the face of drug regulation and gave the FDA a stricter hand with marketing. Until that time, companies, said Swann, had been “taking considerable liberties when it came to advertising their products.” The new law reassigned control over prescription drug advertising from the FTC to the FDA, which would henceforth require all ads to include a “fair balance” presentation — effectiveness versus precautionary information — and a brief summary of the package insert. And what of thalidomide? The drug that caused 8,000 to 10,000 birth defects worldwide and an untold number of stillbirths is now approved in the U.S. as a cancer treatment, under very strict regulation. 1976 | NAPROSYN The birth of the medical brand persona  Emotion remains the spark with which audiences most identify, in pharma and medical device advertising alike. On the patient side, emotion traces its roots to Medicus' 1980s ad for non-sedating anti­histamine Seldane, one of the first to exploit the DTC channel before the rules were liberalized in 1997. But one brand had forged an emotional persona long earlier: Syntex's Rx analgesic Naprosyn. And it did so entirely on the basis of what used to be called “ethical” promotion — no consumer media or TV. Its promotion debuted by early 1976, months before fellow NSAIDs Nalfon and Tolectin (although Motrin had come out a couple of years earlier), because its first set of ads featured only the package insert and risk disclosure, recalls Lester Barnett. See also: 30 years later, DTC's complicated past still hasn't deterred marketers In fact, restlessness would become a sort of calling card for Naprosyn, as it not only vied for a place in medicine chests but also ushered in the era of medical brand persona. At the time, Barnett was the executive art director at San Francisco agency Barnum Communications, which held the account for Naprosyn. He attests to being “in the room” for a sort of anti-campaign moment: “I fought for ‘we are not doing a campaign, but creating a unique feeling proposition, building a brand personality.'” Naprosyn — Bay Area pharma firm Syntex's version of naproxen sodium — was the drug with which Barnett made his stand, and it became known as “the perpetual teenager.” “That personality went beyond the campaign to become the very essence of the brand for its entire life span,” explained Barnett in a subsequent email. “All campaigns were weighed against the established ‘brand personality.'” His efforts were preceded — and perhaps facilitated — by another important change agent: Herb Lubalin, who moved the pharma advertising world from the dominant Swiss style of the '50s, with little brand differentiation, to campaign individualization via a broad range of typographic and design stylings. See also: Merck's creative archive tells an industry story “Medical advertising could look and sound like advertising. It didn't need to look like medicine anymore,” says Barnett. After establishing its hyperactive persona, Naprosyn continually pushed the enve­lope with new dosages and forms — anything to make news — while competitors clung to reminder advertising. It paved the way for many future brands to make individual names for themselves. Still, Naprosyn remains somewhat of an anomaly by current standards. “Today's business is an introduction business,” says Barnett, who is considered the godfather of branding. “No one supports the brand anymore. Naprosyn kept the perpetual teenager going.” 1987 | AZT  Patient power and the arms race on drugs  Many of the talking points in today's drug-pricing debate echo those when AZT reached the market. Photo credit: SSPL/Getty Images Cost concerns for prescription drugs loom large, and medication remains priced beyond the reach of the sickest patients. Sound familiar? It was the national discourse in 1987. That was the year AZT entered the pharmacopeia as the first treatment shown to lengthen the lives of patients with AIDS. As the only approved drug for the AIDS virus, AZT could fetch a premium price, a fact not lost on marketer Burroughs Wellcome (forerunner to GlaxoSmithKline). “[AZT's] original price was $10,000 a year. It started the arms race on drugs,” notes Michael Weinstein, the longtime HIV/AIDS activist who set up the AIDS Healthcare Foundation that same year. Its price also sparked a new brand of activism, later called “vigilante consumerism” by one consultancy. In 1987, concerned individuals formed Act Up (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power). See also: Why the FDA's view of patient communication evolved over time Act Up staged a Wall Street demonstration to protest profiteering by pharma — especially Burroughs Wellcome — and the Reagan administration's mishandling of the AIDS crisis. Shortly thereafter, the FDA said it would shorten its drug-approval process. A Wall Street sit-in by Act Up two years later led Wellcome to lower AZT's price by 20%. But it didn't end well, because many people who started on AZT in '87 died. Data from the National Center for Health Statistics show deaths in the U.S. due to AIDS climbed from about 13,000 in 1987 to just over 41,000 a year in 1995. It wasn't until 1995, the year following approval of Roche's saquinavir, that the death rate began to fall. Prior to AZT, the sentiment was “do everything possible to get a treatment as soon as possible,” says Weinstein. Patients were taking to the streets demanding fast-track approval for promising therapies and greater access to clinical trials. “It was a relatively new thing to have a patient constituency that involved,” Weinstein observes, especially one like the subsection of people with AIDS, who were mainly successful middle-class people. “They weren't a disenfranchised group.” This patient power forced pharma companies to re-imagine themselves as part of the patient-support continuum. Some, including Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck, and Pfizer, responded with social-responsibility efforts aimed at making HIV treatments more accessible. 1994 | CARDIOLOGY STENTS Medical devices beat pharma to the web Today, nearly every FDA-approved medical device and drug brand has an internet presence. That wasn't always the case, agency execs recall. In 1994, the first commercial-facing healthcare website appeared, and it was for medical device firm Cordis, at the time an independent maker of cardiology and endovascular products like bare-metal stents. That device firms would be quicker than drug companies to use the internet makes sense, says Linda Holliday, who cofounded the agency that did the seminal web work for many device and pharma clients, Philadelphia-based Medical Broadcasting Co. See also: The provider gift ban: The day the tchotchkes died At the time, “the internet wasn't seen as a commercial thing. It was a scientific thing, so researchers in those high-tech businesses — devices more so than drugs — understood it first,” Holliday points out. A 1990s snapshot of Cordis.com (taken after the firm became part of Johnson & Johnson) shows its mission statement, main business lines, and little else. Companies eschewed adding product information. “Corporations never talked to customers as corporations — their business lines or products did,” Holliday explains. “The audience for the corporate people was investors or employees. So pharma companies saw themselves through that lens and websites became digital versions of their corporate HQ.” It was hard for pharma and device companies to even contemplate putting product information on their sites. Take J&J: “Moms in Iowa didn't realize that when they bought baby powder, it was from the same company that made birth control, and this was scary and difficult to handle,” Holliday recalls. According to her, MBC went on to do thousands of web properties for the likes of J&J, Merck, Pfizer, and others. As for Cordis, J&J picked it up in 1996 and then it changed hands again, last October. Its site is now merged into that of Cardinal Health's. 2012 | ZALTRAP Moneyball comes to healthcare Patients compelled Burroughs Wellcome to lower the price of AIDS drug AZT in the 1980s. A couple of decades later, a group of physicians refusing to prescribe colon-cancer drug Zaltrap played agitator. Dr. Leonard Saltz, head of GI oncology at Memo­rial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and head of its formulary committee, put it well at last May's MM&M Transforming Healthcare Conference. “Zaltrap was an interesting situation,” he recalled, “because from my perspective as a clinician — from our perspective as an institution — it offered absolutely zero benefit over a competitor at double the price. And therefore it's half the value.” That competitor was Genentech's Avastin, and the rival biologic offered similar expected clinical outcomes for colorectal-cancer patients. Saltz was one of three MSKCC oncologists who explained the unflattering economic comparison in the opinion pages of The New York Times soon after Zaltrap's August 2012 approval. See also: Power to the payers: PBMs leave behind a trail of tiers A few months later, Sanofi effectively halved the price of the drug, whose initial cost was $11,000 a month. It was a “watershed moment,” an insurance executive told the Times, both in terms of the size of an oncology drug's price cut and of oncologists saying “enough is enough.” Since then, the pressure on companies to meet provider and payer demands for such evidence has only increased, driven by Gilead's decision in 2013 to price Sovaldi at $1,000 a pill. Meanwhile, predatory pricing by the likes of Martin Shkreli (2015) and EpiPen's manufacturer (2016), both on off-patent products, have again roused public ire. Some are calling drug pricing the healthcare issue of our time. Have we just come full circle, back to the '60s, when Sen. Kefauver trained a spotlight on drug price increases? Or to the charged atmosphere of the '80s, when the AIDS community balked at AZT's cost? One thing seems certain, says Dr. Saltz — the “financial toxicity” of an agent is playing an increasing part in how patients value drugs. “The idea that we can just hide this under the rug, which has been very comfortable for the past 50 years, is no longer tenable,” he says. “The sooner that those of us in the business of developing treatments understand this, the better off we will be.” From the October 2016 Issue of MMM » Share this content: facebook twitter linkedin google Comments Print Similar Articles Leadership Exchange: How Do We Get Beyond the Pill?

The FDA quickly imposed a two-year moratorium on using brand names in DTC ads. Illustration courtesy of MediciGlobal.  Liz Moench was there at the very beginning. At 23, she joined Boots, a Louisiana-based upstart known to few people outside the pharma universe. She knew relatively little about the industry herself. During her job interview with John Bryer, then Boots' president, she innocently asked why patients weren't viewed as the company's target customers. That wasn't the type of question that pharma marketing execs were asking back then, though, in retrospect, it's the type of question that should've been asked far sooner. “It was radical to come in from the outside,” Moench says, referring to her previous gig in TV advertising. “And it was radical to have a senior executive who was really open-minded in his thinking. [Bryer] was a real maverick.” See also: DTC: The first 10 years Within months, Moench had played a leading role in creating the healthcare industry's first DTC TV ad. Here's her story, as well as those of two other DTC titans, Francis Gace and Steve Andrzejewski. 1983: THE FIRST DTC SPOT On May 13, 1983, the first broadcast television commercial in the United States for a prescription drug aired for anti-inflammatory drug Rufen featuring then Boots president John Bryer. Moench's ad, for Rufen, an anti-inflammatory drug, aired in Tampa on May 19, 1983. It targeted an audience that was a “good representation of the demographics of the U.S. at the time,” Moench recalls: existing patients who already knew about ibuprofen. The spot made no representations that it was intended for treating arthritis. Per the advice of the Boots legal team, the ad focused on pricing, with Bryer himself noting that Rufen was 20% cheaper than competitor Motrin. “We didn't say what [Rufen] was for. We didn't talk about it being better than another drug, or any of its benefits,” Moench continues. “By running a price ad, we didn't need to go into the issue of the package insert.” See also: How the FDA Advanced DTC Advertising Boots timed the Rufen ad to coincide with a front-page marketing feature that ran every Thursday in The Wall Street Journal. The drugmaker gave the newspaper an exclusive interview about the ad, for reasons that transcended marketing. “That was our way of notifying the FDA,” Moench reveals. “We didn't tell them the date we were launching. We'd had our meetings with them, but they wouldn't tell us if they would take action or not. And the law had no specific regulations governing consumer or DTC ­advertising, which is why we ran a newspaper [ad] with the full package insert.” Within two days of the ad's airing, the FDA sent Boots a cease and desist letter. It also imposed a two-year moratorium on DTC advertising using brand names. But the cat was out of the bag. See also: Celebrity pharma ads: Opportunity or PR disaster? Four years later, as the executive director of public affairs at Ciba-Geigy (today part of Novartis), Moench helped recruit what is thought to be the first celebrity spokesperson for a prescription drug: legendary New York Yankee Mickey Mantle, who spoke on behalf of prescription pain relief drug Voltaren. “We had to meet Rep. John Dingell, who was part of the oversight committee looking at marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry, because Mickey got onto Today,” Moench recalls. “When Mickey thought the interview was over, he said, ‘You know, this drug works great for hangovers.' So millions of people heard this. I'm sitting in the holding room going, ‘My career's over.'” 1992: THE SUPER BOWL Marion Merrell Dow's Super Bowl ad for smoking-cessation patch Nicoderm cost about $1 million for 30 seconds of airtime. In the wake of the FDA's two-year moratorium on branded DTC advertising, the industry was skittish. Bold moves were few and far between — until Marion Merrell Dow launched the industry's first Super Bowl ad, in January 1992, featuring smoking-cessation patch Nicoderm. “We knew in the Super Bowl audience, which was going to be anywhere between 80 and 100 million eyeballs, there would be a fair number of smokers,” recalls Francis Gace, cofounder of Lewis & Gace, the agency that worked on the ad. “Plus any ad on the Super Bowl got talked about. We could anticipate a fair amount of word of mouth, particularly if we were the first on the market.” See also: DTC Report 2016: Gut Check To skirt the requirement of a time-consuming full disclosure, which included warnings, side effects, and benefits, the drugmaker could only name the product and say what it was, not show the patch itself. The spot featured two men taking an escalator at an airport. One man said, "Nicoderm." The other responded, "Yes, it's a patch." “That's about all we could say in the entire commercial,” Gace adds. “But we figured that we'd already marketed Nicorette. The name similarity was close enough. We figured it would be clear to anyone who was watching that we were talking about smoking cessation.” The ad cost about $1 million for 30 seconds of airtime. Habitrol may have outspent Nicoderm in detailing ($34 million to $19 million), sampling ($9.6 million to $4.5 million), and consumer advertising ($34 million to $23 million), yet Nicoderm became the number one prescription brand among smoking-cessation patches. Schering-Plough broke DTC ground in 1997 with "Ask your doctor about Claritin." The line still resonates. Photo courtesy of Ogilvy CommonHealth Worldwide.  1997: DTC BUDGETS SKYROCKET In 1997, the FDA issued draft guidance allowing pharma companies to advertise on TV without the brief summary that took up so much print space as long as they directed viewers to a magazine ad, a toll-free phone number, or a website for such information. Schering-Plough, which manufactured allergy treatment Claritin, jumped on the opportunity (Schering was acquired by Merck in 2009). With its renowned Blue Skies campaign, created by CommonHealth's Thomas Ferguson Advertising, the marketing team upgraded from unbranded reminder ads to branded spots. Blue Skies evolved into a multichannel campaign that included radio, print, and TV ads, all advising consumers to “ask your doctor about Claritin.” “A lot of people were ask­ing, ‘Is this something you should do or not?'” says Steve Andrzejewski, who worked on that launch as VP of marketing for S-P. “‘Ask your doctor about Claritin,' without claims, raised awareness of the name Claritin and the number one question from people seeing the ad was, ‘What is Claritin?' It ended up educating customers that there are alternatives that wouldn't make them sleepy.” 2016: THE EVOLUTION OF DTC  Looking back at the ­evolution of DTC advertising, Moench, now president and CEO of MediciGlobal, reckons that the groundwork for change was laid in the 1980s. “Back in the '70s, patients did what doctors told them,” Moench quips. “In the 1980s, environmentalists fueled change.” To help low-income and minority communities situated near factories and landfills, the environmentalist movement pushed for the Emergency Planning and Right to Know Act of 1986, designed to hold corporations accountable for the release of toxic chemicals in populated areas. During the same period, AIDS activists sought to involve patients in the regulatory process, HMOs emerged to allow consumers to choose their health plans, and the notion of a patient's right to understand gave birth to patient package inserts (PPIs), Moench explains. See also: 4A's announces plans to defend DTC “So you had these four movements — AIDS, DTC, HMOs with choice, and PPIs with understanding,” says Moench. “And that's now been picked up in the 2000s by rare-disease groups. We talk about patient-centricity now, but it was happening in the '80s. “Today's ads are lifestyle-based and aspirational,” she continues. “There seem to be a lot of themes about being with family, being able to do things that are active, being able to function at your job.” Celebrity spokespeople continue to be widely used, but Andrzejewski, now an adjunct professor of health economics at NYU's Stern School of Business, notes a recent rise in the use of animation and caricatures. All three execs point out, with some degree of amazement, how deeply DTC ads are now woven into the fabric of industry marketing. “In the days of Rufen and Nicoderm, [ads for] Viagra and similar products were probably far from anyone's mind,” Gace says. See also: A ranking of 2015's DTC Ads Adds Andrzejewski, “Now there's a higher comfort level on the pharma company side and there's a clearer path of what to do with the FDA.” At the same time, the DTC space has gotten crowded. And much to the consternation of TV advertising loyalists, budgets are now spread across a range of channels. “In the past, there weren't as many companies involved, especially in TV advertising,” Andrzejewski notes. “Today, getting the message to the intended audience is much more important because there are so many messages out there.” 2017 AND BEYOND The value of DTC advertising continues to be a contentious topic. The AMA called for a ban on DTC advertising of drugs and devices in late 2015, linking it to inflated costs. More recently, a New York Times op-ed and a JAMA editorial criticized Bristol-Myers Squibb's DTC ads for cancer med Opdivo, characterizing them as misleading. DTC boosters say that the ads, along with social media, have helped patients become better informed while allowing them to play a more active role in their health decision-making. But Moench notes that DTC advertising is not as patient-centric as it should be. Similarly, Andrzejewski says more effective hypertargeting is critical to keep patients engaged. “Healthcare plans are playing a bigger role, and those systems are going to have something to say, so it's important for people to be very targeted,” he explains. “Once you have the demographics, it makes the advertising spends that much more efficient because you can target them that much more specifically.” From the October 2016 Issue of MMM » Share this content: facebook twitter linkedin google Comments Print Related Articles Industry criticizes FDA's proposed DTC studies 2015 DTC spending: All the data in one place Lobbyists argue DTC ad tax deduction may be a casualty of reform Larry Dobrow on the Worst DTC ads of 2015 Drugmakers go to DTC to promote IBS drugs Another physician group raises concerns about DTC Related Topics Advertising DTC Patients Celebrity FDA Marketing Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

These drugmakers are now increasingly straddling both sides of the courtroom, too, protecting their high-price products from biosimilars - biopharmaceutical drugs with the treatment properties of medicines they seek to mimic - while simultaneously challenging rivals' patent claims. Biologics, manufactured in living cells, then extracted and purified, are more complex than traditional medicines and cannot be copied with precision, and so their knock-off versions are called biosimilars instead of generics. The allure of biosimilars is clear, with insurers and other payers counting on the steep discounts. U.S. pharmacy benefit managers are already trimming brand-name drugs from their rosters. {nL2N1BY0AZ] With Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez predicting biosimilar discounts of up to 75 percent, in part based on developments in Europe, makers of innovative drugs are fighting tooth and nail to protect their higher-priced products for as long as possible. [ For instance, AbbVie has sued in Delaware claiming patent protection for its arthritis drug Humira, the world's best-selling prescription medicine, until at least 2022 as it seeks to delay an Amgen replica that won U.S. approval last week. Meanwhile, Amgen has gone to another U.S. federal court seeking to protect its own arthritis medicine, Enbrel, from a Novartis biosimilar until 2029. With lawsuits pitting Big Pharma against Big Pharma piling up, lawyers said the legal landscape has gotten a lot more complex. "One of the biggest surprises has been the number of innovator biopharma companies, like Amgen, now developing biosimilars to compete with the products of other innovator companies," said Don Ware, an expert on biosimilars at U.S. law firm Foley Hoag in Boston. "This creates conflicts for law firms like ours, because suddenly the clients we advise are adverse to each other," Ware said. "And it makes it hard for the companies to retain top outside counsel without having to give them conflict waivers." Sanofi, Merck, Eli Lilly, Pfizer , Johnson & Johnson and Biogen are also embroiled in lawsuits over biosimilars. For a Factbox on major suits see: NOT BITTER ENEMIES Even so, some analysts say the lawsuits are business as usual and are unlikely to spill over into other areas, including research partnerships. Novartis and Amgen may be at each other's throats in court over the Swiss drugmaker's Enbrel copy, but the two are still cooperating on a drug for migraines. "It's not like these companies are bitter enemies," Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said. "These court cases are simply the last resort of original drug makers to wring a few more months or a year of exclusivity from their blockbusters." Conflicts pitting big drugmakers against each other may have been inevitable after Europe in 2006 and the United States in 2010 created separate biosimilar approval rules. After all, Big Pharma's financial clout and expertise made large, sophisticated drugmakers the natural candidates to manufacture complex biosimilar copies that cost hundreds of millions to bring to market, far more than for generic off-patent copies of simpler, small molecule drugs. Some smaller companies and generics makers have jettisoned biosimilar programmes after originally underestimating hurdles to entry, Richard Francis, head of Novartis's Sandoz division that makes biosimilars, said earlier this year. Just this week, Shire abandoned two biosimilar candidate drugs that accompanied its Baxalta takeover, copies of Amgen's Enbrel and AbbVie's Humira, to focus on rare diseases. "The realisation of what it's going to take to stay in this market and be successful has led to a change in the landscape and the players in it," Francis said.

The constant itch, to say nothing of the disfigurement, can be so unbearable that many patients consider suicide. There has never been a safe and effective treatment. On October 1, the results of two large clinical trials of a new drug offered hope to the estimated 1.6 million adult Americans with an uncontrolled moderate to severe form of the disease, atopic dermatitis, which is a type of eczema. Most patients who got the active drug, dupilumab, instead of a placebo reported that the itching began to wane within two weeks and was gone in a few months, as their skin began to clear. Nearly 40% of participants who got the drug saw all or almost all of their rash disappear. For some, relief was almost instantaneous. “I knew immediately I was on the drug” and not the placebo, Daniela Velasco, an event planner in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, said. Within a couple of weeks, the ugly red rash that had covered 90% of her body was almost gone. Even better, she said, “for the first time I didn’t feel any itch at all.” The drug blocks two specific molecules of the immune system that are overproduced in patients with this and some other allergic diseases. The only side effects were a slight increase in conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the outer membrane of the eye, and swelling at the injection site. “This is a landmark study,” said Dr Mark Boguniewicz, an atopic dermatitis expert at National Jewish Health and University of Colorado School of Medicine who was not involved with the study. “For us in atopic dermatitis we are entering a new era.” The studies, lasting 16 weeks and involving nearly 1,400 people, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr George D Yancopoulos, the president and chief scientific officer at Regeneron, which, in partnership with Sanofi, makes the drug, said he expects the Food and Drug Administration to rule on dupilumab by March 29, 2017. The drug’s brand name will be Dupixent. The agency has given the drug breakthrough status, which provides expedited development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. Yancopoulos declined to speculate on dupilumab’s price, saying only that it will be “consistent with the value of the drug.” It is a biologic, the most expensive type of drug, and is injected every two weeks. Atopic dermatitis experts said they have longed for a safe and highly effective treatment. In desperation, some prescribed other drugs off-label, like powerful immunosuppressants or high doses of steroids, which are far from ideal because even if they helped, their side effects can be severe — kidney failure with immunosuppressants, bone loss and even psychotic breaks with high-dose steroids. Patients are miserable, Boguniewicz said. “Our patients and families haven’t slept through the night not for days or weeks but for months or years.” Many doctors provide no treatments other than perhaps creams and ointments that do not stop the itching or soothe the red and weeping rash, said Dr Jonathan I Silverberg of Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and a principal investigator in one of the studies. Many sufferers can relate to the plight of the defence lawyer played by John Turturro in the HBO series “The Night Of.” He suffers from by atopic dermatitis that started on his legs and his feet and later spread to his neck and head. Like so many patients, he tries treatment after treatment — bleach baths, covering the rash in Crisco and wrapping it with plastic wrap, steroids, Chinese medicine. He scratches it with chopsticks and disgusts people near him. But all to no avail. Such experiences explain the excitement over the new drug, although researchers say they would like to see longer term data. “What we are seeing are some really impressive efficacy numbers,” Silverberg said. “But efficacy alone is not enough. It is the safety profile that is the real key. Everything we are seeing really looks great.” Dr Jon M Hanifin, a professor of dermatology at Oregon Health and Science University and founder of the National Eczema Association, agreed. While not a principal investigator in the study, Hanifin did oversee the care of some patients enrolled in it. “It’s wonderful,” he said. “We walk in the room and patients are smiling. These patients are the worst of the worst. Their life was destroyed.” Yancopoulos was inspired in part to develop the drug because his father had severe atopic dermatitis, which he developed shortly after he got lung cancer at age 70. “More so than the cancer and the chemo, this rash and its horrible itch started dominating his life and ruining its quality,” Yancopoulos said. “Here’s a guy with Stage IIIB lung cancer — basically a death sentence — and he is more concerned and miserable about his skin and his itch.” Curing the itch One participant in the trial, Lisa Tannebaum, a 53-year-old harpist in Stanford, Connecticut, was so thrilled that she wrote a letter to Regeneron suggesting they use her before and after photographs in advertisements. She developed a severe form of the disease 14 years ago and tried everything imaginable in conventional and alternative medicine without relief — specialised diets, immunosuppressive drugs, special clothing, bleach baths. She even had the gold fillings removed from her teeth on the theory that they may be causing an allergic response, but to no avail. “It was like every day I had poison ivy and fire ants on myself,” she said. “You don’t sleep at all. You can’t go out, you have staph infections all the time,” because the skin’s protective barrier is broken by the rash. “I couldn’t drive my kids to school because the itching was so bad I couldn’t put my hands on the steering wheel.” Now, she is performing again and will be playing her harp at Carnegie Hall on October 30. Herb Bull, 71, a retired Merck scientist in Westfield, New Jersey, had mild atopic dermatitis for years until three years ago, when it took a turn for the worse. The rash covered his entire body. Sleep was impossible, itching a constant torment. Even walking was difficult. “He had weeping lesions all over his body,” said his doctor, Dr Emma Guttman-Yassky, a principal investigator in the trial and professor of dermatology and immunology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. “I thought I might as well give up and die,” Bull said. It took months for the drug to work, he said, but when it did, the change was miraculous. His rash and the itching went away. The new drug, Bull said, “saved my life.” Go to Top Tweet Videos Fridge of kindness in Bengaluru Demonetisation hits farmers hard, say 'no money... Exchange limit reduced to Rs. 2000 from...

The constant itch, to say nothing of the disfigurement, can be so unbearable that many patients consider suicide. There has never been a safe and effective treatment. On Saturday, the results of two large clinical trials of a new drug offered hope to those with an uncontrolled moderate to severe form of the disease, atopic dermatitis, which is a type of eczema. Most patients who got the active drug, dupilumab, instead of a placebo reported that the itching began to wane within two weeks and was gone in a few months, as their skin began to clear. Nearly 40 per cent of participants getting the drug saw all or almost all of their rash disappear. For some, relief was almost instantaneous. Related Content Protective compound added to skin cells helps body fight eczema: scientists "I knew immediately I was on the drug [and not the placebo]," Daniela Velasco, an event planner in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, said. Within a couple of weeks, the ugly red rash that had covered 90 per cent of her body was almost gone. Even better, she said, "For the first time I didn't feel any itch at all." Advertisement Before entering the trial, Ms Velasco, 36, had seen 40 doctors about the disease and tried dozens of drugs and treatments, to no avail. To participate in the study, she spent more than $US95,000 to fly to New York on a regular basis. She realised she might get a placebo but also knew that when the study ended everyone, including the placebo patients, would be able get the drug if the trial was successful. The drug blocks two specific molecules of the immune system that are overproduced in patients with this and some other allergic diseases. The only side effects were a slight increase in conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the outer membrane of the eye, and swelling at the injection site. "This is a landmark study," said Mark Boguniewicz, an atopic dermatitis expert at National Jewish Health and University of Colorado School of Medicine who was not involved with the study. "For us in atopic dermatitis, we are entering a new era." The studies, lasting 16 weeks and involving nearly 1400 people, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. George Yancopoulos, the president and chief scientific officer at Regeneron, which, in partnership with Sanofi, makes the drug, said he expected the Food and Drug Administration to rule on dupilumab by March 29, 2017. The drug's brand name will be Dupixent. The agency has given the drug breakthrough status, which provides expedited development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. Dr Yancopoulos declined to speculate on dupilumab's price, saying only that it would be "consistent with the value of the drug". It is a biologic, the most expensive type of drug, and is injected every two weeks. Atopic dermatitis experts said they have longed for a safe and highly effective treatment. In desperation, some prescribed other drugs off-label, like powerful immunosuppressants or high doses of steroids, which are far from ideal because, even if they helped, their side effects can be severe - kidney failure with immunosuppressants, bone loss and even psychotic breaks with high-dose steroids. Patients are miserable, Dr Boguniewicz said. "Our patients and families haven't slept through the night not for days or weeks but for months or years." Many doctors provide no treatments other than perhaps creams and ointments that do not stop the itching or soothe the red and weeping rash, said Jonathan Silverberg of Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine and a principal investigator in one of the studies. Many sufferers can relate to the plight of the defence lawyer played by John Turturro in the HBO series The Night Of.  He suffers from by atopic dermatitis that started on his legs and his feet and later spread to his neck and head. Like so many patients, he tries treatment after treatment - bleach baths, covering the rash in Crisco and wrapping it with plastic wrap, steroids, Chinese medicine. He scratches it with chopsticks and disgusts people near him. But all to no avail. Such experiences explain the excitement over the new drug, although researchers say they would like to see longer term data. "What we are seeing are some really impressive efficacy numbers," Dr Silverberg said. "But efficacy alone is not enough. It is the safety profile that is the real key. Everything we are seeing really looks great." Jon Hanifin, a professor of dermatology at Oregon Health and Science University and founder of the National Eczema Association, agreed. While not a principal investigator in the study, Dr Hanifin did oversee the care of some patients enrolled in it. "It's wonderful," he said. "We walk in the room and patients are smiling. These patients are the worst of the worst. Their life was destroyed." Dr Yancopoulos was inspired in part to develop the drug because his father had severe atopic dermatitis, which he developed shortly after he got lung cancer at the age of 70. "More so than the cancer and the chemo, this rash and its horrible itch started dominating his life and ruining its quality," Dr Yancopoulos said. "Here's a guy with Stage IIIB lung cancer - basically a death sentence - and he is more concerned and miserable about his skin and his itch." One participant in the trial, Lisa Tannebaum, a 53-year-old harpist in Stanford, Connecticut, was so thrilled that she wrote a letter to Regeneron suggesting they use her before and after photographs in advertisements. She developed a severe form of the disease 14 years ago and tried everything imaginable in conventional and alternative medicine without relief - specialised diets, immunosuppressive drugs, special clothing, bleach baths. She even had the gold fillings removed from her teeth on the theory that they may be causing an allergic response, but to no avail. "It was like every day I had poison ivy and fire ants on myself," she said. "You don't sleep at all. You can't go out, you have staph infections all the time," because the skin's protective barrier is broken by the rash. "I couldn't drive my kids to school because the itching was so bad. I couldn't put my hands on the steering wheel." Now, she is performing again and will be playing her harp at Carnegie Hall on October 30. Herb Bull, 71, a retired Merck scientist in Westfield, New Jersey, had mild atopic dermatitis for years until three years ago, when it took a turn for the worse. The rash covered his entire body. Sleep was impossible, itching a constant torment. Even walking was difficult. "He had weeping lesions all over his body," said his doctor, Emma Guttman-Yassky, a principal investigator in the trial and professor of dermatology and immunology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. "I thought I might as well give up and die," Mr Bull said. It took months for the drug to work, he said, but when it did, the change was miraculous. His rash and the itching went away. The new drug, he said, "saved my life". New York Times Advertisement Advertisement Most Popular Why the Veronicas latest video is groundbreaking Depression: does it originate in the immune system?
