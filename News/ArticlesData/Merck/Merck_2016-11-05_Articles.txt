(MarketWatch) -- Big pharmaceutical companies have poured more than $100 million into defeating a state referendum in California that seeks to control soaring drug prices by limiting how much state agencies pay for the prescription drugs they buy on behalf of patients. In a classic “stop hitting yourself” move, the pharmaceutical companies are running TV ads and sending endless mailers saying they are concerned that the measure could backfire by forcing the companies to raise drug prices for veterans and other patients in order to preserve their bottom line. Their real concern is the possibility that this proposition could start a domino effect; lowering the prices that state agencies around the country are willing to pay for drugs. The pharmaceutical companies are spending big to defend their profits, and dressing it up as a defense of veterans. But for pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders, profit always comes before patients, or veterans. Proposition 61, which is on the ballot in California on Tuesday, is the most expensive ballot measure in the state this year, and the “No on Prop 61” campaign has broken the record for spending by one side in a campaign. The proposition would prohibit state agencies from paying more than the price paid by the federal Department of Veterans Affairs, which uses its buying power to negotiate lower prices with the companies. Supporters say the proposition could help combat skyrocketing drug prices. The drug companies say it will backfire, but quietly avoid the fact that it’s up to them whether it does so or not. Opinion Journal: Can the Polls Be Trusted?(4:21) Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Doug Rivers explains the art and science of presidential polling. Photo credit: Getty Images. John Lechleiter, the CEO of Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, -0.84%  , told investors last month that “we’re fighting that tooth and nail.” Lilly has contributed more than $4.5 million to fight Prop 61. An industry publication said if Prop 61 were to pass it would lead more state governments and even private health plans to demand the discounts, saying it would be “a pricing disaster for the entire U.S. drug industry.” The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, an international nonprofit and the largest provider of HIV/AIDS medical care in the U.S., is the sponsor of Prop 61, also known as the California Drug Price Relief Act. The “Yes on Prop 61” campaign has raised almost $15 million, more than 99% of that funding coming from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. But they are being outspent 7-to-1 by the opposition. The opposition campaign is officially listed as “No on Prop 61 -- Californians Against the Deceptive Rx Proposition, a coalition of veterans, doctors, patient advocates, seniors, taxpayers, and members of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America with major funding by Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer, Inc. and other companies.” The campaign has raised $109 million, exclusively from the pharmaceutical industry, not a dollar coming from veterans, doctors, patient advocates, seniors, or taxpayers. The “No” campaign has also collected endorsements from medical associations, labor unions, community groups, and many veterans’ organizations. Some of the endorsements, like that of two prominent LGBT groups in San Francisco, have been criticized after it was revealed they each received $5,000 from the “No” campaign. Advertisements funded by “No on Prop 61” are running during almost every commercial break on television in the days leading up to the election. The ads feature a concerned veteran warning Californians that passage of Proposition 61 could actually increase prescription costs, but supporters of Prop 61 see the ads as a threat more than a good-hearted warning. “This is not a prediction; it’s a pure threat,” said Garry South, the lead strategist for the “Yes on Prop 61” campaign. “If they have to sell drugs to the state of California at a lower price, they’re going to try to make up for it and keep their obscene profits high by trying to screw everyone else in California.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who brought discussions of drug prices to the national stage during his presidential campaign, has become the face of the “Yes” campaign. Sanders endorsed the proposition and is featured prominently in “Yes on Prop 61” messaging, saying the proposition would be “a real blow against this greedy [pharmaceutical] industry.” Prop 61 is a record-breaking race in a record-breaking year for ballot-measure spending. Campaigns supporting or opposing the 17 propositions on California’s ballot have spent almost half a billion dollars so far this year. Who’s funding the opposition to Prop 61? Merck & Co. Inc . $9.4 million Pfizer Inc. $9.4 million Johnson & Johnson $9.3 million Amgen Inc. $7.6 million Abbvie Inc. $6.9 million Sanofi-Aventis US LLC $6.7 million Astra Zeneca Pharma LP $6.1 million Allergan USA Inc. $5.8 million Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. $4.7 million Glaxosmithkline $4.5 million And 23 more drug companies and the pharma trade group, for a grand total of $109 million Pharmaceutical giants Merck MRK, -0.66%  and Pfizer PFE, -0.64%  are the two largest contributors to the “No” campaign, spending $9.4 million each, followed closely by Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -1.58%  , which has kicked in $9.3 million. Thirty-three pharmaceutical companies have funded the “No” campaign, along with the industry group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). While more than 99% of the “Yes” campaign’s funding has come from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, they also had over 500 contributions from individuals of $100 or less, and the California Nurses Association PAC gave $55,929. Endorsements for the “Yes” campaign include former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), many local Democratic Party chapters, and labor unions. Kathy Fairbanks, a spokesperson for the “No on Prop 61” campaign said that, despite the intention of supporters, “Prop 61 isn’t going to work. It’s going to backfire, and harm patients in California, and veterans, and families.” Fairbanks, and opponents of Prop 61 point to a report from California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office about the “highly uncertain” fiscal impact. But the same LAO report also states that the fiscal impact on the state “could range from relatively little effect to significant annual savings,” and that “potential drug manufacturer responses limit potential savings,” clarifying that the real predictor of drug prices if Prop 61 passes will be the response from the pharmaceutical industry.

Nigeria’s federal health officials joined local dignitaries and officers of The Carter Center and other organizations in Gidan Gimba, Karu LGA, Nasarawa State, Nigeria, to celebrate the achievement. The observance was held in Nigeria because 42 percent of the Carter Center-assisted treatments have been administered through numerous Center health programs there. The next largest number of NTD drugs has been distributed in Ethiopia, to combat trachoma, river blindness, and lymphatic filariasis. "The Carter Center health programs have pioneered eradication, elimination, and control of neglected tropical diseases for more than a quarter-century," said Ambassador (ret.) Mary Ann Peters, the Carter Center’s chief executive officer. “We have seen, time and again, that people at the grass-roots level can improve their own lives dramatically when they have access to the appropriate tools and knowledge. Among the most important of these tools are safe and effective donated medicines, together with health education and community ownership of the distribution process.” Founded by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, The Carter Center partners with ministries of health and community volunteers to distribute medication and health education aimed at eliminating river blindness, blinding trachoma, and lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), and controlling schistosomiasis and intestinal worms. Nigeria’s Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health, Mrs. Binda Adamu Bello, welcomed Peters, along with Dr. Dean Sienko, the Center’s vice president of health programs; Dr. Frank Richards, director of the Center’s river blindness, lymphatic filariasis, and schistosomiasis programs; Craig Withers, senior director of international support; and Dr. Emmanuel Miri, Nigeria country representative for The Carter Center. Also on hand for the celebration were former Nigeria Head of State General Yakubu Gowon; Sir Emeka Offor, Founder of the Sir Emeka Offor Foundation and Carter Center’s Special Emissary for River Blindness; former ambassador Howard Jeter; Ben Nwobi, resident program advisor for RTI International and the USAID’s ENVISION project in Nigeria; Michael T. Harvey, USAID mission director; Dr. Rex Mpazanje, acting World Health Organization country representative; and Chris Ogoshi, NGDO Coalition Chairman. “The Federal Ministry of Health is pleased to be part of this celebration of our long and successful partnership with The Carter Center,” Bello said. “The whole of Nigeria’s productivity is affected when some suffer. The people of Nigeria deserve the best health possible and, together with the villages and our other faithful partners, we are achieving it.” To commemorate the half-billion treatments with which The Carter Center has assisted, Bello administered a dose of ivermectin, used to treat river blindness (onchocerciasis); Peters administered a dose of praziquantel, which treats schistosomiasis; and community drug distributor Mr. Yusuf Maikeffi gave a dose of albendazole, which controls intestinal worms (soil-transmitted helminths). All three medications can be administered together safely and effectively. Jude Musa, a 13-year-old boy who loves football and drumming, swallowed all three treatments with a sip of water and a smile. Jude said he previously had blood in his urine, a symptom of schistosomiasis, but it returned to normal after he started receiving praziquantel every year from Maikeffi. "If you take this medicine, it will help you," Jude, one of six children of a retired police officer, told his neighbors. He said some of his friends had been infected with worms, but got better with Maikeffi's care. In his role as Gidan Gimba's trained community drug distributor (CDD), Maikeffi serves about 200 people. Some have reported improved vision, and he’s observed a reduction in vision issues in his village since he began distributing treatment. He attributes the improvement to a reduction in river blindness. "I enjoy being a CDD because it is important to me to help protect my community," said Maikeffi, the father of six children, ranging in age from 5 to 20. Maikeffi is one of 80,000 community-based volunteers and health workers dedicated to improving health in the Carter Center-assisted areas of Nigeria. Ivermectin is donated under the brand name Mectizan® by pharmaceutical company Merck (MSD). Albendazole is donated by GSK. Praziquantel is donated by Merck KGaA. The 500 million treatments also include programs that address trachoma (azithromycin, donated by Pfizer) and lymphatic filariasis (a combination treatment of Mectizan and albendazole). About half of the 500 million doses being celebrated have gone toward combatting the effects and spread of river blindness. Together with the ministries of health, the Center already has helped to eliminate the parasitic disease from Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Guatemala, as well as key locations in Sudan and Uganda. The Carter Center’s river blindness program in Nigeria operates a state-of-the-art laboratory at its headquarters in Jos to support national onchocerciasis elimination assessments. The Center also supports the work of the Nigerian National Onchocerciasis Elimination Committee, which advises the federal minister of health. Blinding trachoma and lymphatic filariasis were recently eliminated from this part of Nigeria by Carter Center-assisted programs, further evidence of the effectiveness of the efforts being celebrated. Additionally, Nigeria, once the most Guinea worm-endemic country in the world, eliminated that disease and achieved WHO certification in 2013. The Center and partners are nearing completion of the goal to globally eradicate Guinea worm disease; this is being accomplished by behavioral change, without medication or vaccine. About the Diseases Lymphatic filariasis is caused by thin worms transmitted to humans by the bites of mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions. These worms live in, and cause blockage of, the lymphatic system that normally returns fluids in human extremities to the circulatory system. This blockage results in fluid collection in the tissues (most commonly the legs and genitalia), severe swelling, and periodic fevers from bacterial infections of the collected fluids. A long-standing infection with lymphatic filariasis results in an irreversible condition called elephantiasis, in which there is a marked enlargement and hardening of the skin so that it resembles that of an elephant. Approximately 120 million people are infected by lymphatic filariasis, and 1.1 billion are at risk of infection. The Carter Center LF Elimination Program currently operates in Ethiopia and Nigeria. In addition, The Carter Center's Hispaniola Initiative works with the ministries of health in Haiti and the Dominican Republic to accelerate the elimination of malaria and lymphatic filariasis from the countries' shared island, Hispaniola. Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is a parasitic disease that afflicts the rural poor. It is caused by a worm that is spread from person to person by the bites of Simulium black flies that breed in rapid-flowing rivers and streams. The disease can cause intense itching, eye damage, and irreversible blindness, reducing an individual's ability to work and learn. Worldwide, an estimated 120 million people are at risk of being infected and 270,000 have been blinded by the disease, mostly in Africa. In addition to Africa and Latin America, onchocerciasis also affects Yemen. As many as 50 million Nigerians are at risk of contracting river blindness. The Carter Center also works with the governments of Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Brazil, and Venezuela to eliminate transmission of the disease. Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharziasis or "snail fever," is a waterborne parasitic infection that damages internal organs. The most common symptoms are blood in urine and/or feces and an enlarged liver, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weakness, and anemia. In terms of socioeconomic and public health impact, schistosomiasis is second only to malaria as the most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries. Nigeria is the most endemic country for schistosomiasis, with approximately 20 million people — mostly children — needing treatment. The Carter Center’s Schistosomiasis Control Program operates in seven states in Nigeria. Trachoma is a bacterial eye infection found in poor, isolated communities lacking basic hygiene, clean water, and adequate sanitation. It is easily spread from person to person through eye-seeking flies, and by hands and clothes. Repeated infection leads to scarring and inward turning of the eyelid — a very painful condition called trichiasis — eventually causing blindness if left untreated. Trachoma can be found in over 50 countries, most in Africa and the Middle East, and a few countries in the Americas and Asia. Globally, 200 million people are at risk for trachoma, and over 3.2 million are at immediate risk for blindness from trichiasis. The Carter Center’s Trachoma Control Program operates in Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda. In 2008, the Center helped Ghana eliminate blinding trachoma. Partners Many generous foundations, corporations, governments, and individuals have made these accomplishments possible through the years, including major support from Abbott; Alwaleed Philanthropies; BASF Corporation; Chevron Corporation; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Carlos Slim Foundation; Clarke Mosquito Control; GSK; Conrad N. Hilton Foundation; Izumi Foundation; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Johnson & Johnson; John J. Moores; A.G. Leventis Foundation; Lions Clubs International Foundation; Merck; Merck KGaA; OPEC Fund for International Development; Pfizer Inc; RTI International; Sightsavers; Sir Emeka Offor Foundation; and United States Agency for International Development. Key implementing partners include the ministries of health in endemic countries, World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), UNICEF, the Task Force for Global Health, UNICEF, and various university partners. In Nigeria the Center currently enjoys major support from RTI/ENVISION, USAID, and the Sir Emeka Offor Foundation. **Contact: **Emily Staub, Emily.Staub@cartercenter.org Ongoing Primary countryWorld Other countries Brazil Colombia Ethiopia Ghana Guatemala Mali Niger Nigeria South Sudan Sudan Uganda Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) Theme: Contributions Health Content format: News and Press Release Language: English Home Updates Countries Disasters Topics Organizations Jobs Training About Us Help ReliefWeb Informing humanitarians worldwide.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/ By Brendan Pierson (Reuters) - After a $67.5 million jury verdict against Johnson & Johnson on Oct. 27 marked its third straight trial defeat in an onslaught of lawsuits claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer, the company is hoping to reverse the trend by having the cases heard in a different court. All three awards, totaling around $195 million, were handed down in state court in St. Louis, Missouri, with the same judge presiding. Women or their families have filed 2,500 similar claims, the vast majority in the same court, which is one of several in the United States that attracts consumer lawsuits. The plaintiffs claim studies show J&J's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products, when used in the vaginal area, increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The company counters that larger, more comprehensive studies show no such link. In a court filing in August, J&J argued the case should be dismissed because plaintiffs’ lawyers tainted the St. Louis jury pool. The company said the other side spent almost $10 million on national and local television commercials in the previous year, with a disproportionate share of them running in St. Louis. The women's lawyers have denied J&J's claim. The company also contended that, because most of them are not from St. Louis and the New Jersey-based company has no strong ties to the area, the cases should not have been heard there. The judge rejected both arguments. John Beisner, one of the top lawyers representing J&J, said the company plans to make the same arguments to the Missouri Court of Appeals. If the St. Louis court is found not to have jurisdiction, the cases would have to be refiled elsewhere. Beisner compared the St. Louis verdicts to a favorable ruling in September from a state court judge in New Jersey. That judge, who is presiding over some 200 talc cases, disqualified the plaintiffs' experts on the grounds that their scientific testimony was too speculative. In the same decision, he dismissed the first two cases set for trial and the ruling is being appealed. J&J unsuccessfully tried to block the testimony of the experts in St. Louis on similar grounds. The company will make the same challenge on appeal, Beisner said. Last week's $70 million verdict followed Missouri jury awards of $72 million in February and $55 million in May. The first big talc verdict in February was won by the family of Jacqueline Fox, who died in October 2015. Their lawyers said she used J&J Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder daily for 35 years for genital hygiene before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013. Jere Beasley, whose firm has filed hundreds of talc cases, including the three Missouri wins and two New Jersey dismissals, said the verdicts should prompt J&J to make a deal. "If I were representing them, I would say, folks, we need to sit down and regroup and start trying to settle these cases," he said. LARGE VERDICTS Large verdicts are relatively common in major product liability cases, and they are often reduced or overturned on appeal. One lawsuit against Merck & Co over its recalled painkiller Vioxx produced a $253 million verdict in 2005, which was thrown out three years later. Merck eventually settled most Vioxx cases for $4.85 billion in 2007. Shareholders in J&J, which had sales of $70 billion last year, have so far shrugged off the three talc verdicts, the first of the cases to go to trial. But if the trend continues, liability could mount. The company has not reported setting aside any litigation reserve to deal with talc cases, as it has with previous claims over antipsychotic drug Rispardal and recalled hip implants. J&J no longer sells Shower to Shower, which was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2012. Though not a major seller on its own, Baby Powder is a recognized symbol of J&J’s baby care line, which brought in $2 billion in revenue in 2015. Some legal experts said it made sense for J&J to fight on. "Ordinarily I would say three verdicts like that would prompt you to think about settlement," said University of Georgia Law School professor Elizabeth Burch, who researches product liability cases, but she said J&J's case is somewhat different. A settlement would not necessarily cap J&J's liability, Burch said, because its talc products are still on the market, unlike companies whose products have been recalled. Howard Erichson, a professor at Fordham School of Law, said the company also had valid concerns about the impact of a settlement on its position in the market. "This is not Vioxx. This is not asbestos," Erichson said. "This is a case where the company wants to defend its brand, and is not going to be anxious to announce a big settlement that appears to concede that the product is harmful.

Back To Top[*] Researchers in U.S. report promising new Alzheimer's drug Nov. 07, 2016 - 06:10AM JST A new experimental treatment against Alzheimer’s has proved to be promising and free of harmful side effects, researchers in the United States report. The research published in the journal Science Translational Medicine on the basis of a small 32-person sample gave rise to two broader clinical trials that are now underway with more than 3,000 subjects. The treatment uses a compound called verubecestat, developed by U.S. pharmaceutical firm. It reduces levels of proteins called beta amyloids by blocking an enzyme known as BACE1. In people with Alzheimer’s disease, the proteins clump into plaques that damage the brain, affecting cognitive abilities, especially memory. The enzyme plays a key role in production of the proteins. The 32 people who participated in the first clinical trial had been diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s. Pharmaceutical labs are working to develop compounds that can stop or even reverse the formation of these plaques. Until now, products developed to neutralize the BACEI enzyme had very toxic side effects, such as liver damage or further neuro-degeneration. But verubecestat does not, said Dr Matthew Kennedy of the Merck research lab in northeastern state of New Jersey. Researchers found that one or two doses of the compound were enough to lower protein levels without causing side effects. The two so-called phase 3 clinical trials now under way to evaluate how well verubecestat works will conclude in July 2017. If the results are good, the compound could be marketed as a pill in two or three years. The number of people in the United States suffering from mind-wasting Alzheimer’s could surpass 28 million by 2050 after the entire baby boomer generation gets past age 80, according to projections. The World Health Organization says 36 million people around the world suffer from some form of dementia, most of them with Alzheimer. The figure is expected to double by 2030 to exceed 65.7 million, and triple by 2050 to 115.4 million, if no effective treatment is found in the next few years.

Valley Cottage, NY, November 05, 2016 --(PR.com)-- Future Market Insights (FMI) delivers key insights on the global companion animals drug market in its upcoming outlook titled, “Companion Animals Drug Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment, 2015 – 2025.” In terms of revenue, the global companion animal drug market is projected to register a healthy CAGR of 4.9% over the forecast period owing to various factors, which FMI analysis highlights and offers detailed insights and forecasts. The market is segmented based on product type, distribution channels and regions. The overall market has been segmented broadly into eight product types such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, parasiticides (further sub-divided into ecto-parasiticides and endo-parasiticides), heartworm drugs, nutritional, behavioural and skincare drugs and vaccines. Parasiticides more frequently applied as a cure for flea and tick infestations, are estimated to account for maximum revenue share by product type in the global companion animal drug market by 2015 end. The parasiticide drug segment is expected to expand at a CAGR of 6.6% in terms of value during the forecast period. Other popular drugs used in companion animals include heartworm medicines and vaccines. The vaccines segment is expected to reach market value of US$ 1,760.4 Mn by 2025, expanding at a CAGR of ~3% over the forecast period. Request Free Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-1077 To provide deeper insight into drug dispensing and distribution channels, the report has also been segmented by distribution channels such as veterinary hospitals, veterinary clinics and pharmacies and drug stores. It has been observed and validated that pet owners globally prefer consulting veterinary doctors at hospitals and clinics and administering prescription drugs to their small companion pets. However, a new trend of referring to the Internet to find out disease pathogenesis and buying over-the-counter (OTC) drugs from retail pharmacies and drug stores has been fast picking up. The primary trend in the companion animal drug market is an increase in pet adoption and humanization of pets globally. Other driving forces include increasing urbanization and growing affluence in emerging economies, increasing R&D for faster launch of first-in-line drugs, extension of patent approvals on formularies and growing demand for compounded medicines, as they are easily affordable and accessible. Factors restraining market growth include rising costs for R&D and lack of scope for innovation due to matured product portfolios. This report assesses trends driving growth of each segment on global as well as regional levels, and offers potential strategic recommendations that could prove useful to drug makers planning to penetrate or enter the market. North America is estimated to dominate the companion animals drug market with maximum market share by end of 2015. North America and Western Europe are collectively expected to account for close to 50% of the total companion animals drug market share in terms of value by end of 2015. Among emerging markets, Latin America is estimated to witness highest CAGR of 6.0% over the forecast period, followed by Asia Pacific excluding Japan, due to increasing pet adoption and rise in geriatric population. Send An Enquiry @ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/askus/rep-gb-1077 Some key players identified in the global companion animal drug market report include Zoetis Inc., Elanco (Eli Lilly), Merck Animal Health, Bayer Animal Healthcare, Merial (Sanofi), Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Virbac Animal Health and Ceva Santé Animale. They have discussed individual strategies followed by these companies in terms of enhancing drug portfolios, market consolidation and drug innovation pipelines. The report has been concluded with strategic recommendations for players already present in the market and also new players planning to enter the market, which could help them in the long run.
