UNESCO-Merck Africa Research Summit – MARS aims to bring together researchers from across Africa to discuss the generation, sharing and dissemination of research data and to prepare for the road ahead in Africa’s development as an international hub for research excellence and scientific innovation. Speaking on Merck’s support for the UNESCO – MARS Prof. Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, Chairman of Executive Board and Family Board of E.Merck KG emphasizes: “We are keen to support young gifted researchers by passing on the knowledge and experience we have gathered over the 340 years of Merck history. Through our ‘Merck STEM Program’ we aim to advance capacity in young researchers and promote young gifted scientists, to teach them the cutting edge of research in our R&D hubs and laboratories.” UNESCO-Merck Africa Research Summit – MARS 2017 will have scientific support from UNESCO (United Nations educational, scientific and cultural organization), African Union Scientific, Technical and Research Commission (AU-STRC), the University of Cambridge, UK, University of Rome, and Merck. “The annual Summit aims to contribute to building research capacity in the African research community, with special focus on ‘The Role of Scientific Research in responding to Cancer and Vaccines Development – two emerging challenges in Africa’. The Summit will also showcase innovative research taking place in projects, programs and initiatives across African universities and the wider African research community,” said Dr. Rasha Kelej, President of “Merck STEM Program”, Chairman of the Steering Committee of the summit and Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. The summit is a unique opportunity for Africa’s young and women scientists to share their research output and findings with the top echelon of scientists from Africa and abroad.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 5 Great Things About Merck & Co.'s Q1 Results Merck handily beat expectations with its Q1 results. Here's how the drugmaker did it. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) May 2, 2017 at 3:03PM By every measure, Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) enjoyed a solid first quarter. The big drugmaker reported its first-quarter results before the market opened on Tuesday. Merck's adjusted earnings per share of $0.88 easily beat analysts' estimate of $0.83. Its revenue of $9.4 billion topped Wall Street projections of $9.25 billion. What's even better is how Merck managed to exceed expectations. Here are five great things from the company's first-quarter results that made the difference. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Keytruda is rocking The biggest story for Merck in the first quarter was Keytruda. Sales for the cancer drug soared 134% year over year in the quarter to $584 million. Keytruda won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for two additional indications in the second half of 2016. In August, the FDA granted approval to the drug for treating head and neck cancer. Merck received an even greater prize, though, in October, when Keytruda gained FDA approval as a first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. The company attributed the higher sales for Keytruda to its continued global launch of new indications. Merck won yet another FDA approval in March 2017 for Keytruda in treating fourth-line classical Hodgkin lymphoma. This approval didn't significantly impact first-quarter results, however.  2. Gardasil revenue growing The second-best news of the first quarter stemmed from Merck's human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines Gardasil and Gardasil 9. Sales for the vaccine franchise jumped 41% year over year to $532 million. There were four factors contributing to the strong performance for the Gardasil franchise. The timing of public sector purchases helped. Higher demand was also a positive. It certainly didn't hurt that Merck raised prices for the vaccines. The termination of a joint venture with Sanofi at the end of 2016 also made a big impact. Merck recorded around $50 million in Gardasil sales in 19 European countries that previously were recorded by its joint venture with Sanofi.  3. Zepatier coming on strong AbbVie and Gilead Sciences are experiencing declining hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug sales. That's not the case for Merck. Its HCV drug Zepatier is coming on strong. Merck reported first-quarter sales for Zepatier of $378 million. In the same quarter of 2016, the HCV drug generated revenue of only $50 million. Zepatier's fourth-quarter 2016 sales totaled $229 million.  How is Merck succeeding in HCV when rivals aren't? For one thing, it's still rolling out Zepatier globally. The drugmaker also enjoyed a favorable adjustment of around $40 million in the first quarter from rebate accruals. 4. Fleas and ticks lending a helping hand Merck owes some of its first-quarter success to fleas and ticks. Without them, its Bravecto line of products for killing fleas and ticks in dogs and cats wouldn't be in high demand. And without Bravecto, Merck's animal health business wouldn't be doing nearly as well as it currently is. The company's animal health unit posted sales of $939 million in the first quarter. That reflected a solid 13% year over year increase. The contribution from animal health was second only to diabetes drug Januvia (which had first-quarter sales of $1.3 billion in the first quarter) in terms of overall impact on Merck's top line. 5. Better days ahead Perhaps the best news of all from Merck's first-quarter update didn't relate to the first quarter. The company provided updated guidance for full-year 2017 that was sure to please investors. Merck narrowed and raised its 2017 revenue outlook to a range of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion. The company's previous full-year 2017 guidance projected revenue between $38.6 billion and $40.1 billion. The drugmaker also narrowed and raised its 2017 earnings guidance. Merck now expects GAAP earnings per share between $2.51 and $2.63, with adjusted earnings per share between $3.76 and $3.88. Previously, the company projected full-year 2017 GAAP earnings per share of $2.47 to $2.62, with adjusted earnings per share between $3.72 and $3.87.

(MRK) and Cummins Inc. (CMI) Earnings results on CMI and COH set these stocks into rally mode, while MRK shares may have to wait May 2, 2017, 10:06 am EDT  |  By Johnson Research Group     Tuesday’s market activity is going to get a nudge from some earnings reports as the likes of Coach Inc (NYSE:COH), Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) are drawing responses from technical buyers as they review the charts. In short, Cummins and Coach are set to benefit from their earnings as the stocks are getting help from their charts while Merck shares are tiptoeing across a sensitive technical support level that is indicating a higher probability of a breakdown in the shares is on the horizon. Coach Inc (COH) Shares of the upscale retailer are just another in the lengthening strong arm of consumer discretionary earnings results. This is one of the sectors that have seen stronger than average results through the earnings season. Coach stock’s chart turned bullish last month when the 50-day moving average transitioned into a bullish pattern, followed by a Golden Cross. Now, the 100-day is preparing to cross over the 200-day, signaling a strengthening long-term trend for COH stock. Just ahead of the earnings announcement, we watched Coach shares decline as the traders were “selling the rumor” ahead of the number. This means that these and other traders will be “buying the news” to get back into COH stock. The open will see Coach breach the upper Bollinger Band also, signaling that a volatility rally is ready to ensue. For now, the short-term target for this move would be $44. Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) Merck spent the morning releasing their better-than-expected quarterly results. So far, the results aren’t reflecting as much strength as we would have expected with the stock trading slightly lower in the pre-market activity. MRK stock is sitting in a precarious position as it is teetering on critical support. Failure for the earnings news to get Merck moving from this support will put additional pressure from sellers. Currently, MRK stock is positioned on its 200-day, which is at $62.25. The stock is also sitting just under the 100-day moving average at $62.85. Finally, the stock’s 50-day just transitioned into bearish mode as it rolled over and is now declining. The technical pressure appears to be mounting against the pharma giant. Cummins Inc. (CMI) Cummins shares are trading 7% higher ahead of the open after the company provided great earnings results and provided a positive view on its international demand and growth. CMI stock continues to trend more strongly that the benchmark indices with the stock trading 11% higher before this morning’s open. Cummins’ 50-day moving average just came into play to help support the stock. The trendline will also continue its ascent with today’s move, maintaining a bullish outlook for CMI stock. Outside of the technicals, analyst recommendations on Cummins are extremely low with only 13% of those covering the stock rating it a buy. The expected upgrades and bounce from the 50-day provide a technically bullish outlook for CMI shares with a target of $175. As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The European Commission approved KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score of 50 percent or more) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumor mutations. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory cHL who have failed autologous stem cell transplant and brentuximab vedotin (BV), or who are transplant-ineligible and have failed BV. The FDA accepted for review under its Accelerated Approval program the sBLA for KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin for the treatment of patients with metastatic or advanced NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression. This is the first application for regulatory approval of KEYTRUDA in combination with another treatment. The FDA granted Priority Review with a PDUFA action date of May 10, 2017. The FDA accepted and granted Priority Review for the sBLA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, a type of bladder cancer, for first-line use in patients who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing therapy. The application for second-line use was also accepted for Priority Review. The PDUFA action date for both applications is June 14, 2017. The company recently submitted additional data and analyses to the FDA for the pending sBLA application for the treatment of previously treated patients with advanced microsatellite instability-high cancer. The PDUFA action date for this Priority Review has been extended to June 9, 2017. The FDA and EMA accepted for review three New Drug Applications (NDAs) in the company’s diabetes franchise for medicines containing ertugliflozin, an investigational SGLT2 inhibitor in development to help improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes as part of Merck’s collaboration with Pfizer Inc. The PDUFA action date from the FDA is in December 2017 for the three NDAs. Merck presented phase 3 data across our late-stage pipeline in studies that met their primary endpoints. At the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in February, data were presented from the ongoing “DRIVE-FORWARD” phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of doravirine (MK-1439), an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for previously untreated adults with HIV-1 infection. The study met its primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating the non-inferiority of once-daily doravirine to once-daily ritonavir-boosted darunavir. Positive results from a study of letermovir, an investigational antiviral medicine for the prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in high-risk bone marrow transplant patients, were presented at the BMT Tandem Meetings in February. Merck presented data from a trial for V212, an investigational inactivated varicella zoster virus vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster or HZ, also known as shingles. The data demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of confirmed HZ cases by an estimated 64 percent in immunocompromised patients and also were presented at the BMT Tandem Meetings. First-Quarter Revenue Performance The following table reflects sales of the company’s top pharmaceutical products, as well as total sales of Animal Health products.           $ in millions       First Quarter                   Change 2017 2016 Change Ex-Exchange Total Sales $9,434 $9,312 1% 3% Pharmaceutical 8,185 8,104 1% 2% JANUVIA / JANUMET 1,335 1,412 -5% -5% KEYTRUDA 584 249 134% 137% ZETIA / VYTORIN 575 889 -35% -35% GARDASIL / GARDASIL 9 532 378 41% 41% ZEPATIER 378 50 * * PROQUAD, M-M-R II and VARIVAX 355 357 0% 1% ISENTRESS 305 340 -10% -10% REMICADE 229 349 -34% -31% ROTATEQ 224 188 19% 19% Animal Health 939 829 13% 14% Other Revenues       310       379       -18%       -5% *Growth comparison not meaningful due to ongoing product launch. Pharmaceutical Revenue First-quarter pharmaceutical sales increased 1 percent to $8.2 billion, including a 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. The growth was driven by oncology, hepatitis C and vaccines, largely offset by the loss of market exclusivity for several products, as well as lower sales in the diabetes franchise. Growth in oncology was due to higher sales of KEYTRUDA as the company continues to launch the product with new indications globally. Growth in hepatitis C was driven by ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir), a medicine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 1 or 4 infection, due to ongoing launches globally. Sales in the United States also reflect an approximately $40 million favorable adjustment to rebate accruals due to mix of business. Growth in vaccines was primarily driven by higher sales of GARDASIL [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant] and GARDASIL 9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant), vaccines to prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by HPV, in the United States reflecting the timing of public sector purchases, underlying demand and increased price, as well as higher sales of PNEUMOVAX 23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent) largely driven by demand in the United States. Growth in vaccines also reflects incremental sales of approximately $65 million, of which approximately $50 million relates to GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9, due to Merck now recording vaccine sales in the 19 European countries previously part of the Sanofi Pasteur MSD vaccines joint venture, which was terminated on Dec. 31, 2016. Pharmaceutical sales reflect a decrease in the diabetes franchise of JANUVIA (sitagliptin) and JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl), medicines that help lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes, primarily due to the timing of customer purchases in the United States as anticipated for the quarter. Sales growth also was offset by the loss of U.S. market exclusivity in 2016 for ZETIA (ezetimibe), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol; CUBICIN (daptomycin for injection), an I.V. antibiotic; and NASONEX (mometasone furoate monohydrate), an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms; as well as by the ongoing impact of biosimilar competition in the company’s marketing territories in Europe for REMICADE (infliximab), a treatment for inflammatory diseases. In the aggregate, sales of these products declined $686 million during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. Animal Health Revenue Animal Health sales totaled $939 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 13 percent compared with the first quarter of 2016, including a 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. Growth was primarily due to sales increases in companion animal products, driven by the BRAVECTO (fluralaner) line of products that kill fleas and ticks in dogs and cats for up to 12 weeks, as well as in ruminants, poultry and swine products. In March, Animal Health completed the acquisition of Vallée S.A., a leading privately held producer of animal health products in Brazil.

The increase in gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by a lower net impact from acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and restructuring costs which reduced gross margin by 9.8 percentage points in the first quarter of 2017 as compared with 15.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in gross margin also reflects the favorable effects of foreign exchange and lower inventory write-offs. Marketing and administrative expenses were $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2017, a 4 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase primarily reflects higher health care reform fee expenses, administrative costs, and promotion and direct selling expenses. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2017, an 8 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase reflects higher clinical development spending, partially offset by lower restructuring costs. GAAP EPS was $0.56 for the first quarter of 2017 compared with $0.40 for the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information The non-GAAP gross margin was 77.8 percent for the first quarter of 2017 compared to 77.0 percent for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in non-GAAP gross margin was largely driven by the favorable effects of foreign exchange and lower inventory write-offs. Non-GAAP marketing and administrative expenses were $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 3 percent compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was driven primarily by higher health care reform fee expenses, administrative costs, and promotion and direct selling expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2017, a 14 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase primarily reflects higher clinical development spending. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.88 for the first quarter of 2017 compared with $0.89 for the first quarter of 2016. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income and EPS is provided in the table that follows.           $ in millions, except EPS amounts       First Quarter 2017       2016 EPS GAAP EPS $0.56 $0.40 Difference4 0.32 0.49 Non-GAAP EPS that excludes items listed below1 $0.88 $0.89   Net Income GAAP net income2 $1,551 $1,125 Difference 886 1,367 Non-GAAP net income that excludes items listed below1,2 $2,437 $2,492   Decrease (Increase) in Net Income Due to Excluded Items: Acquisition- and divestiture-related costs3 $883 $1,423 Restructuring costs 215 196 Other (9) — Net decrease (increase) in income before taxes 1,089 1,619 Estimated income tax (benefit) expense (203) (252) Decrease (increase) in net income       $886       $1,367   Financial Outlook Merck has narrowed and raised its full-year 2017 GAAP EPS range to be between $2.51 and $2.63.

The summit is a unique opportunity for Africa’s young and women scientists to share their research output and findings with the top echelon of scientists from Africa and abroad. It is also an opportunity for networking and career development. The Summit will present a platform where young scientists will be able to discuss the enabling environment for better research among others. On another note, the organizing committee will present the ‘Best Young African Researcher Award’ and the ‘Best African Woman Researcher Award’ to recognize the outstanding contribution of African female scientists with aim to promote women in research and advance their contribution to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). In 2016, UNESCO and Merck celebrated outstanding African Women Researchers for the first time. Kenya, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Uganda, Ethiopia ranked the first five places in ‘Merck Africa Women Research Award’ on women health in Africa.

 Merck's profit tops estimates Natalie Grover, Reuters May 2, 2017, 9:06 AM 398 facebook linkedin twitter email print FILE PHOTO: The logo of Merck is pictured in this illustration photograph in Cardiff, CaliforniaThomson Reuters (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by higher gross margins, and the drugmaker also raised its revenue and profit forecasts for 2017. Net income attributable to Merck surged 38 percent to $1.55 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the first quarter. Excluding items, Merck earned 88 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Gross margins rose to 68 percent from 61.6 percent, primarily driven by a lower impact from acquisition- and divestiture-related expenses as well as restructuring costs, Merck said. Total revenue increased 1.3 percent to $9.43 billion in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $9.25 billion. "The continued momentum of Keytruda in oncology, along with the strength of the vaccine and other franchises and animal health, helped to drive revenue growth," Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said in a statement. However the company's sales growth was curbed by a drop in its diabetes franchise, and the loss of patent exclusivity on its cholesterol drug Zetia, antibiotic Cubicin, Nasonex nasal spray in the United States as well as competition for Remicade, its big-selling arthritis drug, in Europe. Sales of cancer drug Keytruda, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, rose 134 percent to $584 million, but missed Wall Street's consensus estimate of $589 million, according to Barclays. Merck on Tuesday raised its full-year 2017 adjusted profit forecast to $3.76 to $3.88 per share from the forecast of $3.72 to $3.87 it gave in February. It also hiked its revenue forecast to $39.1 billion-$40.3 billion from $38.6 billion-$40.1 billion. The company's shares rose 0.8 percent to $62.88 in light premarket trading on Tuesday.

Merck & Company, Inc. reports earnings, Tuesday, May 2, 2017. Photo: Mel Evans, AP Merck tops Street 1Q forecasts on cost cuts, new drug sales 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Strict cost controls, along with surging sales of its two newest medicines and a surprisingly strong performance from its entire vaccine portfolio pushed Merck & Co. beyond most expectations for the first quarter and the company boosted its outlook for the year. The company has begun a new cycle in which sales of its latest drugs grow as revenue fades for older drugs facing new generic competition, particularly its blockbuster cholesterol pills Zetia and Vytorin. Other Merck drugs are facing more brand-name competition. Meanwhile Merck's crucial diabetes franchise, already under pressure from insurers for bigger discounts, was hurt by a shift in the timing of orders by large U.S. purchasers. Combined sales of its Januvia and Janumet diabetes treatments dipped 5 percent, to $1.34 billion. Merck's new drugs are picking up the slack, however. Sales of Zepatier, the hepatitis C drug launched a year ago, rocketed to $378 million, a pace that will soon make it a blockbuster with annual sales topping $1 billion. Revenue from the cancer medicine Keytruda, one of the top new immuno-oncology drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer, more than doubled to $584 million. It's approved for treating melanoma, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer, a fiercely competitive category in which it's the market leader. Keytruda also has pending approvals for bladder cancer, for a rare cancer caused by DNA repair defects and for treating lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The latter use could be approved by the middle of next week. Meanwhile, Merck is running scores of other patient tests of Keytruda for still more cancer types. Merck on Tuesday reported net income of $1.55 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.13 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 88 cents per share, a nickel above what analysts expected. "We're seeing strong performance across all elements of Merck's businesses," CEO Kenneth Frazier told analysts during a conference call. Merck slashed spending on manufacturing and materials a whopping 16 percent to $3.02 billion, while boosting spending on research and development 8 percent to $1.8 billion in the quarter. The drugmaker posted revenue of $9.43 billion, also topping Street forecasts for $9.29 billion. Its prescription drugs business produced $8.19 billion of that revenue, up 1 percent, while its animal health unit had sales of $939 million, up 13 percent. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, raised its financial forecast for the year, saying it expects earnings between $2.51 and $2.63 per share, including one-time items, up from its January forecast of $2.47 to $2.62 per share. It now expects revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from its January forecast for $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. Credit-Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote to investors that sales of Januvia and Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, drove Merck's total sales above analysts' expectations, but the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker had greater-than-expected declines to older products Zetia, Vytorin and Remicade, an immune disorder blockbuster whose sales plunged 34 percent to $229 million. In early trading, Merck shares dipped 5 cents to $62.33. _____ Follow Linda A.

Merck & Company, Inc. reports earnings, Tuesday, May 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) Strict cost controls, along with surging sales of its two newest medicines and a surprisingly strong performance from its entire vaccine portfolio pushed Merck & Co. beyond most expectations for the first quarter and the company boosted its outlook for the year. The company has begun a new cycle in which sales of its latest drugs grow as revenue fades for older drugs facing new generic competition, particularly its blockbuster cholesterol pills Zetia and Vytorin. Other Merck drugs are facing more brand-name competition. Meanwhile Merck's crucial diabetes franchise, already under pressure from insurers for bigger discounts, was hurt by a shift in the timing of orders by large U.S. purchasers. Combined sales of its Januvia and Janumet diabetes treatments dipped 5 percent, to $1.34 billion. Merck's new drugs are picking up the slack, however. Sales of Zepatier, the hepatitis C drug launched a year ago, rocketed to $378 million, a pace that will soon make it a blockbuster with annual sales topping $1 billion. Revenue from the cancer medicine Keytruda, one of the top new immuno-oncology drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer, more than doubled to $584 million. It's approved for treating melanoma, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer, a fiercely competitive category in which it's the market leader. Keytruda also has pending approvals for bladder cancer, for a rare cancer caused by DNA repair defects and for treating lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The latter use could be approved by the middle of next week. Meanwhile, Merck is running scores of other patient tests of Keytruda for still more cancer types. Merck on Tuesday reported net income of $1.55 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.13 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 88 cents per share, a nickel above what analysts expected. "We're seeing strong performance across all elements of Merck's businesses," CEO Kenneth Frazier told analysts during a conference call. Merck slashed spending on manufacturing and materials a whopping 16 percent to $3.02 billion, while boosting spending on research and development 8 percent to $1.8 billion in the quarter. The drugmaker posted revenue of $9.43 billion, also topping Street forecasts for $9.29 billion. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Its prescription drugs business produced $8.19 billion of that revenue, up 1 percent, while its animal health unit had sales of $939 million, up 13 percent. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, raised its financial forecast for the year, saying it expects earnings between $2.51 and $2.63 per share, including one-time items, up from its January forecast of $2.47 to $2.62 per share. It now expects revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from its January forecast for $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. Credit-Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote to investors that sales of Januvia and Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, drove Merck's total sales above analysts' expectations, but the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker had greater-than-expected declines to older products Zetia, Vytorin and Remicade, an immune disorder blockbuster whose sales plunged 34 percent to $229 million. In early trading, Merck shares dipped 5 cents to $62.33. _____ Follow Linda A. Johnson at www.twitter.com/LindaJ_onPharma Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: Merck — The drugmaker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 88 cents per share for the first quarter, five cents a share above estimates. Revenue exceeded Street forecasts, boosted by surging demand for its cancer drug Keytruda, and Merck also raised its full-year outlook. Pfizer — Pfizer earned an adjusted 69 cents per share for the first quarter, coming in two cents a share above estimates. The pharmaceutical company's revenue fell short of analysts' estimates, but its full-year outlook falls within the range of current Street forecasts. Aetna — The insurance company reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.71 per share, beating estimates of $2.37 a share. Revenue beat forecasts, as well. Aetna reported an overall loss due to costs associated with the termination of its deal to merge with Humana, but said its business got off to a strong 2017 start. Hilton — The hotel operator came in 10 cents a share above estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of 38 cents per share. Revenue was above forecasts and the company raised its full-year guidance, as customers book more rooms at higher prices. Becton Dickinson — The medical supplies company beat estimates by seven cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $2.30 per share. Revenue was also slightly above estimates. Advanced Micro Devices — The chipmaker matched Wall Street estimates with a quarterly loss of four cents per share. Revenue matched, as well. AMD did give strong current-quarter revenue guidance, but investors are expressing concerns over profit margin forecasts. Coach — The handbag and accessories maker earned an adjusted 46 cents per share for its latest quarter, two cents a share above estimates. Revenue fell somewhat short of expectations. The bottom line, however, was helped by a reduction in discounting. Mosaic — The fertilizer producer came in 15 cents a share below estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of four cents per share. Revenue also missed forecasts. Mosaic was hurt as phosphate and potash prices fell, and a plant outage also impacted results. CVS Health — The drugstore operator and pharmacy benefits manager beat estimates by seven cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.17 per share. Revenue beat forecasts. Profit did drop from a year earlier on fewer filled prescriptions and lower front-end sales. Altria — The tobacco products company fell a penny a share shy of estimates, with quarterly profit of 73 cents per share. Revenue also fell short of the Street's outlook. Altria said its smokeable products segment did well, but there were negative effects from a voluntary smokeless product recall, as well as from its beer-related investments. Texas Roadhouse — Texas Roadhouse beat estimates by three cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 61 cents per share. The restaurant chain's revenue also beat forecasts. Same-restaurant sales topped estimates for both company-owned and franchised locations. Tenet Healthcare — Tenet lost an adjusted 27 cents per share for its latest quarter, smaller than the 51 cents a share Wall Street was expecting. The hospital operator's revenue was essentially in line with forecasts. The hospital operator gave upbeat guidance for the current quarter and the full year, and said it would sell three hospitals in Houston to rival HCA . United Continental — The airline is in the spotlight today, with Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz scheduled to testify before the House Transportation Committee on the widely publicized recent incident in which a passenger was dragged off a flight. Twitter — Twitter struck a deal with the Women's National Basketball Association to stream 20 games per year over the next few seasons. BP — BP reported first-quarter profit that nearly tripled from a year earlier, beating analysts' forecasts, thanks to higher oil prices and an increase in output. AstraZeneca — The drugmaker won Food and Drug Administration approval for the use of its immunotherapy drug durvalumab as a treatment for bladder cancer. Infosys — Infosys announced plans to hire 10,000 U.S. workers in the next two years. The India-based IT services firm will also open four new U.S. technology centers. Morgan Stanley — Morgan Stanley is cutting commissions on trades involving stocks, exchange-traded funds, and annuities, capping them at 2.5 percent of the trade's value. Angie's List — The company will be bought by IAC, which will combine the consumer review site with its HomeAdvisor unit and spin the combination out into a new publicly traded company. The stock deal values Angie's List at $8.50 per share, 44 percent above Monday's closing price. Microsoft — Microsoft executive Julie Larson-Green is pulling back on her duties for health reasons, according to The Information.

Merck & Company, Inc. reports earnings, Tuesday, May 2, 2017. Mel Evans, File AP Photo Business May 02, 2017 7:24 AM Merck tops Street 1Q forecasts on cost cuts, new drug sales By LINDA A. JOHNSON AP Medical Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Strict cost controls, along with surging sales of its two newest medicines and a surprisingly strong performance from its entire vaccine portfolio pushed Merck & Co. beyond most expectations for the first quarter and the company boosted its outlook for the year. The company has begun a new cycle in which sales of its latest drugs grow as revenue fades for older drugs facing new generic competition, particularly its blockbuster cholesterol pills Zetia and Vytorin. Other Merck drugs are facing more brand-name competition. Meanwhile Merck's crucial diabetes franchise, already under pressure from insurers for bigger discounts, was hurt by a shift in the timing of orders by large U.S. purchasers. Combined sales of its Januvia and Janumet diabetes treatments dipped 5 percent, to $1.34 billion. Merck's new drugs are picking up the slack, however. Sales of Zepatier, the hepatitis C drug launched a year ago, rocketed to $378 million, a pace that will soon make it a blockbuster with annual sales topping $1 billion. Revenue from the cancer medicine Keytruda, one of the top new immuno-oncology drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer, more than doubled to $584 million. It's approved for treating melanoma, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer, a fiercely competitive category in which it's the market leader. Keytruda also has pending approvals for bladder cancer, for a rare cancer caused by DNA repair defects and for treating lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The latter use could be approved by the middle of next week. Meanwhile, Merck is running scores of other patient tests of Keytruda for still more cancer types. Merck on Tuesday reported net income of $1.55 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.13 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 88 cents per share, a nickel above what analysts expected. "We're seeing strong performance across all elements of Merck's businesses," CEO Kenneth Frazier told analysts during a conference call. Merck slashed spending on manufacturing and materials a whopping 16 percent to $3.02 billion, while boosting spending on research and development 8 percent to $1.8 billion in the quarter. The drugmaker posted revenue of $9.43 billion, also topping Street forecasts for $9.29 billion. Its prescription drugs business produced $8.19 billion of that revenue, up 1 percent, while its animal health unit had sales of $939 million, up 13 percent. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, raised its financial forecast for the year, saying it expects earnings between $2.51 and $2.63 per share, including one-time items, up from its January forecast of $2.47 to $2.62 per share. It now expects revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from its January forecast for $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. Credit-Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote to investors that sales of Januvia and Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, drove Merck's total sales above analysts' expectations, but the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker had greater-than-expected declines to older products Zetia, Vytorin and Remicade, an immune disorder blockbuster whose sales plunged 34 percent to $229 million. In early trading, Merck shares dipped 5 cents to $62.33. FILE - This Thursday, Dec. 18, 2014, file photograph, shows a sign at the Merck company facilities in Kenilworth, N.J.

JOHNSON AP Medical Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Strict cost controls, along with surging sales of its two newest medicines and a surprisingly strong performance from its entire vaccine portfolio pushed Merck & Co. beyond most expectations for the first quarter and the company boosted its outlook for the year. The company has begun a new cycle in which sales of its latest drugs grow as revenue fades for older drugs facing new generic competition, particularly its blockbuster cholesterol pills Zetia and Vytorin. Other Merck drugs are facing more brand-name competition. Meanwhile Merck's crucial diabetes franchise, already under pressure from insurers for bigger discounts, was hurt by a shift in the timing of orders by large U.S. purchasers. Combined sales of its Januvia and Janumet diabetes treatments dipped 5 percent, to $1.34 billion. Merck's new drugs are picking up the slack, however. Sales of Zepatier, the hepatitis C drug launched a year ago, rocketed to $378 million, a pace that will soon make it a blockbuster with annual sales topping $1 billion. Revenue from the cancer medicine Keytruda, one of the top new immuno-oncology drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer, more than doubled to $584 million. It's approved for treating melanoma, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer, a fiercely competitive category in which it's the market leader. Keytruda also has pending approvals for bladder cancer, for a rare cancer caused by DNA repair defects and for treating lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The latter use could be approved by the middle of next week. Meanwhile, Merck is running scores of other patient tests of Keytruda for still more cancer types. Merck on Tuesday reported net income of $1.55 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.13 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 88 cents per share, a nickel above what analysts expected. "We're seeing strong performance across all elements of Merck's businesses," CEO Kenneth Frazier told analysts during a conference call. Merck slashed spending on manufacturing and materials a whopping 16 percent to $3.02 billion, while boosting spending on research and development 8 percent to $1.8 billion in the quarter. The drugmaker posted revenue of $9.43 billion, also topping Street forecasts for $9.29 billion. Its prescription drugs business produced $8.19 billion of that revenue, up 1 percent, while its animal health unit had sales of $939 million, up 13 percent. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, raised its financial forecast for the year, saying it expects earnings between $2.51 and $2.63 per share, including one-time items, up from its January forecast of $2.47 to $2.62 per share. It now expects revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from its January forecast for $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. Credit-Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote to investors that sales of Januvia and Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, drove Merck's total sales above analysts' expectations, but the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker had greater-than-expected declines to older products Zetia, Vytorin and Remicade, an immune disorder blockbuster whose sales plunged 34 percent to $229 million.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck Announces First-Quarter 2017 Financial Results KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2017. “Merck delivered solid performance across our broad range of products that address major disease categories and the needs of global health,” said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. “The continued momentum of KEYTRUDA in oncology, along with the strength of the vaccine and other franchises and animal health, helped to drive revenue growth in the quarter.” Financial Summary           $ in millions, except EPS amounts       First Quarter 2017       2016 Sales $9,434 $9,312 GAAP EPS 0.56 0.40 Non-GAAP EPS that excludes certain items1* 0.88 0.89 GAAP net income2 1,551 1,125 Non-GAAP net income that excludes certain items1,2*       2,437       2,492 *Refer to table on page 7.   Worldwide sales were $9.4 billion for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 1 percent compared with the first quarter of 2016, including a 2 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share assuming dilution (EPS) were $0.56 for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 for the first quarter of 2017 excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs and certain other items. Pipeline Highlights Merck continued to deliver significant progress in the development program for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD-1 therapy, receiving key regulatory approvals or opinions and supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) acceptances. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved under its Accelerated Approval program KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) or for patients with cHL who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. The European Commission approved KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score of 50 percent or more) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumor mutations. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory cHL who have failed autologous stem cell transplant and brentuximab vedotin (BV), or who are transplant-ineligible and have failed BV. The FDA accepted for review under its Accelerated Approval program the sBLA for KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin for the treatment of patients with metastatic or advanced NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression. This is the first application for regulatory approval of KEYTRUDA in combination with another treatment. The FDA granted Priority Review with a PDUFA action date of May 10, 2017. The FDA accepted and granted Priority Review for the sBLA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, a type of bladder cancer, for first-line use in patients who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing therapy. The application for second-line use was also accepted for Priority Review. The PDUFA action date for both applications is June 14, 2017. The company recently submitted additional data and analyses to the FDA for the pending sBLA application for the treatment of previously treated patients with advanced microsatellite instability-high cancer. The PDUFA action date for this Priority Review has been extended to June 9, 2017. The FDA and EMA accepted for review three New Drug Applications (NDAs) in the company’s diabetes franchise for medicines containing ertugliflozin, an investigational SGLT2 inhibitor in development to help improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes as part of Merck’s collaboration with Pfizer Inc. The PDUFA action date from the FDA is in December 2017 for the three NDAs. Merck presented phase 3 data across our late-stage pipeline in studies that met their primary endpoints. At the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in February, data were presented from the ongoing “DRIVE-FORWARD” phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of doravirine (MK-1439), an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for previously untreated adults with HIV-1 infection. The study met its primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating the non-inferiority of once-daily doravirine to once-daily ritonavir-boosted darunavir. Positive results from a study of letermovir, an investigational antiviral medicine for the prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in high-risk bone marrow transplant patients, were presented at the BMT Tandem Meetings in February. Merck presented data from a trial for V212, an investigational inactivated varicella zoster virus vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster or HZ, also known as shingles. The data demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of confirmed HZ cases by an estimated 64 percent in immunocompromised patients and also were presented at the BMT Tandem Meetings. First-Quarter Revenue Performance The following table reflects sales of the company’s top pharmaceutical products, as well as total sales of Animal Health products.           $ in millions       First Quarter                   Change 2017 2016 Change Ex-Exchange Total Sales $9,434 $9,312 1% 3% Pharmaceutical 8,185 8,104 1% 2% JANUVIA / JANUMET 1,335 1,412 -5% -5% KEYTRUDA 584 249 134% 137% ZETIA / VYTORIN 575 889 -35% -35% GARDASIL / GARDASIL 9 532 378 41% 41% ZEPATIER 378 50 * * PROQUAD, M-M-R II and VARIVAX 355 357 0% 1% ISENTRESS 305 340 -10% -10% REMICADE 229 349 -34% -31% ROTATEQ 224 188 19% 19% Animal Health 939 829 13% 14% Other Revenues       310       379       -18%       -5% *Growth comparison not meaningful due to ongoing product launch. Pharmaceutical Revenue First-quarter pharmaceutical sales increased 1 percent to $8.2 billion, including a 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. The growth was driven by oncology, hepatitis C and vaccines, largely offset by the loss of market exclusivity for several products, as well as lower sales in the diabetes franchise. Growth in oncology was due to higher sales of KEYTRUDA as the company continues to launch the product with new indications globally. Growth in hepatitis C was driven by ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir), a medicine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 1 or 4 infection, due to ongoing launches globally. Sales in the United States also reflect an approximately $40 million favorable adjustment to rebate accruals due to mix of business. Growth in vaccines was primarily driven by higher sales of GARDASIL [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant] and GARDASIL 9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant), vaccines to prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by HPV, in the United States reflecting the timing of public sector purchases, underlying demand and increased price, as well as higher sales of PNEUMOVAX 23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent) largely driven by demand in the United States. Growth in vaccines also reflects incremental sales of approximately $65 million, of which approximately $50 million relates to GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9, due to Merck now recording vaccine sales in the 19 European countries previously part of the Sanofi Pasteur MSD vaccines joint venture, which was terminated on Dec. 31, 2016. Pharmaceutical sales reflect a decrease in the diabetes franchise of JANUVIA (sitagliptin) and JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl), medicines that help lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes, primarily due to the timing of customer purchases in the United States as anticipated for the quarter. Sales growth also was offset by the loss of U.S. market exclusivity in 2016 for ZETIA (ezetimibe), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol; CUBICIN (daptomycin for injection), an I.V. antibiotic; and NASONEX (mometasone furoate monohydrate), an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms; as well as by the ongoing impact of biosimilar competition in the company’s marketing territories in Europe for REMICADE (infliximab), a treatment for inflammatory diseases. In the aggregate, sales of these products declined $686 million during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. Animal Health Revenue Animal Health sales totaled $939 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 13 percent compared with the first quarter of 2016, including a 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. Growth was primarily due to sales increases in companion animal products, driven by the BRAVECTO (fluralaner) line of products that kill fleas and ticks in dogs and cats for up to 12 weeks, as well as in ruminants, poultry and swine products. In March, Animal Health completed the acquisition of Vallée S.A., a leading privately held producer of animal health products in Brazil.

The increase in gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by a lower net impact from acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and restructuring costs which reduced gross margin by 9.8 percentage points in the first quarter of 2017 as compared with 15.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in gross margin also reflects the favorable effects of foreign exchange and lower inventory write-offs. Marketing and administrative expenses were $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2017, a 4 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase primarily reflects higher health care reform fee expenses, administrative costs, and promotion and direct selling expenses. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2017, an 8 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase reflects higher clinical development spending, partially offset by lower restructuring costs. GAAP EPS was $0.56 for the first quarter of 2017 compared with $0.40 for the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information The non-GAAP gross margin was 77.8 percent for the first quarter of 2017 compared to 77.0 percent for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in non-GAAP gross margin was largely driven by the favorable effects of foreign exchange and lower inventory write-offs. Non-GAAP marketing and administrative expenses were $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 3 percent compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was driven primarily by higher health care reform fee expenses, administrative costs, and promotion and direct selling expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2017, a 14 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase primarily reflects higher clinical development spending. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.88 for the first quarter of 2017 compared with $0.89 for the first quarter of 2016.

Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Financial Highlights Package PDF May 02, 2017 06:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2017. “Merck delivered solid performance across our broad range of products that address major disease categories and the needs of global health,” said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. “The continued momentum of KEYTRUDA in oncology, along with the strength of the vaccine and other franchises and animal health, helped to drive revenue growth in the quarter.” Financial Summary           $ in millions, except EPS amounts       First Quarter 2017       2016 Sales $9,434 $9,312 GAAP EPS 0.56 0.40 Non-GAAP EPS that excludes certain items1* 0.88 0.89 GAAP net income2 1,551 1,125 Non-GAAP net income that excludes certain items1,2*       2,437       2,492 *Refer to table on page 7.   Worldwide sales were $9.4 billion for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 1 percent compared with the first quarter of 2016, including a 2 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share assuming dilution (EPS) were $0.56 for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 for the first quarter of 2017 excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs and certain other items. Pipeline Highlights Merck continued to deliver significant progress in the development program for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD-1 therapy, receiving key regulatory approvals or opinions and supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) acceptances. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved under its Accelerated Approval program KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) or for patients with cHL who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. The European Commission approved KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score of 50 percent or more) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumor mutations. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory cHL who have failed autologous stem cell transplant and brentuximab vedotin (BV), or who are transplant-ineligible and have failed BV. The FDA accepted for review under its Accelerated Approval program the sBLA for KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin for the treatment of patients with metastatic or advanced NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression. This is the first application for regulatory approval of KEYTRUDA in combination with another treatment. The FDA granted Priority Review with a PDUFA action date of May 10, 2017. The FDA accepted and granted Priority Review for the sBLA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, a type of bladder cancer, for first-line use in patients who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing therapy. The application for second-line use was also accepted for Priority Review. The PDUFA action date for both applications is June 14, 2017. The company recently submitted additional data and analyses to the FDA for the pending sBLA application for the treatment of previously treated patients with advanced microsatellite instability-high cancer. The PDUFA action date for this Priority Review has been extended to June 9, 2017. The FDA and EMA accepted for review three New Drug Applications (NDAs) in the company’s diabetes franchise for medicines containing ertugliflozin, an investigational SGLT2 inhibitor in development to help improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes as part of Merck’s collaboration with Pfizer Inc. The PDUFA action date from the FDA is in December 2017 for the three NDAs. Merck presented phase 3 data across our late-stage pipeline in studies that met their primary endpoints. At the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in February, data were presented from the ongoing “DRIVE-FORWARD” phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of doravirine (MK-1439), an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for previously untreated adults with HIV-1 infection. The study met its primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating the non-inferiority of once-daily doravirine to once-daily ritonavir-boosted darunavir. Positive results from a study of letermovir, an investigational antiviral medicine for the prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in high-risk bone marrow transplant patients, were presented at the BMT Tandem Meetings in February. Merck presented data from a trial for V212, an investigational inactivated varicella zoster virus vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster or HZ, also known as shingles. The data demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of confirmed HZ cases by an estimated 64 percent in immunocompromised patients and also were presented at the BMT Tandem Meetings. First-Quarter Revenue Performance The following table reflects sales of the company’s top pharmaceutical products, as well as total sales of Animal Health products.           $ in millions       First Quarter                   Change 2017 2016 Change Ex-Exchange Total Sales $9,434 $9,312 1% 3% Pharmaceutical 8,185 8,104 1% 2% JANUVIA / JANUMET 1,335 1,412 -5% -5% KEYTRUDA 584 249 134% 137% ZETIA / VYTORIN 575 889 -35% -35% GARDASIL / GARDASIL 9 532 378 41% 41% ZEPATIER 378 50 * * PROQUAD, M-M-R II and VARIVAX 355 357 0% 1% ISENTRESS 305 340 -10% -10% REMICADE 229 349 -34% -31% ROTATEQ 224 188 19% 19% Animal Health 939 829 13% 14% Other Revenues       310       379       -18%       -5% *Growth comparison not meaningful due to ongoing product launch. Pharmaceutical Revenue First-quarter pharmaceutical sales increased 1 percent to $8.2 billion, including a 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. The growth was driven by oncology, hepatitis C and vaccines, largely offset by the loss of market exclusivity for several products, as well as lower sales in the diabetes franchise. Growth in oncology was due to higher sales of KEYTRUDA as the company continues to launch the product with new indications globally. Growth in hepatitis C was driven by ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir), a medicine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 1 or 4 infection, due to ongoing launches globally. Sales in the United States also reflect an approximately $40 million favorable adjustment to rebate accruals due to mix of business. Growth in vaccines was primarily driven by higher sales of GARDASIL [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant] and GARDASIL 9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant), vaccines to prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by HPV, in the United States reflecting the timing of public sector purchases, underlying demand and increased price, as well as higher sales of PNEUMOVAX 23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent) largely driven by demand in the United States. Growth in vaccines also reflects incremental sales of approximately $65 million, of which approximately $50 million relates to GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9, due to Merck now recording vaccine sales in the 19 European countries previously part of the Sanofi Pasteur MSD vaccines joint venture, which was terminated on Dec. 31, 2016. Pharmaceutical sales reflect a decrease in the diabetes franchise of JANUVIA (sitagliptin) and JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl), medicines that help lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes, primarily due to the timing of customer purchases in the United States as anticipated for the quarter. Sales growth also was offset by the loss of U.S. market exclusivity in 2016 for ZETIA (ezetimibe), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol; CUBICIN (daptomycin for injection), an I.V. antibiotic; and NASONEX (mometasone furoate monohydrate), an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms; as well as by the ongoing impact of biosimilar competition in the company’s marketing territories in Europe for REMICADE (infliximab), a treatment for inflammatory diseases. In the aggregate, sales of these products declined $686 million during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. Animal Health Revenue Animal Health sales totaled $939 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 13 percent compared with the first quarter of 2016, including a 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. Growth was primarily due to sales increases in companion animal products, driven by the BRAVECTO (fluralaner) line of products that kill fleas and ticks in dogs and cats for up to 12 weeks, as well as in ruminants, poultry and swine products. In March, Animal Health completed the acquisition of Vallée S.A., a leading privately held producer of animal health products in Brazil.

The increase in gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by a lower net impact from acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and restructuring costs which reduced gross margin by 9.8 percentage points in the first quarter of 2017 as compared with 15.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in gross margin also reflects the favorable effects of foreign exchange and lower inventory write-offs. Marketing and administrative expenses were $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2017, a 4 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase primarily reflects higher health care reform fee expenses, administrative costs, and promotion and direct selling expenses. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2017, an 8 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase reflects higher clinical development spending, partially offset by lower restructuring costs. GAAP EPS was $0.56 for the first quarter of 2017 compared with $0.40 for the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information The non-GAAP gross margin was 77.8 percent for the first quarter of 2017 compared to 77.0 percent for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in non-GAAP gross margin was largely driven by the favorable effects of foreign exchange and lower inventory write-offs. Non-GAAP marketing and administrative expenses were $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 3 percent compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was driven primarily by higher health care reform fee expenses, administrative costs, and promotion and direct selling expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2017, a 14 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase primarily reflects higher clinical development spending. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.88 for the first quarter of 2017 compared with $0.89 for the first quarter of 2016.

Merck has narrowed and raised its full-year 2017 non-GAAP EPS range to be between $3.76 and $3.88, including an approximately 1.5 percent negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-April 2017 exchange rates. The non-GAAP range excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, costs related to restructuring programs and certain other items. Merck has narrowed and raised its full-year 2017 revenue range to be between $39.1 billion and $40.3 billion, including an approximately 1.5 percent negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-April 2017 exchange rates.

The U.S. drugmaker said its fast-growing immuno-oncology drug Keytruda is gaining market share and sees future sales opportunities across multiple types of cancer, despite first quarter sales of $584 million falling just shy of analysts' estimates. The company said Keytruda has become "the most prescribed" product for previously untreated, or first-line, lung cancer and it is looking to expand its use in second-line lung therapy. Merck is awaiting a potential U.S. approval next week for Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy. "The approval could meaningfully boost sales of Keytruda given the size of the lung cancer market," said Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans of by far the largest oncology market. Research chief Roger Perlmutter called the combination "a major opportunity to establish Keytruda further as a real preferred treatment therapy." Keytruda use is also growing in head and neck cancers, with 15 percent of U.S. sales for that indication now compared with 40 percent from lung. Merck slightly raised its 2017 adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $3.76 to $3.88 per share from its prior view $3.72 to $3.87, due to a favorable foreign exchange environment. It now expects full-year revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from $38.6 billion-$40.1 billion. Total revenue rose 1.3 percent to $9.43 billion in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $9.25 billion, despite the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity on cholesterol drug Zetia, antibiotic Cubicin, Nasonex nasal spray, and new competition for rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in Europe. Merck's blockbuster cholesterol drug Vytorin will also face competition from cheap generic rivals going forward. "In addition to Keytruda, we've got multiple other launches that are showing good growth and we've got a strong portfolio of vaccines" to help offset loss of exclusivities, said Adam Schechter, Merck's head of global human health. Merck's hepatitis C treatment Zepatier had sales of $378 million, topping analysts' estimates of $269 million, while sales of $532 million for Gardasil vaccine against human papillomavirus also sailed past Wall Street forecasts. Animal health sales grew 13 percent to $939 million. The company cautioned that animal health growth would be "more measured in subsequent quarters." Excluding items, Merck earned 88 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Merck shares were up 10 cents at $62.48.

Image: Dylan Vaughan Pharma giant MSD has announced it will spend €40m this year on its facility in Ballydine, Co Tipperary. MSD remains one of Ireland’s major pharma employers with more than 1,800 staff here, 600 of which are based at its Tipperary plant that has been in operation for more than 40 years. Now the company has revealed it is to upgrade its Ballydine facility to the tune of €40m this year, as part of a €75m investment that is already underway. The total spend for this year includes the installation of a new spray-drying facility, which develops and supplies the active ingredients and final formulated product for its medicines at its manufacturing and R&D facilities. This technology is used in a number of new products to improve how the medicines are absorbed by patients, particularly in the areas of diabetes, heart disease, women’s health and anaesthesia. MSD said that over the course of more than 50 years, it has spent more than $2.5bn investing in its Irish facilities. Ger Brennan, managing director of MSD human health, said: “Our manufacturing sites in Tipperary, Cork and Carlow have established themselves as critical to MSD’s global vision of inventing for life, with our Irish workforce playing a lead role in the production and development of next-generation treatments in areas such as oncology, diabetes, HIV and hepatitis C. “With diseases becoming more complex, it is vital that the pharma sector invests today for the healthcare needs of tomorrow. It is pleasing that MSD, with investments such as this, is leading the way in this regard.” Earlier this year, MSD revealed that it was to spend up to €25m over the course of the next three years to expand its clinical trials programme in Ireland. The company believes that despite a growth in the number of clinical trials for cancer medication, there is scope for a significant boost in the country.

Leading healthcare company, MSD, has announced it is to invest €40 million this year in its manufacturing facility in Ballydine, Co. Tipperary, as part of a total spend of €75 million over the last three years to enhance the site’s facilities. The spend in 2017 includes the installation of a new spray drying facility at the plant - a technology used in a number of new products to increase their solubility and improve how the medicines are absorbed by patients. MSD Ballydine develops and supplies the active ingredients and final formulated product for a range of innovative medicines at its manufacturing and R&D facilities. The plant, which last year marked 40 years in operation, exports to over 30 countries around the world with primary markets being Europe, USA and Japan.

Ger Brennan, Managing Director of MSD Human Health, said, “This investment represents a significant vote of confidence not only in MSD’s operations in Ireland, but in Ireland’s pharma sector generally. Our manufacturing sites in Tipperary, Cork and Carlow have established themselves as critical to MSD’s global vision of inventing for life, with our Irish workforce playing a lead role in the production and development of next generation treatments in areas such as oncology, diabetes, HIV and hepatitis C. “With diseases becoming more complex, it is vital that the pharma sector invest today for the healthcare needs of tomorrow.  It’s pleasing that MSD, with investments such as this, is leading the way in this regard.” MSD Ballydine is one of the region’s largest employers with over 600 highly-skilled people working at the site to deliver on the company’s vision of meeting unmet medical needs and helping save and improve lives around the world. Recognised as Ireland’s Pharma Company and Biopharma Company of the Year in 2015, MSD employs over 1,800 people in Ireland across its extensive Irish operations, encompassing manufacturing, commercial, global financial services and marketing facilities. The company had a turnover in Ireland of €3.9 billion in 2015. MSD has a strong legacy in Ireland that stretches back over the last 50 years, and in that time, the company has invested over $2.5 billion in expanding and developing its facilities here. The company provides healthcare solutions and innovative medicines in areas such as diabetes, heart disease, immunology, oncology, infectious diseases, women’s health and anaesthesia.

Ces montants pourront être modifiés d’un commun d’accord entre la Société et l’Investisseur.

Il est précisé que cette opération ne donnera pas lieu à l’établissement d’un prospectus soumis au visa de l’AMF mais sa mise en place est conditionnée au transfert des actions de la Société sur le compartiment « offre au public » d’Alternext Paris qui, lui, donnera lieu à l’établissement d’un prospectus soumis au visa de l’AFM. La Société prévoit de déposer le projet de prospectus auprès de l’AFM dans les prochains jours. Principales caractéristiques des ODIRNANE Les ODIRNANE auront une valeur nominale de 10.000€ chacune et seront émises à 99% de leur valeur nominale. Elles ne porteront pas d’intérêt, seront à durée indéterminée et ne seront pas remboursables en numéraire, sauf en cas de remboursement anticipé ou dans le cadre du remboursement des ODIRNANE en numéraire.

Si la Société choisit d’attribuer un montant en numéraire, celui-ci sera égal à : M = (Vn / P) * C « M » : montant en numéraire payable au porteur d’ODIRNANE ; « Vn » : créance obligataire que l’ODIRNANE représente (valeur nominale d’une ODIRNANE, soit 10.000€) ; « P » : le « Prix d’Attribution », égal à 92% du plus bas cours quotidien moyen pondéré par les volumes de l’action de la Société pendant la période de fixation du Prix d’Attribution6 ; « C » : le cours moyen pondéré par les volumes de l’action le jour de l’exercice du Droit à l’Attribution. Si la Société choisit d’attribuer des actions nouvelles et/ou existantes, le nombre d’actions sera égal à : N = Vn / P « N » : nombre d’actions ordinaires nouvelles et/ou existantes attribuables au porteur d’ODIRNANE ; « Vn » : créance obligataire que l’ODIRNANE représente (valeur nominale d’une ODIRNANE, soit 10.000€) ; « P » : le Prix d’Attribution applicable. Les ODIRNANE, qui seront librement cessibles, ne feront pas l’objet d’une demande d’admission aux négociations sur le marché Alternext Paris et ne seront par conséquent pas cotées. Principales caractéristiques des BSA Dès l’émission de chaque tranche d’ODIRNANE, les BSA attachés à cette tranche, dont le nombre sera déterminé dans les conditions définies ci-après, seront détachés des ODIRNANE. Le nombre de BSA à émettre à l’occasion de chaque tranche d’ODIRNANE sera tel que, multiplié par le prix de souscription, prime d’émission incluse, des actions ordinaires nouvelles à émettre sur exercice des BSA déterminé dans les conditions définies ci-après, le montant ainsi obtenu soit égal à la valeur nominale des ODIRNANE auxquelles les BSA sont attachés. Les BSA seront librement cessibles. Sur demande de l’Investisseur auprès de la Société, les BSA pourront faire l’objet d’une demande d’admission aux négociations sur le marché Alternext Paris. Les BSA pourront être exercés pendant une période de 4 ans à compter de leur émission et chaque BSA donnera droit à la souscription d’une action ordinaire nouvelle de la Société (sous réserve d’ajustements éventuels). Le prix de souscription, prime d’émission incluse, des actions ordinaires nouvelles à émettre sur exercice des BSA sera égal à 120% du moins élevé entre (i) le plus bas des cours quotidiens moyens pondérés par les volumes de l’action de la Société (tel que publié sur Bloomberg) pendant la période de fixation du prix d’exercice des BSA qui est constitué des 10 jours de bourse consécutifs précédant la date de demande de souscription des ODIRNANE desquelles les BSA sont détachés, étant précisé que dans le cas où la souscription des ODIRNANE est effectuée à la discrétion de l’Investisseur, la période de fixation du prix d’exercice des BSA est constituée des jours de bourse au cours desquels l’Investisseur n’a vendu aucune action parmi les 10 jours de bourse consécutifs précédant la date de souscription des ODIRNANE et (ii) 15,50€. A titre indicatif, sur la base du cours de clôture de l’action Noxxon du 28 avril 2017 (à savoir 21,90€), la valeur théorique d’un BSA ressort entre 5,12€ et 8,07€ en fonction de la volatilité retenue (soit entre 20% et 40%). La valeur théorique d'un BSA est obtenue en utilisant la méthode de Black & Scholes sur la base des hypothèses suivantes : - Prix d’exercice : 18,60€ - Echéance : 4 ans - Taux d’intérêt sans risque : 0% - Taux de versement en dividende : 0% Actions nouvelles résultant de l’exercice du Droit à l’Attribution des ODIRNANE ou de l’exercice des BSA Les actions nouvelles émises sur exercice du Droit à l’Attribution des ODIRNANE ou sur exercice des BSA porteront jouissance courante. Elles auront les mêmes droits que ceux attachés aux actions ordinaires existantes de la Société et feront l’objet d’une demande d’admission sur le marché Alternext Paris sur la même ligne de cotation (Code ISIN NL0012044762).

The Company has today agreed to issue 64,512 new shares, each with a par value of €1, at a unit price of €15.50 (representing a discount of 29.2% on the closing price of April 28, 2017 including the share premium, raising a total of €1 million and accounting for approximately 3.15% of the Company’s share capital (the “Private Placement”). Following this capital increase the number of shares outstanding stands at 2,115,609. 53,761 share warrants, with an exercise price of €18.60 were issued to the investors who subscribed for the new shares. The share warrants will have the same characteristics (other than exercise price) as the BSA share warrants attached to the ODIRNANE bonds (see below). YA II PN’s objective in subscribing €250 thousand for these shares1 as part of the capital increase is to increase the free float and liquidity of the Company’s shares.

Should all the tranches be taken up and should all the BSA share warrants be exercised, up to €20 million in additional capital could be raised, €10 million of which from the redemption of the ODIRNANE bonds in new Company shares and €10 million from the exercise of the share warrants attached to the ODIRNANE bonds.

As part of this financing of the Company through Notes and Warrants, certain shareholders2 in NOXXON have signed a lock-up agreement covering all their shares until December 31, 2017. «This financing is an important event for NOXXON Pharma as it allows the company to conduct the NOX-A12 clinical trial in collaboration with Merck & Co. Inc./MSD in patients with metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer who generally do not respond to checkpoint inhibitors alone, and should allow the company to reach top line response data» commented Aram Mangasarian, CEO of NOXXON. Use of Proceeds These funds will be used for the clinical development of NOX-A12 in advanced solid tumors and general corporate purposes. Legal framework of the transaction The Company is a Dutch public limited liability company whose shares are listed on Alternext Paris, a multilateral trading facility operated by Euronext Paris S.A., with the ticker symbol ALNOX and the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN): NL0012044762. The Company has an authorized share capital of EUR 10,250,000 divided into 10,250,000 ordinary shares with a par value of EUR 1.00 each. Immediately prior to completion of the transaction, the Company’s issued share capital amounted to 2,051,097 shares with 35,000 ordinary shares held by the Company as treasury shares. On September 22, 2016, the general meeting authorized the Company’s Board of Directors to issue up 2,006,097 new Shares (representing 100% of the issued and outstanding capital at that time) and exclude any pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders in connection with such issuance for a period of three years. The new shares in connection with the Private Placement were issued by the Board of Directors, with approval from the Supervisory Board, under this existing delegation by the general meeting. Further, the Supervisory Board has in advance consented to the issuance by the Board of Directors of such further number of Shares as needed upon the exercise of the Warrants and conversion of the Notes. The private placement of new shares and Warrants is not based on a prospectus approved by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets, the AFM or the French regulator, the AMF.

Linked to this conversion Kreos will also be issued 49,724 warrants with an exercise price of €18.60. The share warrants will have the same characteristics (other than exercise price) as the BSA share warrants attached to the ODIRNANE bonds (see below). The amount of debt held by Kreos is thus brought to €1 682 thousand. Following the transfer of the shares of the Company to the “public offering” compartment of AlterNext Paris and the issuance of the first tranche of the ODIRNANE for €1 million, additional €841 thousand3 of Kreos Debt will be converted into shares at a price per share equal to the lower of (i) €15.50 and (ii) the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) over the last 10 trading days preceding the transfer of the shares of the Company to the public offering market compartment of Alternext Paris. As part of this debt conversion of €841 thousand of Kreos Debt Kreos will also receive 45 219 share warrants with an exercise price of €18.60. These share warrants will have the same characteristics (other than exercise price) as the BSA share warrants attached to the ODIRNANE bonds (see below). In the case of a new equity financing4 or a cash contribution as part of a licensing transaction with pharmaceutical partner, an amount of the Kreos Debt equal to the amount of the funds received by the Company will be converted into shares at a price per share equal that used in the equity financing in the case of an equity financing and in other cases a the lower of (i) €15.50 and (ii) the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) over the last 10 trading days preceding the transfer of the shares of the Company to the public offering market compartment of Alternext Paris.

ANNEX: Characteristics, terms and conditions of the financing through the issuance of convertible notes with share subscription warrants attached Terms of the transaction The agreement between Noxxon Pharma N.V. (the “Company”) and YA II PN, Ltd (the “Investor”) covers, subject to the transfer of the Company’s shares from the “private placement” compartment to the “public offering” compartment of Alternext Paris, the issuance by the Company to the Investor of Notes with Warrants attached. The Investor commits over 36 months from the date hereof, upon request of the Company and subject that certain conditions are satisfied (see Note 1 hereafter), to subscribe Notes with Warrants attached. The Investor has also the right to subscribe Notes with Warrants attached at its sole discretion. Subject to the execution of the conversion of Kreos Debt as described above, the first tranche of Notes with Warrants attached will be issued at the latest on the tenth trading day following the transfer of the Company’s shares from the “private placement” compartment to the “public offering” compartment of Alternext Paris. This first tranche will have a nominal amount of €1 million. Tranches n°2 to n°6 will have a nominal amount of €0.5 million each. Subsequent tranches will have a nominal amount of €0.25 million each. The amount of the tranches may be modified upon mutual consent between the Company and the Investor. The detailed characteristics of the Notes and Warrants will be available on Noxxon’s website (www.noxxon.com). It is specified that this financing will not give rise to the filing of a prospectus with the AMF but its implementation is subject to the transfer of the Company’s shares from the “private placement” compartment to the “public offering” compartment of Alternext Paris. The transfer of the shares will give rise to the filing of a prospectus with the AFM. The Company plans to file the draft of the prospectus with the AFM in the following days. Main characteristics of the Notes The Notes have a nominal value of €10,000 each and will be subscribed at 99% of such nominal value. The Notes bear no interest and don’t have any maturity date and will not be redeemable in cash, except in the case of early redemption and if the Company elects to remit cash upon a Conversion (as described below). Each Note gives its holders a conversion right (a “Conversion“) to receive, at the Company’s discretion (i) cash, (ii) ordinary shares, or (iii) a combination of cash and ordinary shares. If the Company chooses to remit cash, the corresponding amount shall be equal to: A = (Nv / Cp) * VWAP “A“: cash amount payable to the Note holder; “Nv“: nominal value of the Note (€10,000); “Cp“: “Conversion Price“, equal to 92% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price of the Company’s share during the relevant pricing period6; “VWAP“: the volume weighted average price of the Company’s share on the Conversion date. If the Company chooses to remit new and/or existing shares, the corresponding number of shares shall be equal to: N = Nv / Cp “N“: number of new and/or existing shares to be remitted to the Note holder; “Nv“: nominal value of the Note (€10,000); “Cp“: the applicable Conversion Price. The Note will be freely transferable and will not be admitted to trading on Alternext Paris and therefore will not be listed. Main characteristics of the Warrants The number of Warrants to be issued under each tranche will be such that, multiplied by their strike price (determined as described below), the resulting amount shall be equal to the principal amount of the tranche of Notes to which the said Warrants are attached. The Warrants shall be immediately detached from the Notes. They will be freely transferable and the Company may request their admission to trading on Alternext Paris upon request of the Investor. The Warrants shall have a maturity of 4 years from their respective issuance date. Each Warrant will give right to subscribe 1 new share (subject to adjustments). The strike price of the Warrants will be equal to 120% of the lower of (i) the lowest daily volume weighted average price of the share over the pricing period of the Warrant’s strike price, which is the 10 consecutive trading days preceding the request of subscription Notes to which the Warrants are attached, it being specified that if the subscription of Notes is done at the Investor’s discretion, the pricing period of the Warrant’s strike price is the trading days during which the Investor has not sold any Company’s share in the market among the ten consecutive trading days expiring on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Notes are subscribed and (ii) €15.50. For information purposes, on the basis of the closing price of the Company’s share on April 28, 2017 (i.e. €21.90), the theoretical value of the Warrants is between €5.12 and €8.07 in function of the used volatility (i.e. between 20% and 40%). The theoretical value of a Warrant is obtained using the Black & Scholes model on the basis of the following assumptions: – Strike price: €18.60 – Maturity: 4 years – No risk interest rate: 0% – Pay-out ratio: 0% New shares resulting from Conversion of Notes or exercise of Warrants The new shares issued upon Conversion of Notes or exercise of Warrants will be admitted to trading on Alternext Paris as from their issuance, will carry immediate and current dividend rights and will be fully assimilated to and fungible with the existing shares (ISIN code NL0012044762). The Company will publish and update on its website a follow-up table of the outstanding Notes, Warrants and number of shares.

The U.S. drugmaker said its fast-growing immuno-oncology drug Keytruda is gaining market share and sees future sales opportunities across multiple types of cancer, despite first quarter sales of $584 million falling just shy of analysts' estimates. The company said Keytruda has become "the most prescribed" product for previously untreated, or first-line, lung cancer and it is looking to expand its use in second-line lung therapy. Merck is awaiting a potential U.S. approval next week for Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy. "The approval could meaningfully boost sales of Keytruda given the size of the lung cancer market," said Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans of by far the largest oncology market. Research chief Roger Perlmutter called the combination "a major opportunity to establish Keytruda further as a real preferred treatment therapy." Keytruda use is also growing in head and neck cancers, with 15 percent of U.S. sales for that indication now compared with 40 percent from lung. Merck slightly raised its 2017 adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $3.76 to $3.88 per share from its prior view $3.72 to $3.87, due to a favorable foreign exchange environment. It now expects full-year revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from $38.6 billion-$40.1 billion. Total revenue rose 1.3 percent to $9.43 billion in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $9.25 billion, despite the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity on cholesterol drug Zetia, antibiotic Cubicin, Nasonex nasal spray, and new competition for rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in Europe. Merck's blockbuster cholesterol drug Vytorin will also face competition from cheap generic rivals going forward. "In addition to Keytruda, we've got multiple other launches that are showing good growth and we've got a strong portfolio of vaccines" to help offset loss of exclusivities, said Adam Schechter, Merck's head of global human health. Merck's hepatitis C treatment Zepatier had sales of $378 million, topping analysts' estimates of $269 million, while sales of $532 million for Gardasil vaccine against human papillomavirus also sailed past Wall Street forecasts. Animal health sales grew 13 percent to $939 million. The company cautioned that animal health growth would be "more measured in subsequent quarters." Excluding items, Merck earned 88 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Merck shares were up 10 cents at $62.48.

Follow @MaxNisen Facebook Twitter Email Print Share May 2, 2017 3:07 PM EDT BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB CO -0.36 At Closing, May 2nd 55.95 USD You'll have to excuse Merck & Co. Inc. investors for being distracted on Tuesday; it's a little hard for them to focus on a somewhat fluky earnings report when the trajectory of a multi-billion-dollar cancer-drug market is about to be decided. Merck's first-quarter results topped analyst expectations, helped by the government and favorable foreign-exchange rates. But the company's future rests on an FDA decision, expected by May 10, on whether to approve a combination of its lead immune-boosting cancer drug Keytruda and chemotherapy to treat newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients. Keytruda is already approved in a subset of that population, and this approval could make the drug far more broadly available.   Meh Markets weren't overly impressed with Merck's first quarter earnings Source: Bloomberg Intraday times are displayed in ET. As Bloomberg News pointed out in its coverage of the company's earnings, Merck's fortunes are more and more tied to Keytruda. Its shares jumped 6 percent in November when it announced the FDA might approve its combo much earlier than expected. A similar stock move up or down is likely coming soon, depending on what happens over the next eight days.  Nothing else at Merck engenders as much excitement. The latest quarter's results, and a full-year revenue-forecast boost, were driven partly by government purchases of the HPV vaccine Gardasil, which are unlikely to repeat. Sales of Hepatitis C drug Zepatier were better than expected, but its market is in decline. Sales of Merck's best-selling drugs, the diabetes medicines Januvia and Janumet, fell 5 percent from a year ago and missed analyst expectations by nearly $100 million. Patent expirations, particularly for the heart drugs Zetia and Vytorin, cost Merck nearly $700 million in sales in the quarter, and the company expects to lose even more as the year progresses. The Key Keytruda is Merck's primary bastion against a sales decline for many of its biggest drugs. A jump in Gardasil sales came from government stocking Source: Merck *Zepatier's launch is so recent that y-o-y comparison is misleading. Keytruda's opportunity is enormous -- the market for this generation of IO drugs is expected to approach $20 billion by 2020 -- and Merck needs to seize it. Its chemo combo is its best near-term chance to do so. But approval is not certain because Merck's trial was relatively small and early-stage. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. won the first round of the IO lung-cancer fight with an aggressive strategy. While Merck restricted Keytruda trials to patients whose tumors expressed a high level of a biomarker (PD-L1) that predicts the drug will be more likely to succeed, Bristol tested Opdivo in a larger group of patients. Doctors are required to test previously treated patients for the biomarker in order to prescribe Keytruda, but have been able to freely recommend Opdivo since 2015.   But when Bristol tried this same aggressive approach in newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients, it fell flat on its face, with a failed trial in August. Merck's more cautious approach, meanwhile, led to Keytruda becoming the only drug of this type approved in the population in October, albeit only in high PD-L1 patients.  An early chemo-combo approval would substantially amplify Merck's victory. First, it could broaden Keytruda's use and weaken Bristol's no-testing advantage (Merck included patients regardless of PD-L1 expression in its combo trial).  Second, the combination is notably more effective than Keytruda alone. And third, an approval will create a formidable competitive barrier to rivals trying to expand IO market share with combos of their own. Bristol and AstraZeneca PLC will release data this year on combinations of two different IO drugs in lung cancer that may have worse side effects relative to Merck's approach. Roche Holding AG is still running a trial for its own chemo combo. With an approval, Keytruda may surpass Opdivo as the best-selling drug in this class overall as soon as this year. With a rejection or a significant delay, Merck would weaken its chances of dominating the largest market for this group of drugs.   Neck and Neck The race for IO supremacy is still close, but Merck could pull ahead Source: Bloomberg Opdivo still generated nearly twice as much revenue as Keytruda in the first quarter because of its earlier and broader approval in previously treated lung-cancer patients. This is Merck's chance to turn the tables, and such opportunities will likely be few and far between.  AstraZeneca's Imfinzi got its first FDA approval on Monday, bringing the total number of marketed drugs in this class to five. Each drug is involved in a huge variety of studies of potential new uses, and drugmakers are increasingly emulating each others' approaches to combo partners and trial design. Being the only drug on offer for a group of patients, let alone one as large as the population of newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients, will become an increasingly rare experience. This is probably Merck's best shot to fully enjoy it.   This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Merck & Company, Inc. reports earnings, Tuesday, May 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) Strict cost controls, along with surging sales of its two newest medicines and a surprisingly strong performance from its entire vaccine portfolio pushed Merck & Co. beyond most expectations for the first quarter and the company boosted its outlook for the year. The company has begun a new cycle in which sales of its latest drugs grow as revenue fades for older drugs facing new generic competition, particularly its blockbuster cholesterol pills Zetia and Vytorin. Other Merck drugs are facing more brand-name competition. Meanwhile Merck's crucial diabetes franchise, already under pressure from insurers for bigger discounts, was hurt by a shift in the timing of orders by large U.S. purchasers. Combined sales of its Januvia and Janumet diabetes treatments dipped 5 percent, to $1.34 billion. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Merck's new drugs are picking up the slack, however. Sales of Zepatier, the hepatitis C drug launched a year ago, rocketed to $378 million, a pace that will soon make it a blockbuster with annual sales topping $1 billion. Revenue from the cancer medicine Keytruda, one of the top new immuno-oncology drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer, more than doubled to $584 million. It's approved for treating melanoma, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer, a fiercely competitive category in which it's the market leader. Keytruda also has pending approvals for bladder cancer, for a rare cancer caused by DNA repair defects and for treating lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The latter use could be approved by the middle of next week. Meanwhile, Merck is running scores of other patient tests of Keytruda for still more cancer types. Merck on Tuesday reported net income of $1.55 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.13 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 88 cents per share, a nickel above what analysts expected. "We're seeing strong performance across all elements of Merck's businesses," CEO Kenneth Frazier told analysts during a conference call. Merck slashed spending on manufacturing and materials a whopping 16 percent to $3.02 billion, while boosting spending on research and development 8 percent to $1.8 billion in the quarter. The drugmaker posted revenue of $9.43 billion, also topping Street forecasts for $9.29 billion. Its prescription drugs business produced $8.19 billion of that revenue, up 1 percent, while its animal health unit had sales of $939 million, up 13 percent. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, raised its financial forecast for the year, saying it expects earnings between $2.51 and $2.63 per share, including one-time items, up from its January forecast of $2.47 to $2.62 per share. It now expects revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from its January forecast for $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion.

The company has begun a new cycle in which sales of its latest drugs grow as revenue fades for older drugs facing new generic competition, particularly its blockbuster cholesterol pills Zetia and Vytorin. Other Merck drugs are facing more brand-name competition. Meanwhile Merck’s crucial diabetes franchise, already under pressure from insurers for bigger discounts, was hurt by a shift in the timing of orders by large U.S. purchasers. Combined sales of its Januvia and Janumet diabetes treatments dipped 5 percent, to $1.34 billion. Merck’s new drugs are picking up the slack, however. Sales of Zepatier, the hepatitis C drug launched a year ago, rocketed to $378 million, a pace that will soon make it a blockbuster with annual sales topping $1 billion. Revenue from the cancer medicine Keytruda, one of the top new immuno-oncology drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer, more than doubled to $584 million. It’s approved for treating melanoma, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer, a fiercely competitive category in which it’s the market leader. Keytruda also has pending approvals for bladder cancer, for a rare cancer caused by DNA repair defects and for treating lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The latter use could be approved by the middle of next week. Meanwhile, Merck is running scores of other patient tests of Keytruda for still more cancer types. Merck on Tuesday reported net income of $1.55 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.13 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 88 cents per share, a nickel above what analysts expected. “We’re seeing strong performance across all elements of Merck’s businesses,” CEO Kenneth Frazier told analysts during a conference call. Merck slashed spending on manufacturing and materials a whopping 16 percent to $3.02 billion, while boosting spending on research and development 8 percent to $1.8 billion in the quarter. The drugmaker posted revenue of $9.43 billion, also topping Street forecasts for $9.29 billion. Its prescription drugs business produced $8.19 billion of that revenue, up 1 percent, while its animal health unit had sales of $939 million, up 13 percent. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, raised its financial forecast for the year, saying it expects earnings between $2.51 and $2.63 per share, including one-time items, up from its January forecast of $2.47 to $2.62 per share. It now expects revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from its January forecast for $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. Credit-Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote to investors that sales of Januvia and Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, drove Merck’s total sales above analysts’ expectations, but the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker had greater-than-expected declines to older products Zetia, Vytorin and Remicade, an immune disorder blockbuster whose sales plunged 34 percent to $229 million.

Smith Helaine Kang Home Energy Mining Tech Pharma & Biotech Home News Newswires NYSE:MRK Merck & Co raises forecasts again as new drugs prove worth Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 09:31 02 May 2017 Prescription drugs overall chipped in sales of US$8.2bn out of a total US$9.43bn Keytruda is being used to treat a number of different cancers Pharma giant Merck & Co (NYSE:MRK) raised its forecasts as sales of its top cancer drug Keytruda again surpassed expectations. The immuno-oncology treatment comfortably more than  doubled sales at US$584mln in the three months to March as its use as therapy for cancer continues to broaden. Prescription drugs overall chipped in sales of US$8.2bn out of a total US$9.43bn, with the group total around US$200mln above consensus. Hepatitis C drug Zepatier, like Keytruda one of Merck’s new wave of prescription treatments, also had a stellar quarter with sales jumping to US$378mln just a year after launch.  This helped offset slower sales of some of Merck’s older drugs such as Zetia and Vytorin. Net income to March was $1.55bn, or 56 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-offs were 88c per share. For the full year, the group no expects earnings per share of between US$2.51 and $2.63 per share, a 1.6% rise from previous guidance in January. Revenues should come in at between US$39.1bn to US$40.3bn, up from its January forecast for $38.6bn to $40.1bn. Shares rose 1% to US$62.95.

Merck raised its full-year forecast Tuesday after sales of Keytruda, Merck’s drug for skin and lung cancers, more than doubled in the first quarter to $584 million. While that was short of analysts’ lofty expectations, Merck is catching up after Bristol-Myers’s rival drug Opdivo suffered a series of setbacks. Keytruda has been approved for new uses, while Opdivo last year failed in a major trial of lung cancer patients. Bristol-Myers said last month that sales of Opdivo declined compared with the fourth quarter. “We see it as foundational and transformational for oncologists,” Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s head of research and development, said on a call with investors. “The goal has been to actually change the shape of the survival curve.” Merck’s adjusted earnings this year will be $3.76 to $3.88 a share, the company said in a statement, up from a previous forecast of $3.72 to $3.87. The shares were up less than 1 percent to $62.94 at 9:36 a.m. in New York as investors weighed the growth of Keytruda against lackluster sales of Merck’s biggest products, the diabetes pill Januvia and its sister treatment Janumet. Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, called it a “mixed to net negative quarter,” citing the high expectations for Keytruda. “The focus will be on Keytruda’s light performance and outlook, as well as Januvia’s weakness,” he said, adding that he expects the cancer drug to grow faster in the second half of the year. Arfaei has an outperform rating on the shares. Merck is increasingly reliant on Keytruda to become its next major blockbuster as its diabetes business starts to come under pressure. Januvia and Janumet sales fell 5.5 percent percent from a year before to $1.34 billion. The decline in Januvia sales makes Merck the latest drugmaker to report a slowdown for diabetes drugs, after Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc both blamed price pressures for hurting sales in the first quarter. Merck said the diabetes sales decline was due to the timing of purchases. Merck also increased its revenue forecast to $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, from $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. First-quarter earnings, excluding some items, were 88 cents a share, beating the 83-cent average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Mai 2017 , aktualisiert 02. Mai 2017, 15:07 Uhr Bild vergrößern Der US-Pharmariese hat im ersten Quartal rund 584 Millionen Dollar mit dem Krebsmedikament Keytruda verdient. Bild:  Reuters Quelle:Handelsblatt Online Der US-Pharmakonzern Merck ist auf Wachstumskurs. Der Gewinn fiel im ersten Quartal mit 1,55 Milliarden Dollar überraschend stark aus. Wachstumstreiber ist vor allem die Krebsimmuntherapie Keytruda. FrankfurtEin starkes Geschäft mit seinem wichtigsten Krebsmedikament, mit Impfstoffen und einem Mittel zur Behandlung von Hepatitis C hält Merck & Co auf Wachstumskurs. Der US-Pharmakonzern baute seinen Gewinn im ersten Quartal stärker als erwartet aus und erhöhte seine Ziele für das Gesamtjahr. Im ersten Jahresviertel kletterte der Nettogewinn um 38 Prozent auf 1,55 Milliarden Dollar, wie das Unternehmen am Dienstag mitteilte. Der Umsatz legte um 1,3 Prozent auf 9,43 Milliarden Dollar zu. Zwar hat Merck & Co mit Patentverlusten und einem mauen Geschäft mit Diabetesmitteln zu kämpfen. Als Zugpferd erweist sich jedoch die Krebsimmuntherapie Keytruda, deren Umsätze auf 584 Millionen Dollar von 249 Millionen vor Jahresfrist in die Höhe schnellten. Starke Zuwächse verzeichnete auch das Hepatitismittel Zepatier. Anzeige Merck profitierte zum Jahresauftakt auch von niedrigeren Ausgaben im Zusammenhang mit Zukäufen, Verkäufen und Restrukturierungsmaßnahmen. Für 2017 rechnet der Konzern nun mit einem bereinigten Gewinn je Aktie von 3,76 bis 3,88 Dollar statt der bislang prognostizierten 3,72 bis 3,87 Dollar. Die Umsatzprognose wurde auf 39,1 bis 40,3 Milliarden von 38,6 bis 40,1 Milliarden Dollar angehoben. rtrQuelle:  Handelsblatt Online Schlagworte: Anlagetipp-Aktie Aktie Umweltbelastung-Klima Pharmazeutika © Sie wollen unsere Inhalte verwenden?

(Foto: Reuters) FrankfurtEin starkes Geschäft mit seinem wichtigsten Krebsmedikament, mit Impfstoffen und einem Mittel zur Behandlung von Hepatitis C hält Merck & Co auf Wachstumskurs. Der US-Pharmakonzern baute seinen Gewinn im ersten Quartal stärker als erwartet aus und erhöhte seine Ziele für das Gesamtjahr. Im ersten Jahresviertel kletterte der Nettogewinn um 38 Prozent auf 1,55 Milliarden Dollar, wie das Unternehmen am Dienstag mitteilte. Der Umsatz legte um 1,3 Prozent auf 9,43 Milliarden Dollar zu. Zwar hat Merck & Co mit Patentverlusten und einem mauen Geschäft mit Diabetesmitteln zu kämpfen. Als Zugpferd erweist sich jedoch die Krebsimmuntherapie Keytruda, deren Umsätze auf 584 Millionen Dollar von 249 Millionen vor Jahresfrist in die Höhe schnellten. Starke Zuwächse verzeichnete auch das Hepatitismittel Zepatier. Boehringer, Bayer, Novartis: Die größten Pharmakonzerne der Welt Platz 20: Astellas Gemessen am reinen Pharmaumsatz ist Astellas die Nummer zwei der japanischen Pharmaindustrie. Der Schwerpunkt liegt auf Transplantationsmedizin, Onkologie und Antiinfektiva. Die Japaner kamen im vergangenen Jahr auf einen Umsatz von 11,1 Milliarden Dollar.Foto: dpa Bild 1 von 20 Merck profitierte zum Jahresauftakt auch von niedrigeren Ausgaben im Zusammenhang mit Zukäufen, Verkäufen und Restrukturierungsmaßnahmen. Für 2017 rechnet der Konzern nun mit einem bereinigten Gewinn je Aktie von 3,76 bis 3,88 Dollar statt der bislang prognostizierten 3,72 bis 3,87 Dollar. Die Umsatzprognose wurde auf 39,1 bis 40,3 Milliarden von 38,6 bis 40,1 Milliarden Dollar angehoben.

Merck & Company, Inc. reports earnings, Tuesday, May 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) Posted: Tuesday, May 2, 2017 9:22 am | Updated: 9:45 am, Tue May 2, 2017. Merck tops Street 1Q forecasts on cost cuts, new drug sales Associated Press | Strict cost controls, along with surging sales of its two newest medicines and a surprisingly strong performance from its entire vaccine portfolio pushed Merck & Co. beyond most expectations for the first quarter and the company boosted its outlook for the year. The company has begun a new cycle in which sales of its latest drugs grow as revenue fades for older drugs facing new generic competition, particularly its blockbuster cholesterol pills Zetia and Vytorin. Other Merck drugs are facing more brand-name competition. Meanwhile Merck's crucial diabetes franchise, already under pressure from insurers for bigger discounts, was hurt by a shift in the timing of orders by large U.S. purchasers. Combined sales of its Januvia and Janumet diabetes treatments dipped 5 percent, to $1.34 billion. Merck's new drugs are picking up the slack, however. Sales of Zepatier, the hepatitis C drug launched a year ago, rocketed to $378 million, a pace that will soon make it a blockbuster with annual sales topping $1 billion. Revenue from the cancer medicine Keytruda, one of the top new immuno-oncology drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer, more than doubled to $584 million. It's approved for treating melanoma, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer, a fiercely competitive category in which it's the market leader. Keytruda also has pending approvals for bladder cancer, for a rare cancer caused by DNA repair defects and for treating lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The latter use could be approved by the middle of next week. Meanwhile, Merck is running scores of other patient tests of Keytruda for still more cancer types. Merck on Tuesday reported net income of $1.55 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.13 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 88 cents per share, a nickel above what analysts expected. "We're seeing strong performance across all elements of Merck's businesses," CEO Kenneth Frazier told analysts during a conference call. Merck slashed spending on manufacturing and materials a whopping 16 percent to $3.02 billion, while boosting spending on research and development 8 percent to $1.8 billion in the quarter. The drugmaker posted revenue of $9.43 billion, also topping Street forecasts for $9.29 billion. Its prescription drugs business produced $8.19 billion of that revenue, up 1 percent, while its animal health unit had sales of $939 million, up 13 percent. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, raised its financial forecast for the year, saying it expects earnings between $2.51 and $2.63 per share, including one-time items, up from its January forecast of $2.47 to $2.62 per share. It now expects revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from its January forecast for $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. Credit-Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote to investors that sales of Januvia and Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, drove Merck's total sales above analysts' expectations, but the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker had greater-than-expected declines to older products Zetia, Vytorin and Remicade, an immune disorder blockbuster whose sales plunged 34 percent to $229 million. In early trading, Merck shares dipped 5 cents to $62.33. _____ Follow Linda A. Johnson at www.twitter.com/LindaJ_onPharma Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:25 PM, May 2, 2017 Updated: 11:05 PM, May 2, 2017 Merck & Co Inc <MRK.N> on Tuesday reported better-than-expected profit in the first quarter as surprisingly strong demand for animal health products, vaccines and its hepatitis C treatment offset nearly $700 million in lower sales from drugs that lost patent protection. The U.S. drugmaker said its fast-growing immuno-oncology drug Keytruda is gaining market share and sees future sales opportunities across multiple types of cancer, despite first quarter sales of $584 million falling just shy of analysts' estimates. The company said Keytruda has become "the most prescribed" product for previously untreated, or first-line, lung cancer and it is looking to expand its use in second-line lung therapy. Merck is awaiting a potential U.S. approval next week for Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy. "The approval could meaningfully boost sales of Keytruda given the size of the lung cancer market," said Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans of by far the largest oncology market. Research chief Roger Perlmutter called the combination "a major opportunity to establish Keytruda further as a real preferred treatment therapy." Keytruda use is also growing in head and neck cancers, with 15 percent of U.S. sales for that indication now compared with 40 percent from lung. Merck slightly raised its 2017 adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $3.76 to $3.88 per share from its prior view $3.72 to $3.87, due to a favorable foreign exchange environment. It now expects full-year revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from $38.6 billion-$40.1 billion. Total revenue rose 1.3 percent to $9.43 billion in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $9.25 billion, despite the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity on cholesterol drug Zetia, antibiotic Cubicin, Nasonex nasal spray, and new competition for rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in Europe. Merck's blockbuster cholesterol drug Vytorin will also face competition from cheap generic rivals going forward. "In addition to Keytruda, we've got multiple other launches that are showing good growth and we've got a strong portfolio of vaccines" to help offset loss of exclusivities, said Adam Schechter, Merck's head of global human health. Merck's hepatitis C treatment Zepatier had sales of $378 million, topping analysts' estimates of $269 million, while sales of $532 million for Gardasil vaccine against human papillomavirus also sailed past Wall Street forecasts. Animal health sales grew 13 percent to $939 million. The company cautioned that animal health growth would be "more measured in subsequent quarters."

(MRK) reported a profit for the first-quarter 2017 that increased 38 percent from last year, while quarterly sales rose 1 percent. It narrowed and raises 2017 Full-Year profit outlook. Both adjusted earnings per share and sales for the quarter beat analysts' expectations. "Merck delivered solid performance across our broad range of products that address major disease categories and the needs of global health, The continued momentum of KEYTRUDA in oncology, along with the strength of the vaccine and other franchises and animal health, helped to drive revenue growth in the quarter," said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. Tn the Tuesday's pre-Market trade, MRK is trading at $63.39, up $1.01 or $1.62 percent. Net income attributable to the company for the first-quarter 2017 rose 38 percent to $1.55 billion from the prior year's $1.13 billion, with earnings per share improving to $0.56 from $0.40 last year. But, non-GAAP net income for the first-quarter declined to $2.44 billion or $0.88 per share, from $2.49 billion or $0.89 per share in the same quarter last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report earnings of $0.83 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. Worldwide sales were $9.43 billion for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 1 percent compared with the first quarter of 2016, including a 2 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. Analysts expected revenue of $9.25 billion for the quarter. On a GAAP basis, the gross margin was 68.0 percent for the first quarter of 2017 compared to 61.6 percent for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by a lower net impact from acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and restructuring costs which reduced gross margin by 9.8 percentage points in the first quarter of 2017 as compared with 15.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in gross margin also reflects the favorable effects of foreign exchange and lower inventory write-offs. The company has narrowed and raised its full-year 2017 GAAP earnings per share range to be between $2.51 and $2.63. It has narrowed and raised its full-year 2017 non-GAAP earnings per share range to be between $3.76 and $3.88, including an approximately 1.5 percent negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-April 2017 exchange rates. It has narrowed and raised its full-year 2017 revenue range to be between $39.1 billion and $40.3 billion, including an approximately 1.5 percent negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-April 2017 exchange rates. Wall Street currently is looking for fiscal year 2017 earnings of $3.81 per share on annual revenues of $39.72 billion. While announcing the fourth-quarter result, Merck said it expected earnings per share in a range of $2.47 to $2.62, adjusted earnings of $3.72 to $3.87 per share and sales of $38.6 billion and $40.1 billion for fiscal year 2017. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Hollywood's 10 Highest Paid Film Stars Gold Diggers Delight: The Richest Single People On Earth Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers More Earnings Tredegar Corp Q1 Income Declines 20% EARNINGS SUMMARY: Details of Radisys Corp Q1 Earnings Report EARNINGS SUMMARY: Details of Olin Corp Q1 Earnings Report Jack Henry & Associates Inc Q3 Earnings Advance 11% WestJet To Buy Up To 20 Dreamliners For Long Routes From Canada Martin Marietta Materials Inc.

The company has begun a new cycle in which sales of its latest drugs grow as revenue fades for older drugs facing new generic competition, particularly its blockbuster cholesterol pills Zetia and Vytorin. Other Merck drugs are facing more brand-name competition. Meanwhile Merck’s crucial diabetes franchise, already under pressure from insurers for bigger discounts, was hurt by a shift in the timing of orders by large U.S. purchasers. Combined sales of its Januvia and Janumet diabetes treatments dipped 5 percent, to $1.34 billion. Merck’s new drugs are picking up the slack, however. Air Force makes big personnel changes to widen talent pool Advertisement Sales of Zepatier, the hepatitis C drug launched a year ago, rocketed to $378 million, a pace that will soon make it a blockbuster with annual sales topping $1 billion. Revenue from the cancer medicine Keytruda, one of the top new immuno-oncology drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer, more than doubled to $584 million. It’s approved for treating melanoma, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer, a fiercely competitive category in which it’s the market leader. Keytruda also has pending approvals for bladder cancer, for a rare cancer caused by DNA repair defects and for treating lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The latter use could be approved by the middle of next week. Meanwhile, Merck is running scores of other patient tests of Keytruda for still more cancer types. Merck on Tuesday reported net income of $1.55 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.13 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 88 cents per share, a nickel above what analysts expected. “We’re seeing strong performance across all elements of Merck’s businesses,” CEO Kenneth Frazier told analysts during a conference call. ‘If you’re a really good federal worker, you should welcome’ the reorganization plan, OMB says Merck slashed spending on manufacturing and materials a whopping 16 percent to $3.02 billion, while boosting spending on research and development 8 percent to $1.8 billion in the quarter. The drugmaker posted revenue of $9.43 billion, also topping Street forecasts for $9.29 billion. Its prescription drugs business produced $8.19 billion of that revenue, up 1 percent, while its animal health unit had sales of $939 million, up 13 percent. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, raised its financial forecast for the year, saying it expects earnings between $2.51 and $2.63 per share, including one-time items, up from its January forecast of $2.47 to $2.62 per share. It now expects revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from its January forecast for $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. Credit-Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote to investors that sales of Januvia and Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, drove Merck’s total sales above analysts’ expectations, but the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker had greater-than-expected declines to older products Zetia, Vytorin and Remicade, an immune disorder blockbuster whose sales plunged 34 percent to $229 million. In early trading, Merck shares dipped 5 cents to $62.33. _____ Follow Linda A.

Inc. MRK, +0.51% rallied 2% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the drug giant reported first-quarter profit and sales that rose above expectations, and lifted its full-year outlook. Net income increased to $1.55 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $1.13 billion, or 40 cents a share in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 88 cents, beating the FactSet consensus of 83 cents. Revenue rose 1% to $9.43 billion from $9.31 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $9.25 billion, as better-than-expected Januvia/Janumet and animal health sales helped offset a miss for Keytruda. For 2017, Merck raised its adjusted EPS outlook to $3.76 to $3.88 from $3.72 to $3.87 and its revenue outlook to $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion from $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion.

Engine maker Cummins sent manufacturers and other industrial companies higher after reporting solid first-quarter earnings. A late slump took the price of oil to its lowest price in almost six months. Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler all fell after they said sales declined in April. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Financial Partners, said auto sales have weakened because lenders are growing a bit hesitant to make loans to help people buy cars. “It’s more a story specific to the auto sector as opposed to a slowdown in consumer spending,” he said. Thanks to an upturn in the last few minutes of trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 2.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,391.17. The Dow Jones industrial average added 36.43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,949.89. The Nasdaq composite set another record as it picked up 3.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,095.37. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks sank 8 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,399.36. The six largest auto makers in the U.S. all said their sales fell in April. Vehicle sales have set records the last few years and analysts are worried the streak is ending and car companies are relying too much on discounts and incentives to keep their sales numbers high. Ford lost 50 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $10.92 and GM gave up $1, or 2.9 percent, to $33.20 while Fiat Chrysler skidded 49 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $10.92. Car retailers, rental companies and parts suppliers slipped as well. Industrial companies made some of the biggest gains. Cummins reported a far bigger profit and better sales than analysts expected, and its stock climbed $9.23, or 6.1 percent, to $160.56. The company said demand from construction and mining sales grew compared with the same period a year ago, but truck production in North America fell. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.18, or 2.4 percent, to $47.66 a barrel in New York. That’s its lowest price since mid-November. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed $1.06, or 2.1 percent, to $50.46 a barrel in London. Health care stocks shook off an early loss. Merck climbed after it reported strong sales of newer medications including its cancer drug Keytruda and hepatitis C drug Zepatier, and its stock gained 32 cents to $62.70. Hospital chain Tenet Healthcare jumped $3.31, or 21.6 percent, to $18.66 after it agreed to sell three hospitals to HCA Holdings for $725 million and said it will rejoin insurer Humana’s network. Technology stocks rose further. The S&P 500’s technology index, which includes 69 major companies, is at its highest levels since March 2000, the peak of the dot-com boom. However it’s still well below the records it set back then. Apple gained 93 cents to $147.51 during regular trading. Its stock lost 2 percent in aftermarket trading after the company reported results that included slightly disappointing quarterly iPhone sales. Its guidance also wasn’t as strong as investors hoped. Consumer products companies slipped. Drugstore operator and pharmacy benefits manager CVS Health lost $2.96, or 3.6 percent, to $79 and agricultural company Archer-Daniels-Midland shed $4.06, or 8.9 percent, to $41.67 after their respective earnings reports. Consumer reviews website Angie’s List soared after it agreed to be bought by media company IAC/InterActiveCorp. IAC/InterActive wants to combine Angie’s List with its HomeAdvisor.com business, which offers resources for home repair and improvement projects. The company will be called ANGI Homeservices. IAC/InterActive offered to buy Angie’s List in 2015 for $8.75 a share, which Angie’s List said was too low. On Tuesday its stock jumped $3.6, or 61.5 percent, to $9.51 and IAC/InterActive rose $12.05, or 14.3 percent, to $96.24. Health insurer Molina Healthcare fired CEO Mario Molina and chief financial officer John Molina, citing the company’s poor financial performance. The Medicaid administrator was founded by their father, David Molina, who died in 1996. The stock jumped $8.95, or 17.6 percent, to $59.75. Bond prices headed higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.28 percent from 2.32 percent. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline dipped 1 cent to $1.51 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cents to $1.47 a gallon. Natural gas gave up 2 cents to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $1.50 to $1,257 an ounce. Silver fell 1 cent to $16.83 an ounce. Copper lost 3 cents to $2.64 a pound. The dollar rose to 112 yen from 111.83 yen. The euro rose to $1.0928 from $1.0906. In Greece the Athex composite jumped 3.1 percent after the country and its creditors agreed Greece should make another round of pension cuts in 2019 and commit to a budget target when its current bailout program ends next year. That deal will restart bailout loan payments to Greece, meaning it won’t face default. That could have touched off another eurozone crisis. Other European stocks also rallied. The CAC 40 in France added 0.7 percent while Britain’s FTSE 100 index gained 0.6 percent. In Germany, the DAX rose 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.7 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.3 percent.

KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index was unchanged at 3,143.38 while Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 shed 0.6 percent to 5,917.60. South Korean markets also were closed. Benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia advanced. Trader Gregory Roqwe, left, and specialist David Haubner work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Tuesday, May 2, 2017.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) (The Associated Press) WALL STREET: U.S. stocks gained but reports by automakers that their sales are shrinking offset strong results from industrial companies. Engine maker Cummins sent manufacturers and other industrial companies higher after reporting solid first-quarter earnings. Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler fell after they said April sales declined. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.1 percent to 2,391.17. The Dow Jones industrial average added gained 0.2 percent to 20,949.89. The Nasdaq composite set another record as it picked up 0.1 percent to 6,095.37.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) (The Associated Press) FED WATCH: Investors looked ahead to a meeting of policymakers of the U.S. Federal Reserve to discuss interest-rate policy. Many investors expect the Fed to freeze the benchmark interest rate this month but are looking to a post-meeting statement for signs of when the next hike might come. The CME Group's FedWatch tool says futures markets indicate a 66 percent chance of a hike in June. Ronald Madarasz works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Tuesday, May 2, 2017. U.S. stocks are opening slightly higher as investors find a lot to like in corporate first-quarter results. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) (The Associated Press) ANALYST'S TAKE: "Certainly, the poor vehicle sales print can be added to a growing list of below par U.S. data points of late and that will almost certainly be a theme the Federal Reserve will explore," said Chris Weston of IG in a report. "Keep in mind the interest rate markets are pricing a 60 percent chance of a hike from the Fed in June, so this probability will move depending on the tone of the statement."

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) (The Associated Press) AUTO SLOWDOWN: U.S. auto sales fell 4.7 percent last month, the most pronounced slowdown of the year and a strong indication that 2017 will put an end to seven straight years of growth. Auto executives and analysts, who have been anticipating a slowdown, saw no cause for panic. Many expect sales in the important economic sector to top 17 million for the third straight year, an industry first. Sales have dropped for four straight months, the first time that's happened since the economy ground to a halt in 2009. April sales totaled just over 1.4 million, which translates to an annual sales rate of 16.9 million, far below last year's record of 17.5 million. The April decline brought year-to-date sales down by 2.4 percent from a year ago. Trader Richard Newman, left, works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Tuesday, May 2, 2017.

This also reduces any propensity of volatility in the future market unless the development of drug having a special property such as additional benefit for patients suffering from other diseases. Thus a premium can be charged on special anti-hypertensive drugs such as /angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors which prolong survival in patients with congestive heart failure and diabetes mellitus.

This is why. By Ben Levisohn May 2, 2017 11:59 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of Pfizer (PFE) are falling today after the pharmaceutical giant beat earnings forecasts but missed on sales. Pfizer reported an adjusted profit of 69 cents, beating forecasts for 67 cents, on sales of $12.8 billion, missing expectations for $13.1 billion. After listening to Pfizer's conference call, Bernstein's Tim Anderson and team wonder what might lift its stock from here: Twice now we have asked Pfizer directly about its commitment to the IO partnership it has with Merck KGaA: as part of Q4 results in January the answer seemed imprecise, but today's answers seemed like a much clearer commitment to the collaboration. The subtext here, of course, is whether PFE would potentially dump its partner, as would likely be required if it were to move on another big IO company such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) or AstraZeneca (AZN). It feels to us that despite Q1 results where the top-line was weak, PFE likely has valuation support on the downside….the question remains what is capable of lifting PFE shares higher? Shares of Pfizer have fallen 1% to $33.45 at 11:57 a.m. today, while Bristol-Myers Squibb has declined 0.4% to $56.07, and AstraZeneca has gained 1.3% to $30.65. Merck (MRK) has risen 0.5% to $62.70 after beating earnings forecasts of its own today.

Such repatriation moves usually do little boost economic growth but rather are boons for shareholders. Mark Fahey | Nick Wells 13 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Apple may be famous for keeping cash overseas, but many other companies stand to benefit if President Donald Trump gets his way with a tax holiday. The tech giant's quarterly results Tuesday are expected to show overall cash reserves of more than $250 billion, with the vast majority stockpiled offshore. That cash has been accumulated at a rate of $3.6 million an hour in recent months, according to The Wall Street Journal. On a per-share basis, the company's foreign earnings left overseas come to more than $40 a share, according to CNBC calculations using figures from a recent report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Unlike Apple, most companies do not report overseas cash breakdowns. But regulations do require that they report money that will be reinvested overseas and thus exempted from U.S. taxation. For many companies, that figure will include a substantial cash element. Here's how Apple's vast sum compares with other companies' overseas holdings on a per-share basis. The one-page tax plan outline released by the Trump administration last week indicated that Trump is pushing for a "one-time tax on trillions of dollars held overseas," as well as a "territorial tax system to level the playing field for American companies." It is unlikely that Trump's sparse tax plan will make it through Congress in its current form, and the rate would be for that one-time tax is unknown. Trump has mentioned a proposed rate of 10 percent. The tax on foreign reinvested income was one of the few ideas in the proposal that has the potential to bring in revenue, though it's unlikely to bring in enough to pay for the rest of the plan. Repatriation holidays are not a new idea. Former President Barack Obama once proposed such a tax, and then-President George W. Bush's 2004 American Jobs Creation Act gave corporations a one-time repatriation rate of 5.25 percent (versus the top rate of 35 percent). Companies brought back more than $300 billion, saving more than $3 billion in taxes, but the program failed to yield any substantial American job growth, according to a 2011 Senate investigation. Much of the money was instead returned to shareholders, despite rules intended to prevent that outcome. "I think that the lesson of the last repatriation holiday is that it's virtually impossible to prevent companies from doing what they want with repatriated cash in hand," said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. "When you offer a holiday, companies immediately start anticipating a second holiday and start stockpiling." Since the first holiday, companies have seen their off-shore holdings swell to $2.6 trillion. The largest stockpiles belong to many of the same companies that took advantage of the 2004 program — big names like Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, IBM and PepsiCo. While it is unclear which of many forms the final tax will take, companies could stand to save billions. Companies watching closely Apple may have the largest overall stockpile, but plenty of other countries could also see substantial gains from a repatriation holiday. Pfizer, for example, had $197 billion in unrepatriated income abroad last year, according to the ITEP report — that's about the same size as the company's total market cap. Merck, too, has seen substantial savings on untaxed earnings relative to its overall value. While some of that cash has likely gone into investments abroad, both companies would be able to bring billions back to the U.S. for domestic purchases. "To the extent that tax changes would make it cheaper for us to access financing, then you're quite right," Pfizer CEO Ian Read said on the company's January earnings call, referring to a repatriation holiday changing the company's capital development priorities. "Some deals that previously would not have been affordable may now be affordable." Speaking on earnings calls in recent years, executives of S&P 500 companies have often declined to provide information about their plans with offshore cash holdings. Repatriation at the current tax rate is usually avoided often enough that it is notable when large companies opt to retrieve cash and pay U.S. taxes. GE made news in 2015 when it paid $6 billion to bring home $36 billion from its sale of GE Capital. "I am confident that we're talking about the right things," Johnson & Johnson CFO Dominic Caruso said on a conference call after a recent visit to Washington. "We're talking about a lower U.S. tax rate, we're talking about a territorial system, and we're talking about some innovation and some incentive for job creation in the U.S." After the election, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins told CNBC that a repatriation deal would allow the company to create more jobs in the U.S. The company has more than $60 billion abroad. On the company's February earnings call, Robbins said cash repatriation would not fundamentally change the company's mergers and acquisitions strategy. But it could lead to cash back to investors. "If we were to increase our dividend, then that flows through the mutual funds, which flows through to the middle-class America, which flows through to make people feel better about their income," Robbins told CNBC after the election. "I think all that is good for business." But Gardner argues that any tax holiday would do little to realign incentives for companies that have grown accustomed to avoiding taxes through offshoring. The move would reward larger companies for that behavior but leave smaller companies out in the cold, he said. "These companies are offshoring profits artificially in anticipation of a special holiday," he said. "And for every company that is doing that, there are 10 small mom-and-pop companies that do business entirely in the U.S. and are complying with the law."

X MSD invests €40m in Tipperary plant Spray drying facility is the latest element in a €75 million upgrade of the Tipperary plant Tue, May 2, 2017, 05:15 Dominic Coyle At the announcement of MSD’s €40 million investment in its Ballydine plant in Co Tipperary were (from left) site lead Ger Carmody with Liz O’Donnell, director of policy, government affairs and communications at MSD Ireland and Ger Brennan, managing director for human health at MSD Ireland.         International pharma group MSD is investing €40 million to upgrade its Tipperary plant. The bulk of the money will be spent on the installation of a new spray drying facility at the Ballydine facility. Spray drying improves solubility of tablets by patients, according to the company, and how medicines are absorbed by patients. Until now, MSD – known in the United States as Merck – had no such facility in Ireland where it employs about 1,800 people. As a result, it was forced to send drugs from the Irish plant over to the US for this treatment before bringing them back to Europe, a spokesman for the company said. “This investment reflects the growing importance of MSD Ireland’s operations to our global network,” said Ballydine site lead Ger Carmody. “The investment will ensure Ballydine continues to be well positioned for the ongoing development of new products providing the technologies that our newer products require.” The spray drying facility is the latest element in a €75 million upgrade of the Tipperary plant, where the company employs around 600 people, over the past three years. Mr Carmody said MSD’s Ballydine workforce was now leading the way in the development of new medicines, including the group’s new hepatitis C drug Zepatier, which is being manufactured at the Tipperary factory for patients worldwide. The managing director of MSD human health Ger Brennan said the company’s Irish workforce – in Tipperary, Cork and Carlow – are playing a leading role in the production and development of next generation therapies. MSD announced a separate investment of up €25 million to expand its clinical trials programme in Ireland earlier this year. The investment will focus on trials of cancer drugs over the next three years.       Topics: Ger Brennan Ger Carmody Merck Msd Ballydine Tipperary Read More Harris looks to woo European Medicines Agency to Dublin Trinity Biotech records 63% drop in pretax profit Losses dip slightly at Alkermes to $72.6m Dublin-based drugs firm Icon reports rise in revenues Pharma group Shire to create 150 new jobs in Dublin GlaxoSmithKline posts 31% gain in first-quarter profit Jazz Pharma to recommend use of big-selling narcolepsy drug in children Eli Lilly’s profit beats expectations thanks to demand for new drugs United Drug to make €40m investment at Dublin headquarters Irish medtech firm Diaceutics signs major deal with US lab  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Companies Paddy Power Betfair revenue grows by 23% in Q1 Work Lucy Kellaway: Mondelez gives us a mouthful of unpalatable cliches Rugby Gordon D’Arcy: Clermont loss can be springboard for Leinster Health Holles Street doctors sought ice from pub to help patient Sponsored The Story of Home: Light and shade ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ The Story of Home: 'People need a sense of belonging' Charting a family adventure on the Shannon-Erne Waterways Latest Business EU raises UK Brexit bill to €100bn as Paris and Berlin harden stance 08:01 VW Q1 profit jumps 40% as brand cost cuts materialize 07:49 SMEs told to make their own preparations for Brexit 07:43 Paddy Power Betfair revenue grows by 23% in Q1 07:40 Brexit: JPMorgan Chase to move hundreds of bankers to Dublin 07:18 Most Read in Business 1 Brexit: JPMorgan Chase to move hundreds of bankers to Dublin 2 Irish shoppers exasperated by retail outlets’ in-store tech 3 Central Bank to assess if lenders broke debt restructuring rules 4 EU raises UK Brexit bill to €100bn as Paris and Berlin harden stance 5 First-time buyers: It’s cheaper to buy than rent, but do the sums 6 Contesting €35,000 award could cost firm €2m in legal fees 7 Crosbie received €1.7m from Vicar Street for expenses 8 David Hall must use all his skills in latest housing initiative 9 Paddy Power Betfair revenue grows by 23% in Q1 10 Unicorn restaurant site in Dublin on market for €9m Never miss a story.

Engine maker Cummins sent manufacturers and other industrial companies higher after reporting solid first-quarter earnings. A late slump took the price of oil to its lowest price in almost six months. Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler all fell after they said sales declined in April. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Financial Partners, said auto sales have weakened because lenders are growing a bit hesitant to make loans to help people buy cars. "It's more a story specific to the auto sector as opposed to a slowdown in consumer spending," he said. Thanks to an upturn in the last few minutes of trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,391.17. The Dow Jones industrial average added 36.43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,949.89. The Nasdaq composite set another record as it picked up 3.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,095.37. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks sank 8 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,399.36. The six largest automakers in the U.S. all said their sales fell in April. Vehicle sales have set records the last few years and analysts are worried the streak is ending and car companies are relying too much on discounts and incentives to keep their sales numbers high. Ford lost 50 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $10.92 and GM gave up $1, or 2.9 percent, to $33.20 while Fiat Chrysler skidded 49 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $10.92. Car retailers, rental companies and parts suppliers slipped as well. Industrial companies made some of the biggest gains. Cummins reported a far bigger profit and better sales than analysts expected, and its stock climbed $9.23, or 6.1 percent, to $160.56. The company said demand from construction and mining sales grew compared with the same period a year ago, but truck production in North America fell. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.18, or 2.4 percent, to $47.66 a barrel in New York. That's its lowest price since mid-November. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed $1.06, or 2.1 percent, to $50.46 a barrel in London. Health care stocks shook off an early loss. Merck climbed after it reported strong sales of newer medications including its cancer drug Keytruda and hepatitis C drug Zepatier, and its stock gained 32 cents to $62.70. Hospital chain Tenet Healthcare jumped $3.31, or 21.6 percent, to $18.66 after it agreed to sell three hospitals to HCA Holdings for $725 million and said it will rejoin insurer Humana's network. Technology stocks rose further. The S&P 500's technology index, which includes 69 major companies, is at its highest levels since March 2000, the peak of the dot-com boom.

AIDS is the most common risk factors of kaposi sarcoma, which develops in people who are infected with HIV. The Kaposi sarcoma therapeutics pipeline is expected to generate large revenue due to increasing awareness regarding cancer treatments, high demand for safe and effective medications, advancement in technologies and increasing prevalence of cancer and immunodeficiency syndrome. The American Cancer Society and other regulatory bodies are supporting the Kaposi sarcoma pipeline by providing increased funding and grants. Explore Report at: www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/kaposi-sarcoma-t… According to American Cancer Society, Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a cancer that develops from the cells that line lymph or blood vessels. It usually appears as tumors on the skin or on mucosal surfaces such as inside the mouth, but tumors can also develop in the other parts of the body, such as in the lymph nodes (bean-sized collections of immune cells throughout the body), the lungs, or digestive tract. The abnormal cells of kaposi sarcoma form purple, red, or brown blotches or tumors on the skin. These affected areas are called lesions. The skin lesions of Kaposi sarcoma most often appear on the legs or face. They may look bad, but they usually cause no symptoms. At times, some lesions on the legs or in the groin area may cause the legs and feet to swell painfully. Request for Table of Content at: www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/kaposi-sarcoma-t… Many companies have a pipeline of drugs for the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma, which are under clinical development. Vasgene Therapeutics, Inc plans to introduce a recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein, which is currently in Phase II. Recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein showed a promising result in blocking growth of blood vessels that provide blood to cancer. Apogee Biotechnology Corporation also plans to introduce a drug ABC294640, which is currently in Phase I clinical development for treatment of Kaposi sarcoma. Chiltern International Inc. plans to introduce a biological, XmAb13676, which is currently in Phase I clinical development.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — Despite strong results from industrial companies, U.S. stocks couldn’t get any momentum going today after car makers said their sales are shrinking. Engine maker Cummins sent manufacturers and other industrial companies higher after reporting solid first-quarter earnings. A late slump took the price of oil to its lowest price in almost six months. Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler all fell after they said sales declined in April.

Hospital chain Tenet Healthcare jumped $3.31, or 21.6 percent, to $18.66 after it agreed to sell three hospitals to HCA Holdings for $725 million and said it will rejoin insurer Humana’s network. Technology stocks rose further. The S&P 500’s technology index, which includes 69 major companies, is at its highest levels since March 2000, the peak of the dot-com boom. However it’s still well below the records it set back then. Apple gained 93 cents to $147.51 during regular trading. Its stock lost 2 percent in aftermarket trading after the company reported results that included slightly disappointing quarterly iPhone sales. Its guidance also wasn’t as strong as investors hoped. Consumer products companies slipped. Drugstore operator and pharmacy benefits manager CVS Health lost $2.96, or 3.6 percent, to $79 and agricultural company Archer-Daniels-Midland shed $4.06, or 8.9 percent, to $41.67 after their respective earnings reports. Consumer reviews website Angie’s List soared after it agreed to be bought by media company IAC/InterActiveCorp. IAC/InterActive wants to combine Angie’s List with its HomeAdvisor.com business, which offers resources for home repair and improvement projects. The company will be called ANGI Homeservices. IAC/InterActive offered to buy Angie’s List in 2015 for $8.75 a share, which Angie’s List said was too low. Today its stock jumped $3.6, or 61.5 percent, to $9.51 and IAC/InterActive rose $12.05, or 14.3 percent, to $96.24. Health insurer Molina Healthcare fired CEO Mario Molina and chief financial officer John Molina, citing the company’s poor financial performance. The Medicaid administrator was founded by their father, David Molina, who died in 1996. The stock jumped $8.95, or 17.6 percent, to $59.75. Bond prices headed higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.28 percent from 2.32 percent. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline dipped 1 cent to $1.51 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cents to $1.47 a gallon. Natural gas gave up 2 cents to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $1.50 to $1,257 an ounce. Silver fell 1 cent to $16.83 an ounce. Copper lost 3 cents to $2.64 a pound. The dollar rose to 112 yen from 111.83 yen. The euro rose to $1.0928 from $1.0906. In Greece the Athex composite jumped 3.1 percent after the country and its creditors agreed Greece should make another round of pension cuts in 2019 and commit to a budget target when its current bailout program ends next year. That deal will restart bailout loan payments to Greece, meaning it won’t face default. That could have touched off another eurozone crisis. Other European stocks also rallied. The CAC 40 in France added 0.7 percent while Britain’s FTSE 100 index gained 0.6 percent. In Germany, the DAX rose 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.7 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.3 percent.

The consultancy was founded by three engineers 21 years ago, to develop innovative new products for clients around the world in the healthcare and consumer sectors. Mike Cane, one of the founding partners, said: “Over the years we have grown organically and our success is the result of a lot of hard work and commitment from our talented team and loyal clients. Our growth has come from strong sales in continental Europe and the US, with well over half of our business coming from these export markets. When we founded the company, we wanted to be a leading international provider of product innovation services for healthcare and consumer products, and I think we can now say we have achieved this. “Over the last 3 years we have expanded our capabilities significantly to make CDP a ‘one stop shop’ for businesses like Unilever, Barclaycard and Merck Consumer Healthcare, who need to innovate and launch their next generation products quickly. “While our strength has traditionally been in engineering development and product design, we now have strong teams working in the front end of innovation that help our customers optimise their innovation plans, and at the back end where our manufacturing engineering group sets up new processes and multinational supply chains. “While not every project uses all of these capabilities, the sheer range of expertise we can deploy to solve innovation challenges benefits our clients across the board.” Matt Schumann, also a founding partner added: “Our growth in the US healthcare market this year has been a key part of our expansion. It is the result of many years investment in that market from which we have added several major accounts to our healthcare and diagnostics portfolio.” Mike Beadman, the third founding partner, concluded: “We are very optimistic about the future.

The Anti-Hypertensive Drug Market is characterised by low rate of return on most drugs due to greater penetration of generics due to loss of patents of major blockbusters. Thus the strategy of most companies revolve around same for less or more for more. Availability of a number of effective substitute and fragmentation of market along with good efficacy and cost effectiveness of traditional anti-hypertensive drugs act as a drag on charging a premium. This also reduces any propensity of volatility in the future market unless the development of drug having a special property such as additional benefit for patients suffering from other diseases. Thus a premium can be charged on special anti-hypertensive drugs such as /angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors which prolong survival in patients with congestive heart failure and diabetes mellitus. Thus combination therapy will be on the rise. The uptake of any newer drug will be slow in face of competition and apprehensions about its safety, efficacy and special benefit potential. Thus marketing cost will tend to be higher further reducing profits. Market Forecast: Market Research Future published a half-cooked research report on Anti-Hypertensive Drug Market.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 02, 2017 10:58am   Comments Share: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) results may grab the headlines today, but auto sales and a Fed meeting also compete for attention. It’s been a strong earnings season so far, helping drive markets to record or near-record peaks, and AAPL takes the field amid a big tech rally. Several key earnings releases hit the tape today, but AAPL is arguably the biggest story as the tech company reports after the close. Shares of AAPL rose Monday, and tech sector performance in general has been solid lately. Several major tech firms beat quarterly estimates last week and the tech-heavy Nasdaq set another record high Monday. Leaders Monday included Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB). AAPL is expected to report earnings of $2.02 per share, up from $1.90 in the same period last year, on revenue of $52.61 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. The big focus is on the company’s flagship smartphone products. iPhone sales are expected to increase 4.3% from a year ago, according to Wall Street estimates. But some analysts say smartphone demand appeared to weaken in Q1, and AAPL’s earnings could go a long way toward answering that question. In general, AAPL has a lot of momentum going into earnings, so we’ll see if it can live up to expectations. One of the more interesting narratives emerging among economists is the idea that U.S. Q1 earnings have been positive partly due to strong international demand. Economies in Europe and Asia have improved even as U.S. economic data shows signs of a slowdown, and some of the best-performing U.S. companies have large overseas sales. AAPL earnings today could shed further light, since AAPL has a big international presence. The Fed meeting today and tomorrow isn’t expected to result in any interest rate policy changes, according to the futures market (see below). Because of that, it’s getting a little lost in the news, but it’s still important to pay attention to anything the Fed might say on Wednesday. April auto and truck sales are another big event today. In March, U.S. light vehicle sales fell on a monthly and an annual basis. Combine weak auto sales with other recent declining economic data and you could have a recipe for concern. But if there’s better news from the auto lots today, it might give the market something to latch onto in the wake of disappointing economic data Monday (see below). Consensus is for an improved annual light vehicle sales rate in April, according to Wall Street analysts. Not everything is back-loaded today. Two of the biggest health companies, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), reported this morning, with MRK beating Wall Street analysts’ top- and bottom-line estimates but PFE pulling up short on revenue. On the energy side, ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) fell in pre-market trading after reporting an unexpected adjusted loss. Earnings across the board have generally been solid, and continue to help drive indices to record or near-record highs. European and Asian stocks look mostly higher, and oil rebounded a bit but remains below $50 a barrel. Ten-year Treasury yields climbed back to 2.33% in the early going, and the dollar made modest gains against the euro and yen. Volatility is practically non-existent, with VIX just above its yearly lows near the 10.2 mark. New Month; Same Sluggish Data The new month started off with a hefty batch of data Monday, and unfortunately, every reading pointed toward slower than expected economic growth. One of the key inflation factors, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, fell 0.1% in March, below expectations for a flat reading. That means core PCE prices are up just 1.6% year over year, well below the Fed’s 2% inflation target. Combined with the March decline in the consumer price index (CPI), it’s another sign that inflation doesn’t seem to be much of a factor. One possible bright spot: The ISM report — which includes responses from businesses across a number of industries — showed business leaders sounding generally positive about demand. What if the Fed Met and Nobody Came? It feels a bit that way, with Fed leaders gathering this week amid virtually no chance of a rate hike, according to futures prices. What should investors look for in Wednesday’s statement? Any explanations the Fed might have for the slowdown in economic data over the last month would be welcome. A lot of people are trying to determine if the weak spate of data is a blip caused by bad March weather and typical Q1 sluggishness, or something more pronounced. The Fed said at its March meeting that the labor market was strengthening and that economic activity had continued to expand at a “moderate” pace. It also observed moderate gains in household spending, and said business fixed investment had “firmed somewhat.” Any deviations from this language in tomorrow’s statement could prove very telling.  Could Auto Sales Signal Consumer Optimism? Despite low unemployment and rising wages, consumers remained tight with their wallets in March, at least judging from the government’s personal spending data released Monday. Spending on goods fell 0.1% during the month. Today’s April auto and truck sales data could signal whether consumers decided to lighten those wallets a little once the chilly month of March ended. Auto sales have been slow lately, and even the classic and antique car market is starting to feel some of the chill, according to industry media. Tail fins, anyone?

The drug may be used in combination with other front-line treatments for cancer The US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has given accelerated approval to an AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) drug that uses the body’s own immune system to beat cancer. Initially, Imfinzi will be used to treat patients with bladder cancer, which is a comparatively small market for a company of the international scale of AZ. However, its use is expected to become wider spread and it may be used in combination with other front-line treatments for cancer.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Persistence Market Research Sleep Disorder Therapeutics Market Estimated to Flourish by 2021 – Persistence Market Research Sleep disorders include a variety of complications related to sleep and have a high prevalence across the globe. Based on these complications, sleep disorders can be classified into three categories- lack of sleep which includes insomnia, excessive sleep which includes narcolepsy and disturbed sleep which include sleep apnea and Rapid eye movement (REM) disorder. Insomnia may arise as result of unhealthy diet, emotional dreams, stress, and many other factors. Insomnia may affect reaction time towards common stimulus, hand-eye coordination, memory, and disturb daily life. A sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/5714  Narcolepsy is a disorder that causes uncontrolled sleep at time period lasting less than minute or more than an hour. It has also been found that patients with narcolepsy experience sleep attacks more often during pregnancy, stress or ill health. Usually narcolepsy is a genetic disease, but it has also been found to develop as a result of some neurological disorders or severe brain damage. REM sleep behavior disorder involves abnormal behavior in sleep. In this disorder, a patient dreaming about running, may run while still asleep. Sleep apnea is obstructed breathing during sleep. According to a press release in March 2014 by World Association of Sleep Medicine, 45% of the global population suffers from some form of sleep disorder. It also mentions that approximately 25% male and 10% females in the U.S. suffer from sleep apnea. This high prevalence suggests an opportunity for a large therapeutics market. To view TOC of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/5714 Currently marketed drugs include Sanofi-Aventis manufactured Ambien (zolpidem), Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s Lunesta (eszopiclone), Takeda Pharmaceutical’s Rozerem (ramelteon), Somaxon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Silenor (doxepine) and various others. Over-the-counter drugs are also available for treating sleep disorder; these include Nytol, Sominex, Compoz, and Unisom. Merck’s Suvorexant drug is an orexin receptor agonist which is under Phase III trial. Other companies involved in the drug development of sleep disorder include Vanda Pharmaceuticals, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline and Neurim Pharmaceuticals.

JOHNSON, AP Medical Writer Updated: May 2, 2017 - 10:22 AM Twtter KENILWORTH, N.J. - Strict cost controls, along with surging sales of its two newest medicines and a surprisingly strong performance from its entire vaccine portfolio pushed Merck & Co. beyond most expectations for the first quarter and the company boosted its outlook for the year. The company has begun a new cycle in which sales of its latest drugs grow as revenue fades for older drugs facing new generic competition, particularly its blockbuster cholesterol pills Zetia and Vytorin. Other Merck drugs are facing more brand-name competition. Meanwhile Merck's crucial diabetes franchise, already under pressure from insurers for bigger discounts, was hurt by a shift in the timing of orders by large U.S. purchasers. Combined sales of its Januvia and Janumet diabetes treatments dipped 5 percent, to $1.34 billion. Merck's new drugs are picking up the slack, however. Sales of Zepatier, the hepatitis C drug launched a year ago, rocketed to $378 million, a pace that will soon make it a blockbuster with annual sales topping $1 billion. Revenue from the cancer medicine Keytruda, one of the top new immuno-oncology drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer, more than doubled to $584 million. It's approved for treating melanoma, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer, a fiercely competitive category in which it's the market leader. Keytruda also has pending approvals for bladder cancer, for a rare cancer caused by DNA repair defects and for treating lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The latter use could be approved by the middle of next week. Meanwhile, Merck is running scores of other patient tests of Keytruda for still more cancer types. Merck on Tuesday reported net income of $1.55 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.13 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 88 cents per share, a nickel above what analysts expected. "We're seeing strong performance across all elements of Merck's businesses," CEO Kenneth Frazier told analysts during a conference call. Merck slashed spending on manufacturing and materials a whopping 16 percent to $3.02 billion, while boosting spending on research and development 8 percent to $1.8 billion in the quarter. The drugmaker posted revenue of $9.43 billion, also topping Street forecasts for $9.29 billion. Its prescription drugs business produced $8.19 billion of that revenue, up 1 percent, while its animal health unit had sales of $939 million, up 13 percent. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, raised its financial forecast for the year, saying it expects earnings between $2.51 and $2.63 per share, including one-time items, up from its January forecast of $2.47 to $2.62 per share. It now expects revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from its January forecast for $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. Credit-Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote to investors that sales of Januvia and Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, drove Merck's total sales above analysts' expectations, but the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker had greater-than-expected declines to older products Zetia, Vytorin and Remicade, an immune disorder blockbuster whose sales plunged 34 percent to $229 million. In early trading, Merck shares dipped 5 cents to $62.33. _____ Follow Linda A. Johnson at www.twitter.com/LindaJ_onPharma Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Der Umsatz legte konzernweit um 1 Prozent auf 9,4 Milliarden US-Dollar zu, wie Merck am Dienstag mitteilte. Die meisten Analysten hatten hier mit einem Rückgang gerechnet. 02.05.2017 13:26 Der Gewinn stieg um 38 Prozent auf 1,55 Milliarden Dollar. Günstig wirkten sich hierbei niedrigere Restrukturierungskosten aus. Vor Sonderposten verdiente der Konzern etwas weniger als im Vorjahr, aber immer noch mehr als die Experten im Schnitt erwartet hatten. Für das laufende Jahr zeigt sich Merck nun etwas zuversichtlicher. Die Spanne für den bereinigten Gewinn je Aktie hob der Konzern auf 3,76 bis 3,88 Dollar an. Der Umsatz soll mit 39,1 bis 40,3 Milliarden Dollar ebenfalls höher ausfallen als bislang gedacht./she/das (AWP) View the discussion thread.

(Photo: Apple) 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE iPhone maker Apple and two leading U.S. drugmakers lead the parade of earnings reports Tuesday in what is shaping up to be the best quarterly earnings season since late 2011. Shares of Apple, which reports after Wall Street’s closing bell, closed $2.95 higher Monday at a fresh record $146.58. The company, which could report that its cash hoard has swelled beyond $250 billion, has seen its shares surge nearly 27% this year. The stock has found new life since billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway said last year it had built a big stake in Apple. Buffett then doubled his position to roughly 133 million shares at the start of 2017. Berkshire’s stake in Apple is now valued at an estimated $19.5 billion. Apple, which is forecast to report earnings of $2.02 per share, up more than 6% from $1.90 a year ago, will look to extend the strong earnings season for the tech sector, which is on track for profit growth of nearly 18%, earnings tracker Thomson Reuters says. Analysts will be eyeing sales of its flagship iPhone. Apple has helped the Dow Jones industrial average climb within 1% of its March 1 high and also powered the tech-dominated Nasdaq to a fresh record Monday. Other Dow stocks set to report Tuesday include drugmakers Merck and Pfizer. Analysts expect Merck profits to tumble 7% from a year ago and Pfizer to come in flat at 67 cents a share. The health care sector, overall, is forecast to grow profits 5.7%. RELATED: Trump gets "B" or "B-minus" from Wall Street pros What gives?

The role of an ETF is to provide investors with an investing option that isn’t tied to one sole company. Instead, an ETF will hold a basket of assets – stocks, bonds, commodities – that trades close to its net asset value over the course of the a day. Furthermore, ETFs tend to track an index, making them a prime example for how a sector is performing on any given day. To help make investors aware of some of their options when looking at investing in the pharmaceutical sector, the Investing News Network (INN) looks at the five top ETFs (barring any leveraged ETFs) in the space. Included on the list are: PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals Portfolio ETF (NYSEARCA:PJP) iShares US Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE) SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:XPH) Market Vectors Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:PPH) Market Vectors Generic Drugs ETF (NASDAQ:GNRX) The funds are arranged by the value of their assets. “Trump’s victory could mean the end of Obamacare.

All rights reserved. fotovapl/Shutterstock.com Hepatitis C Has Been Eradicated in 20 Patients Who Received Infected Kidney Transplants The gamble paid off. PETER DOCKRILL 1 MAY 2017   For the patients, it was a gamble: if they took part in a new study, they'd be off the waiting list, and would receive a new kidney from an organ donor – but the organ they'd be getting would be one infected with the hepatitis C virus. Those were the terms of two bold clinical studies conducted last year in the US, but for the patients who took part, the gamble paid off. Doctors this week announced that all 20 patients who received donated organs – and subsequently contracted hepatitis C – were able to beat the infection thanks to an antiviral treatment after the transplant.   The approach carries an amount of risk, as there's a chance the patients receiving the organs might never be cured of hepatitis C. But the early success of the two trials run separately by the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University could provide new hope for the hundreds of thousands of patients on organ donation lists around the world. In the US alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting to receive kidney transplants, but despite the level of need, organ donations from people with hepatitis C haven't been possible - with viable kidneys even being thrown out due to the infection. Thanks to the success of these preliminary results, that's something that might change in the future. "We started this trial in the hopes that, if successful, we could open up an entirely new pool of donor organs, and effectively transplant hundreds, if not thousands, more patients who are awaiting a lifesaving organ," says one of the researchers, liver transplant specialist David S. Goldberg from the University of Pennsylvania. "Historically, hepatitis C infected kidneys were often discarded, and were thought to be damaged or too 'high-risk'. Our pilot data demonstrate the ability to cure the contracted virus following transplantation in this patient population."   Last year, Goldberg and his team approached 38 kidney patients on dialysis who had been waiting for a donated organ for at least one and a half years. Once they and their families were informed of the procedure and its risks, 14 provided their consent, with 10 of this group being selected to receive infected kidneys. One of those, Irma Hendricks, describes joining the trial as a "no brainer", having been on dialysis for six months and facing a five-year wait before a donated kidney would be available. "I went to a dialysis centre three days a week," she told Marie McCullough at The Philadelphia Inquirer. "It gave me constant headaches and fatigue. I felt, 'What do I have to lose?' I would rather deal with hep C than dialysis." Like all the other patients in Goldberg's trial, Hendricks did contract the virus when she received her transplant – but all of the group managed to beat the virus thanks to a 12-week course of the oral medication Zepatier, donated by the funder of the study, Merck.   "I feel as good as I felt maybe a decade ago," says one of the patients, Kiran Shelat. "I have lots of energy, I'm sleeping better, and my outlook on life has definitely improved." In a similar but separate trial involving 10 patients at John Hopkins University, the antiviral treatment also successfully eradicated the virus in all participants. The results are only preliminary at the moment, having been announced at the American Transplant Congress in Chicago over the weekend – although the results of the University of Pennsylvania trial were published in a brief letter in The New England Journal of Medicine. But the researchers are optimistic – if larger studies can confirm that the technique is safe, it could mean hundreds of kidneys infected with hepatitis C could potentially be used in transplants in the future. "This has the potential to enable 500 to 1,000 more people to get kidney transplants [annually], just based on how many organs are being discarded now," says surgeon Niraj Desai, who ran the kidney transplant trial at Johns Hopkins University. "So it's very exciting." Moving ahead, the researchers want to expand the trials. The University of Pennsylvania team is now extending the trial to another 10 kidney patients, and plan to conduct new clinical trials in the future, transplanting hearts, livers, and lungs donated by people with the virus. One hurdle with these kinds of treatments could be the high cost of the medications used to combat hepatitis C. The drug used in the trial usually costs US$55,000 for a round of treatment, and another new medication to treat the virus, Harvoni, costs US$94,000. But if the researchers can figure out a way to keep these prices down – such as by devising shorter treatment windows than the 12 weeks used in the clinical trials – there could be an awful lot of promise here. The preliminary results of the University of Pennsylvania trial are published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein told her constituents at a recent San Francisco town hall event that she’s not ready to support a single-payer health care system — an idea that has been gaining steam at the state level in California. “If single-payer health care is going to mean complete takeover by the government of all health care,” the California Democrat said, “I am not there.” A week later, Feinstein was even further from there, benefitting from a fundraising event at the Washington, D.C., office of Avenue Solutions, a lobbying firm that represents major health insurers, pharmaceutical companies and the primary trade association for doctors. The industries have historically opposed efforts to create a universal, government-run health care system — an idea supported by 58 percent of U.S. adults. Feinstein supporters at the event were expected to kick in $1,000 to $5,000 for her re-election bid. A Feinstein spokesperson did not respond to MapLight’s request for comment. As Feinstein gears up to run for a fifth full Senate term, lawmakers in her home state of California are weighing legislation to establish a state-run, single-payer health care program. Labor unions and progressive advocacy groups are backing the bill. Hundreds of supporters marched to the Capitol in Sacramento last week as the measure advanced through a state Senate committee. More than 40 organizations, including health insurers and medical providers, are opposing the bill. At the same time, national Democrats are facing increased pressure to support a single-payer health care plan from allies of Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent. Progressives are also urging the party to reject support from lobbyists and business interests. Since Feinstein began her fourth full term in 2013, lobbyists and political action committees have given at least $592,000 to her campaign, more than one-third of what she’s raised in total donations, according to a MapLight review of campaign finance data. Feinstein’s campaign committee received $655,822 in donations between January and March. Lobbyists accounted for at least $20,700; political action committees gave more than $160,000. Her campaign saw substantial support from the health care industry during that time. Recent donors to Feinstein include former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, who lobbies for Blue Cross Blue Shield Association; Brian Griffin, who represents  the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA); and Fred Graefe, who lobbies for the Federation of American Hospitals. She also received donations from political action committees run by PhRMA and pharmaceutical companies Merck & Co., Amgen, and AbbVie. The California Democrat raised almost $10 million during her last re-election campaign in 2012.  The lobbying industry was her fifth-largest source of campaign revenue, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics; it accounted for almost $325,000 of her fundraising during the contest. Feinstein won re-election in a landslide with 62.5 percent of the vote. Her GOP opponent, autism advocate Elizabeth Emken, raised $914,350, or less than $1 for every $10 given to Feinstein.National More Political Capital How Oil And Gas Industry Power Shapes Colorado Politics By David Sirota and Josh Keefe While the state is investigating a deadly explosion at a home that was just a few hundred feet from an aging oil well, Democratic lawmakers struggle to advance any bill opposed by the oil and gas industry.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Animal Parasiticides Market : Application,Research Report 2017 – 2025 Animal Parasiticides Market: Overview Thanks to the rise in concern among people regarding animal healthcare, the global market for animal parasiticides is experiencing a remarkable expansion in its overall size. With increasing knowledge about the benefits of animal parasiticides, their demand will continue to move upwards over the forthcoming years. As all animal parasiticides contain one or more active ingredients that can destroy specific parasites, their efficiency level is very high. This factor adds substantially to the increasing popularity of animal parasiticides, which is anticipated to reflect positively on their sales over the next few years. Apart from this, the escalating demand for protein rich food, enforcement of animal welfare acts in developed economies, growing trend of pet adoption, and the rising number of government initiatives to increase awareness about to animal health are also expected to boost this market considerably in the years to come. Request a Brochure of the Report @ www.tmrresearch.com/sample/sample?flag=B&rep_id=485 Animal Parasiticides Market: Segment-wise Analysis Broadly, the global market for animal parasiticides is analyzed on the basis of the type of product and the type of animal. On the basis of product type, this market is classified into endoparasiticide, ectoparasiticide, and endectocide. Endoparasiticides, available as liquid, pills and tablets, injectables, and feed additives, control the spread of internal parasites, such as roundworms, tapeworms, and flukes in animals, whereas, extoparasiticides are efficient in curbing the spread of external parasites, such as flies, ticks, mites, and fleas. These parasiticides are available as spot-on and pour-on formulations, sprays, dips, and collars, and ear tags. Endectocides are efficient in curbing both internal and external parasites. Request for TOC of the Report @ www.tmrresearch.com/sample/sample?flag=T&rep_id=485 Based on the animal type, the global market for animal parasiticides is categorized into companion animals and food-producing animals (livestock animals). Dogs, cats, and horses are the main companion animals of human while cattle, hens, sheep, pigs, and goats are considered as food-producing animals. Among the two, the food producing animals segment has acquired the leading position. The increasing need to keep these animals healthy, triggered by the rising concerns over food-borne diseases caused by animals, is the key driving force behind this growth. Global Animal Parasiticides Market: Geographical Outlook Geographically, the global market for animal parasiticides is spread across North America, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Thanks to the large population of the companion as well as food-producing animals, Europe has emerged as the market leader and is closely followed by North America. Read Complete Report @ www.tmrresearch.com/animal-parasiticides-market Analysts expect these regions to maintain a strong growth pace over the forthcoming years on account of the growing awareness regarding animal health among consumers. However, the most promising growth opportunities are likely to be presented by Asia Pacific and Latin America in the years to come. The augmenting population of livestock and companion animals and the increasing expenditure on animal healthcare, owing to the rising awareness level among people in these regions, are projected to surface as the key driving force behind the significant growth of the animal parasiticides markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Global Animal Parasiticides Market: companies mentioned in the report The leading producers of animal parasiticides across the world are Zoetis Inc., Vetoquinol, Virbac SA, Sanofi S.A., Eli Lilly and Co., Merck & Co.
