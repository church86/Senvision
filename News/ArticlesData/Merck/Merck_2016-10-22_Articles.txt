Merck anticipates making ZINPLAVA available in first quarter 2017. ZINPLAVA is indicated to reduce recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in patients 18 years of age or older who are receiving antibacterial drug treatment of CDI and are at high risk for CDI recurrence. ZINPLAVA is not indicated for the treatment of CDI. ZINPLAVA is not an antibacterial drug. ZINPLAVA should only be used in conjunction with antibacterial drug treatment of CDI. CDI is caused by bacteria that produce toxins, including toxin B. Symptoms of CDI include mild-to-severe diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever. The incidence of recurrent CDI is higher in certain patient populations, including people 65 years of age or older and those with compromised immune systems. “For generations, Merck has been steadfast in its commitment to fighting infectious diseases – and that commitment continues today. ZINPLAVA is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to C. difficile toxin B and neutralizes its effects,” said Dr. Nicholas Kartsonis, vice president of clinical development, infectious diseases, Merck Research Laboratories. Selected safety information about ZINPLAVA Heart failure was reported more commonly in the two Phase 3 clinical trials in ZINPLAVA-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. These adverse reactions occurred primarily in patients with underlying congestive heart failure (CHF). In patients with a history of CHF, 12.7% (15/118) of ZINPLAVA-treated patients and 4.8% (5/104) of placebo-treated patients had the serious adverse reaction of heart failure during the 12-week study period. Additionally, in patients with a history of CHF, there were more deaths in ZINPLAVA-treated patients [19.5% (23/118)] than in placebo-treated patients [12.5% (13/104)] during the 12-week study period. The causes of death varied, and included cardiac failure, infections, and respiratory failure. In patients with a history of CHF, ZINPLAVA (bezlotoxumab) should be reserved for use when the benefit outweighs the risk. The most common adverse reactions occurring within 4 weeks of infusion with a frequency greater than placebo and reported in greater-than or equal to 4% of patients treated with ZINPLAVA and Standard of Care (SoC) antibacterial drug therapy vs placebo and SoC antibacterial drug therapy included nausea (7% vs 5%), pyrexia (5% vs 3%) and headache (4% vs 3%). Serious adverse reactions occurring within 12 weeks following infusion were reported in 29% of ZINPLAVA-treated patients and 33% of placebo-treated patients. Heart failure was reported as a serious adverse reaction in 2.3% of ZINPLAVA-treated patients and 1.0% of placebo-treated patients. In ZINPLAVA-treated patients, 10% experienced one or more infusion specific adverse reactions compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients, on the day of or the day after, the infusion. Infusion specific adverse reactions reported in greater-than or equal to 0.5% of patients receiving ZINPLAVA and at a frequency greater than placebo were nausea (3%), fatigue (1%), pyrexia (1%), dizziness (1%), headache (2%), dyspnea (1%) and hypertension (1%). Of these patients, 78% experienced mild adverse reactions, and 20% of patients experienced moderate adverse reactions. These reactions resolved within 24 hours following onset. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity following administration of ZINPLAVA. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to bezlotoxumab in two Phase 3 studies with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Following treatment with ZINPLAVA in these two studies, none of the 710 evaluable patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-bezlotoxumab antibodies. About bezlotoxumab Bezlotoxumab was developed by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School’s MassBiologics Laboratory in conjunction with Medarex (now part of Bristol-Myers Squibb), and was licensed to Merck in 2009.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 Scientist with ties to SIU reports positive results for genital herpes vaccine Saturday Oct 22, 2016 at 9:30 PM Oct 22, 2016 at 9:30 PM Dean Olsen Staff Writer @deanolsenSJR A Springfield researcher last week reported “stunning reductions” in genital herpes symptoms during the first phase of an overseas clinical trial of his therapeutic herpes vaccine. Though involving only 17 U.S. and British patients with herpes who received a series of three shots over a three-month period in a Caribbean island country, William Halford said he hopes to offer his Theravax vaccine to the general public next year in an as-yet-undetermined foreign country. Halford, whose vaccine is the product of research at Springfield’s Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and is produced in his private company’s downtown laboratory, said he plans to publish full results of the phase 1 trial in a scientific journal in late 2017. But Rational Vaccines, the company he co-founded last year, said in a news release that initial results of the trial, using a live but weakened form of the herpes virus, positions Halford’s Theravax vaccine as “one of the most effective therapeutic vaccines ever created” for people suffering from one of the world’s most common sexually transmitted infections. Can't wait for FDA In the United States, about one in seven people ages 14 to 49 — more than 23 million people — have genital herpes. As many as 3 million suffer herpes outbreaks four to 24 times per year. Worldwide, more than 400 million people have genital herpes, with tens of millions living with chronic symptoms, including chronic pain, that often aren't alleviated with available medical treatments. Halford’s phase 1 study, conducted in the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis — a two-island, sovereign nation about 200 miles southeast of Puerto Rico — met its primary goal of demonstrating “safety and tolerability” in genital herpes patients who had lived with chronic symptoms for one to 25 years, Halford said. “This early phase trial revealed Theravax elicited stunning reductions in herpes symptoms among trial participants,” the Rational Vaccines release says. “Specifically, 17 of 17 participants who received the three-shot vaccine series indicated the live Theravax vaccine was more effective in reducing their genital herpes symptoms than antiviral drugs.”  The patients had taken antiviral drugs for years and decades before they took part in the clinical trial, Halford said. On average, the participants reported a threefold reduction in their number of days with herpes symptoms, according to the release, which says a “functional cure” for herpes “may be on the horizon.” This early phase study, which will conclude in June 2017, didn’t include a “placebo control group,” and the symptoms were self-reported rather than evaluated by a medical professional. It also lacked the number of patients required to thoroughly evaluate the treatment’s effectiveness.  Halford said he was well aware of these limitations. A phase 1 clinical trial that proves safety paves the way for phase 2 and 3 trials that measure effectiveness, he said. The vaccine, which works by stimulating the immune system, holds too much promise for easing human suffering to be delayed by the traditional 20-year process required to bring a vaccine to market in the United States, Halford said. This process is overseen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Halford isn’t a physician but said the Hippocratic oath that doctors take to “do no harm” makes his next steps clear. Those steps, he said, are similar to those a doctor faces when paramedics carry a gunshot victim into a hospital emergency room. “You should not sit there and confer with your colleagues and attorneys for 10 years while that person bleeds to death,” Halford said. “The next step,” he said, “is to go anywhere in the world where they want a better herpes treatment option and start to develop it. For our company, what makes the most sense is to go to any sovereign nation in the world that is willing to offer the highest level of cooperation and bring potentially life-improving medicine to herpes sufferers ASAP." 'Attenuated' viruses Halford, 48, said he would continue research overseas that eventually could lead to FDA approval of "vaccines within the United States with the potential to alleviate the chronic pain and debilitating symptoms from which far too many herpes sufferers can find no relief with the current standard of medical care offered in the USA." In fact, going overseas could help Rational Vaccines bring a vaccine to market in the United States in fewer than 20 years, said Halford, an SIU associate professor of medical microbiology, immunology and cell biology. Halford said he knows news of his Theravax clinical trial results may invite criticism from other scientists. It’s unusual for an American scientist to go overseas to conduct clinical trials, Halford said, though he noted that the chickenpox vaccine was developed in Japan in 1974, then tested and used in Japan for decades before it was purchased by the pharmaceutical company Merck in the late 1980s. The chickenpox vaccine received FDA approval for use in Americans in the mid-1990s. Moreover, there is continued resistance in the U.S. scientific community to the use of a live, “attenuated” viral vaccine even though the vaccines for chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella, polio and yellow fever were developed decades ago with live, attenuated viruses. Since the 1970s, genetic-engineering techniques became available that can create alternatives to vaccines with weakened viruses. American scientists now generally think that vaccines with “attenuated” viruses pose unnecessary risks of complications and disease for patients. However, herpes vaccines created with a piece, or protein "subunit" from a virus have failed in decades of clinical trials. Halford's company already has developed a vaccine to prevent genital herpes infection, Profavax, which Halford said is "100 times more effective than the herpes subunit vaccines" that have been tested in U.S. clinical trials over the past 30 years. The next step, he said, is to test Profavax in a phase 1 clinical trial similar to the trial of Theravax. Profavax, he said, could be a boon to partners of people with genital herpes by eliminating their risk of being infected. 'Astounding' results The scientists from SIU and elsewhere at the SIU Technology and Innovation Expo in Chicago on Oct. 13 gave Halford’s presentation of his herpes vaccine trial results a positive reception, according to Dr. Jerry Kruse, dean and provost of SIU School of Medicine. “I hope this works. The initial results are astounding,” Kruse said. Halford is “an outstanding scientist — a genius, actually,” Kruse added. Kruse said Halford’s team, which includes Rational Vaccines employees Joshua Geltz and Ashley Mihalich, is “excellent.” SIU would like to see more of its scientists leverage their research discoveries and create local companies, Kruse said. Dr. David Koelle, an infectious-disease specialist and herpes vaccine researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle, said the track record of live, attenuated vaccines is “good,” but he wouldn’t comment on Halford’s trial until all of the data are available. Koelle said he respects Halford as a scientist, but the “bar for safety in vaccines is extremely high in the United States.” “The evaluation of any vaccine or treatment must be done with the utmost care and oversight,” Koelle said. “It’s important that we balance safety in clinical trials without categorically rejecting promising treatments or vaccines.” Herpes patients in the United States will be encouraged by news of Halford’s trial and won’t mind if a vaccine is developed overseas as long as it’s safe and effective in preventing or treating the infection, according to Fred Wyand, spokesman for the North Carolina-based American Sexual Health Association. “This is something people have talked about for a long time,” he said. “People are clamoring for it.” Global Industry Analysts Inc. have estimated that the global market for treatments to reduce the severity of chronic herpes symptoms will reach $4.8 billion annually by 2017. The global market for Halford’s proposed preventive vaccine, Profavax, could be more than $10 billion per year, he said, because for every herpes sufferer, "there are 30 people who remain vulnerable to contracting genital herpes." SIU owns the patent for the technology Halford developed and would evenly split any royalties with him. Halford, who teaches medical students, said he has no plans to leave SIU or Springfield. “I can use Springfield as a base of operations and go anywhere,” he said. Sad commentary? Rational Vaccine’s chief executive officer Agustin Fernandez III said he isn’t worried about finding investors willing to help Rational Vaccines do research and serve patients in foreign countries. The challenge, he said, is finding investors who share the company’s long-term vision of eradicating genital herpes. About $750,000 has been raised from investors to get the company to this point, Halford said. Fernandez, 40, who said he lives in Los Angeles and New York, is a movie producer and director. He shared an Academy Award in 2014 as executive producer of the short documentary, “The Lady in Number 6,” and he directed the 2015 crime thriller, “Badge of Honor.” Fernandez, who is one of the company’s investors, said he contacted Halford to become involved because of the impact of herpes on people in his life. Fernandez said he has cut back on his film work to devote full time to Rational Vaccines. The fact that the vaccine is being developed overseas is a sad commentary on U.S. regulations, he said. “The concerns of U.S. regulators don’t seem to be in line with patients’ needs,” he said. “The people who need the treatment don’t care where the treatment comes from.”  — Contact Dean Olsen: dean.olsen@sj-r.com, 788-1543, twitter.com/DeanOlsenSJR.

Secondhand smoke linked to higher risk of stroke The increased risk of stroke that comes with smoking may extend to nonsmokers who live in the same household and breathe in secondhand smoke, a U.S. study suggests. Researchers found that never-smokers who had a stroke were nearly 50 percent more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke at home than people who had never had a stroke. Sanders urges Californians to approve drug price ballot measure Former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, in an opinion editorial published in the Los Angeles Times, on Friday urged Californians to approve a November ballot measure aimed at reining in pharmaceutical prices. The California Drug Price Relief Act, also known as Proposition 61, seeks to limit state health programs from paying more for medications than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which receives the steepest discounts in the country. Climate change is shifting areas of skin disease concern Climate change is bringing certain skin diseases and other illnesses to regions where they were rarely seen before, according to a recent research review. Dermatologists should keep these changing patterns of skin diseases in mind when making diagnoses, say the authors, who analyzed specific disease shifts in North America. Cigna ends preauthorization requirement to treat opioid addiction Health insurer Cigna Corp has discontinued its policy of requiring doctors to seek authorization before treating opioid addicts, as part of a fight against an epidemic of opioid abuse, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Friday. The policy change will apply nationally, said Schneiderman, who has been pushing for easier access to treatments for an estimated 2.2 million American addicts. Polio vaccine makers failing to make enough doses: WHO experts Two companies making vaccines to help the world eradicate polio are failing to produce enough, so many countries should prepare to give lower doses to make stocks last, a group of experts has advised the World Health Organization. With polio on the brink of eradication globally, the WHO wants to see a worldwide switch from the traditional "live" oral polio vaccine, which runs the risk of spreading the disease, to an inactivated vaccine that needs to be injected. Rehab after heart attack tied to longer, not healthier life Heart attack survivors who participate in cardiac rehabilitation programs may survive longer, but feel no healthier, than they would without this follow-up care, a U.S. study suggests. Previous research has linked medically supervised rehab programs focused on things like stress reduction, exercise and heart healthy living to lower mortality rates. The current study offered more evidence of this: rehab participants were 41 percent less likely to die of all causes during up to seven years of follow-up. Indian doctor accused of crimes becomes president of World Medical Association The World Medical Association (WMA), the top medical-ethics body, on Friday installed an Indian doctor facing corruption charges as its president, despite controversy surrounding his appointment while legal cases are pending. A statement released by the WMA said Dr. Ketan Desai delivered his inaugural speech as president on Friday at the association's annual assembly in Taiwan. He will serve in the position for 2016/17. Merck's Keytruda succeeds in key bladder cancer trial Merck & Co Inc said its immunotherapy, Keytruda, helped previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer live longer in a late-stage study, prompting an independent monitoring panel to recommend stopping the trial early. The blockbuster drug's benefit in patients with urothelial cancer, the most common form of bladder cancer, surpassed that of chemotherapy, meeting the main study goal of overall survival. Docs lay out media recommendations for kids, teens The quantity and quality of media children and teens consume should change with their age, according to new guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics. The organization also says parents should oversee children's media consumption and educate them about proper media engagement. Type 1 diabetes often comes with other autoimmune diseases People with type 1 diabetes often develop other autoimmune disorders, such as thyroid and gastrointestinal diseases, and a recent study yields new information about this link. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the pancreas and destroys its insulin-producing cells. Patients often develop other immune system diseases, too. Indeed, in the current study, 27 percent of patients had at least one other autoimmune disorder. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Meet the Contributors → Bio Roundup: Jenkins Gets Mad, Bernie Gets His Pen, CRISPR IPO & J-Lo Alex Lash October 21st, 2016 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  If you’re among those frustrated by the lack of talk about health and science in the three presidential debates, this week perhaps brought you a wee consolation prize. The steady drip of hacked Hillary Clinton-related emails showed her campaign team questioning then-candidate FDA commissioner Robert Califf’s ties to the pharma industry. The staff also crowed over Clinton’s tweet—a reaction last summer to the first revelations about Martin Shkreli’s price gouging—that sent biopharma stocks downhill. Bernie Sanders is no longer a presidential candidate, but he continued his pharma-bashin’ ways with a letter to Ariad Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ARIA) questioning the firm’s price hikes for cancer drug ponatinib (Iclusig). The hikes were first reported earlier this month by Adam Feuerstein of The Street. If politicians flogging drug makers doesn’t slake your thirst for health and science in the national conversation, how about J-Lo taking on DNA-disrupting baddies on a TV show called C.R.I.S.P.R.? No word yet if—ahem—Gene Hackman will co-star. You think that’s funny? Wait til you get a load of this week’s roundup. TOP STORIES —The hepatitis C drug telaprevir (Incivek) from Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) was once the fastest drug launch in history before competition wiped it off the map in three years. In a feature this week, Vertex CEO Jeff Leiden said the collapse was a result of “hubris” and “blindness.” Xconomy detailed the drug’s rise and fall, and the steps Vertex is taking to prevent its new dominant cystic fibrosis business from suffering the same fate. —Xconomy reported Monday that Tom Daniel, Celgene’s (NASDAQ: CELG) former president of research and early development, left the Summit, NJ, company over the summer to start Catalysis Advisors in San Diego. For the past decade, Daniel and Celgene executive vice president George Golumbeski formed one of the best-known deal-making duos in biopharma. —A team led by gene therapy researcher Jennifer Adair at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has refashioned a common blood-spinning medical device into an automated tabletop “gene therapy in a box.” Doctors who work on cutting-edge stem cell treatments say it could help spread gene therapy practice, if regulators allow it to be used for clinical trials. —John Jenkins, the director of the FDA’s office of new drugs, isn’t done criticizing eteplirsen (Exondys 51), the Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug from Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRPT) that Jenkins’ bosses approved last month after an internal tug of war. Jenkins was one of many FDA staffers who stood against the approval. In a speech this week before the National Organization of Rare Disorders in Arlington, VA, Jenkins had harsh words, including this: “The path taken by Sarepta is not a good model for other development programs.” His slides are here. THE REGULATORS’ THUMBS GO UP AND DOWN —Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) won FDA approval for the first new treatment in 40 years for soft tissue sarcoma, a type of cancer. The special “accelerated” approval means Lilly must conduct a successful Phase 3 trial to maintain the FDA’s green light. —The FDA also approved the atezolizumab (Tecentriq), developed by Roche’s Genentech group, for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that fits a certain genetic profile. Genentech, Merck, and Bristol-Myers Squibb are all vying to treat lung cancer with immunotherapy drugs, and they rolled out data at a medical conference earlier this month. —Data from atezolizumab and other “checkpoint inhibitors” will soon be part of Xconomy’s new cancer immunotherapy trial resource. It debuted this week with a compilation of data from the other main type of immunotherapy: genetically modified T cells. —European regulators approved Onivyde, a pancreatic cancer drug developed by Cambridge, MA-based Merrimack Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: MACK). Shire holds rights to the drug in Europe. —The FDA suspended a trial of chronic pain drug fasinumab, citing safety issues. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE: TEVA) paid Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN) $250 million last month to co-develop fasinumab, part of a class of drugs with a checkered safety history. —Shares of South Plainfield, NJ-based PTC Therapeutics (NASDAQ: PTCT) fell more than 30 percent after the FDA refused to reconsider its rejection of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug ataluren (Translarna). PTC said it would continue to appeal to higher levels within the agency. TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS —Shares of Alkermes (NASDAQ: ALKS) climbed more than 38 percent after the company reported positive data from the third of three Phase 3 trials of experimental depression drug ALKS-5461. —Partners Theravance Biopharma (NASDAQ: TBPH) and Mylan (NASDAQ: MYL) reported positive Phase 3 data for their lung disease treatment revefenacin and expect to ask for marketing approval next year. —Celgene reported early results for a pill called mongersen for Crohn’s disease, an important drug in its pipeline. The data, from a small trial that wasn’t placebo controlled, drew a mixed reaction from analysts. —Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD) said it would move its experimental treatment for fatty liver disease into Phase 3 trials despite Phase 2 data that The Street described as “hard to interpret.” —Shares of Rigel Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RIGL) fell more than 22 percent after fostamatinib, a drug for a rare platelet disease, failed the second of … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Alex Lash is Xconomy's National Biotech Editor.
