One key analyst issued a few of its top picks for the industry, considering the current market situation, election season and all. Jefferies now sees a more even balance between the overhang around U.S. pricing from the upcoming election and the search for yield, post-Brexit, which could benefit many companies in its universe. Ultimately the firm noted that AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) remains its top pick globally, followed by Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY), Novartis A.G. (NYSE: NVS), AstaZeneca PLC (NYSE: AZN) and Zoetis Inc. (NYSE: ZTS). Jefferies also explained that there could be more risk with Some of the U.S. companies that have been supported by dividend yields, such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), which could suffer if the Federal Reserve raises rates faster and further than expected. Investors have become more engaged discussing large cap pharmaceuticals again, following a volatile end to third-quarter earnings with Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), the CM-026 data and fresh proposals from the Clinton camp. Buy-side sentiment has cooled on Novo and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY), though there still seems room for downside to expectations for both. Jefferies gets most bullish incoming calls on AstraZeneca, Bayer and Sanofi, with the latter feeling most like a value trap near term. Sentiment on the sector has turned more negative, with a renewed focus on U.S. pricing, though most investors are not clear on exactly what proposals trouble them the most. The firm sees the European Society for Medical Oncology in early October as likely positive for Merck and negative for Bristol-Myers as comparisons at the 50% cut-off likely favor Merck. Jefferies expects Novartis to show better data for LEE011 in MONALEESA-2 compared to Ibrance, which could act as a strong driver of more positive investor sentiment for Novartis. Roche’s OAK data in 2/3L non-small cell lung cancer could act as a positive catalyst, whilst putting further pressure on Bristol-Myers as Opdivo likely faces increasing pressure in this setting. Novartis shares did not react to the surprise positive read out of BAF312 in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, likely because investors still expect the need for additional Phase 3 studies before it can be filed. However, the magnitude of the benefit seen at ECTRIMS could change this and the company is also discussing the potential for an early filing with regulators. Shares of AbbVie were trading at $64.08 on Tuesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $71.47 and a 52-week trading range of $45.45 to $68.12. Jefferies has a Buy rating for AbbVie with a $90 price target. Eli Lilly was trading at $79.08 a share. The consensus price target is $96.70, and the 52-week range is $67.88 to $92.85. Jefferies has a Buy rating and a $105 price target. Novartis shares were last seen at $80.28, within a 52-week range of $69.90 to $98.95. The consensus price target is $94.75. Shares of AstraZeneca recently traded at $33.24. The consensus price target is $35.50. The 52-week range is $26.97 to $35.04. Zoetis was changing hands at $51.15, with a consensus price target of $54.50 and a 52-week range of $38.26 to $52.64. Jefferies has a Buy rating and a $60 price target on Zoetis.

Nov 11 HIV antibody treatment shows promise, but has a ways to go Nov 11 More from Marie McCullough Arrow icon Last month, Kiran Shelat let University of Pennsylvania surgeons replace his failing kidneys with one that they knew would infect him with hepatitis C, a virus that could slowly destroy his liver. Slideshow Penn researchers: Hep C drugs make more kidneys safe for transplant Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Normally, a kidney infected with hep C would be offered only to transplant patients who already have the disease -- or it would be thrown away. But the advent of new hep C drugs, with cure rates of 95 percent or more, has led Penn transplant specialists to see infected kidneys as a small but valuable opportunity to expand the pool of organs for which 100,000 Americans are waiting. Two days after Shelat's transplant, tests confirmed that the Yardley civil engineer was hep C positive. He began a 12-week course of Zepatier, Merck's $55,000 therapy. Although it is too soon to say Shelat is cured,  the virus is now undetectable in his blood, the Penn team announced Tuesday morning. And he is free of peritoneal dialysis, the nightly 10-hour blood-cleansing process that was barely controlling the downward spiral caused by his autoimmune kidney disease. "Walking from the parking lot to my office was an ordeal," he recalled. "Only after the transplant, when I started feeling better, did I realize how bad I felt before. Now I’m walking. I’m breathing better.  I go up and down steps. It’s like being altogether a different person." David S. Goldberg, a Penn liver transplant specialist, is coleading the pilot study of 10 patients  with Penn kidney transplant specialist Peter P. Reese. Since it began in May, at least one other patient, Irma Hendricks of East Stroudsburg, Pa.,  has received a hep C-positive kidney, then eradicated her resulting infection with Zepatier. If effective, the new approach could make a dent in the kidney-transplant waiting list, where about 5 percent of patients die each year. "Last year, about 12,000 people in the U.S. got a deceased donor kidney transplant. There could be, at a minimum, maybe 1,000 more transplants if this is successful," Goldberg said.  "That's  not an insignificant number of people who get off dialysis and get their lives back." Patients who are candidates for the Penn trial go through an unusually intensive informed consent process, including an information session that family members are encouraged to attend. Shelat and his wife, Chetana, and daughter Reshma, who is a nurse, were impressed by the thoroughness and frankness of the researchers. "They said, 'Quite definitely you will get hepatitis C,' " Shelat recalled. "I thought, 'What if I do this, and take a chance, and get into some serious trouble later on?' But as I listened more, and they showed me Zepatier’s [cure] numbers, I saw they were confident. It allowed me to relax."  Although Penn was the trailblazer, Johns Hopkins University last month launched a similar clinical trial. The first of 10 patients has received a transplant, been treated with Zepatier, and now has no detectable virus, said Niraj Desai, director of Hopkins' kidney transplant program. "We were throwing these kidneys away," Desai said. "Organs from young donors.  We’re throwing them away while wait-list patients are dying." Merck is donating its drug for the trials, but costs are a major concern. Gilead Sciences' hep C drug, Harvoni,  costs about $94,000 for a treatment course.  That's in addition to the cost of a transplant and medications to prevent organ rejection. "But a year of dialysis is close to $75,000," Goldberg said. "If people survive three years, studies show a kidney transplant is cost effective." Kidney recipients also have one of the highest transplant-survival rates, averaging 15 years, he said. Besides making use of otherwise wasted organs, transplanting hep C-positive kidneys could help mitigate the horror of the growing opioid epidemic, Goldberg and Reese believe. Many people who become addicted to opioid painkillers go on to inject heroin in order to prevent agonizing withdrawal symptoms. Many wind up with hep C because it is easily transmitted among injectors who share syringes. "It’s a tragedy, obviously, but there has been a huge increase in donors who die of a drug overdose [and are hep C positive]," Goldberg said. "One bit of solace for the family may be that the kidneys could be used." Shelat, for one, is eager to become a champion of the approach. "When I feel better, I would love to take part in this effort and spread the word," he said. "If a patient has even the smallest doubt, here I am, the proof. I’m grateful. I’m blessed."

for old. Old for young." (PRNewsFoto/Merck)     Facebook Twitter Pinterest Merck Logo (PRNewsFoto/Merck)     Facebook Twitter Pinterest × The WE100 movement's motto is "Young for old. Old for young." (PRNewsFoto/Merck) Merck Logo (PRNewsFoto/Merck) DARMSTADT, Germany, September 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- "WE100" movement will promote activities to prepare society for 100 healthy years across generations  Merck, a leading science and technology company, revealed the new purpose "Prepare society for a new era of humans living 100 healthy years" for its Consumer Health business. The purpose will be brought to life through the movement "WE100®" aimed at raising awareness of healthy living, all the way from children's age to 100 years. The WE100 movement with its motto "Young for old. Old for young." will also coordinate concrete actions to help prepare society for humans living 100 healthy years.      (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160913/406890 ) The new purpose of the Consumer Health business of Merck has been presented along with the WE100 movement by Uta Kemmerich-Keil, President and CEO of the Consumer Health Business, who commented "Our main objective is to change perceptions of society and take concrete action to articulate the next steps on our journey toward 100 healthy years. This initiative is equally aimed at the younger population, which needs to be educated now about the right approach to healthy ageing." Kemmerich-Keil added "We decided to launch a new purpose and WE100 as a neutral movement so that everybody sharing the goal of preparing society to live 100 healthy years could join," Kemmerich-Keil concluded. The WE100 movement was also recently presented at Cannes Creativity Festival by Atilla Cansun, Chief Marketing Officer of the Consumer Health business of Merck, who explained "We believe age does not influence how much one has to offer. Our first step will be to eliminate the barriers preventing the older generation to be fully involved and integrated in society. We want to set the bar high and we welcome anyone sharing our goal to prepare society for humans living 100 healthy years to join us as the WE100 movement develops." As life expectancy continues to increase dramatically across the world since 1945, surveys show that society is not yet prepared for the prospect of humans living 100 years.[1] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world's population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22% by 2050. As a first step of the WE100 movement, the Consumer Health business of Merck conducted a survey on ageing and the perception of ageing across society, which showed that 80% of interviewees think that society needs to dramatically change its perception and attitude towards ageing. The survey also showed that 95% of interviewees believe governments are not taking a proactive role in findings solutions to trigger greater involvement in the society after retirement. In addition, 80% of those interviewed think they have lower chances to find jobs at age 50+ versus younger generations. Finally, when asked whether children are prepared to live 100 healthy years, 93% of survey respondents say current education is falling short of providing the necessary information to prepare children early on to live a long healthy life. As part of the WE100 movement pilots, activities in schools are planned in 2017 to help children prepare for healthy ageing. Finally, as of October 2016, WE100 will start working on establishing partnerships with public and private organizations around the theme of living 100 healthy years to involve relevant stakeholders in the movement.

The purpose will be brought to life through the movement "WE100(R)" aimed at raising awareness of healthy living, all the way from children's age to 100 years. The WE100 movement with its motto "Young for old. Old for young." will also coordinate concrete actions to help prepare society for humans living 100 healthy years. (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160913/406890 ) The new purpose of the Consumer Health business of Merck has been presented along with the WE100 movement by Uta Kemmerich-Keil, President and CEO of the Consumer Health Business, who commented "Our main objective is to change perceptions of society and take concrete action to articulate the next steps on our journey toward 100 healthy years. This initiative is equally aimed at the younger population, which needs to be educated now about the right approach to healthy ageing." Kemmerich-Keil added "We decided to launch a new purpose and WE100 as a neutral movement so that everybody sharing the goal of preparing society to live 100 healthy years could join," Kemmerich-Keil concluded. The WE100 movement was also recently presented at Cannes Creativity Festival by Atilla Cansun, Chief Marketing Officer of the Consumer Health business of Merck, who explained "We believe age does not influence how much one has to offer. Our first step will be to eliminate the barriers preventing the older generation to be fully involved and integrated in society. We want to set the bar high and we welcome anyone sharing our goal to prepare society for humans living 100 healthy years to join us as the WE100 movement develops." As life expectancy continues to increase dramatically across the world since 1945, surveys show that society is not yet prepared for the prospect of humans living 100 years. [1] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world's population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22% by 2050. As a first step of the WE100 movement, the Consumer Health business of Merck conducted a survey on ageing and the perception of ageing across society, which showed that 80% of interviewees think that society needs to dramatically change its perception and attitude towards ageing. The survey also showed that 95% of interviewees believe governments are not taking a proactive role in findings solutions to trigger greater involvement in the society after retirement. In addition, 80% of those interviewed think they have lower chances to find jobs at age 50+ versus younger generations. Finally, when asked whether children are prepared to live 100 healthy years, 93% of survey respondents say current education is falling short of providing the necessary information to prepare children early on to live a long healthy life. As part of the WE100 movement pilots, activities in schools are planned in 2017 to help children prepare for healthy ageing. Finally, as of October 2016, WE100 will start working on establishing partnerships with public and private organizations around the theme of living 100 healthy years to involve relevant stakeholders in the movement.

"Merck is committed to advancing patient care and offering therapeutic options that help address unmet medical needs for people with MS, with a focus on efficacy, dosing, durability and safety," said Luciano Rossetti, Global Head of Research & Development for Merck's biopharma business. "We look forward to sharing additional data on Rebif® and Cladribine Tablets with the scientific community at this year's ECTRIMS Congress." Oral presentations include a comparison of the CLARITY and the CLARITY EXTENSION studies, which sought to examine the duration of clinical outcome response to Cladribine Tablets, and results of the SOLAR study, which examined the effects of adding high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) to Rebif® therapy for patients with RRMS. Poster presentations will report on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets or Rebif® and patient-reported outcomes in patients being treated with Rebif®. Several health economics outcomes research presentations will highlight key issues facing people with MS, including pregnancy outcomes. In addition to data presentations, a Merck-sponsored satellite symposium, "Reimagining the MS Treatment Journey," will take place Wednesday, September 14, 18:45-19:45 BST in Hall A at the ExCel. The panel session will feature distinguished experts in MS who will debate whether unmet needs in MS care remain, consider what an ideal MS therapy might look like, and review current and potential future therapies. On Thursday, September 15, Merck will hold its fourth annual Grant for Multiple Sclerosis Innovations (GMSI) Awards symposium. Up to €1 million will be awarded to one or more researchers to support work that aims to improve the understanding of MS for the ultimate benefit of patients. The symposium will take place in the South Gallery 19 at the ExCel from 19:30-20:30 BST. For more information about the data to be presented, please review the ECTRIMS website. Also, visit Merck's booth at this year's Congress to learn more about the company's programs and commitment to advancing MS care. About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Rebif® Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide™. Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS. RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

  will share in EUR1 million   Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced key symposia and more than 30 presentations of clinical data on Cladribine Tablets, an investigational, oral, small molecule for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and Rebif® (interferon beta-1a), the company's high-dose, high-frequency interferon beta for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), are scheduled for the 32nd Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) taking place September 14-17, 2016, in London. "Merck is committed to advancing patient care and offering therapeutic options that help address unmet medical needs for people with MS, with a focus on efficacy, dosing, durability and safety," said Luciano Rossetti, Global Head of Research & Development for Merck's biopharma business. "We look forward to sharing additional data on Rebif® and Cladribine Tablets with the scientific community at this year's ECTRIMS Congress." Oral presentations include a comparison of the CLARITY and the CLARITY EXTENSION studies, which sought to examine the duration of clinical outcome response to Cladribine Tablets, and results of the SOLAR study, which examined the effects of adding high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) to Rebif® therapy for patients with RRMS. Poster presentations will report on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets or Rebif® and patient-reported outcomes in patients being treated with Rebif®. Several health economics outcomes research presentations will highlight key issues facing people with MS, including pregnancy outcomes. In addition to data presentations, a Merck-sponsored satellite symposium, "Reimagining the MS Treatment Journey," will take place Wednesday, September 14, 18:45-19:45 BST in Hall A at the ExCel. The panel session will feature distinguished experts in MS who will debate whether unmet needs in MS care remain, consider what an ideal MS therapy might look like, and review current and potential future therapies. On Thursday, September 15, Merck will hold its fourth annual Grant for Multiple Sclerosis Innovations (GMSI) Awards symposium. Up to EUR1 million will be awarded to one or more researchers to support work that aims to improve the understanding of MS for the ultimate benefit of patients. The symposium will take place in the South Gallery 19 at the ExCel from 19:30-20:30 BST. For more information about the data to be presented, please review the ECTRIMS website (http://www.ectrims-congress.eu/2016.html).

About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Rebif® Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide(TM). Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS. RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

Poster presentations will report on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets or Rebif® and patient-reported outcomes in patients being treated with Rebif®. Several health economics outcomes research presentations will highlight key issues facing people with MS, including pregnancy outcomes. In addition to data presentations, a Merck-sponsored satellite symposium, "Reimagining the MS Treatment Journey," will take place Wednesday, September 14, 18:45-19:45 BST in Hall A at the ExCel. The panel session will feature distinguished experts in MS who will debate whether unmet needs in MS care remain, consider what an ideal MS therapy might look like, and review current and potential future therapies. On Thursday, September 15, Merck will hold its fourth annual Grant for Multiple Sclerosis Innovations (GMSI) Awards symposium. Up to EUR1 million will be awarded to one or more researchers to support work that aims to improve the understanding of MS for the ultimate benefit of patients. The symposium will take place in the South Gallery 19 at the ExCel from 19:30-20:30 BST. For more information about the data to be presented, please review the ECTRIMS website (http://www.ectrims-congress.eu/2016.html). Also, visit Merck's booth at this year's Congress to learn more about the company's programs and commitment to advancing MS care. About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Rebif® Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide(TM). Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS. RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

How to Whitelist Besides, you're reading about advertising. Why not see who's advertising around the advertising coverage while you're at it? Will You Live to 100? Marketers Are Betting on It By Jack Neff. Published on September 12, 2016. When Atilla Cansun asked the audience at Cannes Lions Health for a show of hands of anyone over 80, he got, unsurprisingly, no response. He said he didn't see anyone even likely in their 60s. Credit: Courtesy Cannes Lion/Getty Images Merck Consumer Health CMO Atilla Cansun saw firsthand the risk of people not preparing for the prospects of living longer when his father retired in his 60s. "You get this influx of money and have little projects, like painting the walls or the summer home," Mr. Cansun said. "Then this guy who used to be leading a whole [university] department is suddenly concerned about whether the cat stops by to drink the milk. You just reduce people down to where they're underwhelmed." Rather than stay there, however, his father re-entered the marketplace and now chairs the architecture department at a university in Istanbul at age 72. "And the way he talks about his own future has completely changed." His father's experience helped inspire Mr. Cansun to launch We100 to deal with a world where living to 100 will be commonplace; the initiative aims to prepare people physically, mentally and financially for what Mr. Cansun calls "100 kick-ass years." We100 is what he terms a "neutral brand" aiming to enlist support from other healthcare companies, governments, nonprofits or even, in his dreams, another vibrant septuagenarian, Pope Francis, or 90-year-old Queen Elizabeth. Mr. Cansun and Merck aren't alone. In a healthcare market long focused on treating problems, there's a growing focus on preventing them, or more accurately, keeping people healthier so their advancing years are more blessing and less curse. To be sure, in a world of $600 EpiPens and multibillion-dollar cholesterol and erectile dysfunction drugs, there's still more money in treatment than prevention. But even beyond drugs and supplements, the preventive approach is getting more attention in beauty care, where marketers are trying to convince millennials to do things now to prevent the appearance of aging, rather than wait until later to reduce those effects. Derek Bowen, a former beauty marketer at Coty and Alberto-Culver and Unilever's Tresemmé, now approaches beauty from a different perspective in his current post as chief marketing officer and general manager-consumer packaged goods Americas at supplement marketer NBTY. One of the most successful products of the company's flagship brand, Nature's Bounty, in recent years has been its Hair, Skin & Nails product, designed with such ingredients as argan oil and biotin in supplements to improve looks. "Beauty has been so externally focused, but the internal piece is really important too," Mr. Bowen said. "What you take, what you eat, is very important to your outer appearance. Beauty companies, because the products are all used on your skin or hair, have not been able to address the inner part of that, which is what we're really tapping into." Much like beauty marketers, Nature's Bounty focuses on before-and-after demos, running a 30-day challenge campaign that asks consumers to look at results after a month of taking the product. Among the initiatives Merck is championing as part of We100 are: Healthy Hour, a new health curriculum for students in kindergarten to college on how to improve quality of life from birth to 100 years old TogetherLand, a scholarship for architecture students to develop a new residential model that supports independent living but includes common spaces and fosters helping others Restart 50+, an online job platform to provide new opportunities for people in their 50s We4You, a program for Merck employees to volunteer three weeks of their time to help the elderly For the first time, in 2015 growth of skincare products fell below that of fragrances, something NPD Group analyst Karen Grant attributes to a slowdown in antiaging skincare. Replacing it somewhat are supplements designed to "work from the inside out," she said. Dollar sales of supplements to improve facial appearance alone have grown fivefold in two years, albeit to a modest $4.1 million in 2015, even as sales of antiaging products declined. Skin creams are not disappearing; the focus and marketplace are shifting. One of the fastest-growing beauty brands of recent years has been Rodan & Fields, which saw sales nearly double last year to $626 million, marketed heavily on Facebook by independent distributors and fueled in part by millennials turning to preventive skincare. Rodan & Fields' core consumer averages a bit younger than that for traditional antiaging products at 40, said Lynn Emmolo, chief brand officer. But millennials much younger than that are a major segment for the brand. "Millennials are looking at skincare at an earlier age, but they're not thinking of antiaging," Ms. Emmolo said. "They're thinking about prevention, so part of our line is about the prevention story—products that have SPF protection and treat skin to prevent problems." Mr. Bowen prefers not to use the terms "prevention" or "treatment," but as NBTY looks to expand the market for its supplements, the focus is clearly toward the former. A new Nature's Bounty campaign, for example, shows a message from the future to a woman telling her she should take more fish oil. For Merck Consumer Health, there's a link between preparing for a world where people live to 100 and nutritional supplements. Merck, having divested its consumer business, with such drugs as Claritin and Afrin, to Bayer two years ago, now focuses on nutritional supplements, led by Seven Seas—a major player in Europe and the Commonwealth countries. Certainly Merck wouldn't mind if the prospect of a longer life led people to take its probiotics at younger ages to gird their digestive and immune systems for a healthier future. But Mr. Cansun said We100 is truly about preparing society for a new reality of people living longer. "Even in Africa and rural places in Southeast Asia, life expectancy has picked up by 30-plus years since the Second World War," he said. "But if you look at the bigger picture of how institutions and government and the healthcare industry are adjusting to it, it's quite appalling." Merck surveyed 2,000 people age 18 to 89 in the U.K. and Germany and found most people expect their lives to hit a crescendo at 50, then start heading downhill in terms of health, career prospects and other areas. He said 80% of respondents globally believe society broadly needs to change its attitude toward the elderly, and more than 90% feel kids aren't well prepared by educational institutions to prepare themselves for long and healthy lives. Education systems are generally "a rat race preparing people to perform and outperform and create output—a sprint that ends with maybe a fat job at the end of college," he said. "But nobody actually takes the time to help kids know their bodies and what kind of lives they need to live to prepare them for that marathon, which may take up to 100 years." We100 also aims to change attitudes about aging and employment, where its research found 80% of people believe they have diminished chances to advance or change careers after age 50. While Merck Consumer Health has started We100 with backing from WPP's Ogilvy & Mather, Mr. Cansun said he intends to keep it neutral or unbranded, hoping to enlist participation from bigger players in a global health and pharmaceutical market where Merck is only ninth, as well as from government, education and elsewhere. That includes even such things as changing the ways governments view and talk about retirement ages—where any delay in benefit eligibility is usually considered to diminish benefits, yet people seldom talk about the need to keep people active in the workforce longer as their life spans grow. He believes marketing can also do plenty to change, including hire older people to work on brands that appeal to older people. When he asked an audience at the Lions Health portion of the Cannes International Festival of Creativity for a show of hands for anyone over 80, he got, unsurprisingly, no response, but said he didn't see anyone even likely in their 60s. And he believes, conversely, that healthcare marketing, geared largely toward treatment of older people with health problems, needs to focus more on younger people too. "It shouldn't just be about selling products," Mr. Cansun said. "It should be about selling products surrounded by education so kids can be aware of taking care of themselves."

Merck Announces Recipients of the Grant for Growth Innovation 2016 Merck Announces Recipients of the Grant for Growth Innovation 2016 ICT Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 12/09/2016 08:16 DARMSTADT, Germany, September 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced the recipients of the Grant for Growth Innovation (GGI) for 2016. The awards were announced yesterday evening at an award presentation meeting organized by Merck during the 55th European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) Meeting in Paris, France. Merck is providing grants to pioneers of new research in growth through the Grant for Growth Innovation award. Identifying and supporting forward thinking researchers in the field of growth follows Merck´s scientific strategy of providing a platform that makes innovation possible. "It is inspiring to see the high quality and aspiration of the researchers to whom these grants have been awarded. We recognise that despite advances in treatment and management of growth disorders, we still require a better understanding of these diseases to address the high unmet medical need. We look forward to seeing the results of these projects," said Dr Steven Hildemann, Global Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Medical and Safety at Merck´s Biopharma business. 38 applications were received from 20 countries and reviewed by an independent Scientific Steering Committee composed of five internationally renowned endocrinologists and researchers. Following a rigorous selection process, three awards were offered to innovative projects which seek to advance understanding in the field of growth. The winning projects are based in Australia, Italy and Brazil, and are as follows: Andrew J. Brooks  University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Brisbane, Australia  Project: Targeting the transmembrane domain of the growth hormone receptor to develop new drug classes addressing unmet needs in treatment of growth hormone disorders Antonio Cittadini, MD, PhD  Federico II University, Naples, Italy  Project: Treatment of growth hormone deficiency associated with chronic heart failure: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study Alexander Augusto de Lima Jorge, MD, PhD  University of São Paulo Medical School, Brazil  Project: Growth hormone and estrogen pharmacogenetics in patients with Turner syndrome About the Grant for Growth Innovation (GGI)  Merck initiated the GGI program to support the advancement of understanding of the field of growth. A total grant of up to €400,000 per year, divided between up to three research proposals, will be awarded to the selected projects. Each application is blinded and evaluated by an independent Scientific Steering Committee composed of internationally renowned endocrinologists and researchers, according to five criteria: innovation; scientific rationale; clarity; feasibility; and impact of research.

He is well-versed in pipeline development, portfolio evaluation and prioritization, and intellectual property law matters. We look forward to leveraging his expertise at the Board level." Dr. Chowrira is currently the President of Synlogic Inc, a U.S. biopharmaceutical company focused on synthetic biotics, where he has overseen and managed corporate and business development, alliance management, and financial and legal operations since September 2015. Prior to joining Synlogic, Dr. Chowrira was the Chief Operating Officer of Auspex Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals in the spring of 2015. Previously, he was President and Chief Executive Officer of Addex Therapeutics, a biotechnology company publicly-traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Before that, he held various leadership and management positions at Nektar Therapeutics, Merck & Co., Sirna Therapeutics, (acquired by Merck & Co.) and Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Chowrira has a J.D. from the University of Denver's Sturm College of Law, a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from the University of Vermont College of Medicine, a M.S. in Molecular Biology from Illinois State University, and a B.S. in Microbiology from the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, India. "I am thrilled to be joining the COTI Board. I have been very impressed with the Company's innovative approach to addressing difficult to treat gynecological cancers," said Dr. Chowrira. "Selective targeting of the mutant forms of p53 protein, a central switch in a number of cancers, has been the focus of intense research in the field for a number of years with limited success. COTI scientists may potentially have solved this puzzle and are currently evaluating their lead oral small molecule candidate in women with gynecological cancers. If this compound is able to achieve efficacy in these patients, in my opinion this would be a major advance in this field. I am looking forward to working with the rest of the Board and management team at COTI to help grow the business as they continue to make significant progress." About Critical Outcome Technologies Inc. COTI is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company advancing the treatment of cancer through targeted therapeutics. The Company's lead compound, COTI-2, has a novel p53-dependent mechanism of action with selective and potent anti-cancer activity. The initial therapeutic indication is in gynecologic cancers, which includes ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers; treatment of patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial began at MD Anderson Cancer Center in February 2016. The Company has secured orphan drug status for the ovarian indication in the U.S. and is planning additional studies in other cancer indications such as head and neck, Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, and acute myelogenous leukemia, based upon more than ten animal xenograft models showing both single and combination agent activity of COTI-2 with other leading cancer drugs. Preclinical data provides evidence to suggest a potentially dramatic change in the treatment of cancers with mutations of the p53 gene.

Merck's Consumer Health Business Presents New Purpose to Help Prepare Society for 100 Healthy Years Merck's Consumer Health Business Presents New Purpose to Help Prepare Society for 100 Healthy Years CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 13/09/2016 09:16 DARMSTADT, Germany, September 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck, a leading science and technology company, revealed the new purpose "Prepare society for a new era of humans living 100 healthy years" for its Consumer Health business. The purpose will be brought to life through the movement "WE100®" aimed at raising awareness of healthy living, all the way from children's age to 100 years. The WE100 movement with its motto "Young for old. Old for young." will also coordinate concrete actions to help prepare society for humans living 100 healthy years.      (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160913/406890 ) The new purpose of the Consumer Health business of Merck has been presented along with the WE100 movement by Uta Kemmerich-Keil, President and CEO of the Consumer Health Business, who commented "Our main objective is to change perceptions of society and take concrete action to articulate the next steps on our journey toward 100 healthy years. This initiative is equally aimed at the younger population, which needs to be educated now about the right approach to healthy ageing." Kemmerich-Keil added "We decided to launch a new purpose and WE100 as a neutral movement so that everybody sharing the goal of preparing society to live 100 healthy years could join," Kemmerich-Keil concluded. The WE100 movement was also recently presented at Cannes Creativity Festival by Atilla Cansun, Chief Marketing Officer of the Consumer Health business of Merck, who explained "We believe age does not influence how much one has to offer. Our first step will be to eliminate the barriers preventing the older generation to be fully involved and integrated in society. We want to set the bar high and we welcome anyone sharing our goal to prepare society for humans living 100 healthy years to join us as the WE100 movement develops." As life expectancy continues to increase dramatically across the world since 1945, surveys show that society is not yet prepared for the prospect of humans living 100 years.[1] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world's population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22% by 2050. As a first step of the WE100 movement, the Consumer Health business of Merck conducted a survey on ageing and the perception of ageing across society, which showed that 80% of interviewees think that society needs to dramatically change its perception and attitude towards ageing. The survey also showed that 95% of interviewees believe governments are not taking a proactive role in findings solutions to trigger greater involvement in the society after retirement. In addition, 80% of those interviewed think they have lower chances to find jobs at age 50+ versus younger generations. Finally, when asked whether children are prepared to live 100 healthy years, 93% of survey respondents say current education is falling short of providing the necessary information to prepare children early on to live a long healthy life. As part of the WE100 movement pilots, activities in schools are planned in 2017 to help children prepare for healthy ageing. Finally, as of October 2016, WE100 will start working on establishing partnerships with public and private organizations around the theme of living 100 healthy years to involve relevant stakeholders in the movement.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Tag News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted Journalist Account PRNewswire Distribution Search Military Families Enjoy Discount Program for Fertility Treatments   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Fertility Medications * IVF medications By Industry: * HealthNEW YORK - Sept. 12, 2016 - PRLog -- Military families receive a significant discount on fertility meds from EMD Serono (Merck) in the form of a program called Compassionate Corps. Veterans and their spouses will be eligible to receive free fertility meds. This program expands upon the Compassionate Care program already offered by Serono. In order to qualify for the free fertility medications and IVF drugs, those who have served in the military will be required to be retired, or the spouse of a veteran, be considered infertile due to a service-related injury, or have been diagnosed by a doctor as being infertile and needing intervention. This program was introduced in 2014 and has now expanded to include many who were previously not covered. IVFprescriptions.com supports the US military and their families who participate in this program. Fertility Drug Support Says Craig Millian, Head of US Endocrinology and Fertility, "We are proud to add to our comprehensive access programs a new way to help serve the men and women of our military who may be experiencing financial barriers to fertility treatment." With many couples spending tens of thousands of dollars for multiple cycles, offsetting the costs for fertility drugs and IVF procedures, and the IVF drugs that are necessary to achieve conception and pregnancy, are offering hope to those who had given up on having their own children. How to Enroll in Fertility Drug Discount Program For those who qualify, there is one more stipulation. The fertility center that patients are utilizing must be one that participates in the program. Not all do. Centers who wish to become participating centers can contact Serono directly to receive the necessary forms. The necessary forms will be submitted to Serono, who will send approval, in most instances, within a couple of days. Once this has been completed the patient can obtain the needed fertility drugs for up to two cycles per year, at no charge. The Fine Print for Discount Fertility Meds Those who wish to participate in the discount IVF drugs program that is offered to the military, need to keep in mind that patients have to reapply each year. The discount can't be combined with any other medical insurance or discounts, and if you are covered under Medicare, or other programs offed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, you won't be allowed to participate. This discount primarily covers the fertility drugs produced by Serono, which include Gonal-F, Centrotide, and Ovidrel. Military Discount for Fertility Meds and IVFPrescriptions.com IVFprescriptions.com is one of many online discount pharmacies, who are certified and licensed by the Ministry of Health. They also carry fertility medications produced by Serono, and as such support the programs that have been launched. For an in-depth discussion about how IVFprescriptions.com can offer discounts on fertility meds go to the website: www.ivfprescriptions.com, or call their offices directly. For those not qualifying for the Compassionate Corps program, there are many other discounts that can be realized. IVF Prescriptions is licensed by the Israel Ministry of Health and accredited to export medicines worldwide. IVF Prescriptions is a leader in discount infertility drugs with pharmacies in the UK, Germany, and Israel. Manufacturing facilities are located in the Netherlands, Ireland, and Germany. We are dedicated to providing you with the best service and the lowest price for your online fertility meds, with different divisions of specialty drugs, from lifesaving medications to life-giving fertility drugs.

Proposition 61, the Drug Price Relief Act, is the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation’s response to a controversy over the dramatic price increase of some prescription drugs—most notably EpiPen, a lifesaving anti-allergic reaction device. For Deia Davis-Williams of Beaumont, a 400 percent increase in the price of EpiPen threatens her life. Davis-Williams says she has used EpiPen for 14 years to combat a fatal allergy to latex and never received notice of a price change from her healthcare provider. She now pays $400 for an injector she’d routinely buy with a co-pay of $20, since her health insurances no longer covers EpiPen. “I had a refill that I needed due to an attack in May and my pens were defective, the needle broke on one and the other pen did not work as well, so I had no pens at all,” Davis-Williams said. “I had to go for a refill and that’s when I found out it wasn’t covered with my insurance anymore, and I was going to have to pay full price and I didn’t have the money.” EpiPen users won’t be the only group affected by the price increase. Last January, a bill took effect requiring all California schools to stock at least one injector. Taxpayers will have to foot the bill. California’s Prop. 61 promises to deal directly with lowering prescription drug prices. It would prohibit state programs such as Medicaid from paying more for a drug than the lowest price paid by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which typically receives discounts. It is reported the pharmaceutical industry has spent nearly $70 million to defeat the initiative. Mylan, the generics and specialty pharmaceutical company, is responsible for raising prices on the product they acquired in 2007 from pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck. Back then, the price for a pack of two EpiPens was $100. Now it costs nearly $600. Last week, Mylan announced the expansion of existing cost-cutting programs to patients for out-of-pocket costs and issued savings cards, but coupons may not be enough to satisfy users and lawmakers. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) said this step by the pharmaceutical giant seems more like a public relations drill than an actual remedy. “What’s needed is robust, real action to lower the price for everyone, not just a select few,” said Blumenthal. Mylan Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch, who also oversees the lobbying group Generic Pharmaceutical Association, said the price increase was necessary for the company to recoup its investment in EpiPen. According to the company, this includes raising awareness for severe allergic reactions and making improvements to how the product works. But critics argue the price increase isn’t driven by Mylan’s costs. Just $1 worth of epinephrine, the active ingredient, is used in the injector and manufacturing costs are pennies per device. Director of the Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation at the University of Michigan, Marianne Udow-Phillips, said Mylan knew they had a monopoly on the product. “Congress does need to do something to change this picture,” said Udow-Phillips.”This is a perfect demonstration of the complexity and real problems with pharmaceutical pricing in this country.” Bresch’s father, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia), weighed in on the onslaught of criticism over EpiPen price increase. “I am aware of the questions my colleagues and many parents are asking, and frankly, I share their concerns about the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs,” he said. “I look forward to reviewing their response in detail and working with my colleagues, and all interested parties to lower the price of prescription drugs and to continue to improve our healthcare system.” Bresch vigorously defended the price hikes, arguing the U.S. healthcare framework incentivizes higher prices through a complex thicket of drug companies, insurers, healthcare providers and pharmacy benefit managers. “There’s no question, the system is broken,” she said. “There’s no transparency, there’s no clarity and no one knows what anything costs.” Prescription drug prices have become a huge concern for the public, with a growing awareness that prescription drug costs are often significantly lower in countries such as Canada. Davis-Williams said she considers moving out of the country in order to afford the lifesaving device. “I don’t want to die and leave my kids without a mother all because I can’t get a medication to keep me from dying because someone has decided that my life is not worth saving or anyone else’s,” she said. Pfizer Canada is the sole distributor of EpiPens through a licensing agreement with Mylan. Prices for the device have remained the same for the past few years. Patients can obtain two EpiPens for $210 without a prescription. Mylan says in the U.S. they receive $274 on the sale of two EpiPens, claiming the other $400 goes to U.S. insurers and wholesalers. After much scrutiny, this week Mylan announced they would introduce a generic EpiPen identical to the existing product with a wholesale list price of $300. “We understand the deep frustration and concerns associated with the cost of EpiPen to the patient, and have always shared the public’s desire to ensure that this important product be accessible to anyone who needs it,” Bresch said, in a statement. “Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response, which required the cooperation of our partner.” But Davis-Williams doesn’t believe the generic substitute will contain the same potency as the original EpiPen. “Any medication that you decide you’re going to make a generic version of, you don’t know if you’re getting the full strength or not,” Davis-Williams said. “Like Claritin, when they made a store brand available, it was not as strong as it was and my kids are on it. I ended up having to get a doctor’s prescription for the medication because the one being sold over the counter wasn’t helping my kids’ allergies at all.” _____ By Madlen Grgodjaian California Black Media Follow Filed Under: featured, Health Tagged With: CBM, Epipen Connect With Us!

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Dale Wyngarden: Big pharma controls Congress Tuesday Sep 13, 2016 at 2:01 AM By Dale WyngardenCommunity Columnist The EpiPen story is familiar to anyone who reads by now. An automated injector for a dose of epinephrin (adrenaline) to counteract anaphylactic shock, usually triggered by severe allergic reactions, was developed in the 1970s, and licensed for sale by the FDA in 1987. For two decades, it produced a steady stream of revenue for several pharmaceutical companies licensed to market it.  When Mylan Pharmaceutical bought distribution rights from Merck in 2007, it generated $200 million in sales. The same year, the Mylan CEO received compensation of $2.4 million and Mylan stock traded at $13.29 a share. Nine years later, sales topped $1 billion, CEO compensation skyrocketed to $18.9 million and stock values reached $47.59. This prosperity was fueled by a steady stream of price escalation that quintupled the wholesale price and drove the retail price from less than $100 to nearly $600. All of this on the backs of families desperate to protect the vulnerable from deadly allergic reactions, and on the backs of taxpayers cursed with a federal government that is complicit.  It's just business. Free enterprise, claims Mylan. Free enterprise, my posterior. We know what free enterprise looks like in Holland. Look at the office furniture industry. Four world leaders in our backyard. All of them seemingly prosperous. All competing with each other. Mylan enjoys a virtual monopoly, thanks to our federal Food and Drug Administration and patent protection, and you and I pay dearly for it.  Europe counts as many as nine different products delivering epinephrin, but our FDA keeps foreign drugs out of our market, supposedly to protect the quality and integrity of American made pharmaceuticals, This, despite the fact that on any global ranking of health care system we always come in as the most expensive and somewhere between the 24th and 36th most effective. We're consistently behind almost every European country.  EpiPens in Europe sell in a range from $75 to $100. National health care systems sit at table with pharmaceutical suppliers that enjoy a virtual monopoly and negotiate a price that is fair to both manufacturers and taxpayers. We, on the other hand, not only don't, but our Congress, ever appreciative of the cash cow the pharmaceutical industry has been to our political process, has even enacted a law prohibiting our largest medical insurance program, Medicare, from negotiating prices. While protecting Mylan's monopoly, our government responds to obscene price escalation by simply paying. At our expense, of course.  This doesn't come without some cost to the industry. In 2008, Mylan's lobbying expenses climbed from $270,000 to $1.2 million. Last year Pfizer reportedly spent over $10 million on lobbying. Tracking lobbying spending over the past 18 years, the Center for Responsive Politics finds the pharmaceutical and health products industries top all others at nearly $3.4 billion. There have got to be a lot of lobster thermador lunches and luxury golf outings buried in that pile. And can contributions to politicians be far behind? So far, presidential candidates have raked in nearly $9.5 million from the pharmaceutical industry. Ideology seems to make scant difference. Money flows to all candidates, on both sides of the aisle. Mylan's abject greed and wanton disregard for the American people, whose government has protected them with a virtual monopoly, grieves me. So also does the perception that the loyalties of our Congress and federal agencies have been bought by the sea of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry rather than the votes of hometown constituents. Washington seems broken, and nobody we send there seems much interested in fixing it. We may get a congressional hearing, but don't hope for much more. — Dale Wyngarden is a resident of the city of Holland. He can be reached at wyngarden@ameritech.net.

Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Sep 13, 2016 at 9:22AM Image source: Getty Images. Since the failure of Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) $160 billion megadeal to buy Allergan and move its headquarters, on paper, to lower-tax Ireland, shares of the pharmaceutical giant have been moving upward. In fact, the stock is up around 12% since early April, when the likelihood of the merger being called off became apparent. More recently, Pfizer has announced some eye-popping deals to boost profits and sales quickly, including the $14 billion buyout of cancer biotech Medivation (NASDAQ:MDVN) and its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi. While I'm optimistic about Pfizer's future, the company needs to play its cards carefully in the next few quarters because big risks are lurking under the surface. In particular, here are three wild cards that could propel the big pharma's shares sharply downward in the next few months. The first wild card: Management scuttles the idea of a company split The idea of Pfizer splitting into two entities is front and center on shareholders' minds this year, with management saying a definitive decision should come by the end of 2016. Advocates of a split believe it would unlock significant shareholder value trapped in Pfizer's conglomerate structure. In particular, top revenue-generating assets, such as Ibrance, Enbrel, Lyrica, Eliquis, and Xeljanz, could be unchained from Pfizer's slower-moving product lines. Since Pfizer's top-line growth has been sagging, in part due to the difficulty of meaningfully growing revenues once a company exceeds $50 billion a year in revenue, it seems likely the market will punish the stock if the split doesn't happen. Add to that the fact the split is expected, with many analysts citing Pfizer's $17 billion deal to buy intravenous-drug maker Hospira, as well as the recent Medivation deal, being all about juicing up its divisions in preparation for a split. Pfizer has fended off years of relentless pressure from analysts and others to break up. In addition, the new acquisitions could just as easily indicate that management has now found ways to accelerate growth and profit without a split. That being said, I don't personally think it's likely the split will be called off -- but it's still a risk. The joker in the deck: Pipeline failures Pfizer's pipeline is one of the largest in the world, with over 90 drugs in clinical trials or beyond trials and registered with the FDA for approval. Of those, nine drugs are in the headline-generating registration phase. Given so many shots on goal, it's not just possible, but probable, that one or more drugs disappoint. One drug that could either shoot to stardom or flame out is avelumab. The oncology drug, co-developed with Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK), could be filed with the FDA as soon as the second half of 2016. Pfizer rates it as a significant pipeline opportunity, with estimated peak sales at $1.9 billion. With the expectations behind this drug, it needs to stay on its timeline. And then there's Ibrance, Pfizer's breast cancer-treating superstar. The drug is up for EU evaluation by the end of this year. Since this drug has immense potential, anything but a full-on approval would likely hurt Pfizer's stock. Also up for approval is a med from Pfizer's $5.5 billion deal to buy California-based Anacor Pharmaceuticals. The topical gel crisaborole, for eczema treatment, is currently under FDA review. Pfizer believes crisaborole could reach or exceed annual sales of $2 billion. A regulatory decision is expected by January 2017. The ace of spades: The acquisition spree doesn't pay off M&A deals are not a prescription that always works in a shareholder's favor. While Medivation fits well with Pfizer's bid to conquer cancer, pricing power in this therapy area could be winding down. While cancer drug prices have held up thus far, things could erode rapidly if the federal government goes beyond taking potshots at high-priced drugs and starts playing hardball. In addition, the current market frenzy around oncology assets is leading to acquirers paying top dollar. Indeed, all the jockeying with other drugmakers led to the Medivation deal costing Pfizer more than 14 times Medivation's revenue guidance for 2016. Medivation's lead drug, Xtandi, had $2.2 billion in revenue in the last four quarters, and it is projected to reach $4 billion in five years. But it may fall well short, since Xtandi faces competition from Johnson and Johnson's Zytiga. Worse, Medivation's two clinical-stage oncology assets, PARP inhibitor talazoparib and antibody pidilizumab, share the risk of any investigational drug -- they still have to run the FDA gauntlet. Always play cards close to chest, because no safe stocks exist Big pharma companies are often regarded as safe stocks, but that's an illusion. They can still present big risks for investors: Drugs in development often don't work, drugs fail in clinical trials, and the FDA can drop the ax. Even if drugs are approved, their addressable market can be snared by a competitor, or they may become targets for cost-conscious regulators. Let's not end on a gloomy note, because Pfizer looks to be on a good trajectory right now. In particular, Ibrance is a fantastic cornerstone to a growing cancer franchise, and the drugmaker's rising price in a listless market looks promising. But there's always the chance of a messy surprise coming, so keep your powder dry.   Cheryl Swanson owns shares of Allergan and Johnson and Johnson.

Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Sep 13, 2016 at 9:22AM Image source: Getty Images. Since the failure of Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) $160 billion megadeal to buy Allergan and move its headquarters, on paper, to lower-tax Ireland, shares of the pharmaceutical giant have been moving upward. In fact, the stock is up around 12% since early April, when the likelihood of the merger being called off became apparent. More recently, Pfizer has announced some eye-popping deals to boost profits and sales quickly, including the $14 billion buyout of cancer biotech Medivation (NASDAQ:MDVN) and its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi. While I'm optimistic about Pfizer's future, the company needs to play its cards carefully in the next few quarters because big risks are lurking under the surface. In particular, here are three wild cards that could propel the big pharma's shares sharply downward in the next few months. The first wild card: Management scuttles the idea of a company split The idea of Pfizer splitting into two entities is front and center on shareholders' minds this year, with management saying a definitive decision should come by the end of 2016. Advocates of a split believe it would unlock significant shareholder value trapped in Pfizer's conglomerate structure. In particular, top revenue-generating assets, such as Ibrance, Enbrel, Lyrica, Eliquis, and Xeljanz, could be unchained from Pfizer's slower-moving product lines. Since Pfizer's top-line growth has been sagging, in part due to the difficulty of meaningfully growing revenues once a company exceeds $50 billion a year in revenue, it seems likely the market will punish the stock if the split doesn't happen. Add to that the fact the split is expected, with many analysts citing Pfizer's $17 billion deal to buy intravenous-drug maker Hospira, as well as the recent Medivation deal, being all about juicing up its divisions in preparation for a split. Pfizer has fended off years of relentless pressure from analysts and others to break up. In addition, the new acquisitions could just as easily indicate that management has now found ways to accelerate growth and profit without a split. That being said, I don't personally think it's likely the split will be called off -- but it's still a risk. The joker in the deck: Pipeline failures Pfizer's pipeline is one of the largest in the world, with over 90 drugs in clinical trials or beyond trials and registered with the FDA for approval. Of those, nine drugs are in the headline-generating registration phase. Given so many shots on goal, it's not just possible, but probable, that one or more drugs disappoint. One drug that could either shoot to stardom or flame out is avelumab. The oncology drug, co-developed with Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK), could be filed with the FDA as soon as the second half of 2016. Pfizer rates it as a significant pipeline opportunity, with estimated peak sales at $1.9 billion. With the expectations behind this drug, it needs to stay on its timeline. And then there's Ibrance, Pfizer's breast cancer-treating superstar. The drug is up for EU evaluation by the end of this year. Since this drug has immense potential, anything but a full-on approval would likely hurt Pfizer's stock. Also up for approval is a med from Pfizer's $5.5 billion deal to buy California-based Anacor Pharmaceuticals. The topical gel crisaborole, for eczema treatment, is currently under FDA review. Pfizer believes crisaborole could reach or exceed annual sales of $2 billion. A regulatory decision is expected by January 2017. The ace of spades: The acquisition spree doesn't pay off M&A deals are not a prescription that always works in a shareholder's favor. While Medivation fits well with Pfizer's bid to conquer cancer, pricing power in this therapy area could be winding down. While cancer drug prices have held up thus far, things could erode rapidly if the federal government goes beyond taking potshots at high-priced drugs and starts playing hardball. In addition, the current market frenzy around oncology assets is leading to acquirers paying top dollar. Indeed, all the jockeying with other drugmakers led to the Medivation deal costing Pfizer more than 14 times Medivation's revenue guidance for 2016. Medivation's lead drug, Xtandi, had $2.2 billion in revenue in the last four quarters, and it is projected to reach $4 billion in five years. But it may fall well short, since Xtandi faces competition from Johnson and Johnson's Zytiga. Worse, Medivation's two clinical-stage oncology assets, PARP inhibitor talazoparib and antibody pidilizumab, share the risk of any investigational drug -- they still have to run the FDA gauntlet. Always play cards close to chest, because no safe stocks exist Big pharma companies are often regarded as safe stocks, but that's an illusion. They can still present big risks for investors: Drugs in development often don't work, drugs fail in clinical trials, and the FDA can drop the ax. Even if drugs are approved, their addressable market can be snared by a competitor, or they may become targets for cost-conscious regulators. Let's not end on a gloomy note, because Pfizer looks to be on a good trajectory right now. In particular, Ibrance is a fantastic cornerstone to a growing cancer franchise, and the drugmaker's rising price in a listless market looks promising. But there's always the chance of a messy surprise coming, so keep your powder dry.   Cheryl Swanson owns shares of Allergan and Johnson and Johnson.

Politicians will bravely vote to legalize it because they care about freedom and public safety. Hahahahahahaha. Sorry. Sorry. Only joking. The real reason marijuana will be legal is money. The pot dispensaries in Colorado and Washington are raking in cash. As soon as they are allowed to accept credit cards and deposit their revenue in banks like other stores, they will make a lot more money. Soon, the best weed stores will be bought out by corporations. And those corporations will pay off legislators on the state and national level to legalize marijuana. Then it will only be a matter of time before you see Woody Harrelson selling “Woody’s Wacky Tobacky” on a commercial during the Super Bowl Halftime Show. If you’re thinking that it’s a bad idea to let corporations sell drugs using TV ads, you’re right. And documentarian Chris Bell, director of “Prescription Thugs”, definitely agrees with you. Chris Bell sites 1983 as the year everything went downhill for the American pharmaceutical industry. That was the year that Washington decided to allow drug commercials for the first time. The FDA and Congress were flooded with letters from concerned citizens urging them not to let drug companies become heartless profiteers like other corporations. These letters were from the CEOs of the drug companies themselves. A generation later, all of the CEOs’ worst fears have come true. While most of us say “no” illegal drugs, the majority of us say “yes, please” to the legal ones. Before I wrote this paragraph, I walked to the kitchen to take my three morning pills. Seriously. Of every 100 pills produced on planet earth, 75 are consumed by Americans. The greatest drug kingpins in the world aren’t escaping Mexican prison, they are leading Dow 30 companies. “Prescription Thugs” observes that big pharma promises quick fixes to all of mankind’s problems and then makes sure that there are free samples at your doctor’s office to get you hooked. Feeling sad? Take a pill. High cholesterol? Take a pill. The film argues that statin drugs are bogus and don’t save lives. A former big pharma rep says that the most notable thing that Pfizer’s top selling pill Lipitor does is make male patients less potent. Conveniently, Pfizer’s second best-selling pill is Viagra. Another reason there are so many new legal drugs on the market is that the FDA screening process has become a joke. All a company has to do is present two studies in which its new drug has the intended effects. If there are 56 competing studies in which the drug didn’t work or had horrific side effects, Merck can just sweep those under the rug. And don’t expect the system to be reformed any time soon. Big pharma spends $130,000,000 on Washington lobbying annually. That’s a quarter of a million dollars per congressman. Chris Bell (“Bigger Stronger Faster”) is my favorite documentarian. He is reasonable, unideological, and non-judgmental. Even though he reveals that he is addicted to prescription drugs and his older brother dies from an overdose during the movie, Bell never points fingers or shirks his own personal responsibility. I agree with “Prescription Thugs”. There are too many pills in this country right now. And there is plenty of blame to go around and no easy answer. Getting all of those drug ads off television would be a darn good start, though. QR Code – Take this post Mobile! Use this unique QR (Quick Response) code with your smart device.

Malignancies News provided by Xencor, Inc. Sep 12, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article MONROVIA, Calif., Sept. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ: XNCR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial of XmAb®14045 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other CD123-expressing hematologic malignancies. "XmAb14045 is a bispecific antibody that engages the immune system against AML," said Paul Foster, M.D., chief medical officer at Xencor. "Built on the scaffold of Xencor's XmAb bispecific Fc domain, XmAb14045 simultaneously binds to CD123, a protein on AML cells, and CD3, a protein on cytotoxic T cells, to activate a targeted immune response against the cancer cells. XmAb14045 has shown highly potent killing of tumor cells in preclinical studies and we look forward to studying its safety, tolerability and antitumor activity in clinical trials." The purpose of the trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of weekly intravenous administration of XmAb14045 and to determine the maximally tolerated dose/dosing schedule. Approximately 60 patients with AML or other CD123-expressing hematologic malignancies will receive XmAb14045. XmAb14045 showed very effective and potent depletion of target cells in primate studies from a well-tolerated single IV dose. XmAb14045 is Xencor's lead bispecific candidate within the company's broad portfolio of CD3 bispecific antibody immunotherapies. Xencor and Novartis share worldwide development costs for XmAb14045 with Xencor maintaining U.S. commercial rights and Novartis having commercial rights in the rest of the world. Xencor expects to advance additional candidates using Xencor's XmAb bispecific technology into the clinic by the end of 2017. For more information about the XmAb14045 clinical trial please visit to www.clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT02730312).  About XmAb®14045 XmAb14045 is a tumor-targeted antibody that contains both a CD123 binding domain and a cytotoxic T-cell binding domain (CD3) in Phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other CD123-expressing hematologic malignancies. An XmAb Bispecific Fc domain serves as the scaffold for these two antigen binding domains and confers long circulating half-life, stability and ease of manufacture on XmAb14045. CD123 is highly expressed on AML cells and leukemic stem cells, and is associated with poorer prognosis in AML patients.  Engagement of CD3 by XmAb14045 activates T cells for highly potent and targeted killing of CD123-expressing tumor cells. About Xencor's XmAb® Bispecific Technology As opposed to traditional monoclonal antibodies that target and bind to a single antigen, bispecific antibodies are designed to elicit multiple biological effects that require simultaneous binding to two different antigen targets. Xencor's XmAb bispecific Fc domain technology is designed to maintain full-length antibody properties in a bispecific antibody, potentially enabling favorable in vivo half-life and simplified manufacturing. Efforts at bispecific antibody design are typically frustrated by poor molecular stability, difficulties in production and short in vivo half-life. Xencor has engineered a series of Fc domain variants that spontaneously form stable, heterodimeric bispecific antibodies and that can be made and purified with standard antibody production methods. These bispecific Fc domains are used to generate a broad array of novel drug candidates in a range of molecule formats. Xencor's initial bispecific programs are T-cell engaging cancer immunotherapies that bind to cancer cells at one end and bind to cytotoxic T-cells at the other end, resulting in a highly potent and targeted killing of cancer cells. The XmAb Fc domain format allows Xencor to tune the potency of the T-cell killing, potentially improving the tolerability of cancer immunotherapy.  About Acute Myeloid Leukemia Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blood cells that interfere with production of normal cells. It is estimated 20,000 patients in the United States will be diagnosed with AML each year. Without treatment AML can progress quickly and become fatal. For more information, please visit www.cancer.org. About Xencor, Inc. Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer. Currently, 10 candidates engineered with Xencor's XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners. Xencor's internal programs include: XmAb5871 in Phase 2 development for the treatment of IgG4-Related Disease, and also for the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; XmAb7195 in Phase 1 development for the treatment of asthma and allergic diseases; XmAb14045 in Phase 1 development for acute myeloid leukemia; and XmAb13676 for B-cell malignancies and XmAb18087 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors, both in pre-clinical development. Xencor's XmAb antibody engineering technology enables small changes to the structure of monoclonal antibodies resulting in new mechanisms of therapeutic action.  Xencor partners include Novartis, Amgen, MorphoSys, Merck, CSL/Janssen, Alexion, Novo Nordisk and Boehringer Ingelheim.

The company will pay an initial 180 million pounds to Glaxo and disburse as much as 100 million pounds if certain goals are met, the Durban, South Africa-based drugmaker said in a statement on Monday. The deal adds to the anaesthetics Aspen bought in June from AstraZeneca of the UK for as much as $770 million. An Aspen warehouse. File picture: Supplied. Credit: INDEPENDENT MEDIA “Aspen has identified anaesthetics as a key element of its expansion strategy,” the company said. “The addition of the portfolio will serve to further establish Aspen as a major role player in anaesthetics globally.” The deal is the second since Aspen said in June it had secured 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in funding, attracting support from 27 banks. The acquisitive company has spent more than $2 billion on assets from drugmakers including Glaxo and Merck & Company in recent years to boost its portfolio of medicines and manufacturing sites, and now sells medicines in more than 150 countries. The shares declined 1.4 percent to 324.25 rand as of 10.16am in Johannesburg, valuing the company at R148 billion ($10.2 billion). The stock is down more than 10 percent since the company announced on Wednesday that the impact of selling pharmaceutical assets and a one-time currency-related loss in Venezuela would weigh on earnings. Aspen also will buy rights from Glaxo to sell two drugs in additional countries, including China, for 45 million pounds. Aspen had previously bought the rights to sell the medicines, Fraxiparine and Arixtra, in other markets. The two companies agreed to cancel a partnership in sub-Saharan Africa, for which Aspen will receive 45 million pounds from the London-based company. * For more developments around this story, check out the print edition of Business Report on Tuesday.

Big Pharma Marketers Try Terror Tactics to Scare Up Sales By Adrianne Pasquarelli. Published on September 12, 2016. Reprints Reprints Grandma is a wolf in an ad for a whooping cough vaccine. Credit: iSpot Grandma as a menacing wolf. Parents whose carelessness leads to cancer in their kids. A teenager hospitalized after sharing a seemingly innocent kiss. Halloween may still be over a month away, but Big Pharma is already out to scare consumers. In recent months, several fear-instilling, often ominous commercials for medical devices, products and vaccines from drugmakers including Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and Mylan are airing in fairly heavy rotation. In GSK's spot for whooping cough vaccine Boostrix, a sick grandmother is portrayed as a wolf holding a human infant. In Pfizer's ad for Trumenba, a meningitis B vaccine, scenes in reverse order show how a boy celebrating at a birthday party ended up prone and pale in a hospital bed after his mom mistakenly thought he just had the flu. "If you increase an individual's feeling that they're susceptible to a threat, and increase the perceived severity of that threat, people are more likely to take action," said Adrienne Faerber, a lecturer at the Dartmouth Institute. "What are these advertisements but trying to get people to take action on things they probably aren't thinking about." Then there's Mylan's EpiPen. In an unsettling commercial for the auto-injector, a young partygoer suffers an extreme anaphylactic reaction, terrifying those around her. Mylan, of course, has come under fire for gouging after pushing up the price of an EpiPen two-pack by more than 550% to $600 since 2007. And that, said John Mack, who runs electronic newsletter Pharma Marketing News, is no coincidence. He said that "a trend with companies, especially ones with injectable drugs and vaccines, which also have big price increases, is to scare people into buying their product or getting their vaccine." Related Stories Pharmaceutical Marketers Need to Take a Chill Pill Mylan Plans Generic EpiPen to Quell Media Storm Over $600 Cost Sarah Jessica Parker Quits EpiPen Campaign EpiPen Maker Mylan Is Airing Fewer Commercials for Its Pricey Product It seems that as product prices increase, so does industry spending on advertising. Last year, prescription drug companies spent $5.8 billion on measured media in the U.S., a 23% increase over 2014, according to Ad Age's Datacenter. That's more than the insurance category, which spent $5.2 billion. Many of pharma's ads target aging baby boomers, who represent a substantial bulk of healthcare's customer base, and prey on their fear, for example, of not being able to spend quality time with their grandchildren. "Baby boomers are almost 80 million strong, but are getting to the point where the population can only live so long—the run for the healthcare industry is going to start waning, so [drugmakers are] taking advantage," said Bethany Bayer, VP-group director of strategy for the Boston healthcare strategy practice of Digitas. But she cautioned that she tells her clients to take a more humane approach in their marketing. "No patient wants to think of themselves that way." Fearmongering was not always the go-to strategy. In the years following the Food and Drug Administration's late-'90s relaxation of direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising on TV, medical ads were often more cheerful, upbeat and positive, experts said. But recent years have seen a darker turn as product prices have risen and consumers have become more cynical of profiteering brands. "This has been a gradual evolution," said George Sillup, chair and associate professor of pharmaceutical and healthcare marketing at Saint Joseph's University. "If we looked at ads over the last year compared with ads three to five years ago, they used to be more scientific—now they're about convince and persuade." To avoid having to dedicate valuable screen time to side effects to comply with FDA regulations, many brands have omitted product names from their ads. Mylan's EpiPen spot doesn't reference the device itself, but instead directs consumers to an informational website. Dartmouth's Ms. Faerber noted that the strategy could appeal to brands that have the market cornered on products. EpiPen is one of only two such products for anaphylactic shock and is considered the better alternative, for example. "It's a way to build market share through making people more aware of a disease rather than promoting the product itself," said Ms. Faerber. Some drug companies say that boldness is necessary to get their points across and to educate consumers. Merck is running a commercial for HPV vaccine Gardasil in which children ask their parents if they knew they were at risk of getting cancer. "This campaign is designed to help parents become aware of the potential risk of HPV-related cancers for their children later in life," said a spokeswoman at Merck. She cited a recent internal study in which many parents were unaware of the link between HPV and certain cancers. Similarly, a GSK spokeswoman said its wolf ad helped to motivate consumers. "This campaign tested well among grandparents and motivated them to talk to their healthcare provider about vaccination," she said, noting that more traditional imagery was not as memorable. She said the wolf in the ad is symbolic of hidden dangers, like in "Little Red Riding Hood," and that the company did not use real wolves, but computer-generated imagery. Yet even if a campaign is effective at grabbing attention and triggering action, experts caution that fear appeal will only work up to a point. Tim Hawkey, managing director and exec creative director at Area 23, an FCB Health company, noted that previous antismoking ads aimed at teenagers failed with their use of scare tactics. Consumers simply couldn't process that they could be personally susceptible to the risk. Mr. Hawkey said that brands need to make sure they don't cross a line into too extreme territory, showing a tombstone rather than a hospital bed, for instance. "Fear can be motivating until it's demotivating," he said. "There's a threshold at which we turn off and say, 'That's not me, that's someone else—my brain can't handle this level of risk and information.'"

The company will pay an initial 180 million pounds to Glaxo and disburse as much as 100 million pounds if certain goals are met, the Durban, South Africa-based drugmaker said in a statement on Monday. The deal adds to the anesthetics Aspen bought in June from AstraZeneca Plc of the U.K. for as much as $770 million. “Aspen has identified anesthetics as a key element of its expansion strategy,” the company said. “The addition of the portfolio will serve to further establish Aspen as a major role player in anesthetics globally.” The deal is the second since Aspen said in June it had secured 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in funding, attracting support from 27 banks. The acquisitive company has spent more than $2 billion on assets from drugmakers including Glaxo and Merck & Co. in recent years to boost its portfolio of medicines and manufacturing sites, and now sells medicines in more than 150 countries. The shares declined 1.4 percent to 324.25 rand as of 10:16 a.m. in Johannesburg, valuing the company at 148 billion rand ($10.2 billion). The stock is down more than 10 percent since the company announced on Wednesday that the impact of selling pharmaceutical assets and a one-time currency-related loss in Venezuela would weigh on earnings. Aspen also will buy rights from Glaxo to sell two drugs in additional countries, including China, for 45 million pounds.

Login Register Public Release: 13-Sep-2016 Five ways to tackle the reproducibility crisis in biomedical research Cell Press Share  Print  E-Mail IMAGE: This figure shows issues contributing to suboptimal reproducibility of preclinical research. view more Credit: Daniel Drucker/Cell Metabolism 2016 Daniel Drucker's unofficial laboratory slogan is "I'd rather be third and right, than first and wrong." As a clinician-scientist who has spent 30 years developing new drugs for diabetes, gastrointestinal disease, and obesity, he has seen high-profile journal article after article proclaim the beginning of the end for these diseases, only for the findings to never be discussed again. This isn't dishonesty or fraud, he says, but the irreproducibility of these amazing discoveries reflects a culture that supports invalidated materials, unreported negative data, and authors overgeneralizing their results. In an op-ed published September 13 in Cell Metabolism, Drucker, of the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Toronto, discusses the chasm between biomedical scientists' astounding preclinical success and the meager clinical translatability. He also suggests ways that researchers can improve and standardize experiments so that the joy of exciting results can come with a rigorous scientific story. These include: 1. Apply Rules for Clinical Trials to Preclinical Research "If you did a clinical trial where you studied 100 patients and only reported data on those patients that fit your hypothesis, I can tell you that you would be fired," Drucker says. "Yet it is common practice to carry out dozens of basic science experiments and not report the majority of them--only the ones that the principle investigator is particularly smitten by are published." As a consequence, the results of many papers are indeed reproducible, if the experiment is precisely conducted with the same mice, which are the same age and the same sex, from the identical supplier, in the same location, with the same microbiota, etc. Failed experiments often don't get mentioned in the paper because it weakens the story that the researcher wants to send to the journal, he says. Negative results, even with slightly different experimental conditions, often mean a mid-tier publication, which is a cultural issue that fosters irreproducibility. 2. Test Hypotheses in More Than One Animal Model Drucker requires his students and postdocs to replicate the effects of a potential therapeutic in several animal models of diabetes or obesity before going on to explore the potential mechanism in tissue and cell cultures. This is a slow approach, and not always fruitful, but it does temper underdeveloped conclusions. An opposite strategy, used in many labs, is to search for an interesting elegant molecular mechanism using molecular and biochemical techniques ex vivo and then generate an animal model that supports these findings. These fast discoveries often come with publication in a top-tier journal and other accolades, but they can be more challenging to apply to human disease. "We would be serving the community better if we could reproduce really cool results in multiple animal models and not just report the ones that work," Drucker says. "We never even hear about the experiments that didn't work until someone else tries and fails to reproduce the findings in a different model. But there is no penalty or reward for producing more or less reproducible research, and no one keeps track of it." 3. Hold Reproducibility Symposia It is rare to see sessions at scientific meetings dedicated to reproducibility issues in research. These discussions do take place, Drucker says, but in hallways or bars, not a formal atmosphere. Having an honest public discussion of common problems and solution, and encouraging everyone to be more accountable for their work, would also set a positive example for young researchers. New methods and techniques are constantly available, and so there will likely always be ways for investigators to improve their practices. 4. Develop Reproducibility Reporting To improve accountability, Drucker envisions a future where an academic independent body develops a basic algorithm that could compute how reproducible or irreproducible a scientific paper proved to be. However, such an index could prove damaging, he says, as no one would want to be known as the king or queen of irreproducibility. "There are much more feasible ways to discuss the reproducibility of one's work that would be less challenging to arbitrate," he says. "For example, let's make it a feature, and the National Institutes of Health has started to do this but many grant agencies have not, to have a mandatory part of grant applications to track a senior researcher's record--allow them to present the most well-cited papers they've published and show examples of how the key findings within have been reproduced." 5. Improve Methods Reporting Another strategy for enabling research to be more easily reproduced is to include sufficient experimental detail, such as description of and source of reagents, cell lines, and animals used in each experiment, Drucker says. Simply enhancing journal requirements for more detailed reporting would increase the likelihood that future scientists can follow the same steps described in a paper. (Cell Press journals recently introduced STAR Methods, 10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.021, which consider such recommendations.) Drucker doesn't anticipate everyone will agree with his recommendations, but he and many others do think it is time to have regular, robust conversations about reproducibility. We can start to fix the problem by quantifying and keeping track of reproducibility while building policies that enforce good scientific practices, he says. ### Daniel Drucker is supported in part by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, a Canada Research Chair in Regulatory Peptides, and a Banting and Best Diabetes Centre-Novo Nordisk Chair in Incretin Biology. He has served as an advisor or consultant to Arisaph Pharmaceuticals, Intarcia, MedImmune, Merck Research Laboratories, Novo Nordisk, and Receptos Inc.
