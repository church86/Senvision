I want to buy Merck and Infibeam shares. Please advise? Manoj Merck (₹981.1): Last week, the stock of Merck gained 4.8 per cent resuming its medium-term uptrend. However, the stock now faces a key resistance at ₹1,000. Conclusive breakthrough of this hurdle will strengthen the stock’s medium- as well as long-term uptrend. The stock can trend upwards to ₹1,060 and then to ₹1,100 levels. Fall below the immediate support level of ₹935 will bring back selling pressure and pull the stock down to ₹900 and then to ₹870 levels in the medium term. As long as the stock trades above the key support band between ₹830 and ₹845, its intermediate-term uptrend will remain intact. You can either buy at the current level and exit around ₹1,100 or wait for a correction and buy at lower levels of ₹900 with stop-loss at ₹845. Infibeam Incorporation (₹1,274.2): Ever since listing in April 2015, the stock of Infibeam Incorporation has been on a steady uptrend. In a short span of less than a year, the stock has become a multi-bagger, gaining three-fold. As long as the stock trades above the significant long-term support band between ₹880 and ₹900, the uptrend will remain intact. Investors with a long-term perspective can hold the stock with stop-loss at ₹860 levels. The stock can reach ₹1,400 levels on a breach of ₹1,338 which is the immediate key resistance. The upside looks limited for the stock as indicators such as relative strength index and price rate of change on the daily as well as weekly charts show negative divergence, implying trend reversal. Therefore, you can wait and buy at lower levels. Strong downward breakthrough of the immediate key support level of ₹1,200 will alter the short-term uptrend and pull the stock down to ₹1,150 and then to ₹1,050 in the medium term. Further fall below ₹1,050 can drag the stock down to ₹1,000 and then to ₹950 levels. I bought Supreme Industries at ₹926. Shall I hold? TC Rajashegaran Supreme Industries (₹964.2): The stock of Supreme Industries is in an uptrend across all time frames. Last November, the stock took support at around ₹800 and resumed its uptrend. Since then, it has been in a medium-term uptrend. The stock rose 2.4 per cent in the previous week, breaching the immediate resistance at ₹940. Recently, the stock breached its moving average compression at around ₹890 strengthening the medium-term uptrend. The stock’s current uptrend can extend and encounter resistance at ₹1,000 in the near term. You can hold the stock with a stop-loss at ₹940 and consider exiting partially if the stock struggles to move beyond the key long-term resistance level of ₹1,000. Strong break-out of ₹1,000 can take the stock higher to ₹1,050 and ₹1,100 in the medium-term. But a fall below the key support level of ₹910 will alter the short-term uptrend and a fall below ₹860 can threaten the medium-term uptrend. Conclusive fall below ₹860 can pull the stock down to ₹800 levels. Important supports below ₹800 are placed at ₹750 and ₹730. Investors with a long-term perspective can stay invested with a stop-loss at ₹750 levels.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Feb 4, 2017 at 6:41AM Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:PFE) launched Inflectra, its biosimilar to Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Remicade, late last year, and fourth-quarter earnings reports from the two companies provide us with insight into Inflectra's market potential. Can Inflectra become a top seller? Read on to find out how big the market could be for this new biosimilar. An important market Remicade is a widely used autoimmune disease drug that's approved to treat a variety of indications, including rheumatoid arthritis. The drug is marketed in the U.S. by Johnson & Johnson, and it's sold in Europe by Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK). Image source: Getty Images. Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co. reported Remicade sales of $6.56 billion and $1.8 billion in 2015, respectively. However, sales slipped in 2016 as biosimilars launched, first in Europe, and then, in November, in the United States. Merck's Remicade sales fell 29% year over year to $1.27 billion in 2016, and Johnson & Johnson's U.S. Remicade sales skidded to a decline in the fourth quarter from growth in the third quarter. In Q4, Johnson & Johnson's sales of Remicade dropped 1.7% from a year ago, while in Q3, sales had jumped 9.4% year over year.  What management is saying In Johnson & Johnson's fourth-quarter earnings report, management's prepared comments suggest that Inflectra isn't making much of a dent on its prescription market share yet. However, Remicade's year-over-year sales decline, and a sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth last quarter, suggest Remicade's price may be being discounted in order to maintain market share. Furthermore, management conceded in the Q&A segment of Johnson & Johnson's earnings call that Remicade's market share could slip 10% to 15% this year. If so, price cuts and declining unit volume could equate to hundreds of millions of dollars shifting from Johnson & Johnson to Pfizer. Pfizer's fourth-quarter earnings similarly suggest there's a big market opportunity for Inflectra. In the quarter, Pfizer's biosimilars revenue jumped 48% from a year ago, mostly because of Inflectra's U.S. launch. Inflectra racked up $61 million in sales in Q4, up from $30 million a year ago. Pfizer's biosimilars include Inflectra, which is also sold as Remsima internationally, Nivestem, a biosimilar to Neupogen, and Retacrit, a biosimilar to Epogen and Procrit. Overall, the company's biosimilar sales were $91 million in the quarter, up from $63 million in the same quarter of 2015. Looking ahead Merck & Co.'s experience battling Remicade biosimilars overseas may be the best indication of what's in store for Johnson & Johnson. In 2014, Merck & Co.'s sales of Remicade totaled $2.37 billion, or roughly twice what the company hauled in from the medicine in 2016. The biosimilars market is more mature outside the U.S., so it may take Inflectra a bit longer to make as big of a dent in Johnson & Johnson's U.S. sales. However, investors might not want to discount just how eager payers are for lower-priced options that can keep runaway drug spending in check. If insurers support Inflectra, then it could wind up winning away more than the 10% to 15% in market share that Johnson & Johnson is modeling. Given that there's $4.4 billion in U.S. sales up for grabs, the stakes are very high for both companies.

In an effort to improve access to cancer care and build a quality workforce, Merck partners with the University of Nairobi, Kenya and Tata Memorial Hospital, India to conduct “Merck Africa Medical Oncology Fellowship Program” for Sub-Saharan Africa as part of Merck Cancer Access Program. “Engagement in cancer care needs a substantial improvement in infrastructure and increase in the number of specialized workforce, which does not exist in many, if not most, Sub-Saharan African countries. For example, in Kenya there are only 13 oncologists, most of them based in Nairobi for population of 47 million which means one oncologist per 3.6 million people, while in United Kingdom there are around 13 oncologists per 1 million people. Moreover, in Ethiopia there are only four oncologists, all based in Addis Ababa for a population of around 100 million. Therefore this Fellowship Program is very critical for improving access to cancer care in Africa as oncologists are very few here and sadly they only tend to work in the capital cities,” Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare adds.

Keytruda, which was already approved for the treatment of a number of cancers and may soon receive FDA approval as a treatment other tumor types, posted sales of $483 million in the quarter and $1.4 billion in all of 2016. One analyst predicted sales to reach $7 billion by 2020.

remain a focus for the US president Donald Trump promised some of the nation’s top drug company executives in a meeting at the White House recently that he would slash regulations at the Food and Drug Administration and make it easier for them to manufacture products in the United States. He also described as “fantastic” the person he planned to nominate for commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, someone he said would streamline the agency and get drug approval decisions faster. “You can’t get approval for the plant, and you can’t get approval for the drug; other than that, you’re doing fantastic,” Trump said at the meeting, to laughter from top executives of companies like Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly and Novartis. But even as he struck a cordial tone with them, he said that lowering drug costs would remain a focus and that he would discuss the issue further during the nonpublic portion of the meeting, away from the news media. “The US drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the pricing has been astronomical,” Trump said. “We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons.” Battered by public outrage over the rising costs of drugs in recent years, the drug industry has regarded Trump warily in recent weeks. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks rallied after his election as investors bet that Trump would reduce corporate taxes and adopt more industry-friendly policies than his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who had made reducing drug prices a campaign issue. But that optimism gave way to unease after Trump pledged to tackle the drug pricing issue himself, including raising the possibility of allowing Medicare to negotiate prices of drugs directly, something the industry has long opposed. Just a few weeks ago, Trump singled out the pharma industry for its high prices, accusing it of “getting away with murder.” At the meeting, Trump again referred to Medicare’s role, saying he would oppose anything that prevented competition, including “price fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what’s happening.” A White House spokesman later clarified that his remarks meant that the president “supports increasing bidding and competition for all drugs in Medicare.”But the president also tried to persuade the executives that he would provide them assistance, saying: “We can save tens of billions of dollars, and you people are going to do great. You’re going to do great.” In comments after the meeting, the drug-industry leaders said that it had been productive and that they welcomed the president’s pledges on cutting regulations and speeding approvals. The naysayers But drug-safety advocates criticized his comments, saying that eliminating agency regulations would mean rolling back consumer protections on products as diverse as drugs, cosmetics, food and dietary supplements. “Trump’s horrifying proposal reflects utter ignorance about the FDA’s essential role in protecting public health and once again demonstrates his commitment to placing corporate profits above protecting the safety of the American people,” said Dr Michael Carome, director of Public Citizen’s health research group. Carome said many of the regulations had been set up by Congress so they could not easily be removed. “Most of these regulations, to do away with them would require new statutes and new laws to be passed,” he said. Others said the agency had already loosened the approval process for new drugs in recent years, with questionable benefit. “Streamlining drug approvals sounds good, but the agency has already weakened approval standards and patients are paying the price — hugely expensive drugs that don’t even work,” said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Centre for Health Research, a Washington research group that advocates strong safety and efficacy standards. She recently studied expensive new cancer drugs and found that many did not help patients feel better or live longer. During the meeting, Trump also told the executives that he was close to naming a candidate to lead the FDA. “You’re going to get your products — either approved or not approved — but it’s going to be a quick process,” he said. “It’s not going to take 15 years,” apparently a reference not to the length of time it takes the agency to approve drugs but to how long it takes to develop a drug. Unnecessary delays He also appeared to express frustration at what he said were unnecessary delays by the agency, especially for drugs that treat patients who are close to death. The agency justifies the delay by saying it needs to evaluate whether the drug is safe and whether it works, Trump said. “We can’t approve the drug because we don’t want to hurt the patient,” he said, “but the patient is not going to live more than four weeks.” The Trump administration has not said who the finalists to lead the FDA are, but two widely circulated candidates are Dr Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA official with long-standing ties to the pharmaceutical industry, and Jim O’Neill, an associate of billionaire Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who has said he favoured allowing drugs to be approved even if their efficacy had not been proved. At the meeting, many of the drug industry leaders were eager to emphasise their long histories in the United States as well as their US manufacturing plants, even though the pharmaceutical industry — like many others — has increasingly moved its production overseas. More than half the finished drug products that are sold in the United States are made here, according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal, but the majority of the raw ingredients used to make those products are manufactured in countries like China and India. Even Joseph Jimenez, the chief executive of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, emphasized the company’s US ties, pointing out the billions of dollars it spends on research and development and saying, “Our global headquarters is near Boston.” Eric Althoff, a spokesman for Novartis, which is based in Basel, Switzerland, said Jimenez was referring to the company’s research and development headquarters. Jimenez and others supported Trump’s pledge to cut taxes and regulations. “One of the things that can help us is a lower tax rate,” Jimenez said. “Yep, we’ll get it,” Trump replied.   Tweet Go to Top Videos 'PM Modi likes peeping into others' bathroom':...

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 February 2017 by Military News Trump’s Plan to Lower Drug Costs Is a Fairy Tale Image source: U.S. Department of Defense Current Photos, Flickr. The first days of the Trump presidency could appropriately be described as a whirlwind. During Trump’s first 10 1/2 days in office, he issued more aggregate executive orders and proclamations (20) than any modern-day president. And the actions just keep coming. Trump’s vision to fix drug prices in America On Tuesday, Jan. 31, Trump met with the CEOs of a number of major drugmakers to discuss how to get drug costs in America under control. These included the heads of Johnson & Johnson , Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) , Novartis , Merck , Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) , and the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America lobbying group. The message was simple, according to Trump: We have to get the prices [of drugs] way down. We have to get lower prices, we have to get even better innovation, and I want you to move your companies back to the United States. I want you to manufacture in the United States. Trump’s bluntness with drugmakers laid out a series of actions he’d like to see come to fruition during his tenure as president. First, Trump implied that the drug approval process would be streamlined with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow drug developers to bring their potentially game-changing products to market even faster. According to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, the average cost per approved drug is $2.56 billion, which includes an estimated average of $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs, and $1.16 billion in time costs. Secondly, Trump wants to give more bargaining power to Medicare and Medicaid to negotiate the purchasing price of drugs. While Medicaid and the VA currently have the ability to bargain on their behalf, Medicare is barred from doing so, resulting in a considerably smaller discount to list price compared with its sister program, Medicaid.

In plainer terms, he wants to try to level the playing field between what U.S. consumers pay for drugs compared with citizens in other countries that may have pricing controls in place. Trump aims to level the field by prioritizing countries that “pay their fair share for U.S.-manufactured drugs, so our companies have greater financial resources to accelerate development of new cures.” Fourth, Trump wants to encourage drugmakers to manufacture their products domestically by enticing them with corporate income-tax reform. To be clear, Trump’s corporate income-tax proposal goes for all businesses, not just the pharmaceutical industry. Trump laid out a plan during his campaign to cut corporate income taxes to 15% from 35%, as well as provide U.S. multinationals with the opportunity to repatriate overseas cash at a special holiday rate of 10%. Presumably, providing a more competitive corporate income-tax rate of 15% could reduce the desire of companies to seek tax-inversion deals that allow them to redomicile their headquarters in a country with a lower corporate tax rate. The response from the drug-company heads was mostly encouraging. Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks opined, “Tax, deregulation — those are things that could really help us expand operations,” according to Reuters. Separately, Amgen CEO Bob Bradway promised to add 1,600 jobs this year. This comes after Amgen laid off roughly 4,000 workers in 2014 on the heels of high phase 3 expenses and drug launch costs.

For drugmakers, their discussion with Trump establishes that he isn’t out to make their existence miserable. However, truth be told, Trump’s ideas to lower drug prices are probably nothing more than a fairy tale. Though they may sound great on paper, they fail to address some key issues. Let’s take this from top to bottom. 1. Deregulating the FDA isn’t a smart idea First, Trump has very little chance of deregulating the FDA to the extent that it considerably expedites the drug-approval process. The FDA is in place to provide qualitative and safety checks on all stages of the development and manufacturing process, and the price to be paid is that it can take an average of a decade to bring new drugs to market. Removing some of these critical steps could mean bringing unsafe or ineffective therapies to consumers. Trump overlooks the fact that the U.S. introduced the breakthrough therapy designation in 2012, allowing game-changing experimental medications to be reviewed by the FDA based on phase 1/2 data, significantly shortening the process by which drugs make it to market. Even before the breakthrough designation was introduced, the FDA had a historically faster review process for novel therapeutics than other global regulatory agencies. Efficiency isn’t an issue with the FDA, and the drug approval process arguably works pretty well. Trying to rejigger the regulations the FDA abides by could be a logistical nightmare. Image source: Getty Images. 2. Free-market economics will likely prevail Interestingly enough, the public would like to see Trump’s vision of Medicare being able to negotiate on its own behalf come to fruition. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey from the previous year found that 87% of respondents want Medicare to have the power to negotiate on its own behalf, lowering net drug prices in the process. Unfortunately, this isn’t likely to happen during at least the first half of the Trump presidency. Republicans in Congress usually prefer the idea of allowing the free market to dictate the pricing of goods and services and are thus unlikely to allow the federal government to exercise its power in terms of influencing the drug-pricing process. 3. Prioritizing trading partners will be ineffective Trump will also have to come to terms with the fact that he won’t be able to dictate drug-pricing controls in foreign markets. Prioritizing trading partners might seem doable, but what’s to say it doesn’t result in retaliatory tariffs in other aspects of U.S. exports? Image source: Getty Images. Trying to tie foreign markets to the U.S. healthcare system also makes no sense, because the U.S. healthcare system is nothing like any other country out there. Most foreign countries (at least those considered to be developed) have universal health plans that specifically control drug pricing. The U.S. has no universal health plan, which means no controls on pricing. Trump’s trying to make a square peg fit into a round hole by pigeonholing U.S. pricing standards on foreign markets, and it’s almost certainly not going to work. 4. Tax breaks won’t be enough to entice domestic production Fourth, deregulation and tax breaks still probably won’t be enough to entice U.S. multinationals to manufacture their drugs in the U.S. Even though tax breaks will allow U.S.-based companies to keep more of their profits, there’s no guarantee that these excess profits, or repatriated cash for that matter, will go toward more headcount in the U.S. or domestic manufacturing. The CNBC Global CFO survey conducted in December across a myriad of sectors found that just 12.5% of U.S. CEOs had plans to increase headcount if they repatriate their overseas cash. Trump is going to have to understand that not only can’t he dictate how foreign countries price their drugs; he also can’t dictate how U.S. drugmakers spend their cash. The biggest unaddressed issue Image source: Getty Images. But the biggest issue of all is that Trump’s drug-pricing discussions didn’t address the initial pricing of pharmaceuticals in the United States. This isn’t to say that price increases on existing therapeutics isn’t an issue. For instance, Segal Consulting notes that specialty drugs increased in price by 18.9% in 2016, and they’re expected to rise by 18.7% in 2017. That’s a clear problem. However, the real issue is that drugmakers have the ability to set initial price points for rare-disease and specialty therapeutics that are in the five- and six-digit range, annually, once approved. There’s nothing for the FDA or lawmakers to reference that describes the cost-to-patient benefit profile when it comes to drug pricing. Until there is some sort of uniform way of consistently pricing newly approved products to the benefits they offer the patient, Trump’s efforts to reduce drug pricing will be futile at best. 10 stocks we like better than Amgen When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Trump plans to “continually seek information and perspectives from a diverse range of business leaders ... on how best to promote job growth,” according to a statement from the White House. The leaders invited include Maplewood-based 3M as well as Lockheed Martin and General Electric. Despite monthly job growth of 150,000 or so and a record number of Americans working, the Obama administration was vexed by the continued slow decline of U.S. manufacturing employment that began in the 1980s. In response to Trump’s invitation, 3M CEO Inge Thulin said in a statement that he is “honored to be asked to participate in this presidential initiative” and looks forward to engaging “on the important issues relating to American manufacturing.” It is not yet known when the meetings will be scheduled. Manufacturing experts said they expect issues discussed to include workforce training, robotics, programming and technology needs of today’s factories as well as tax and regulatory relief, exports, trade tariffs, and patent protections. Initial business leaders assisting with Trump’s Manufacturing Jobs Initiative include: Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical, Michael Dell of Dell Technologies; John Ferriola, Nucor Corp.; Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool Corp., Mark Fields of Ford Motor, Ken Frazier of Merck & Co., Alex Gorsky of Johnson & Johnson; Greg Hayes, United Technologies and Jeff Immelt, General Electric. Dee DePass and Neal St. Anthony Wealth transfer plans lacking, survey funds Most upper-end Americans are unprepared to handle wealth, according to new research by RBC Wealth Management and Scorpio Partnership. Only 30 percent of millionaire families have a full “wealth transfer plan” in place, and 30 percent said they have done nothing to ready for the transfer of their estate to their heirs. Only 37 percent of American inheritors had conversations with their benefactors about their inheritance before receiving the assets. “It’s a trend that appears to repeat itself generation after generation,” said Tom Sagissor, president of RBC Wealth Management-U.S. “But there are encouraging signs. … Parents today are educating their children about wealth at an earlier age and doing a better job of engaging them in conversations about the inheritance they will one day receive.” The summer 2016 survey was of 3,105 individuals from the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom who have an average net worth of $4.5 million, including givers and recipients. Americans are the most proactive — 60 percent of parents — when it comes to educating the next generation. Half of U.S. respondents said they are confident their children will be able to grow their wealth, compared to just 39 percent in the U.K. and 42 percent in Canada. Other key findings : • Those going through an inheritance received no professional help or guidance in the aftermath of the bequest. • Experience is the best teacher. Individuals are far more likely to have a wealth transfer strategy if they themselves have received an inheritance already: 37 percent of those in the United States who have inherited wealth have a full strategy, and 58 percent of those have a will. • When parents have a wealth-transfer strategy in place, they feel more confident that their heirs will be capable of preserving family wealth. “Discussions around estate and succession planning can be emotionally charged, so families tend to shy away,” said Bill Ringham, senior wealth strategist at RBC. “For families that want to leave a legacy and ensure the nest egg … is protected across generations, communication and planning are key.” Neal St. Anthony Nathanson discusses his new book about Minneapolis’ downtown history Iric Nathanson, a son of Minneapolis who retired last year at 76 from the Minneapolis Consortium of Community Developers (MCCD) after years of helping finance small businesses, is also a writer and local historian. Nathanson has written “Images of Downtown Minneapolis,” which uses historic photos and narrative to explain how downtown has surmounted challenges over the years and continues to grow employment and house more people. The old warehouse district, pretty dilapidated just a few decades ago, has evolved into the thriving “North Loop.” And Nathanson is confident the city will survive the closing of Macy’s, formerly Dayton’s, and come out stronger. Nathanson will sign books at the Nicollet Mall Barnes and Noble on Thursday from noon to 1 p.m. and discuss “Downtown Minneapolis” at the Hennepin History Museum, 2303 Third Av. S., at 2 p.m. on Saturday.

Using extremely sensitive new technologies not used in vaccine manufacturing, Italian scientists reported they were “baffled” by their discoveries which included single particles and aggregates of organic debris including red cells of human or possibly animal origin and metals including lead, tungsten, gold, and chromium, that have been linked to autoimmune disease and leukemia. In the study, published this week in the International Journal of Vaccines and Vaccination, the researchers led by Antonietta Gatti, of the National Council of Research of Italy and the Scientific Director of Nanodiagnostics, say their results “show the presence of micro- and nano-sized particulate matter composed of inorganic elements in vaccine samples” not declared in the products’ ingredients lists. Lead particles were found in the cervical cancer vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, for example, and in the seasonal flu vaccine Aggripal manufactured by Novartis as well as in the Meningetec vaccine meant to protect against meningitis C. Samples of an infant vaccine called Infarix Hexa (against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenzae type B) manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline was found to contain stainless steel, tungsten and a gold-zinc aggregate. Other metal contaminants included platinum, silver, bismuth, iron, and chromium. Chromium (alone or in alloy with iron and nickel) was identified in 25 of the human vaccines from Italy and France that were tested. GSK’s Fluarix vaccine for children three years and older contained 11 metals and aggregates of metals. Similar aggregates to those identified in the vaccines have been shown to be prevalent in cases of leukemia, the researchers noted. Many of the vaccines contained iron and iron alloys which, according to the researchers, “can corrode and the corrosion products exert a toxicity affecting the tissues”. The researchers supply an image of an area in a drop of Sanofi Pasteur MSD’s Repevax (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio) vaccine “where the morphology of red cells – we cannot tell whether they are human or animal- is clearly visible” along with the presence of “debris” composed of aluminum, bromine, silicon, potassium and titanium. Feligen, the only veterinary vaccine tested in the 44 total vaccines sampled, proved to be the only sample free from inorganic contamination. The investigation revealed aluminum and sodium chloride, the usual component of saline, as was expected, because they are named ingredients of most vaccines. Using a Field Emission Gun Environmental Electron Scanning Microscope, the researchers produced photos of this aluminum salt which formed white crystalline branches similar to frost on a windowpane on the top of the droplets of vaccine liquid. A German-made vaccine against allergies produced a layer of inorganic salts so thick that the researchers could not penetrate the drop not to detect other particulate contaminants. Aluminum has a documented neurotoxicity all by itself. The French veterinary vaccines exclude it for this reason. The human ones don’t. The researchers express concern about synergy of multiple toxins added to this known neurotoxin. “It is a well-known fact in toxicology that contaminants exert a mutual, synergic effect, and as the number of contaminants increases, the effects grow less and less predictable. The more so when some substances are unknown.” “The quantity of foreign bodies detected and, in some cases, their unusual chemical compositions baffled us,” the researchers note. “In most circumstances, the combinations detected are very odd as they have no technical use, cannot be found in any material handbook and look like the result of the random formation occurring, for example, when waste is burnt. In any case, whatever their origin, they should not be present in any injectable medicament, let alone in vaccines, more in particular those meant for infants.” Donate to support independent research: Undesirable impact The study explains that these foreign injected impurities may explain a vast array of apparently unrelated adverse events associated with vaccination from headaches and seizures to fatigue, muscle pain, paralysis and sudden infant death syndrome. More likely than not, they speculate, vaccine contaminants will “have a more serious impact on very small organisms like those of children.” Once inside a body, foreign material in a vaccine shot, whether it is meant to be there as in the case of an aluminum, or not, in the case of contaminants, launches the formidable immune system into action. As with anything small and foreign, its reaction to vaccine ingredients is potent, poorly understood, unpredictable, and as the Italian researchers say, may be “undesirable.” The immune system may dispatch an army of large white blood cells called macrophages to engulf the foreign bodies and contain them in swellings and granulomas at the injection site. But if the contaminants are swept away in the blood’s circulation to any distant site or organ including the microbiota, which regulate numerous functions including the immune system, their effect could be felt long after they covertly entered the body. In some cases, the immune system my initiate an inflammatory assault against what it perceives as invader. This may include the launch of a host of players called cytokines. Some of these chemical messengers like interleukin-6 are incriminated in autism. Because the body cannot get rid of these contaminants — metal-based pollutants are not biodegradable – this kind of inflammation may be sustained and chronic and can manifest as autoimmune diseases when the immune system turns on its own cells as in multiple sclerosis or type 1 diabetes. It’s also been shown that the contaminants found in the vaccines can enter cell nuclei and interact with DNA, the researchers note. No one knows what that can do. Dark history Vaccines have a long and sordid history of contamination. In 1955 batches of polio vaccine containing live polio virus infected and paralysed hundreds of children. The tragedy became known as the Cutter Incident for the laboratory where the vaccines had passed safety tests with flying colors. But there are dozens of other “incidents” which would better be called acts of criminal negligence, including: The polio vaccine doled out between 1955 and 1963 was contaminated with simian virus 40 (SV40) from monkey kidney cells used to produce the vaccine. It’s been linked to the growing epidemic of cancer. In 2007, Merck & Company, Inc. recalled 1.2 million doses of Hib vaccines due to contamination with bacteria called cereus, a potentially lethal food-poisoning bug. In 2009, more than 40,000 doses of a meningitis C vaccine for babies were withdrawn from the British market when they were found to be contaminated with blood-poisoning bacteria, S aureus. In 2010, deep sequence analysis of eight different live attenuated virus vaccines revealed unexpected viral sequences in three of them: retrovirus avian leukosis was found in a measles vaccine, a virus similar to simian retrovirus was identified in Rotateq anti-diarrhea vaccine developed by CDC consultant Paul Offit, and the entire genome sequence of porcine cirovirus1 was found in Rotarix leading the FDA to suspend the rotavirus vaccine. In 2014, The US Food and Drug Administration ordered GlaxoSmithKline to review the manufacturing operation of its flu vaccine when it found microbiological contamination of products purporting to be sterile. In 2013, Merck & Company, Inc. recalled one batch of Gardasil when glass particles were discovered in several phials. Recently it was reported that Sanofi Pasteur refused to recall its ActHIB vaccine for babies, even though it knew it was contaminated with glass shards. The FDA didn’t object. There are dozens of these cases, and even if vaccine manufacturers are issued multiple “warnings” action is rarely ever taken to clean the vaccine manufacture process. Since pharmaceutical companies have blanket indemnity from lawsuits for faulty vaccines, there is no incentive for them to clean up their act. Clear and present danger The study investigators conclude that the vaccine contamination they found is likely accidental. “Our hypothesis is that this contamination is unintentional, since it is probably due to polluted components or procedures of industrial processes (e.g. filtrations) used to produce vaccines, not investigated and not detected by the Producers”. Discussion about why pharmaceutical companies don’t produce clean vaccines is one thing. But the reality of vaccines as they are now is another. It doesn’t change what is being injected into millions of people today. Dangerous unintended toxins are in every one of the vaccines tested in this investigation, except one for cats. This research doesn’t just show that vaccines are full of crud that top scientists can’t even define. It makes a mockery of health oversight agencies like the FDA and CDC and their lies that vaccines undergo adequate safety checks and risk assessment. It doesn’t merely reveal that the long-term consequences of vaccinating cannot even be assessed. If anti-cancer vaccines like Gardasil and Cervarix contain cancer-causing aggregates of toxic metals, their use as a weapon against a cancer a girl has zero chance of getting before age 21 is not just useless. It is egregious abuse. Now, every vaccine’s claims to saving lives must be weighed against its risks of causing cancer, neurodevelopmental disease, autoimmune disease and every other immune-mediated “mystery” disorder now epidemic and soaring. The results of these investigations not only negate every assertion that vaccines are “safe and effective”, but they confirm that they are actually a clear and present danger.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 February 2017 by Military News Bristol-Myers’ Injectable Opdivo Gets FDA Approval for mUC Shutterstock photo Bristol-Myers Squibb Company BMY announced that the FDA has approved an injectable form of immuno-oncology drug Opdivo. The drug will have an intravenous use in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) with a recommended dose of 240 mg. Opdivo will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every two weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The FDA approved the use of injectable Opdivo for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or mUC whose disease has progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy under an accelerated approval program based on tumor response rate and duration of response. We note that approval for this indication will be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. In the past one year, Bristol-Myers’ share price was down 16%, compared with the 0.1% increase witnessed by the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry. We remind investors that Opdivo is currently approved in several countries including the U.S., the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions. The drug has been performing impressively due to demand resulting from rapid commercial acceptance for melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and second-line non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the lung-cancer market in the U.S became more competitive in 2016 due to the entry of Roche’s RHHBY Tecentriq in the second-line setting. Consequently, Bristol-Myers stated that the sales of the drug in the U.S will be flat in 2017 due to competitive pressure. A potential earlier-than-expected entry of Merck’s. MRK Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy will also adversely impact sales. Nevertheless, sales in the international markets should continue to grow. Note that shares of Bristol-Myers have been under pressure since Aug 2016. The company announced disappointing top-line data from the phase III CheckMate-026 study evaluating the use of Opdivo monotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data showed that the study failed to meet the primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with ≥5% PD-L1 expression. The company reported final primary analysis in Oct 2016. Bristol-Myers hasn’t been very successful in its attempts to expand Opdivo’s label to include first-line lung cancer thereby given rival Merck an edge in the same.

Boyd Woodruff, 99, a farmer’s son whose groundbreaking research enabled fellow scientists to harvest an arsenal of lifesaving antibiotics from ordinary dirt, died on Jan. 19 at his home in Watchung, N.J. Woodruff was instrumental in isolating two microbes that, while effective against tuberculosis and other infections, proved toxic to humans. But his findings in the early 1940s inspired the rapid development of streptomycin, the miracle cure used to treat tuberculosis, typhoid, plague and other diseases that did not respond to penicillin and other drugs. “This was the eureka moment in all antibiotic discovery,” Douglas Eveleigh, a professor emeritus of biochemistry and microbiology at Rutgers University, said of Woodruff’s research in an e-mail Thursday. “The pharmaceutical industry caught on very rapidly, and there followed an avalanche of antibiotics,” Eveleigh said. “This was all dependent on the Woodruff proof of concept in screening for antibiotic production.” In 1942, Woodruff left his laboratory at Rutgers to join Merck & Co., the pharmaceutical giant, where he oversaw the introduction of other antibiotics, vitamins B12 and C, and riboflavin; a treatment for a rare cancer called Wilms tumor; a pneumonia vaccine, and a drug used to treat river blindness. His mentor at Rutgers, Selman Waksman, and his Merck colleague William Campbell, who developed Avermectin for river blindness, both won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. Harold Boyd Woodruff, known as Boyd, was born on July 22, 1917, in Bridgeton, N.J.   Kevin Geer, 64, a prodigious character actor best known for his work in theater, including roles on Broadway in the 2004 revival of “Twelve Angry Men” and Warren Leight’s family drama “Side Man,” died Jan. 25 at his home in Manhattan. Actor Michael Mastro, a friend who appeared with Geer in both those plays, said the cause appeared to be a sudden heart attack. Geer made his Broadway debut in 1988 as Mitch in a revival of Tennessee Williams’ “A Streetcar Named Desire,” which starred Blythe Danner and Aidan Quinn. He played one of the squabbling jurors in Scott Ellis’ production of “Twelve Angry Men” and a drug-addicted jazz trombonist in “Side Man,” both in its off-Broadway cast in 1998 and during its subsequent Broadway run, for which it won a Tony Award for best new play. In 2009 he was a laid-off factory worker in Jeffrey Sweet’s off-off-Broadway drama “Flyovers.” On TV, he had an emotional turn as an amnesiac sergeant on “M*A*S*H” in 1978 and later appeared on three different iterations of “Law & Order,” including a performance as a white supremacist who bombs a subway. His films included “The Pelican Brief” (1993), with Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington, and “The Men Who Stare at Goats” (2009), with a cast that included Jeff Bridges, George Clooney and Kevin Spacey. His last credited film role was as a security guard who takes advantage of a homeless heroin addict played by Jennifer Connelly in Paul Bettany’s film “Shelter” (2015). A lanky actor with sharp features, Geer was an off-Broadway fixture who could command a stage. “Mr. Geer rages, goes to pieces and exudes roguish charm,” Alvin Klein wrote in the New York Times in reviewing his performance in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s “Anna Christie” in 1990 at the Long Wharf ­Theater in New Haven, Conn. Kevin Scully Geer was born in Reno, Nev., on Nov. 7, 1952.

They are bypassed for two reasons. People refuse to believe they are illusions, despite the abundant evidence; and the professionals dedicated to upholding the illusions continue their work as if nothing at all has been exposed. Medical journalists in the mainstream rely completely on studies published in prestigious journals.   This is the rock. This is the science. This is also the source of doctors’ authoritarian and arrogant advice to patients. “Studies show…” Well, that wraps it up. Nothing else to prove. The studies in the journals are the final word. Medical reporters base their entire careers on these published reports. But what if higher and more credible authorities rejected all these studies? What if they’ve scrutinized more studies than any reporter or doctor possibly could…and have come to a shocking and opposite conclusion? This very thing has happened. And the conclusions have been published. But medical reporters ignore them and go their merry way, as if a vast pillar of modern medicine is still intact…when it isn’t, when it has been decimated. Buckle up. Let us begin with a statement made by Dr. Marcia Angell, the former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, perhaps the most prestigious medical journal in the world—a journal that routinely vets and prints thousands of medical studies: “It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.” — Marcia Angell, MD, The New York Review of Books, January 15, 2009 You might want to read that statement several times, to savor its full impact. Then proceed to this next one, penned by the editor of The Lancet, another elite and time-honored medical journal that publishes medical studies: Richard Horton, editor-in-chief, The Lancet, in The Lancet, 11 April, 2015, Vol 385, “Offline: What is medicine’s 5 sigma?” “The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness… “The apparent endemicity of bad research behaviour is alarming. In their quest for telling a compelling story, scientists too often sculpt data to fit their preferred theory of the world. Or they retrofit hypotheses to fit their data. Journal editors deserve their fair share of criticism too. We aid and abet the worst behaviours. Our acquiescence to the impact factor fuels an unhealthy competition to win a place in a select few journals. Our love of ‘significance’ pollutes the literature with many a statistical fairy-tale…Journals are not the only miscreants. Universities are in a perpetual struggle for money and talent…” Still standing? Here are several more statements. They are devastating. The NY Review of Books (May 12, 2011), Helen Epstein, “Flu Warning: Beware the Drug Companies”: “Six years ago, John Ioannidis, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Ioannina School of Medicine in Greece, found that nearly half of published articles in scientific journals contained findings that were false, in the sense that independent researchers couldn’t replicate them. The problem is particularly widespread in medical research, where peer-reviewed articles in medical journals can be crucial in influencing multimillion- and sometimes multibillion-dollar spending decisions. It would be surprising if conflicts of interest did not sometimes compromise editorial neutrality, and in the case of medical research, the sources of bias are obvious. Most medical journals receive half or more of their income from pharmaceutical company advertising and reprint orders, and dozens of others [journals] are owned by companies like Wolters Kluwer, a medical publisher that also provides marketing services to the pharmaceutical industry.” Here’s another quote from the same article: “The FDA also relies increasingly upon fees and other payments from the pharmaceutical companies whose products the agency is supposed to regulate. This could contribute to the growing number of scandals in which the dangers of widely prescribed drugs have been discovered too late. Last year, GlaxoSmithKline’s diabetes drug Avandia was linked to thousands of heart attacks, and earlier in the decade, the company’s antidepressant Paxil was discovered to exacerbate the risk of suicide in young people. Merck’s painkiller Vioxx was also linked to thousands of heart disease deaths. In each case, the scientific literature gave little hint of these dangers. The companies have agreed to pay settlements in class action lawsuits amounting to far less than the profits the drugs earned on the market. These precedents could be creating incentives for reduced vigilance concerning the side effects of prescription drugs in general.” Also from the NY Review of Books, here are two more quotes from Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of The New England Journal of Medicine (“Drug Companies and Doctors: A Story of Corruption”): “Consider the clinical trials by which drugs are tested in human subjects. Before a new drug can enter the market, its manufacturer must sponsor clinical trials to show the Food and Drug Administration that the drug is safe and effective, usually as compared with a placebo or dummy pill. The results of all the (there may be many) are submitted to the FDA, and if one or two trials are positive—that is, they show effectiveness without serious risk—the drug is usually approved, even if all the other trials are negative.” Here is another Angell statement: “In view of this control and the conflicts of interest that permeate the enterprise, it is not surprising that industry-sponsored [drug] trials published in medical journals consistently favor sponsors’ drugs—largely because negative results are not published, positive results are repeatedly published in slightly different forms, and a positive spin is put on even negative results. A review of seventy-four clinical trials of antidepressants, for example, found that thirty-seven of thirty-eight positive studies were published. But of the thirty-six negative studies, thirty-three were either not published or published in a form that conveyed a positive outcome.” If you have the patience to read and re-read these statements, you’ll see they are marking out a scandal of scandals—the entirety of medical literature is a pipeline for deep fraud. Citing with confidence a study on a drug, for example, would carry no more weight than an article about a celebrity in a gossip rag. But medical reporters must pretend their sources are correct. It’s their job. If they reject published studies, they have nothing left—except to expose the giant scandal I’m outlining in this article. Biting the hand that feeds them would put them out of work. They’d end up writing about picnics for some local paper—if they were lucky. However, that’s not my problem or yours. It’s theirs. They chose their profession. We can settle on the truth. We can even spread it. Why not?

Trump also blasted foreign countries, which he said have been "freeloading" on the United States with price controls that limit what their own citizens can be charged for medications. "We have to get the prices down," Trump said. "We have to get the prices way down." "We have to get lower prices, we have to get even better innovation, and I want you to move your companies back to the United States," Trump said. "I want you to manufacture in the United States." Related: What's to Blame for High Drug Costs? Trump also said he wanted to make it easier for pharmaceutical companies to win regulatory approval for their products. "You're going to get your prices either approved, or not approved," the president said. "But it's going to be a quick process. It's not going to take 15 years." The meeting included the CEOs of Merck, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, as well as the head of the trade group PhRMA. In remarks to reporters while flanked by those CEOs, Trump said, "The U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the prices have been astronomical for our country."
