Merck wanted to highlight that a major trial involving the best seller drug indicated no heart problems for patients with type 2 diabetes. This would have differentiated it from rivals known to have cardiovascular risks, such as Astrazeneca’s (LON:AZN) Onglyza. Merck, though, received a Complete Response Letter from the US Food and Drug Administration on the use of Sitagliptin, the generic treatment for type 2 diabetes. A complete response letter from the FDA means a drug will not be approved in its current form. The pharma giant said it is reviewing the letter and will discuss its next steps with the FDA.

Merck said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined an application to include information on the labels of its diabetes drugs—Januvia and Janumet—that the treatments do not raise the risk of major heart problems. Merck is reviewing the agency's response to its application, the company said on Friday. The application was submitted on the basis of a keenly watched study in 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease. The study's results, announced in 2015, showed that adding Januvia to usual care did not increase major heart problems any more than the addition of a placebo did. The results also showed no increase in hospitalization rates for heart failure, which had been a particular concern with DPP-4 inhibitors, the class of drugs to which Januvia belongs. Januvia is an oral medication, known chemically as sitagliptin, that helps lower blood sugar levels. Janumet is a related combination product. The two treatments generated sales of more than $6 billion last year. Merck's shares were down 1.1 percent at $62.50 before the bell on Friday.

The results of the TECOS Trial (Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin), which were presented at the 2015 American Diabetes Association's annual meeting, reported no increase for adverse heart-related outcomes or hospitalization for heart failure in the nearly 15,000 participants with type 2 diabetes and a history of cardiovascular disease, when compared to placebo. However, Sanjay Kaul, MD, of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said it appears the TECOS results did not meet the FDA's criteria for cardiovascular safety claims. The FDA does not publicly disclose its reasons for rejecting applications. Merck had little to say about the decision: in a press release issued Friday, it said only that the company was "reviewing the letter and will discuss next steps with the FDA." The DPP-4 inhibitor class of drugs, which Januvia belongs to, has been previously linked to increased heart failure rates. However, an FDA advisory committee previously voted that DPP-4 inhibitors have an acceptable amount of CV risk, therefore not warranting any additional label restrictions. This setback for Merck comes after Boehringer Ingelheim's empagliflozin (Jardiance) was granted FDA approval late last year for a claim of primary prevention of cardiovascular death among patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Jardiance is the first, and only, diabetes drug to have a CV label indication. Januvia is currently approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults to improve glycemic control.

The company's indoximod was being tested in combination with Merck's Keytruda. NewLink Genetics said that data on 60 patients found an objective response rate of 52% and a disease control rate of 73%, with rates slightly higher among patients with non-ocular melanoma, at a 59% objective response rate and an 80% disease control rate. Though the company described the results -- which it is presenting at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting on Tuesday -- as impressive and emphasized that the cancer drug combination was well tolerated overall, investors questioned how much of an effect the company's drug had relative to Merck's Keytruda alone and compared NewLink Genetics negatively to Incyte Corp. , which is also developing an IDO inhibitor and is working with Merck. NewLink Genetics shares were valued at $18.40 as of Tuesday morning. The company's shares have surged 63.8% over the last three months, compared with a 3.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

Dynavax said the trial produced results for efficacy in 17 patients and safety in 22 patients. "In patients naïve to anti-PD-1 treatment, responses were observed in six out of seven patients, for an Overall Response Rate (ORR) of 86%," the company said in a statement. "This includes two (29%) complete responses (CR) and four (57%) partial responses (PR). Target tumor shrinkage was observed in all 7 evaluable patients." Dynavax Chief Medical Officer Robert Janssen said the results allow the company explore higher doses of the drug. Shares have fallen 63% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 has gained 19%.

Among the biggest percentage declines ahead of the open, shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. were shedding 1.4%, of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. were giving up 1.2%, of Apple Inc. were falling 0.8% and of Caterpillar Inc. were losing 0.7%. The long gainer is Merck & Co.'s , which inched up less than 0.1%. Dow futures were down 81 points in recent trade, putting the blue-chip barometer in danger of snapping a streak of 10-straight record closes. Feb. 24, 2017 at 8:44 a.m. ET by Tomi Kilgore Merck to take $2.9 billion charge on hepatitis C drug Merck & Co. said late Thursday it will book a pre-tax charge of $2.9 billion for a hepatitis C drug candidate. Merck said recent changes to its product profile and expectations for pricing caused it to evaluate the drug candidate uprifosbuvir, which it acquired along with Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. in 2014, as an intangible asset for impairment. As a result, Merck said the charge lowers its unadjusted fourth-quarter results to a loss of 22 cents a share, from previous earnings of 42 cents a share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter are not affected, Merck said. Shares of Merck declined 0.5% to $65.52 after hours.

Meet the Contributors → AACR Review: Biden Fired Up, Incyte Doubles Up, BMS Up And Down Alex Lash April 6th, 2017 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  The American Association for Cancer Research held its annual meeting this week in Washington, DC, a convenient venue for former Vice President Joe Biden to deliver a broadside against the Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts in science funding. For Biden, it’s personal. In the final year of the Obama administration, he championed a push for integrated cancer research with both public and private entities. The so-called cancer “moonshot” was supposed to get $1.8 billion in earmarked funds over seven years from the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act, signed by Obama in December. (Congress honored Biden by naming part of the law after his son, Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015.) While by no means guaranteed, the Trump administration’s 2018 budget request, with a 20 percent cut to the National Institutes of Health—plus a proposal to shift funds this year to start paying for a Mexico border wall— has put the moonshot funding and much more federally backed biomedical research on uncertain ground. In his AACR speech, Biden called the Trump cuts “draconian.” “This is not the time to undercut progress, for God’s sake,” Biden said. “This is the time to double down.” The AACR weighed in, as well, on the eve of the meeting, calling the Trump proposals “shocking,” and the association’s president-elect Elizabeth Jaffe testified at a friendly House committee hearing last week about the value of cancer research. In a shot across the administration’s bow, the Republican-led committee’s website highlighted how several conservative members talked up support for research funding. Politics and policy are never far from anyone’s mind these days, but the meeting was mainly about cancer research and clinical data. Here is a notable selection: —The relatively new field of cancer immunotherapy has produced remarkable short-term effects in a small percentage of patients, but it remains to be seen over time how long those effects last. Longer-term answers are starting to trickle in; a few durability studies are outlined here. One came from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), which said that a combination of its two marketed immunotherapy agents, nivolumab (Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy), helped extend the lives of melanoma patients more than when used alone. The Phase 3 study, called Checkmate 067, only showed a modest benefit over two years, however, and there were more side effects than with people taking nivolumab alone. How the FDA reads those data is important: The agency approved the combo in 2015 on condition that later studies would show a survival benefit. The approval could be withdrawn with bad data. Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham noted that “the debate will move to the relative risk/reward profile” of combination immunotherapy—particularly given the higher price tag. —AACR provided more ups and downs for Bristol, which has lost significant ground to Merck (NYSE: MRK) in the battle for leadership in cancer immunotherapy. BMS also disclosed that nivolumab failed a Phase 3 trial in glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer that immunotherapy hasn’t yet had much success with. —Bristol has ceded ground to Merck in large part because, as reported last year, nivolumab failed to help newly diagnosed lung cancer patients, while Merck’s pembrolizumab (Keytruda) succeeded. Given the drugs’ similarities the results were perplexing; as Matthew Herper of Forbes explains here, researchers may have unearthed clues as to what happened. —Merck and Bristol are also competing to combine their drugs with those of others to boost their effectiveness. The Delaware-based biotech Incyte (NASDAQ: INCY) is on the dance card of both companies. Both reported before and during AACR plans to test Incyte’s epacadostat with nivolumab and pembrolizumab in Phase 3 trials for various cancers. Epacadostat blocks the tumor enzyme IDO; IDO inhibitors target the immune system differently than the first wave of immunotherapy drugs, checkpoint inhibitors, and thus might help more people respond to them. —The epacadostat news and data overshadowed Phase 2 results for Newlink Genetics’s (NASDAQ: NLNK) rival IDO blocker, indoximod. Newlink has a partnership with Roche but saw its shares slide more than 20 percent this week. EPVantage has more on the emerging IDO drugs and more upcoming data. —Another major target for cellular immunotherapy is the blood-borne cancer multiple myeloma. Bluebird Bio (NASDAQ: BLUE) and the University of Pennsylvania reported the first glimmer of results in human studies last year. At AACR, several firms in the chase— Kite Pharma (NASDAQ: KITE), Poseida Therapeutics, and partners Seattle Genetics (NASDAQ: SGEN) and Unum Therapeutics—all reported preclinical data, a sign that several of these so-called CAR-T cell therapies could be in human studies this year for multiple myeloma. Keep an eye on the American Society of Hematology meeting, in December, for data. —Kite also noted that it has completed its FDA application for its CAR-T treatment axi-cel for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL. It is racing with Novartis to have the first CAR-T ever approved. The other CAR-T under FDA review is from Novartis, to treat children with leukemia. A second CAR-T program from Novartis, to treat the same NHL subtype as axi-cel, could be for review this year, too, but as The Street’s Adam Feuerstein wrote this week, Novartis is being tight-lipped about the timeline of the final push.

Meet the Contributors → Zavante Plans FDA Filing After Antibiotic Hits Clinical Trial Goals Frank Vinluan April 6th, 2017 @frankvinluan @xconomy Like Us Xconomy San Diego —  As bacteria develop resistance to older antibiotics, doctors are clamoring for new options that work on these drug- resistant strains. Zavante Therapeutics has been researching one drug as a possible alternative and, with results from a key clinical trial now in hand, the company is preparing to file for FDA approval early next year. San Diego-based Zavante developed its drug fosfomycin (Zolyd) to treat complicated urinary tract infections. But privately held Zavante’s antibiotic is not a new drug. It’s a new version of an old one. Zavante believes an intravenous formulation can achieve better results fighting infections than the oral version of the drug that is now available. Kevin Finney, chief operating officer of Zavante, said via email that IV administration will be a faster and more reliable way of making the drug “bioavailable,” meaning that it will reach high enough concentrations in the bloodstream to have an effect. “We believe that these optimized blood levels are unachievable through oral dose formulations due to extremely low oral bioavailability,” he said wrote. Fosfomycin was discovered in Spain in 1969, has been marketed in Europe since the 1980s, and is now generic. The drug works by inactivating a protein that bacteria need to form cellular walls and it is used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections. In the U.S., fosfomycin is available only as a powder that can be dissolved in liquid and taken orally, according to Merck Manuals. In other parts of the world, such as Europe, the drug is available in both intravenous and oral formulations. Though fosfoymcin is an old antibiotic, it’s still a useful one. Merck Manuals says that the drug’s ability to work on a wide spectrum of bacteria has made the drug a new choice in treating drug-resistant bugs elsewhere in the body. Zavante has an exclusive licensing agreement with fosfomycin’s primary manufacturer in Europe, Finney said. The Zavante rights to the drug only cover the U.S. But the company has been a pursuing a faster track to the U.S. market via 505(b)(2), an FDA rule covering approvals for new formulations of already approved drugs. That pathway requires only a single clinical trial to show that the new formulation is equivalent to the old one. Zavante’s Phase 2/3 clinical trial enrolled 465 patients randomized to receive either fosfomycin as a one-hour intravenous infusion administered three times daily, or piperacillin/tazobactam, a combination antibiotic that is also administered as a one-hour IV infusion three times daily. Though that combination drug has worked to treat urinary tract infections, an increase in its use has raised concerns about drug resistance, according to research published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. The main goal of the trial was to show that fosfomycin could cure urinary tract infection comparably to the combination antibiotic. Zavante says that the trial results showed its drug had a 64.7 percent success rate treating these infections. By comparison, the piperacillin/tazobactam combination had a 54.5 percent success rate. Zavante says it will present complete results from the clinical trial at an upcoming infectious disease conference. The fosfomycin clinical trial results mean that there now might be two new antibiotics heading to the FDA early next year to help address the problem of drug-resistant bacteria. Earlier this week, Paratek Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: PRTK) reported clinical trial results showing that its antibiotic, omadacycline, hit the goals of a clinical trial that tested the drug in 774 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia. With the new data, Boston-based Paratek plans to file for U.S. approval in the first quarter of 2018. Besides a faster regulatory pathway, the Zavante drug was also granted “fast track” designation from the FDA in 2015, which provides for a speedier review of the drug application. That designation applies to other potential uses of the drug, including abdominal infections, pneumonia, and skin infections. The Zavante drug is in early stage clinical trials for those infections. If Zavante wins FDA approval on its intravenous form of fosfomycin in urinary tract infections, it will have an additional five years to exclusively market its drug without facing generic competition, according to provisions of the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now law. The 2012 statute extended marketing exclusivity as a way encouraging drug companies to develop new drugs that treat serious or life-threatening infections. Zavante’s clinical trial results come a little more year after the company raised $45 million in a Series A round of funding to support the fosfomycin clinical trial. Frazier Healthcare Partners and Longitude Capital led the round, which also included participation from Aisling Capital. Image of E. coli bacteria by Flickr user NIAID via a Creative Commons license.

Markets News provided by Research and Markets Apr 07, 2017, 15:30 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Apr. 07, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Therapeutics in Asia-Pacific Markets to 2023 - Launch of Premium Targeted Therapies and Increasing Prevalence to Drive the Market" report to their offering. The NSCLC market in Asia-Pacific is forecast to grow substantially, from $3 billion in 2016 to $6.2 billion in 2023, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.8%. Owing to strong clinical performances, immune-checkpoint inhibitors will have a greater uptake than other second-line market entrants and will compete among themselves for market share in the APAC region. The entry of targeted therapies into the market will offset the effect of patent expiries for drugs such as Avastin, Alimta, and Tarceva, which will have a limited impact on the market between 2016 and 2023. New targeted and immuno-therapies will drive market growth due to premium pricing and strong clinical performances, but they will also increase the degree of NSCLC market segmentation and the complexity of the treatment algorithm, owing to their enhanced efficacy in specific patient populations. The limited effect of patent expiry on the NSCLC market is one of the main reasons for the substantial growth in value expected in the forecast period, as the introduction of numerous therapies will not be offset by generic erosion; instead, premium therapies will occupy a larger market share for much of the forecast period in APAC. The rate of mutation testing is very low in China and India compared with Australia, South Korea and Japan, and this makes many patients ineligible to receive targeted therapies. However, it is increasing, driven by increasing awareness among the healthcare fraternity. Hence, targeted therapies are expected to be used more often, driving market growth. Moreover, healthcare access and awareness have improved in India and China due to government initiatives. This will increase the market size by strengthening the treatment pool.

Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 07 Apr, 2017, 20:30 BST Share this article DUBLIN, Apr. 07, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Therapeutics in Asia-Pacific Markets to 2023 - Launch of Premium Targeted Therapies and Increasing Prevalence to Drive the Market" report to their offering. The NSCLC market in Asia-Pacific is forecast to grow substantially, from $3 billion in 2016 to $6.2 billion in 2023, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.8%. Owing to strong clinical performances, immune-checkpoint inhibitors will have a greater uptake than other second-line market entrants and will compete among themselves for market share in the APAC region. The entry of targeted therapies into the market will offset the effect of patent expiries for drugs such as Avastin, Alimta, and Tarceva, which will have a limited impact on the market between 2016 and 2023. New targeted and immuno-therapies will drive market growth due to premium pricing and strong clinical performances, but they will also increase the degree of NSCLC market segmentation and the complexity of the treatment algorithm, owing to their enhanced efficacy in specific patient populations. The limited effect of patent expiry on the NSCLC market is one of the main reasons for the substantial growth in value expected in the forecast period, as the introduction of numerous therapies will not be offset by generic erosion; instead, premium therapies will occupy a larger market share for much of the forecast period in APAC. The rate of mutation testing is very low in China and India compared with Australia, South Korea and Japan, and this makes many patients ineligible to receive targeted therapies. However, it is increasing, driven by increasing awareness among the healthcare fraternity. Hence, targeted therapies are expected to be used more often, driving market growth. Moreover, healthcare access and awareness have improved in India and China due to government initiatives. This will increase the market size by strengthening the treatment pool.

The company's indoximod was being tested in combination with Merck's Keytruda. NewLink Genetics said that data on 60 patients found an objective response rate of 52% and a disease control rate of 73%, with rates slightly higher among patients with non-ocular melanoma, at a 59% objective response rate and an 80% disease control rate. Though the company described the results -- which it is presenting at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting on Tuesday -- as impressive and emphasized that the cancer drug combination was well tolerated overall, investors questioned how much of an effect the company's drug had relative to Merck's Keytruda alone and compared NewLink Genetics negatively to Incyte Corp. , which is also developing an IDO inhibitor and is working with Merck. NewLink Genetics shares were valued at $18.40 as of Tuesday morning. The company's shares have surged 63.8% over the last three months, compared with a 3.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images A University startup in India is wrapping up human trials of the first male contraceptive in over a century. The product is a one-time injection of a polymer gel that prevents sperm from swimming. It’s proven to be safe, cheap, effective and free of side-effects. The treatment, dubbed RIsug (reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance), is easily reversed with a second injection. It has been shown to last as long as 13 years, unlike female contraceptives that must be taken daily. The Independent reported, “A new birth control method for men has the potential to win as much as half the $10bn (£8bn) market for female contraceptives worldwide and cut into the $3.2bn of annual condom sales, businesses dominated by pharmaceutical giants Bayer, Pfizer and Merck, according to estimates from the last major drug company to explore the area.” No company has agreed to sell the product, posing a barrier to developing safe and widely accessible contraceptives for men. “The fact that the big companies are run by white, middle-aged males who have the same feeling—that they would never do it—plays a major role,” says Herjan Coelingh Bennink, a gynecology professor who helped develop the contraceptives Implanon and Cerazette as head of research and development in women’s health for Organon International from 1987 to 2000. “If those companies were run by women, it would be totally different.” A male contraception product could provide relief to millions of women in developing countries who don’t have regular access to contraceptives. Though the drug in India would have to redo trials and research in the U.S. to obtain FDA approval, several similar products are being developed within the United States. In California, a similar product is being developed by the non-profit Parsemus Foundation called Vasagel. Their product has been proven to be 100 percent effective in animals tested and they hope to move onto human trials by next year. A startup in Charlottesville, Va., called Contraline is working on a similar substance that would be injected without surgery with the aid of ultrasound. In an interview, the company’s founders said they plan on conducting clinical trials in 2019 and hope to be on the market by 2021. Several other male contraceptive alternatives are currently in a research phase. Eppin is being developed by the University of North Carolina’s Dr. Michael O’Rand to develop a protein that binsd to the sperm cell and prevents it from swimming. This method could be ingested or injected, and fertility resumes once treatment stops. The “Clean Sheets pill” is undergoing research at King’s College of London, and it would relax the vas deferens for 16 to 24 hours, preventing the release of sperm. A drug called JQ1 has shown to effectively, but temporarily, turn off the gene that develops sperm in male mice, but the product has yet to move forward to human trials. Each product would provide a safer, easier, and more affordable alternative to vasectomies. Planned Parenthood’s website lists five birth control methods men can use, three of which include withdrawal, abstinence and “outercourse.” We may be just a few years away from adding better alternatives that shift some of the responsibility of contraceptives to men.

The Best 50 Women in Business awards program honors New Jersey's most dynamic women in business that have been making headlines in their fields. An independent panel of judges selected the top 50 winners based on their dedication to business growth, professional and personal accomplishments, community involvement, and advocacy for women. Created by Caryn, the Kopp Door Opener Service has helped thousands of business owners and sales people secure initial meetings with high level decision makers in almost every major company including P&G, Pfizer, GE, Merck, Verizon, AT&T, Time Warner, Kraft, Target, CBS and the list goes on and on. As sales outsource providers, Caryn's team of senior business developers known as Door Openers find the right opportunities and secure initial prospect meetings for their clients. Many business leaders and sellers say, "When I'm in front of the right decision maker I close the sale most of the time, I just can't get in front of enough of the right prospects." This is true for many companies struggling with their own sales and sales teams, quarter after quarter, year after year. Caryn's trademarked Moment of Yes Sales Message Development Process, proprietary Door Opener Service, and Strategic Sales Insights pave the way for clients to have a seat at the table with high profile, difficult to reach prospects. These introductions help Kopp clients accelerate profitable sales and eliminate the barriers to success they previously experienced. Kopp clients express how helpful it is to have someone else do the high-level prospecting for them! A best-selling author, nationally recognized speaker, and an expert in Business Development, Caryn is uniquely qualified in her passion, coaching women in business to achieve their growth goals. Her unique work-life employment solutions have allowed women and men to pursue their career goals and maintain a balanced life. "When clients achieve success like adding over $5 million dollars in new revenue to their businesses, increasing close ratios from 20% to 48% or being included in RFPs AFTER the RFP process officially closed, we know we're doing business development right!" says Caryn Kopp. NJBIZ and the program sponsors honored this year's winners during an awards ceremony held on Monday, March 20, 2017 at The Palace at Somerset Park, in Somerset, NJ. Accompanying the event is a special publication highlighting each winner.

The NSCLC market in Asia-Pacific is forecast to grow substantially, from $3 billion in 2016 to $6.2 billion in 2023, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.8%. Owing to strong clinical performances, immune-checkpoint inhibitors will have a greater uptake than other second-line market entrants and will compete among themselves for market share in the APAC region. The entry of targeted therapies into the market will offset the effect of patent expiries for drugs such as Avastin, Alimta, and Tarceva, which will have a limited impact on the market between 2016 and 2023. New targeted and immuno-therapies will drive market growth due to premium pricing and strong clinical performances, but they will also increase the degree of NSCLC market segmentation and the complexity of the treatment algorithm, owing to their enhanced efficacy in specific patient populations. The limited effect of patent expiry on the NSCLC market is one of the main reasons for the substantial growth in value expected in the forecast period, as the introduction of numerous therapies will not be offset by generic erosion; instead, premium therapies will occupy a larger market share for much of the forecast period in APAC. The rate of mutation testing is very low in China and India compared with Australia, South Korea and Japan, and this makes many patients ineligible to receive targeted therapies. However, it is increasing, driven by increasing awareness among the healthcare fraternity. Hence, targeted therapies are expected to be used more often, driving market growth. Moreover, healthcare access and awareness have improved in India and China due to government initiatives. This will increase the market size by strengthening the treatment pool.

Alts Equities Smart-Beta New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Smart Beta Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → April → Good News for Healthcare ETFs After Dodging Obamacare Repeal Good News for Healthcare ETFs After Dodging Obamacare Repeal April 7, 2017 at 11:22 am by Brenton Garen The healthcare sector, the third-largest sector weight in the S&P 500, and the related exchange traded funds such as the iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF (NYSEArca: IYH) are bouncing back this year, but investors considering new positions in the group should carefully consider which parts of the sprawling sector offer compelling value. The sector dodged a potential hurdle last month when Congress failed to move forward with a package to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. For healthcare ETFs, the good news is that the U.S. economy moving into the late-cycle phase, overall growth may slow and signs of an economic slowdown could pop up. Consequently, investors may also turn to defensive sectors that are less economically sensitive, such as health care. Industry observers argue that medical technology companies can tap into increased healthcare spending among emerging economies while the U.S. market has matured and could experience slower growth. Looking ahead, in the years through 2024, spending growth is projected to average 5.8% and peak at 6.3% in 2020. “Is health care a buy? We think a selective approach is appropriate. Health care has a lower stock correlation than other sectors, reflecting variations in innovation cycles, drug patents and pipelines. That dynamic reinforces the importance of selecting winners and avoiding losers,” said BlackRock in a recent note. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology sub-sectors may benefit under a Republican president and Congress as the industries are less at risk of price controls that Democrats vowed to impose. The iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEArca: IHE) is up 6% year-to-date. IHE tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceuticals Index and holds 40 stocks with a significant portion of ETF’s lineup devoted to blue-chip pharmaceuticals such as Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Merck (NYSE: MRK). “A challenge for drug makers is that politicians, regulators and consumers are clamoring to curb growth in drug prices. U.S. prescription drug prices rose 5.2% in 2016, the largest increase since 2001, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis,” according to BlackRock. Arguably, pharmaceutical stocks have been resilient this year as Trump, on multiple occasions, has used harsh rhetoric regarding prescription drug prices.

Janssen also holds an exercisable option to peptide-drug conjugate (PDC) use and applications. Janssen will have the right to develop and commercialize all compounds resulting from the collaboration. Under the terms of the agreement, PeptiDream would receive an undisclosed upfront payment and research funding and is eligible to receive preclinical, clinical, and commercialization milestone payments potentially totaling up to $1.15 billion.

A secretive biotech company that doesn't sell any products somehow has a valuation of $4.7 billion. This stealthy startup is sitting on $1.3 billion in cash and has raised over $1.9 billion since its inception. Little is known about the CEO other than he reportedly has a $500 million fortune. But here's what we do know… This private company could revolutionize modern medicine, and it may go public soon if it can successfully launch a new vaccine … IPO News: The Secret $4 Billion Biotech Firm with Big Plans There are reportedly 12 drugs in its pipeline, although there are very few clues as to what the biotech firm is actually working on. According to Forbes, the company's remedies could cure everything from cancer to the Zika virus. In fact, well-known pharmaceutical companies are lining up to invest or work with the secretive group. In 2013, this private business signed a deal for a $240 million cash payment with AstraZeneca Plc. (NYSE ADR: AZN), a biopharmaceutical company worth nearly $80 billion. AstraZeneca followed that with a $140 million investment in 2014. Alexion, a rare-disease specialist, also jumped at the chance of investing with $25 million in 2014. In June 2016, Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) paid $200 million to get the biotech company's help to develop cancer vaccines. We're closely watching this company because of the success of recent healthcare IPOs. Shares of AnaptysBio Inc. (Nasdaq: ANAB) opened at $16 per share on Jan. 2 and opened this morning at $29.17 per share.

Trump has said he wants to raise concerns about China's trade practices and press Xi to do more to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions. * Oil prices jumped more than 1 percent as the missile strike raised concerns that the conflict could spread in the oil-rich region. Safe-haven gold hit five-month highs. * Energy stocks were among the top gainers among the S&amp;P 500 constituents trading premarket. Exxon was up 0.6 percent, with Chesapeake, Apache and Devon Energy all up about 1.5 percent. * Focus is also shifting to U.S. payrolls, due later in the day, for further cues on the strength of the economy. Job growth likely slowed in March after unseasonably mild weather boosted hiring over the prior two months. * The Labor Department's report at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT) is expected to show nonfarm payrolls likely slowed to 180,000 in March, from 235,000 in February. * However, data on Wednesday showed private sector hiring rose the most in over two years, and is likely to bump up the final count. * A robust jobs number will add to other recent healthy economic data and possibly give the Federal Reserve more confidence to begin trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. * New York Fed President William Dudley is scheduled to speak at a conference on financial regulation at 12:15 p.m. ET. * Merck sank 3.1 percent after regulators denied the company's move to label some of its diabetes drugs as safe for heart patients. * Wal-Mart edged up 0.6 percent after Telsey Advisory Group upgraded the stock to "outperform". Futures snapshot at 7:06 a.m. ET: * Dow e-minis were up 3 points, or 0.01 percent, with 48,132 contracts changing hands. * S&amp;P 500 e-minis remained unchanged, with 268,167 contracts traded. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 0.25 points, or 0 percent, on volume of 51,677 contracts.

The deal also includes various potential future development, regulatory, sales, and royalty payments. Evestra and Gedeon Richter have collaborated previously. In February 2015, Richter gave the company a $5 million convertible loan to help Evestra develop its pipeline, particularly vaginal ring products that release low doses of estrogen and progesteron, through clinical stages. The two products Richter said it licensed at the time were called EVE-112 and EVE-116. Richter reported 1.25 billion euros (about $1.33 billion) in revenue in 2016. Richter can decide after three years whether it wants Evestra to repay its loan or to convert it into equity in the San Antonio company. Founded in 2007, Evestra does research in a variety of areas of women’s health, including hormone replacement therapy, endometriosis, and breast cancer. It’s previously licensed other fertility control products, including a deal it announced last month with the U.S. division of Mumbai-based Glenmark Pharmaceuticals to try to bring a generic version of Merck’s (NYSE: MRK) NuvaRing to market. The U.S. division of Glenmark, which is based in Mahwah, NJ, is getting the marketing and distribution rights for the generic drug product in the U.S., as well as an option to commercialize two other vaginal rings in development, Glenmark says. In return, Evestra gets potential milestone and royalty payments as it continues to develop and commercialize the drug, called EVE-119, with Glenmark.

Entrepreneurs are betting on apps that improve—or just replace—prescription medication. by Christina Farr April 7, 2017 What if an app could replace a pill? That’s the big question behind an emerging trend known as “digital therapeutics.” The idea: software that can improve a person’s health as much as a drug can, but without the same cost and side-effects. Digital therapeutics, or “digiceuticals,” as some call them, have become a Holy Grail in some quarters of Silicon Valley, where investors see the chance to deliver medicine through your smartphone. Andreessen Horowitz, the venture firm, even predicts digital drugs will become “the third phase” of medicine, meaning the successor to the chemical and protein drugs we have now, but without the billion-dollar cost of bringing one to market.   “It’s going to seem backwards and even barbaric that our solution to everything was just giving out pills,” partner Vijay Pande wrote on the investment company’s blog. But defining exactly what a digital therapeutic actually is can be as elusive as finding the famous chalice. “It’s still a fluid space that everyone is trying to categorize,” says Peter Hames, the British CEO of a startup called Big Health, which offers an online therapy program for insomnia suffers called sleep.io that it claims can replace “pills or potions” with visualization exercises. Hames says digital therapies fall into two groups, which he calls “medication augmentation” and “medication replacement.” He says sleep.io is in the latter category because it actually makes sleeping pills unnecessary. “We’ve been able to show through multiple peer-reviewed studies that the outcomes are better than drugs,” he says. The term digital therapeutics began to circulate around 2013, in large part due to Sean Duffy, CEO of Omada Health. He began using it at conferences and in the company’s marketing materials to describe its online coaching software to help pre-diabetics avoid getting sick by exercising more and losing weight.

To distinguish themselves from “wellness” gadgets, digital therapeutics companies tend to carry out clinical tests and sometimes seek regulatory approvals –one company, Welldoc, offers a prescription-only version of its BlueStar phone app for managing diabetes, which it terms the “first FDA-cleared mobile prescription therapy.” But unlike drugs, digital therapeutics don’t usually need approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, since often they promote lifestyle or dietary changes that are deemed to be low-risk. Whether a digital therapeutic involves a tracking sensor or coaching though an app, the biggest question is whether they provide a distinct, measureable medical benefit. One startup calling itself a digital therapeutics company is Virta Health, based in San Francisco. The company raised $37 million in March. Its goal is to actually “reverse” diabetes without drugs or surgery using online coaching to get people on a special diet high in fats and low on carbs. It has a study by Indiana State University to back up the claim—about half of the 262 people with type 2 diabetes enrolled in a 10-week trial were able to reduce their blood glucose levels to non-diabetic ranges. Steve Kraus, an investor at Bessemer Venture Partners, says he thinks digital therapeutics will be a “real thing, I really do,” but he says it’s not clear how many people will succeed with lifestyle intervention in the long run. Instead, he says, digital therapeutics used “in combination” with drugs, to make them work better, could be the idea’s sweet spot. What’s the most serious disease that a “digital” treatment could cure? Tell us in the comments. Some digital companies are already allying with pharmaceutical makers. One, Propeller Health, inked a deal with GlaxoSmithKline for what it calls a “digitally guided therapy” platform. The approach combines Glaxo’s asthma medications with sensors, made by Propeller, that patients attach to their inhalers to monitor when they’re used. Patients who get feedback from Propeller’s app end up using the medication less often. To win adoption, digital therapeutics companies have striven to mimic the drug industry’s practices and standards. Big Health, based in San Francisco, went as far as testing a placebo version of its insomnia app against the real thing. One group of insomnia-sufferers were given plausible-sounding, but fake, online visualization exercises; the other received the actual cognitive behavioral therapy that Big Health says works. The digital treatment “absolutely spanked the placebo,” says Hames. Hames believes that someday digital therapeutics companies may even outstrip drug companies when it comes to evidence. “We’re digital, so we’re going to have a firehose of data,” he says. Drugmakers don’t always track real-world results of their pills once clinical trials are done. But digital therapeutics companies could easily keep getting data. “It’s not in the drug company’s interest because they have already sold the drug,” he says. “Meanwhile, the insurance companies will say to us, ‘You have the data, so why don’t you just tell us?’” Some drug company executives remain skeptical. Robert Plenge, vice president at Merck’s research labs, had to look up “digital therapeutics” when asked whether they were important. “I don’t totally understand what you mean,” he says. “Which might in and of itself be your answer.” Plenge doesn’t think the idea would have much impact on drug development and questioned whether digital companies will be able to prove their offerings are worth the price. But some digital therapies are already much cheaper than your average drug. At Big Health, people are charged $400 a year, or about $33 a month, to use the insomnia software. The sleeping pill Ambien, by contrast, costs $73 for six tablets, or six nights of shut-eye. A notable difference is that insurance often pays most of the cost of drugs and insurers are still getting used to digital therapeutics. Omada Health in 2016 again broke ground when Medicare agreed to reimburse the cost of its digital diabetes prevention program. The company didn't say how much it bills employers and insurance plans, but it would charge a self-paying customer $140 a month for the first four, then $20 per month. Ambar Bhattacharyya, with Maverick Ventures, says he thinks insurers are ready to talk about covering digital therapies more widely. “This is an imminent issue that I suspect will be figured out within a year,” he says. If it’s good news, he says, the space is poised to explode. Become an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.
