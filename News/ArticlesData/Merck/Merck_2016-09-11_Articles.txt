Better Buy: Merck vs. Pfizer The Motley Fool 9/12/2016 Dan Caplinger © Brendan McDermid/Reuters People walk past the Pfizer Inc. headquarters in New York. Brendan McDermid/Reuters Pharmaceutical companies have been in the news lately, and political pressure attacking the profits that drug-makers have earned over the decades is rising rapidly as the 2016 election approaches. Quotes in the article Pfizer Inc PFE ▼ 32.10 -0.14 -0.42% Merck & Co Inc MRK ▼ 62.91 -0.74 -1.16% For pharma giants Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), however, the fear of potential new regulation hasn't led to a big decline in their share prices over time, and the growth trends toward greater use of pharmaceuticals both in the U.S. and around the world remain positive catalysts for further stock gains in the future. Investors looking at drug stocks are curious which of these two blue-chip stocks looks like a smarter pick right now. With that in mind, let's compare Merck and Pfizer on a number of metrics to see which makes more sense right now. Valuation and stock performance Both Pfizer and Merck have seen their stocks rise over the past year. Merck has managed to post stronger gains, rising 23% compared to a total return of just 7% for Pfizer. When you look at simple valuation methods based on trailing earnings, neither Merck nor Pfizer look particularly inexpensive. Merck trades at 34 times its earnings over the past 12 months, and while Pfizer is a bit less expensive, its earnings multiple of 30 is still well above the overall market average. When you incorporate future expectations for earnings, however, both stocks begin to look cheaper. Using future estimates for earnings, Pfizer trades at just 13 times forward earnings, and Merck also looks more reasonable with a forward earnings multiple of 16. Pfizer's valuation is slightly cheaper than Merck's, which makes sense given Pfizer's smaller share-price advance compared to its rival. Dividends For dividend investors, both Merck and Pfizer look good. Again, though, Pfizer beats out its competitor, posting a 3.5% dividend yield compared to Merck's current payout of slightly less than 3. The temporarily depressed earnings that both companies have seen lately raise concerns about the sustainability of the dividend, given that both Merck and Pfizer have payout ratios at or slightly above 100%. Based on future expectations, however, it's likely that those figures will drop for both companies going forward. In terms of dividend increases, Pfizer has been more generous recently as well. Its most recent dividend increase earlier this year added 7% to its quarterly payout, compared to just a 2% increase late last year from Merck. That's consistent with the two companies' longer-term history, in which Pfizer has typically rewarded shareholders with faster dividend growth. On the dividend front, Pfizer has an edge over Merck. Growth prospects and risk Fundamentally, Merck and Pfizer have enjoyed similar long-term success but also have to deal with many of the same obstacles to future growth. In Merck's most recent quarterly report, the company reported sales growth of just 1%, reporting that the strength of the U.S. dollar cost it two percentage points of growth. Adjusted net income climbed about 6%. Merck focused its attention on key drugs like cancer-fighter Keytruda and hepatitis C treatment Zepatier, which it hopes to attain blockbuster status and replace some of the compounds that have gone off-patent over the years. Acquisitions continue to play a vital role in driving growth in pipelines for Merck, but the drug-maker has had to deal with restructuring costs and impairment charges that forced it to cut its earnings guidance for the full year, and falling sales for past blockbusters requires Merck to stay vigilant looking forward. For Pfizer, you'll find some of the same issues. In its most recent quarter, Pfizer's sales jumped 11%, but much of that growth came from the inclusion of Hospira in its consolidated results. Reported profits fell, although the bottom line improved on an adjusted basis. The company is also focused on its pipeline, and the August announcement that Pfizer would purchase Medivation in a $14 billion deal showed how strongly Pfizer believes in growing its scale even further. As CEO Ian Read noted, the move "will strengthen Pfizer's Innovative Health business and accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key focus areas." Some fear that Pfizer had to overpay for Medivation, but the purchase price was consistent with premium values for acquisitions in the healthcare space recently. Overall, Merck and Pfizer have similar opportunities and challenges. As a result, Pfizer's cheaper valuation and higher dividend yield make it look more attractive than Merck for most investors right now.

  will share in EUR1 million   Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced key symposia and more than 30 presentations of clinical data on Cladribine Tablets, an investigational, oral, small molecule for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and Rebif® (interferon beta-1a), the company's high-dose, high-frequency interferon beta for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), are scheduled for the 32nd Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) taking place September 14-17, 2016, in London. "Merck is committed to advancing patient care and offering therapeutic options that help address unmet medical needs for people with MS, with a focus on efficacy, dosing, durability and safety," said Luciano Rossetti, Global Head of Research & Development for Merck's biopharma business. "We look forward to sharing additional data on Rebif® and Cladribine Tablets with the scientific community at this year's ECTRIMS Congress." Oral presentations include a comparison of the CLARITY and the CLARITY EXTENSION studies, which sought to examine the duration of clinical outcome response to Cladribine Tablets, and results of the SOLAR study, which examined the effects of adding high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) to Rebif® therapy for patients with RRMS. Poster presentations will report on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets or Rebif® and patient-reported outcomes in patients being treated with Rebif®. Several health economics outcomes research presentations will highlight key issues facing people with MS, including pregnancy outcomes. In addition to data presentations, a Merck-sponsored satellite symposium, "Reimagining the MS Treatment Journey," will take place Wednesday, September 14, 18:45-19:45 BST in Hall A at the ExCel. The panel session will feature distinguished experts in MS who will debate whether unmet needs in MS care remain, consider what an ideal MS therapy might look like, and review current and potential future therapies. On Thursday, September 15, Merck will hold its fourth annual Grant for Multiple Sclerosis Innovations (GMSI) Awards symposium. Up to EUR1 million will be awarded to one or more researchers to support work that aims to improve the understanding of MS for the ultimate benefit of patients. The symposium will take place in the South Gallery 19 at the ExCel from 19:30-20:30 BST.

About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Rebif® Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide(TM). Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS. RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS. RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

"Merck is committed to advancing patient care and offering therapeutic options that help address unmet medical needs for people with MS, with a focus on efficacy, dosing, durability and safety," said Luciano Rossetti, Global Head of Research & Development for Merck's biopharma business. "We look forward to sharing additional data on Rebif® and Cladribine Tablets with the scientific community at this year's ECTRIMS Congress." Oral presentations include a comparison of the CLARITY and the CLARITY EXTENSION studies, which sought to examine the duration of clinical outcome response to Cladribine Tablets, and results of the SOLAR study, which examined the effects of adding high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) to Rebif® therapy for patients with RRMS. Poster presentations will report on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets or Rebif® and patient-reported outcomes in patients being treated with Rebif®. Several health economics outcomes research presentations will highlight key issues facing people with MS, including pregnancy outcomes. In addition to data presentations, a Merck-sponsored satellite symposium, "Reimagining the MS Treatment Journey," will take place Wednesday, September 14, 18:45-19:45 BST in Hall A at the ExCel. The panel session will feature distinguished experts in MS who will debate whether unmet needs in MS care remain, consider what an ideal MS therapy might look like, and review current and potential future therapies. On Thursday, September 15, Merck will hold its fourth annual Grant for Multiple Sclerosis Innovations (GMSI) Awards symposium. Up to EUR1 million will be awarded to one or more researchers to support work that aims to improve the understanding of MS for the ultimate benefit of patients. The symposium will take place in the South Gallery 19 at the ExCel from 19:30-20:30 BST. For more information about the data to be presented, please review the ECTRIMS website (http://www.ectrims-congress.eu/2016.html). Also, visit Merck's booth at this year's Congress to learn more about the company's programs and commitment to advancing MS care. About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Rebif® Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*.

How to Whitelist Besides, you're reading about advertising. Why not see who's advertising around the advertising coverage while you're at it? Will You Live to 100? Marketers Are Betting on It By Jack Neff. Published on September 12, 2016. When Atilla Cansun asked the audience at Cannes Lions Health for a show of hands of anyone over 80, he got, unsurprisingly, no response. He said he didn't see anyone even likely in their 60s. Credit: Courtesy Cannes Lion/Getty Images Merck Consumer Health CMO Atilla Cansun saw firsthand the risk of people not preparing for the prospects of living longer when his father retired in his 60s. "You get this influx of money and have little projects, like painting the walls or the summer home," Mr. Cansun said. "Then this guy who used to be leading a whole [university] department is suddenly concerned about whether the cat stops by to drink the milk. You just reduce people down to where they're underwhelmed." Rather than stay there, however, his father re-entered the marketplace and now chairs the architecture department at a university in Istanbul at age 72. "And the way he talks about his own future has completely changed." His father's experience helped inspire Mr. Cansun to launch We100 to deal with a world where living to 100 will be commonplace; the initiative aims to prepare people physically, mentally and financially for what Mr. Cansun calls "100 kick-ass years." We100 is what he terms a "neutral brand" aiming to enlist support from other healthcare companies, governments, nonprofits or even, in his dreams, another vibrant septuagenarian, Pope Francis, or 90-year-old Queen Elizabeth. Mr. Cansun and Merck aren't alone. In a healthcare market long focused on treating problems, there's a growing focus on preventing them, or more accurately, keeping people healthier so their advancing years are more blessing and less curse. To be sure, in a world of $600 EpiPens and multibillion-dollar cholesterol and erectile dysfunction drugs, there's still more money in treatment than prevention. But even beyond drugs and supplements, the preventive approach is getting more attention in beauty care, where marketers are trying to convince millennials to do things now to prevent the appearance of aging, rather than wait until later to reduce those effects. Derek Bowen, a former beauty marketer at Coty and Alberto-Culver and Unilever's Tresemmé, now approaches beauty from a different perspective in his current post as chief marketing officer and general manager-consumer packaged goods Americas at supplement marketer NBTY. One of the most successful products of the company's flagship brand, Nature's Bounty, in recent years has been its Hair, Skin & Nails product, designed with such ingredients as argan oil and biotin in supplements to improve looks. "Beauty has been so externally focused, but the internal piece is really important too," Mr. Bowen said. "What you take, what you eat, is very important to your outer appearance. Beauty companies, because the products are all used on your skin or hair, have not been able to address the inner part of that, which is what we're really tapping into." Much like beauty marketers, Nature's Bounty focuses on before-and-after demos, running a 30-day challenge campaign that asks consumers to look at results after a month of taking the product. Among the initiatives Merck is championing as part of We100 are: Healthy Hour, a new health curriculum for students in kindergarten to college on how to improve quality of life from birth to 100 years old TogetherLand, a scholarship for architecture students to develop a new residential model that supports independent living but includes common spaces and fosters helping others Restart 50+, an online job platform to provide new opportunities for people in their 50s We4You, a program for Merck employees to volunteer three weeks of their time to help the elderly For the first time, in 2015 growth of skincare products fell below that of fragrances, something NPD Group analyst Karen Grant attributes to a slowdown in antiaging skincare. Replacing it somewhat are supplements designed to "work from the inside out," she said. Dollar sales of supplements to improve facial appearance alone have grown fivefold in two years, albeit to a modest $4.1 million in 2015, even as sales of antiaging products declined. Skin creams are not disappearing; the focus and marketplace are shifting. One of the fastest-growing beauty brands of recent years has been Rodan & Fields, which saw sales nearly double last year to $626 million, marketed heavily on Facebook by independent distributors and fueled in part by millennials turning to preventive skincare. Rodan & Fields' core consumer averages a bit younger than that for traditional antiaging products at 40, said Lynn Emmolo, chief brand officer. But millennials much younger than that are a major segment for the brand. "Millennials are looking at skincare at an earlier age, but they're not thinking of antiaging," Ms. Emmolo said. "They're thinking about prevention, so part of our line is about the prevention story—products that have SPF protection and treat skin to prevent problems." Mr. Bowen prefers not to use the terms "prevention" or "treatment," but as NBTY looks to expand the market for its supplements, the focus is clearly toward the former. A new Nature's Bounty campaign, for example, shows a message from the future to a woman telling her she should take more fish oil. For Merck Consumer Health, there's a link between preparing for a world where people live to 100 and nutritional supplements. Merck, having divested its consumer business, with such drugs as Claritin and Afrin, to Bayer two years ago, now focuses on nutritional supplements, led by Seven Seas—a major player in Europe and the Commonwealth countries. Certainly Merck wouldn't mind if the prospect of a longer life led people to take its probiotics at younger ages to gird their digestive and immune systems for a healthier future. But Mr. Cansun said We100 is truly about preparing society for a new reality of people living longer. "Even in Africa and rural places in Southeast Asia, life expectancy has picked up by 30-plus years since the Second World War," he said. "But if you look at the bigger picture of how institutions and government and the healthcare industry are adjusting to it, it's quite appalling." Merck surveyed 2,000 people age 18 to 89 in the U.K. and Germany and found most people expect their lives to hit a crescendo at 50, then start heading downhill in terms of health, career prospects and other areas. He said 80% of respondents globally believe society broadly needs to change its attitude toward the elderly, and more than 90% feel kids aren't well prepared by educational institutions to prepare themselves for long and healthy lives. Education systems are generally "a rat race preparing people to perform and outperform and create output—a sprint that ends with maybe a fat job at the end of college," he said. "But nobody actually takes the time to help kids know their bodies and what kind of lives they need to live to prepare them for that marathon, which may take up to 100 years." We100 also aims to change attitudes about aging and employment, where its research found 80% of people believe they have diminished chances to advance or change careers after age 50. While Merck Consumer Health has started We100 with backing from WPP's Ogilvy & Mather, Mr. Cansun said he intends to keep it neutral or unbranded, hoping to enlist participation from bigger players in a global health and pharmaceutical market where Merck is only ninth, as well as from government, education and elsewhere. That includes even such things as changing the ways governments view and talk about retirement ages—where any delay in benefit eligibility is usually considered to diminish benefits, yet people seldom talk about the need to keep people active in the workforce longer as their life spans grow. He believes marketing can also do plenty to change, including hire older people to work on brands that appeal to older people. When he asked an audience at the Lions Health portion of the Cannes International Festival of Creativity for a show of hands for anyone over 80, he got, unsurprisingly, no response, but said he didn't see anyone even likely in their 60s. And he believes, conversely, that healthcare marketing, geared largely toward treatment of older people with health problems, needs to focus more on younger people too. "It shouldn't just be about selling products," Mr. Cansun said. "It should be about selling products surrounded by education so kids can be aware of taking care of themselves."

The awards were announced yesterday evening at an award presentation meeting organized by Merck during the 55th European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) Meeting in Paris, France. Merck is providing grants to pioneers of new research in growth through the Grant for Growth Innovation award. Identifying and supporting forward thinking researchers in the field of growth follows Merck´s scientific strategy of providing a platform that makes innovation possible. "It is inspiring to see the high quality and aspiration of the researchers to whom these grants have been awarded. We recognise that despite advances in treatment and management of growth disorders, we still require a better understanding of these diseases to address the high unmet medical need. We look forward to seeing the results of these projects," said Dr Steven Hildemann, Global Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Medical and Safety at Merck´s Biopharma business. 38 applications were received from 20 countries and reviewed by an independent Scientific Steering Committee composed of five internationally renowned endocrinologists and researchers. Following a rigorous selection process, three awards were offered to innovative projects which seek to advance understanding in the field of growth. The winning projects are based in Australia, Italy and Brazil, and are as follows: Andrew J. Brooks  University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Brisbane, Australia  Project: Targeting the transmembrane domain of the growth hormone receptor to develop new drug classes addressing unmet needs in treatment of growth hormone disorders Antonio Cittadini, MD, PhD  Federico II University, Naples, Italy  Project: Treatment of growth hormone deficiency associated with chronic heart failure: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study Alexander Augusto de Lima Jorge, MD, PhD  University of São Paulo Medical School, Brazil  Project: Growth hormone and estrogen pharmacogenetics in patients with Turner syndrome About the Grant for Growth Innovation (GGI)  Merck initiated the GGI program to support the advancement of understanding of the field of growth. A total grant of up to €400,000 per year, divided between up to three research proposals, will be awarded to the selected projects. Each application is blinded and evaluated by an independent Scientific Steering Committee composed of internationally renowned endocrinologists and researchers, according to five criteria: innovation; scientific rationale; clarity; feasibility; and impact of research.

Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Sep 11, 2016 at 7:25AM Image source: Getty Images. If you're looking for a long-term winner as a retiree, it's hard to beat a stock that not only pays growing dividends, but whose shares are in the bargain bin because of short-term disappointments. Even the highest-quality companies suffer setbacks, which can present a golden opportunity to buy beaten-down shares and watch them rebound. In addition, with the stock having taken a hit, your investment dollars buy more shares, meaning a juicier yield and a bigger income stream for decades -- perhaps even the rest of your life. Remember that no stock is without risk, and there are no guarantees. But if you have some patience and don't mind a little risk, these three companies have a long history of solid performance and could make great choices for a retirement portfolio. Bristol-Myers Squibb: management flubbed it, but the stock will be back Blame Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) for being overly ambitious. The Big Pharma company motored to a 17-year high in July, only to take a sharp plunge in August. The stock is now down about 25%, meaning Bristol-Myers' dividend yield is a more attractive 2.7%. At the pre-plunge price, shares were yielding only 2%. But what caused the drop? Chalk it up to an unexpected clinical trial failure for the company's PD-L1 inhibitor, Opdivo, the world's best-selling cancer drug. In a first-line non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) trial, Opdivo failed to outperform conventional chemotherapy. Since Merck & Co.'s PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, succeeded in a somewhat similar trial, Opdivo's failure shocked the market. In fact, the biotech twittersphere went nuts. "The failure is a MAJOR SURPRISE -- possibly the biggest clinical surprise of my career," wrote Mark Schoenbaum of research firm Evercore ISI. Actually, it wasn't so much a surprise as an overreach. What the headlines missed was that the trials were designed differently. Bristol-Myers' trial included a broad group of patients, while Merck played it safe by including only patients whose tumors expressed a lot of PD-L1, making them more likely to benefit from PD-L1-inhibiting drugs. Short-term, management's decision really hurt this stock, but the market appears to have punished Bristol-Myers enough. And it should be remembered that Opdivo has been outselling Keytruda 2-to-1, thanks in part to a management team that's often gone for the wider market approval in its clinical trials.  For instance, in second-line NSCLC treatment, Opdivo is approved for all patients, while Keytruda is approved only for those with high PD-L1 levels.  Bristol-Myers will have another shot at the first-line NSCLC market with a late-stage study testing Opdivo and another drug called Yervoy. Results are expected by January 2018. Meanwhile, this company's growth engine is firing on all cylinders, with last quarter showing 17% growth in revenue to $4.9 billion, compared with the year-ago quarter. U.S. revenues increased an eye-popping 46% to $2.7 billion, as compared with a year ago. Looking forward, the company's top-line forecast is to grow by double digits for the rest of 2016 and by high single digits heading into 2017 and beyond. At the end of last quarter, Bristol-Meyers had $7.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, giving it financial flexibility. In short, the August sell-off put this pharma in the sweet spot to generate a solid income stream while investors wait for it to recover. Image source: Getty Images. CVS Health Corporation: a prescription for success CVS Health Corporation's (NYSE:CVS) 1.8% dividend may not seem like much at first, but CVS offers great dividend growth. The company has raised its dividend for 13 straight years. In fact, management raised the dividend 21% just last year and has boosted it 750% over the past 10 years. In addition, the company's payout ratio is still a low 33%, meaning there's plenty of room to keep raising the dividend. Companies that are able to aggressively grow their dividends usually do so because earnings are accelerating. In the second quarter, CVS's adjusted EPS increased 8.3% year over year. Combining all of its sales data, net revenues were up 17.6% to a record $43.7 billion last quarter, compared with the year-ago quarter. While most people think of CVS as a drugstore operator, it's also the country's second-largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), with more than 80 million members. The larger you are in the PBM business, the better deals you can negotiate on drug prices, which clearly is important, with drug pricing a growing concern in the U.S. In terms of its retail pharmacy business, revenue increased $2.8 billion to $20 billion, or 16% year-over-year, in the most recent quarter, thanks to the addition of long-term care pharmacy operations from its acquisition of Omnicare, Inc, as well as the addition of clinics and pharmacies from its deal with Target Corporation. Add in the company's 1,100 Minute Clinic urgent-care facilities, with plans to open another 400 in the next few years, and this stock looks poised for fast growth in the coming decades. Despite turning in solid financial results in the first and second quarters of 2016, CVS has seen its stock declined 6% since the beginning of the year. Add it all up, and this currently lagging stock could be just what the doctor ordered to revitalize your retirement portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. Abbott Labs: Grace Groner shows the way If you're looking for a great stock that's paid increasing dividends decade after decade, look no further than Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT). Having spun off its biotech department back in 2013 into AbbVie, the parent company has paid increasing dividends for an amazing 44 years. The global healthcare products company now offers a shareholder payout of 2.5%, after raising its dividend 7% in the past year. Abbott's stock price has dropped about 6% over the past 12 months, but the long-term trajectory of this company is not only intact but also likely to be reignited by recent acquisitions. In fact, last quarter's results were a standout, with every single segment delivering mid- to high-single-digit operational growth. Point-of-care diagnostics saw an 11.5% jump, emerging-market pharmaceuticals grew 15.9%, and vascular medical devices grew 8.9%. In addition, with its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which should close before the end of the year, investors should see continued growth far into the future. One story any retiree can appreciate is that of Grace Groner, who was a secretary at Abbott Labs 80 years ago. Groner bought three shares of Abbott Laboratories in 1935 for $60 each. She held on to the stock and reinvested her dividends in more shares, while Abbott split dozens of times and grew into a healthcare behemoth. By 2010, she owned more than 100,000 shares valued at $7 million. I can't tell you where this company will be in another 80 years, but taking into account its highly diversified revenue stream -- which is a stabilizing factor for any company -- as well as its rich and stable history and an above-average dividend yield, it's a good option for retirement investors. Buy on the dip and let it rip One of my favorite rules of thumb for successful stock investing is to buy greatness on sale. All three of these companies offer the kind of growth potential, safety, and expanding dividends that create long-term champs. And best of all, they're in the bargain bin.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Topic News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted For Bloggers PRNewswire Distribution Search Military Families Enjoy Discount Program for Fertility Treatments   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Fertility Medications * IVF medications By Industry: * HealthNEW YORK - Sept. 12, 2016 - PRLog -- Military families receive a significant discount on fertility meds from EMD Serono (Merck) in the form of a program called Compassionate Corps. Veterans and their spouses will be eligible to receive free fertility meds. This program expands upon the Compassionate Care program already offered by Serono. In order to qualify for the free fertility medications and IVF drugs, those who have served in the military will be required to be retired, or the spouse of a veteran, be considered infertile due to a service-related injury, or have been diagnosed by a doctor as being infertile and needing intervention. This program was introduced in 2014 and has now expanded to include many who were previously not covered. IVFprescriptions.com supports the US military and their families who participate in this program. Fertility Drug Support Says Craig Millian, Head of US Endocrinology and Fertility, "We are proud to add to our comprehensive access programs a new way to help serve the men and women of our military who may be experiencing financial barriers to fertility treatment." With many couples spending tens of thousands of dollars for multiple cycles, offsetting the costs for fertility drugs and IVF procedures, and the IVF drugs that are necessary to achieve conception and pregnancy, are offering hope to those who had given up on having their own children. How to Enroll in Fertility Drug Discount Program For those who qualify, there is one more stipulation. The fertility center that patients are utilizing must be one that participates in the program. Not all do. Centers who wish to become participating centers can contact Serono directly to receive the necessary forms. The necessary forms will be submitted to Serono, who will send approval, in most instances, within a couple of days. Once this has been completed the patient can obtain the needed fertility drugs for up to two cycles per year, at no charge. The Fine Print for Discount Fertility Meds Those who wish to participate in the discount IVF drugs program that is offered to the military, need to keep in mind that patients have to reapply each year. The discount can't be combined with any other medical insurance or discounts, and if you are covered under Medicare, or other programs offed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, you won't be allowed to participate. This discount primarily covers the fertility drugs produced by Serono, which include Gonal-F, Centrotide, and Ovidrel. Military Discount for Fertility Meds and IVFPrescriptions.com IVFprescriptions.com is one of many online discount pharmacies, who are certified and licensed by the Ministry of Health. They also carry fertility medications produced by Serono, and as such support the programs that have been launched. For an in-depth discussion about how IVFprescriptions.com can offer discounts on fertility meds go to the website: www.ivfprescriptions.com, or call their offices directly. For those not qualifying for the Compassionate Corps program, there are many other discounts that can be realized. IVF Prescriptions is licensed by the Israel Ministry of Health and accredited to export medicines worldwide. IVF Prescriptions is a leader in discount infertility drugs with pharmacies in the UK, Germany, and Israel. Manufacturing facilities are located in the Netherlands, Ireland, and Germany. We are dedicated to providing you with the best service and the lowest price for your online fertility meds, with different divisions of specialty drugs, from lifesaving medications to life-giving fertility drugs.

The awards were announced yesterday evening at an award presentation meeting organized by Merck during the 55th European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) Meeting in Paris, France. Merck is providing grants to pioneers of new research in growth through the Grant for Growth Innovation award. Identifying and supporting forward thinking researchers in the field of growth follows Merck´s scientific strategy of providing a platform that makes innovation possible. "It is inspiring to see the high quality and aspiration of the researchers to whom these grants have been awarded. We recognise that despite advances in treatment and management of growth disorders, we still require a better understanding of these diseases to address the high unmet medical need. We look forward to seeing the results of these projects," said Dr Steven Hildemann, Global Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Medical and Safety at Merck´s Biopharma business. 38 applications were received from 20 countries and reviewed by an independent Scientific Steering Committee composed of five internationally renowned endocrinologists and researchers. Following a rigorous selection process, three awards were offered to innovative projects which seek to advance understanding in the field of growth. The winning projects are based in Australia, Italy and Brazil, and are as follows: Andrew J. Brooks  University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Brisbane, Australia  Project: Targeting the transmembrane domain of the growth hormone receptor to develop new drug classes addressing unmet needs in treatment of growth hormone disorders Antonio Cittadini, MD, PhD  Federico II University, Naples, Italy  Project: Treatment of growth hormone deficiency associated with chronic heart failure: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study Alexander Augusto de Lima Jorge, MD, PhD  University of São Paulo Medical School, Brazil  Project: Growth hormone and estrogen pharmacogenetics in patients with Turner syndrome About the Grant for Growth Innovation (GGI)  Merck initiated the GGI program to support the advancement of understanding of the field of growth. A total grant of up to €400,000 per year, divided between up to three research proposals, will be awarded to the selected projects.

Sep 11th 2016, 9:00 PM 66,065 Views 210 Comments Share4628 Tweet Email22 Updated: 12 September AS THE SCHOOL year begins, tens of thousands of girls in the first year of secondary school will be offered the HPV vaccine in Ireland. But a campaign called Regret has come to prominence, questioning the safety of the vaccine, and claiming it caused illness in 400 Irish teenage girls and young women after they took it. Jacqui Madden in Co Roscommon and Deirdre Lally in Co Wicklow asked us to look into their claims, and assess the safety of the HPV vaccine, so we did. (Remember, if you see a social media campaign you’re not sure about, email factcheck@thejournal.ie or tweet @TJ_FactCheck). Claim: The side effects of the HPV vaccine outweigh the benefits Verdict: FALSE (by a very wide margin) Repeated studies and clinical trials have shown HPV vaccines like Gardasil to be very effective in preventing the virus which leads to most cervical cancers Repeated studies and clinical trials have shown HPV vaccines to be very safe, and potential allergic reactions and possible side effects to be extremely rare What little scientific research has been done contradicting this overwhelming consensus, has consistently been shown to be flawed and unreliable There is no evidence to show that the illnesses highlighted by the group Regret were caused by the HPV vaccine THE FACTS Source: Associated Press The Basics HPV stands for Human Papillomavirus, which is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections, with almost all men and women contracting it at some point in their lives. According to the HSE, 80% of women contract HPV, usually in their late teens or 20s. In most cases, the virus clears on its own and does not have any symptoms, but in some cases, it can lead to genital warts. In women, HPV can cause changes in the cervix (the lower part of the uterus, or womb) which can lead to cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine used in the school programme is called Gardasil, and protects against four out of 170 types of the virus: numbers 6, 11, 16, 18. However, 16 and 18 alone are responsible for 70% of cervical cancers, as well as 75-80% of anal cancers, according to the manufacturer’s package leaflet and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. This fact wasn’t taken into account in the misleading claim made by Regret this week, that: The HPV vaccine will not save any lives on its own merit, as it only protects against 4 strains out of more than 100 HPV infections. The fact is that two of those four strains account for 70% of cervical cancers, and an immunisation against them therefore necessarily prevents some cervical cancer development, and therefore saves lives. The rate of cervical cancer among women in Ireland is one in 115 (0.87%), according to the latest figures (for 2013). In Irish schools, the HSE began administering a program of HPV vaccination for free in May 2010, in schools and in clinics, to girls in first year of secondary school, and later began a “catch-up” programme for sixth years. This previously involved three injections separated by six months each, but since the 2014/2015 academic year, has been decreased to two injections, six months apart. Parents and guardians are given this HSE information booklet, and asked to sign a consent form, before the vaccine can be administered. In the 2014/2015 academic year, 55,121 vaccine doses were administered. Gardasil is manufactured by Merck and was authorised by the Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in September 2006, after being licensed by the European Medicines Agency. The other HPV vaccine licensed in Ireland is Cervarix, which is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. Both are “prophylactic” medicines, which means they prevent HPV for a number of years after being administered, but do not cure it in existing cases. Effectiveness of the HPV vaccine There is an exceptionally large volume of scientific research on the efficacy of HPV vaccines, which include Gardasil. A good place to start is this World Health Organisation (WHO) review of studies, which reported the vaccines had an efficacy rate of between 90% and 100% in preventing HPV infection. A 2011 meta-analysis evaluated the results of seven separate randomised control tests, and found – for various groups of women over various time periods – the efficacy rate of the vaccines was 96%, 90%, 53%, 84%, 94%, 95%, 85%, 76%. A 2014 meta-analysis evaluated the results of 15 previous scientific studies – 10 randomised control tests and five observational studies. It found the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing HPV 16 and 18 (the two most serious strains) ranged from 83% to 94%. Another 2014 meta-analysis, on the long-term effectiveness of Gardasil, found that in one study of more than 1,000 vaccinated boys and girls aged 9-15, there wasn’t a single HPV infection up to nine years later. And in another study where women aged 16-23 were vaccinated, there wasn’t a single HPV infection five and nine years later. Finally, the original clinical trials which were the basis for Gardasil being licensed, found the vaccine was effective in 88.7% of cases (page 12/13, here). Safety of the HPV vaccine Source: Associated Press Ireland From 2010/2011 to 2014/2015, some 590,694 doses have been administered to first and sixth-year female secondary school students in Ireland, according to FactCheck’s analysis of data collected by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). The total number of girls who took the full set of Gardasil doses available was 201,410. Between 2010 and 2015, a total of 948 “adverse reactions” to Gardasil were reported to the HPRA. Adverse reactions are, essentially, negative symptoms perceived to be side effects from a drug. According to a parliamentary question response by then Health Minister Leo Varadkar, in January: The vast majority of reports received have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects associated with use of Gardasil, as described in the product information. These include reactions associated with the administering of the vaccine itself (an injection) like fainting, dizziness, headaches, skin rashes, but also include: Chronic fatigue, nausea, swollen joints, gastrointestinal problems, drowsiness, menstrual disorders. 958 reports of negative reactions (of varying degrees of severity) out of 590,694 doses constitutes 0.16%. If we plot those figures on a chart, the number of adverse reports is actually invisible compared to the scale of the doses administered. And it’s important to note that these are simply reports of adverse reactions – they do not, by any means, constitute proof that the administering of the vaccine was the cause of the symptom. Furthermore, some of the 108 adverse reports in 2015 would have related to the 2015/2016 vaccination programme, which is not included in the number of doses. Europe In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency published the results of a major review of the safety of HPV vaccines including Gardasil and Cervarix, examining an alleged link to two conditions. They were: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a chronic pain syndrome which affects limbs; and POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), which involves rapid heart rate increases on sitting or standing up, along with fatigue, dizziness and other symptoms. The largescale EMA review concluded that there was no causal relationship between the HPV vaccines and the two conditions, and that, essentially, the prevalence of those two conditions was no greater among those treated with the vaccines, than among the general population. It recommended no change to the licensing terms or product information requirements of Gardasil and Cervarix. Package information The manufacturer’s leaflet, which is reviewed by the HPRA, states the following possible side effects of Gardasil: Very common (more than 10% of patients) – Pain, swelling, redness at the injection site, headaches Common (more than 1%) – Bruising, itchiness at the injection site, fever and nausea Rare (less than 0.1%) – Hives Very rare (less than 0.01%) – Wheezing, difficulty breathing Scientific research Source: Associated Press Once again, very many scientific studies and reviews have been conducted on this, and have found HPV vaccines like Gardasil to be extremely safe. One of the 2014 meta-analyses mentioned above evaluated a 2013 study of almost one million 10-17 year-old girls in Denmark and Sweden. It found no difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated girls in the rate of what have been claimed to be serious adverse effects – various autoimmune and neurological conditions, as well as venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis. Another study from 2014 analysed 42 completed or ongoing clinical trials of Cervarix and found that the rates of symptoms were almost identical between vaccinated and control groups. In fact, the rates of “medically significant conditions” and “serious adverse events” were slightly lower among the vaccinated groups, not that any particular conclusion should be drawn from that. This summary of nine separate studies involves research into possible associations between HPV vaccines and a wide range of conditions and symptoms, including serious ones like stroke, appendicitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune disorder that causes weakness and even paralysis, and has been claimed to be caused by HPV vaccination. In almost all cases, the research found no difference between vaccinated and control groups in the prevalence of the conditions, with the exception of temporary problems like fainting and skin irritation. In one case, a lower “odds ratio” (essentially a lower risk) of multiple sclerosis was observed among the vaccinated group. In the case of Guillain-Barré syndrome, the rate of reported cases was 0.2 per 100,000 doses of Gardasil. That’s one in half a million, or 0.0002%. And that rate was no higher than is typical of other vaccines. Yet another 2011 systematic review of existing research concluded that the prevalence of serious adverse events was not different between vaccinated and control groups. And finally, another 2011 systematic review found the same results. Regret’s evidence Source: Associated Press FactCheck asked the group Regret to provide evidence to support the contention that the HPV vaccine caused the health problems suffered by the 400 young women it represents, and that the HPV vaccine is not safe. A spokesperson for the group confirmed it was their view that “on balance, the risks of taking the HPV vaccine outweigh the benefits”. On the question of a cause-and-effect relationship, the group told us: We question the safety of the vaccine, but without the appropriate independent investigative tools, we cannot establish the causation link [sic]. They did not provide any evidence showing that Gardasil caused the health problems observed among the girls in question. On the wider question of the safety of Gardasil in general, Regret directed us to articles reporting decreasing uptake of the vaccine in various jurisdictions, and criticism of it, but only one scientific study. The fact that uptake of the vaccine is decreasing in a small number of countries, or that its safety has been questioned, does not, of course, constitute evidence that it is not safe. And in reality, the Canadian study highlighted by Regret does not give any support to their contention – quite the opposite. Its authors even expressly stated that the rate of side effects following HPV vaccination was “low”. The research, published in April, tracked the rate of AEFI (adverse events following immunisation), as well as hospitalisation and emergency department admissions within 42 days of vaccination, among women and girls aged nine and older in the Canadian province of Alberta, between 2006 and 2014. In 99.2% of cases, the HPV vaccine administered was Gardasil. The study found: Out of 528,913 doses of a HPV vaccine, 198 adverse events (side effects) were reported. That’s 0.04% Out of 195,270 girls and women vaccinated, 192 reported adverse events. That’s 0.1% Of those 192, four reported an adverse event serious enough to warrant hospitalisation within 42 days Therefore, four out of 195,270 vaccinated individuals experienced a serious side effect following vaccination. That’s 0.002% Of the 198 adverse events reported, the outcome was known for 171. All 171 ended in full recovery Of the 195,270 patients vaccinated, 958 (0.49%) visited the hospital within 42 days – 35.3% within two weeks, and 64.7% after two weeks Only four of these had reported a side effect from the vaccination Of the 195,270 patients vaccinated, 19,351 visited the emergency department (ED) within 42 days. That’s 9.9% Regret presented the fact that almost 10% of those vaccinated visited the ED within 42 days as evidence supporting the risks of the HPV vaccine. But this ignores the fact that only 0.002% of those vaccinated reported a serious side effect (one warranting a trip to the hospital). In other words, those hospital and emergency department visits were not linked to the vaccination, not even in the minds of the women and girls themselves. The “Research” page of the group’s website contains mostly op-ed articles, speeches or interviews criticising the vaccines, but among the more substantive items listed are: An article which claims clinical trials of Gardasil and Gardasil 9 showed a rate of serious side effects of 2.5% and 2.3%. On even cursory examination, this is very misleading. In reality, between one month and four years after vaccination, only four out of 15,705 individuals had a side effect that was determined to be vaccine-related. That’s 0.03%. Once again, vaccinated people getting sick in the normal course of events (including up to four years after vaccination) is falsely being presented as caused by vaccination. A Danish study which described a pattern of “autonomic dysfunction” (problems with breathing, heartrate and digestion) among 53 vaccinated patients. It noted that it could not confirm or dismiss a causal link with the vaccine, but called for further research. However, the consistency of the symptoms observed is surely due to the fact that: This was a retrospective analysis based on 75 patients consecutively referred to the Syncope [Fainting] Unit from May 2011 to December 2014 for a head-up tilt test due to  orthostatic intolerance and symptoms compatible with autonomic dysfunction as suspected side effect following vaccination with the Q-HPV vaccine. In other words, the study found a strong pattern of autonomic dysfunction among a few dozen patients who were referred to a specialised unit, with symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. Which is hardly shocking. A 2012 study which concluded that certain HPV vaccines “pose an inherent risk for triggering potentially fatal autoimmune vasculopathies [blood vessel disease]“. That alarming conclusion was based on autopsy analysis and tissue samples taken from the brains of two young women (19 and 14), who had died six months and two weeks after HPV vaccination. The study was so alarming that the US government’s Centers for Disease Control (CDC) established a working group to examine it. In a public response, they found several serious flaws: The authors’ diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis (blood vessel inflammation in the brain) was invalid The way they tested for the presence of vaccine-related proteins lacked proper controls and was “questionable” The authors did not use the right equipment to properly identify vaccine particles, and did not use control samples, so the relevance of what they did find “cannot be determined” They did not present enough information to be able to examine possible alternative causes of death. And for the record, out of the many millions of HPV vaccine doses administered in the US over the years, the CDC working group found one report of cerebral vasculitis (the disease the article claims is caused by the vaccine), 45 days after a vaccination. And that was in a woman who already had immune system difficulties and several medical problems to begin with. In the medical literature, they found two cases of vasculitis after vaccination (neither of them in the brain, which is the focus of this study), and both of them attributed to a blood vessel disorder called Henoch-Schonlein Purpura. Conclusion A very large number of clinical trials and scientific studies, some outlined above, have proven HPV vaccines, including Gardasil, to be highly effective in preventing the virus that causes 70% of cervical cancer These trials and studies have also proven HPV vaccines, including Gardasil, to be very safe, with extremely low rates of serious possible side effects What little scientific research has been done contradicting this overwhelming consensus, has consistently been shown to be flawed and unreliable There is no evidence whatsoever that HPV vaccination caused the health difficulties observed among the 400 young women represented by the group Regret The claim that “On balance, the risks of taking the HPV vaccine outweigh the benefits” is FALSE by a very wide margin. In fact, the evidence is unequivocal. Send your FactCheck requests to factcheck@thejournal.ie Update: This article has been updated to include the fact that the cervical cancer rate among women in Ireland is one in 115, according to the latest figures (2013).

After obtaining final approval in Europe in May, Boston-based powerhouse Biogen took charge of selling the medicine under the brand name Flixabi. "The U.K. is not the first European country where SB2 commercially debuted. It also went on sales in other places in Europe," a Samsung official said. But she refused to disclose details. Janssen's Remicade has been a blockbuster as the U.S. company had a turnover of $4.5 billion in the United States and $9.9 billion in total last year from the autoimmune disorder drug. Earlier this year, Samsung Bioepis applied for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell SB2 in the world's largest pharmaceutical market in an alliance with Merck. Celltrion might not be happy with the news as the cross-city rival of Samsung Bioepis is also betting its future on Remsima, its own biosimilar version of Remicade. Celltrion, the largest-capitalized corporation in Korea's tech-heavy KOSDAQ, introduced Remsima in Europe in 2013 and now has a 30 percent market share. The firm is seeking to raise this to more than 40 percent in the near future and is poised to market the drug in the U.S. in partnership with Pfizer after getting FDA approval in April. It sent the first batch of the drugs to the U.S. last month. Considering its potential, many global players have invested in the company. Some major investors are Singapore's sovereign wealth fund Temasek and One Equity Partners, an internal fund at JP Morgan. Samsung Bioepis also gained regulatory approval for another biosimilar medicine called SB4 in Europe in January and commercialized it under the trade name Benepali. It copies Enbrel from U.S. pharmaceutical company Amgen, and treats rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis. Samsung Bioepis was set up in 2012 as a joint venture between Samsung BioLogics and Biogen. The firm is responsible for developing and producing products as well as global clinical trials and regulatory registration. Marketing, distribution and sales are carried out by Biogen and Merck, with whom Samsung Bioepis signed commercialization deals. Merck is known as MSD in Korea. Samsung Group has shelled out big bucks on Samsung BioLogics as Korea's No. 1 conglomerate regards the bio segment as one of its main next-generation growth engines. voc200@koreatimes.co.kr 'Lohengrin' resonates with Korea's pol...

Politicians will bravely vote to legalize it because they care about freedom and public safety. Hahahahahahaha. Sorry. Sorry. Only joking. The real reason marijuana will be legal is money. The pot dispensaries in Colorado and Washington are raking in cash. As soon as they are allowed to accept credit cards and deposit their revenue in banks like other stores, they will make a lot more money. Soon, the best weed stores will be bought out by corporations. And those corporations will pay off legislators on the state and national level to legalize marijuana. Then it will only be a matter of time before you see Woody Harrelson selling “Woody’s Wacky Tobacky” on a commercial during the Super Bowl Halftime Show. If you’re thinking that it’s a bad idea to let corporations sell drugs using TV ads, you’re right. And documentarian Chris Bell, director of “Prescription Thugs”, definitely agrees with you. Chris Bell sites 1983 as the year everything went downhill for the American pharmaceutical industry. That was the year that Washington decided to allow drug commercials for the first time. The FDA and Congress were flooded with letters from concerned citizens urging them not to let drug companies become heartless profiteers like other corporations. These letters were from the CEOs of the drug companies themselves. A generation later, all of the CEOs’ worst fears have come true. While most of us say “no” illegal drugs, the majority of us say “yes, please” to the legal ones. Before I wrote this paragraph, I walked to the kitchen to take my three morning pills. Seriously. Of every 100 pills produced on planet earth, 75 are consumed by Americans. The greatest drug kingpins in the world aren’t escaping Mexican prison, they are leading Dow 30 companies. “Prescription Thugs” observes that big pharma promises quick fixes to all of mankind’s problems and then makes sure that there are free samples at your doctor’s office to get you hooked. Feeling sad? Take a pill. High cholesterol? Take a pill. The film argues that statin drugs are bogus and don’t save lives. A former big pharma rep says that the most notable thing that Pfizer’s top selling pill Lipitor does is make male patients less potent. Conveniently, Pfizer’s second best-selling pill is Viagra. Another reason there are so many new legal drugs on the market is that the FDA screening process has become a joke. All a company has to do is present two studies in which its new drug has the intended effects. If there are 56 competing studies in which the drug didn’t work or had horrific side effects, Merck can just sweep those under the rug. And don’t expect the system to be reformed any time soon. Big pharma spends $130,000,000 on Washington lobbying annually. That’s a quarter of a million dollars per congressman. Chris Bell (“Bigger Stronger Faster”) is my favorite documentarian. He is reasonable, unideological, and non-judgmental. Even though he reveals that he is addicted to prescription drugs and his older brother dies from an overdose during the movie, Bell never points fingers or shirks his own personal responsibility. I agree with “Prescription Thugs”. There are too many pills in this country right now. And there is plenty of blame to go around and no easy answer. Getting all of those drug ads off television would be a darn good start, though. QR Code – Take this post Mobile! Use this unique QR (Quick Response) code with your smart device.

Malignancies News provided by Xencor, Inc. Sep 12, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article MONROVIA, Calif., Sept. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ: XNCR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial of XmAb®14045 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other CD123-expressing hematologic malignancies. "XmAb14045 is a bispecific antibody that engages the immune system against AML," said Paul Foster, M.D., chief medical officer at Xencor. "Built on the scaffold of Xencor's XmAb bispecific Fc domain, XmAb14045 simultaneously binds to CD123, a protein on AML cells, and CD3, a protein on cytotoxic T cells, to activate a targeted immune response against the cancer cells. XmAb14045 has shown highly potent killing of tumor cells in preclinical studies and we look forward to studying its safety, tolerability and antitumor activity in clinical trials." The purpose of the trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of weekly intravenous administration of XmAb14045 and to determine the maximally tolerated dose/dosing schedule. Approximately 60 patients with AML or other CD123-expressing hematologic malignancies will receive XmAb14045. XmAb14045 showed very effective and potent depletion of target cells in primate studies from a well-tolerated single IV dose. XmAb14045 is Xencor's lead bispecific candidate within the company's broad portfolio of CD3 bispecific antibody immunotherapies. Xencor and Novartis share worldwide development costs for XmAb14045 with Xencor maintaining U.S. commercial rights and Novartis having commercial rights in the rest of the world. Xencor expects to advance additional candidates using Xencor's XmAb bispecific technology into the clinic by the end of 2017. For more information about the XmAb14045 clinical trial please visit to www.clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT02730312).  About XmAb®14045 XmAb14045 is a tumor-targeted antibody that contains both a CD123 binding domain and a cytotoxic T-cell binding domain (CD3) in Phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other CD123-expressing hematologic malignancies. An XmAb Bispecific Fc domain serves as the scaffold for these two antigen binding domains and confers long circulating half-life, stability and ease of manufacture on XmAb14045. CD123 is highly expressed on AML cells and leukemic stem cells, and is associated with poorer prognosis in AML patients.  Engagement of CD3 by XmAb14045 activates T cells for highly potent and targeted killing of CD123-expressing tumor cells. About Xencor's XmAb® Bispecific Technology As opposed to traditional monoclonal antibodies that target and bind to a single antigen, bispecific antibodies are designed to elicit multiple biological effects that require simultaneous binding to two different antigen targets. Xencor's XmAb bispecific Fc domain technology is designed to maintain full-length antibody properties in a bispecific antibody, potentially enabling favorable in vivo half-life and simplified manufacturing. Efforts at bispecific antibody design are typically frustrated by poor molecular stability, difficulties in production and short in vivo half-life. Xencor has engineered a series of Fc domain variants that spontaneously form stable, heterodimeric bispecific antibodies and that can be made and purified with standard antibody production methods. These bispecific Fc domains are used to generate a broad array of novel drug candidates in a range of molecule formats. Xencor's initial bispecific programs are T-cell engaging cancer immunotherapies that bind to cancer cells at one end and bind to cytotoxic T-cells at the other end, resulting in a highly potent and targeted killing of cancer cells. The XmAb Fc domain format allows Xencor to tune the potency of the T-cell killing, potentially improving the tolerability of cancer immunotherapy.  About Acute Myeloid Leukemia Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blood cells that interfere with production of normal cells. It is estimated 20,000 patients in the United States will be diagnosed with AML each year. Without treatment AML can progress quickly and become fatal. For more information, please visit www.cancer.org. About Xencor, Inc. Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer. Currently, 10 candidates engineered with Xencor's XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners. Xencor's internal programs include: XmAb5871 in Phase 2 development for the treatment of IgG4-Related Disease, and also for the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; XmAb7195 in Phase 1 development for the treatment of asthma and allergic diseases; XmAb14045 in Phase 1 development for acute myeloid leukemia; and XmAb13676 for B-cell malignancies and XmAb18087 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors, both in pre-clinical development. Xencor's XmAb antibody engineering technology enables small changes to the structure of monoclonal antibodies resulting in new mechanisms of therapeutic action.  Xencor partners include Novartis, Amgen, MorphoSys, Merck, CSL/Janssen, Alexion, Novo Nordisk and Boehringer Ingelheim.

The company will pay an initial 180 million pounds to Glaxo and disburse as much as 100 million pounds if certain goals are met, the Durban, South Africa-based drugmaker said in a statement on Monday. The deal adds to the anaesthetics Aspen bought in June from AstraZeneca of the UK for as much as $770 million. An Aspen warehouse. File picture: Supplied. Credit: INDEPENDENT MEDIA “Aspen has identified anaesthetics as a key element of its expansion strategy,” the company said. “The addition of the portfolio will serve to further establish Aspen as a major role player in anaesthetics globally.” The deal is the second since Aspen said in June it had secured 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in funding, attracting support from 27 banks. The acquisitive company has spent more than $2 billion on assets from drugmakers including Glaxo and Merck & Company in recent years to boost its portfolio of medicines and manufacturing sites, and now sells medicines in more than 150 countries. The shares declined 1.4 percent to 324.25 rand as of 10.16am in Johannesburg, valuing the company at R148 billion ($10.2 billion). The stock is down more than 10 percent since the company announced on Wednesday that the impact of selling pharmaceutical assets and a one-time currency-related loss in Venezuela would weigh on earnings. Aspen also will buy rights from Glaxo to sell two drugs in additional countries, including China, for 45 million pounds. Aspen had previously bought the rights to sell the medicines, Fraxiparine and Arixtra, in other markets. The two companies agreed to cancel a partnership in sub-Saharan Africa, for which Aspen will receive 45 million pounds from the London-based company. * For more developments around this story, check out the print edition of Business Report on Tuesday.

Big Pharma Marketers Try Terror Tactics to Scare Up Sales By Adrianne Pasquarelli. Published on September 12, 2016. Reprints Reprints Grandma is a wolf in an ad for a whooping cough vaccine. Credit: iSpot Grandma as a menacing wolf. Parents whose carelessness leads to cancer in their kids. A teenager hospitalized after sharing a seemingly innocent kiss. Halloween may still be over a month away, but Big Pharma is already out to scare consumers. In recent months, several fear-instilling, often ominous commercials for medical devices, products and vaccines from drugmakers including Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and Mylan are airing in fairly heavy rotation. In GSK's spot for whooping cough vaccine Boostrix, a sick grandmother is portrayed as a wolf holding a human infant. In Pfizer's ad for Trumenba, a meningitis B vaccine, scenes in reverse order show how a boy celebrating at a birthday party ended up prone and pale in a hospital bed after his mom mistakenly thought he just had the flu. "If you increase an individual's feeling that they're susceptible to a threat, and increase the perceived severity of that threat, people are more likely to take action," said Adrienne Faerber, a lecturer at the Dartmouth Institute. "What are these advertisements but trying to get people to take action on things they probably aren't thinking about." Then there's Mylan's EpiPen. In an unsettling commercial for the auto-injector, a young partygoer suffers an extreme anaphylactic reaction, terrifying those around her. Mylan, of course, has come under fire for gouging after pushing up the price of an EpiPen two-pack by more than 550% to $600 since 2007. And that, said John Mack, who runs electronic newsletter Pharma Marketing News, is no coincidence. He said that "a trend with companies, especially ones with injectable drugs and vaccines, which also have big price increases, is to scare people into buying their product or getting their vaccine." Related Stories Pharmaceutical Marketers Need to Take a Chill Pill Mylan Plans Generic EpiPen to Quell Media Storm Over $600 Cost Sarah Jessica Parker Quits EpiPen Campaign EpiPen Maker Mylan Is Airing Fewer Commercials for Its Pricey Product It seems that as product prices increase, so does industry spending on advertising. Last year, prescription drug companies spent $5.8 billion on measured media in the U.S., a 23% increase over 2014, according to Ad Age's Datacenter. That's more than the insurance category, which spent $5.2 billion. Many of pharma's ads target aging baby boomers, who represent a substantial bulk of healthcare's customer base, and prey on their fear, for example, of not being able to spend quality time with their grandchildren. "Baby boomers are almost 80 million strong, but are getting to the point where the population can only live so long—the run for the healthcare industry is going to start waning, so [drugmakers are] taking advantage," said Bethany Bayer, VP-group director of strategy for the Boston healthcare strategy practice of Digitas. But she cautioned that she tells her clients to take a more humane approach in their marketing. "No patient wants to think of themselves that way." Fearmongering was not always the go-to strategy. In the years following the Food and Drug Administration's late-'90s relaxation of direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising on TV, medical ads were often more cheerful, upbeat and positive, experts said. But recent years have seen a darker turn as product prices have risen and consumers have become more cynical of profiteering brands. "This has been a gradual evolution," said George Sillup, chair and associate professor of pharmaceutical and healthcare marketing at Saint Joseph's University. "If we looked at ads over the last year compared with ads three to five years ago, they used to be more scientific—now they're about convince and persuade." To avoid having to dedicate valuable screen time to side effects to comply with FDA regulations, many brands have omitted product names from their ads. Mylan's EpiPen spot doesn't reference the device itself, but instead directs consumers to an informational website. Dartmouth's Ms. Faerber noted that the strategy could appeal to brands that have the market cornered on products. EpiPen is one of only two such products for anaphylactic shock and is considered the better alternative, for example. "It's a way to build market share through making people more aware of a disease rather than promoting the product itself," said Ms. Faerber. Some drug companies say that boldness is necessary to get their points across and to educate consumers. Merck is running a commercial for HPV vaccine Gardasil in which children ask their parents if they knew they were at risk of getting cancer. "This campaign is designed to help parents become aware of the potential risk of HPV-related cancers for their children later in life," said a spokeswoman at Merck. She cited a recent internal study in which many parents were unaware of the link between HPV and certain cancers. Similarly, a GSK spokeswoman said its wolf ad helped to motivate consumers. "This campaign tested well among grandparents and motivated them to talk to their healthcare provider about vaccination," she said, noting that more traditional imagery was not as memorable. She said the wolf in the ad is symbolic of hidden dangers, like in "Little Red Riding Hood," and that the company did not use real wolves, but computer-generated imagery. Yet even if a campaign is effective at grabbing attention and triggering action, experts caution that fear appeal will only work up to a point. Tim Hawkey, managing director and exec creative director at Area 23, an FCB Health company, noted that previous antismoking ads aimed at teenagers failed with their use of scare tactics. Consumers simply couldn't process that they could be personally susceptible to the risk. Mr. Hawkey said that brands need to make sure they don't cross a line into too extreme territory, showing a tombstone rather than a hospital bed, for instance. "Fear can be motivating until it's demotivating," he said. "There's a threshold at which we turn off and say, 'That's not me, that's someone else—my brain can't handle this level of risk and information.'"

The company will pay an initial 180 million pounds to Glaxo and disburse as much as 100 million pounds if certain goals are met, the Durban, South Africa-based drugmaker said in a statement on Monday. The deal adds to the anesthetics Aspen bought in June from AstraZeneca Plc of the U.K. for as much as $770 million. “Aspen has identified anesthetics as a key element of its expansion strategy,” the company said. “The addition of the portfolio will serve to further establish Aspen as a major role player in anesthetics globally.” The deal is the second since Aspen said in June it had secured 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in funding, attracting support from 27 banks. The acquisitive company has spent more than $2 billion on assets from drugmakers including Glaxo and Merck & Co. in recent years to boost its portfolio of medicines and manufacturing sites, and now sells medicines in more than 150 countries. The shares declined 1.4 percent to 324.25 rand as of 10:16 a.m. in Johannesburg, valuing the company at 148 billion rand ($10.2 billion). The stock is down more than 10 percent since the company announced on Wednesday that the impact of selling pharmaceutical assets and a one-time currency-related loss in Venezuela would weigh on earnings. Aspen also will buy rights from Glaxo to sell two drugs in additional countries, including China, for 45 million pounds. Aspen had previously bought the rights to sell the medicines, Fraxiparine and Arixtra, in other markets. The two companies agreed to cancel a partnership in sub-Saharan Africa, for which Aspen will receive 45 million pounds from the London-based company. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.
