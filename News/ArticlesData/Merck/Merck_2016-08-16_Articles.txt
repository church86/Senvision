Thousands of cattle producers will gather in Indianapolis, Ind., Nov. 5-7 for the event. Among the convention’s most popular sessions is Angus University, sponsored by Merck Animal Health. “Angus University has been a centerpiece of the American Angus Association’s annual convention for three years, and it is a day of learning and exploration for all areas of the beef business,” says Becky Weishaar, Angus Media’s Creative Media director and lead contact for the convention. “We appreciate Merck’s continued support of Angus University, and look forward to participants engaging in another insightful event.” Angus University begins with keynote speaker Howard Putnam, former CEO for Southwest Airlines. Putnam and his team tripled the revenues and profitability in three years at Southwest Airlines, and the company’s culture and policy became a game-changer for the airline industry, casting traditional models out the window. He has published a book titled The Winds of Turbulence, and will share his insights into business and thinking creatively. Putnam grew up on a farm in Iowa, where he learned to fly in a pasture. More than 20 afternoon sessions offer participants a chance to focus on specific management disciplines and learn how they can improve their operations with quality in mind. Topics include: asset protection, business growth, genetic evaluation, marketing, economics, commercial cattle production, herd health and live cattle demonstrations. Registration for the 2016 Angus Convention is available online, and for the best value, register before Aug. 31 for full-access to convention activities, education, entertainment and meals for only $75 per person.

Despite glut of vehicles, MSD wants more Dan Horn , dhorn@enquirer.com 11:05 p.m. EDT August 16, 2016 Buy Photo Melvin Lawson drives a flush vac truck, the largest vehicle in the Metropolitan Sewer District fleet from the agency's Carthage location. (Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy)Buy Photo Eight months after deciding it might own too many trucks and vans, the Metropolitan Sewer District wants to buy more trucks and vans. The agency in charge of building and maintaining Hamilton County’s sewers is seeking $1.4 million next year for new dump trucks, vans, pickups and other vehicles. Big utilities like MSD buy new vehicles all the time, usually to replace older ones worn out from years of traveling to work sites. But this request is raising eyebrows among the county officials who set MSD’s budget because it comes so soon after the agency concluded it wasn’t using the vehicles it already has as often as it should. An internal review of MSD’s fleet in January found more than 40 percent of its 272 vehicles didn’t meet the city of Cincinnati’s standards for minimum mileage or hours of use. “It is clear that some changes are necessary to ‘right-size’ MSD’s inventory of vehicles/equipment and increase utilization … to an acceptable level,” MSD Director Gerald Checco wrote in the January report. Despite that declaration, Checco said the agency is asking for additional vehicles this year as replacements for old ones that are becoming too costly to maintain and wouldn't easily be swapped out for similar, under-used vehicles already in MSD's inventory. County officials are unconvinced. They say MSD will have to make a stronger case if it wants to spend more money to buy and maintain new vehicles with money from the thousands of homeowners and businesses that pay sewer bills in Hamilton County. "This is money that's coming out of ratepayers' pockets," said County Commissioner Chris Monzel. Wish list: Dump trucks, vans, pickups and more Buy Photo  (Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy) The list of under-used vehicles includes cars and small pickup trucks that MSD employees drive to work sites and meetings, as well as utility vehicles and dump trucks used for major repairs and construction. Smaller vehicles range in price from about $18,000 to $30,000, while dump trucks can run more than $120,000. Checco said he knows MSD’s vehicles can be better used and he’s working on the problem. He recently set up vehicle pools around the county to give more workers access to trucks, cars and other vehicles. A van once designated for engineers, for example, now might also be used by administrators, or vice versa. Checco also is setting up a tracking system to better monitor the use of vehicles and is encouraging more employees to use MSD cars on the job instead of their own, which could also reduce liability. “Instead of having a bunch of cars used maybe 30 percent of the time, you have them used more,” Checco said. “We will see a better utilization of the vehicles.” That’s all well and good, county officials say, but why is MSD asking for more vehicles now? The budget request for 2017 seeks two new dump trucks, five vans, four pickup trucks and more. The fleet review found that MSD already has eight under-used dump trucks, 22 under-used vans and 13 under-used pickup trucks. CINCINNATI.COM MSD official confirms contract threat “Shouldn’t we be optimizing the use of these vehicles?” said Dave Meyer, the county’s director of utility oversight. “There’s a lot of dump trucks that don’t have many miles on them. Why couldn’t we use them?” Meyer said he first became concerned about MSD’s fleet more than a year ago when he looked out his office window at the sewer district’s headquarters and saw cars and trucks sitting in a parking lot. Over the course of weeks, he said, some of those vehicles didn’t seem to move very often. “I thought, ‘Wow, I wonder how many vehicles aren’t being used,” Meyer said. He started asking questions and last year challenged MSD officials about the need for more cars and trucks. As a result, county officials stripped vehicle requests from last year’s budget. Putting new requests "under a microscope" When Checco took over the top job at MSD last year, he did a deeper dive into the problem and produced the vehicle utilization report. Checco, who has worked for the city for years and has a reputation as a detail-oriented administrator, did a similar study years ago of the city’s entire fleet. He said the new vehicle policies MSD has adopted should help him figure out within the next six months or so how many vehicles the agency really needs. Already, he said, about 10 vehicles have been taken out of service and will likely be sold. “Do we have the proper amount? Right now, we don’t know,” Checco said. He said some of the vehicles MSD wants to replace cost thousands of dollars a year in repairs and, in some cases, are more than a decade old. According to the budget request, the vans that would be replaced have an average mileage of 61,900 and the pickup trucks have an average of 68,300. All were purchased in 2004. Meyer said it might be cheaper for MSD to rent some vehicles on an as-needed basis until it figures out what it needs and what it can do without. He said continuing the freeze on buying new vehicles for another year might not be a bad idea. County commissioners will make the call on the request when they consider the budget proposal this fall. Like Monzel, commissioners Dennis Deters and Todd Portune said they are wary of buying more vehicles for MSD. “I think any request for vehicles would come under a microscope,” said Portune, who hasn’t seen the request yet. “Without knowing more, this would be a tough sell.” If a dispute arises over the vehicles, it would be one of many to pop up in recent years between the city, which operates MSD, and the county, which oversees its budget. Those disagreements grew more intense this year after a series of Enquirer articles exposed questionable spending practices and a lack of oversight at the sewer district. The two governments have feuded all year over how best to run the agency and are mired in a federal court fight over who gets final say over spending. The arrangement that paired the city and county expires in 2018 and both sides are trying to plan for what comes next. Talks are continuing in federal court, but neither side will discuss them. ..... About MSD: Serves 43 out of 49 Hamilton County political subdivisions, plus three adjacent portions of Butler, Clermont and Warren counties. Ratepayer base includes about 230,000 residential and commercial users. MSD provides sewage collection and treatment services to a little more than 290 square miles, containing more than 200,000 separate sewer connections that tie in to about 3,000 miles of sanitary and combined sewers. 32 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2bpQscn TOP VIDEOS Who is Nikki Haley? 1:30 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 La Salle wins regional championship 0:55 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Joe Deters: \u0022I didn't believe the tears for a second\u0022 2:47 Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29

DiStefano Arrow icon Merck, the New Jersey-based drugmaker, says it will end 148 sales and management jobs at its North Wales, Montgomery County plant by Sept. 10 as it stops offering Zontivity, a blood circulation medicine.  See the company's brief state WARN layoff notice here. Merck is cutting the workers, some of whom are based in the field and are not regularly in the office, after making "the business decision to cease promotion of Zontivity (vorapaxar) in the U.S., effective September 2, 2016," spokeswoman Lainie Keller said in an e-mail. Merck isn't saying the stuff doesn't work or isn't safe, Keller added. Earlier this summer, Merck told workers it was shifting around 300 jobs from North Wales and two sites in North Jersey, as it concentrates biomedical jobs in Cambridge, Mass., where that state is giving money to biotech companies in hopes of increasing local employment in the college (MIT, Harvard) and former factory town. Keller said the latest North Wales cuts are "separate and distinct" from the cuts local workers were told about earlier this summer, which target Merck Research Laboratories' pre-clinical and early development area in "emerging external science and technology." While cutting research jobs in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Merck is "increasing our investment in exploratory biology in areas where biomedical research is converging, specifically in Cambridge, Mass. and the San Francisco Bay area," Keller added. "Unfortunately, those changes will result in workforce reductions at our Kenilworth and Rahway, N.J. sites and our North Wales, Pa. screening facility as we shift resources and personnel." Some Merck staff will be put on the street, while others will get a chance to leave town and move across the country if they want to keep working for Merck.  Merck has previously cut jobs in a series of layoffs in Montgomery County, but the company's public relations office still says it employs around 12,500 in the area, about the same as in previous years.

When Bristol-Myers reported back on August 5 that Opdivo did not meet its targets for treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer, the stock tanked 16 percent. Merck stock, on the other hand spiked 10.4 percent on the news as investors speculated that the company’s rival drug Keytruda could be the big winner. Related Link: Mizuho Upgrades Valeant, Says Financial Engineering Helped Company 'Outfox The Shorts' However, the stock’s performances have continued to mirror each other ever since, as PreMarket Prep’s Dennis Dick pointed out on Twitter. One likely explanation is that a number of traders have been pair trading the stocks ever since the Opdivo news came out. For Now, Bristol-Myers seems to have found some support at the $60 level, but a breakout below $60 would likely push the stock to test the $55-58 level where it found support in late 2015 and early 2016. A Bristol-Myers breakdown could also trigger a breakout in Merck to new highs above $64. Prior to the August 5 news, Bristol-Myers and Merck had traded nearly in tandem throughout all of 2016, delivering 12.3 and 10.2 percent gains, respectively. Bristol-Myers stock is now down 12.8 percent on the year, while Merck is up 19.7 percent.

Login Register Public Release: 16-Aug-2016 Duration of adulthood overweight and obesity linked to cancer risk in US women PLOS Share  Print  E-Mail The duration of overweight and obesity in women's adult lives is associated with cancer risk, according to a longitudinal study published in PLOS Medicine. The study, led by Melina Arnold of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the specialized cancer agency of the WHO, in Lyon, France, and Professor Hoda Anton-Culver at the University of California, Irvine, uses United States Women's Health Initiative (WHI) data to identify dose-response relationships between duration of high body mass index (BMI) and the risk of developing several types of cancer. To date, most studies exploring the relationship between excess weight and cancer risk looked at cross-sectional information on overweight and obesity. Using multiple BMI measurements over time from approximately 74,000 women (with over 6,000 cancers diagnosed during the 12.6-year mean follow-up), Arnold and colleagues examined the association between duration of overweight, obesity and cancer risk, taking into account other factors related to obesity, such as physical activity, diet, smoking, hormone use, and diabetes. They found every ten-year increase in adulthood overweight duration was associated with a 7% (95% confidence interval 6%-9%) increase in the risk of all obesity-related cancers, 5% (3%-7%) increase in risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, and 17% (12%-22%) increase in the risk of developing endometrial cancer. After adjusting for the intensity of overweight, these figures rose to 8% (5%-12%) for postmenopausal breast cancer and 37% (29%-46%) for endometrial cancer. BMI is not an ideal measure for body fat, and the WHI cohort is dominated by non-Hispanic white women. While these aspects of study design limit generalizability of the findings, the large scale of the study and longitudinal BMI data provide compelling evidence that overweight duration is an important risk factor for cancer. The authors state, "[i]f this is true, health care teams should recognize the potential of obesity management in cancer prevention and that excess body weight in women is important to manage regardless of the age of the patient." ### Research Article Funding: The WHI program is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/) US Department of Health and Human Services through contracts HHSN268201100046C, HHSN268201100001C, HHSN268201100002C, HHSN268201100003C, HHSN268201100004C, and HHSN271201100004C. Support for this research (for MA) came from the Department of Epidemiology, School of Medicine and the Genetic Epidemiology Research Institute at the University of California, Irvine. Funding for this study (for MA and IS) was also obtained from the World Cancer Research Fund International(http://www.wcrf.org/), grant number SG 2012/619. MA was supported by a Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) International Cancer Technology Transfer Fellowship (http://www.uicc.org/). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

português suomeksi svenska Fc Protein and Glycoengineered Antibodies Market (2nd Edition), 2016 - 2026 News provided by ReportBuyer Aug 16, 2016, 16:59 ET Share this article LONDON, Aug. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- INTRODUCTION Developed through introduction of modifications in monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody based therapeutics are gaining increased attention from both large and small pharmaceutical companies. The Y-arm of the antibody is known as Fab, comprising a constant and a variable domain from each light and heavy chain. The variable domain (Fv) within the Fab region is responsible for target specificity and binding affinity whereas the base of the antibody, known as the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region, is responsible for interaction with immune cells. Modifications made in the Fc region can alter its effector functions. The key changes made in the Fc domain to improve the effector functions include glycoengineering, protein engineering or isotype chimerism. This can result in improvement in the ADCC activity, CDC activity, ADCP activity and half-life of the molecule. The concept of engineered antibodies is widely being used for development for biobetters/biosimilars, addressing the drawbacks of their ancestor drug candidates. Several players have developed and made available their proprietary technologies for production of such engineered antibodies. This has encouraged and opened an opportunity for a large amount of licensing activity in this domain, building a strong collaborative network of small and big pharmaceutical companies. Currently, two drugs, namely Gazyva® and POTELIGEO®, are commercially available. A number of molecules are being tested primarily for oncological indications; in addition, a limited set of molecules are also being developed for non-oncological indications such as asthma, COPD, neuromyelitis optica, ulcerative colitis and hemolytic disease in the newborn. Such initiatives suggest that the overall market is likely to hold a strong potential in the coming years. SCOPE OF THE REPORT The "Fc Protein and Glycoengineered Antibodies Market (2nd Edition), 2016-2026" report was commissioned to examine the various aspects of engineering an antibody to develop novel drugs for addressing several oncology and non-oncological disorders. This market has steadily evolved over the last few years. The report examines several elements of developing these next generation antibodies, such as the technologies used for their production, site of engineering in an antibody and a robust landscape in the form of clinical / preclinical pipeline. For the purposes of this report, engineered antibodies are defined as antibodies that have been modified in their Fc region. The two types of modification considered include: - Fc Glycoengineering (referred to as 'Glycoengineering' in the report) - Fc Protein engineering As pharmaceutical companies continue to initiate and expand their research programs in this area, one of the key objectives outlined for this report was to understand the future potential of the market. This was done by analyzing: - The Fc protein and glycoengineered antibody pipeline in terms of phase of development, type of therapy (monotherapy or combination therapy) and target indications. - Technologies established by various players for development of engineered antibody therapeutics including the key mechanism involved, licencing activity, advantages and the molecules being developed using the technology. - Partnerships that have taken place in the recent past covering technology licensing, product development and commercialization agreements, clinical trial collaborations, product license agreements, acquisitions and other relevant agreements. - Inherent threats to growth in the short and long term. - The likely adoption of the Fc protein and glycoengineered antibodies by understanding the competition posed by the current treatment plans and the expected growth rate over the coming few years.

Meet the Contributors → As Pfizer Buys, Closes Bind Therapeutics, CEO Hirsch Heads to Agios Ben Fidler August 16th, 2016 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Boston —  The ink is barely dry on Pfizer’s agreement to buy Bind Therapeutics out of bankruptcy and shut it down, but the employee exodus has begun. Andrew Hirsch, who was Cambridge, MA-based Bind’s (NASDAQ: BIND) chief financial officer before taking over for Scott Minick as CEO in 2015, has been named the CFO of another Boston-area biotech, Agios Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: AGIO). Hirsch was Bind’s CFO from 2012 to 2014 and had stints at Avila Therapeutics (acquired by Celgene) and Biogen before that. He comes to Agios, however, after a bad run at Bind that culminated with a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and a $40 million sale at an auction to Pfizer. As Xconomy reported in late July, Pfizer’s plans were to bring Bind’s assets in-house and close down the company. Bind was forced into bankruptcy in May after lender Hercules Technology accelerated a payment due on a loan offered to the company. Bind, a nanotechnology startup that emerged from the labs of MIT’s Robert Langer and Harvard Medical School’s Omid Farokhzad, went public at $15 per share in 2013. But despite partnerships with companies like Amgen, Pfizer, Merck, and AstraZeneca, the company was never able to grow its stock price. Its lead drug, BIND-014, also disappointed in clinical trials. Ben Fidler is Xconomy's Deputy Biotechnology Editor.
