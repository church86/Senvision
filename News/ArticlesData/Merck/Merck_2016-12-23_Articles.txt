REUTERS NAIROBI: There is hope after the unveiling of the Ebola vaccine. The new vaccine whose trials have been done in Guinea has been developed by Merck and Co, a pharmaceutical company. Tests have shown that the vaccine offers protection against Ebola by up to 100 per cent. The vaccine has been accepted for review by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for Emergency Use Assessment and Listing. Dubbed the Ebola Zaire vaccine V920, expectations are that it will offer the much needed cushion against the virus which wreaked havoc last year. According to WHO, over a total of 28,616 Ebola cases were reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,310 deaths were also reported during the 2014-2015 outbreak. Merck's vice president for clinical research, Paula Annunziato said, "This application to the WHO is an important step toward enabling V920 to be used if a public health emergency of international concern were to be declared for the Ebola Zaire species prior to licensure of the vaccine candidate." During the study, 11,000 people were put on trial. Those who received a shot of the vaccine in the final stage of the study did not report any cases of Ebola even an incubation for period of ten days. The study offers a much needed reprieve for the African continent which has suffered the ravages of Ebola outbreak especially West Africa. The study's lead author, Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general for health systems and innovation at WHO, "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless." Before the vaccine is approved for commercial distribution, it will have to be subjected to studies involving data regarding quality, safety; efficacy and effectiveness; as well as a risk and benefit analysis for emergency use. However, 300,000 dosed of the virus is in stock in case of an outbreak again. Initially engineered by scientists from Canada by the Public Health Agency, the V920 was licensed to Newlink genetic Corporation at a time when the Ebola outbreak had hit its peak. NewLink Genetics allowed Merck to further the work of finding whether the vaccine candidate was fit. Clinical trials are going on in USA, Canada, the European Union and Africa. During the last outbreak, Kenya put in place stringent measures of vetting people traveling into the country, thus managing to prevent an outbreak.

(stock image) Credit: © jes2uphoto / Fotolia Close An experimental Ebola vaccine was highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to results published in The Lancet. The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea's Ministry of Health and other international partners. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author. The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called "ring vaccination" approach -- the same method used to eradicate small pox. When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain "contacts of contacts." A total of 117 clusters (or "rings") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine's efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years. In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so-called "herd immunity"). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured" said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects. It was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea. "This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement," said Dr John-Arne Røttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group. In January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure. Additional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called "compassionate use" that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO's partners are working to compile data to support license applications. The rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO's R&D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics.

News Merck Vaccine Shows Promise In Fight Against Deadly Ebola Virus An Ebola vaccine developed by Merck is proving to be effective against the deadly virus. (Merck) BLOOMBERG NEWS 12/23/2016 Reprints An experimental Ebola vaccine manufactured by Merck (MRK) has been found to be highly protective against the deadly virus, showing promise in the fight against future outbreaks after an earlier epidemic killed thousands and highlighted a shortage of weapons to battle the disease. The vaccine was studied in a trial involving more than 11,000 people in Guinea. Of those who received the shot in a final-stage trial, no Ebola cases were recorded after a 10-day incubation period, according to a study published in the medical journal, the Lancet. The outbreak of Ebola from 2013 to 2016 triggered a public health crisis in West Africa, resulting in more than 11,300 deaths, primarily in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. It also exposed holes in global infectious disease preparedness, with infected travelers reaching as far away as Texas. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless," Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general for health systems and innovation at the World Health Organization, and the study's lead author, said in a statement. The trial, called "Ebola ça Suffit" — French for "Ebola that's enough" — was led by the WHO, Guinea's Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres, and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, as well as other international partners. The vaccine is called rVSV-ZEBOV and manufactured by Merck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of the U.S. drugmaker. Merck this year received breakthrough therapy designation for the shot from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which enables faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted, according to the WHO statement. Thursday's findings reconfirmed a July 2015 study that the vaccine would be a potent weapon against future disease spread. The vaccine was initially engineered with support from the Public Health Agency of Canada. It was eventually licensed to Merck, which signed an agreement in January with Gavi, the world's biggest funder of vaccines for developing countries, to submit the experimental Ebola vaccine for regulatory approval by the end of 2017. Gavi, which brings together funds from governments, companies, United Nations agencies and philanthropic groups like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, committed $5 million to the development of the vaccine. In July 2015, a study published in the Lancet medical journal reported that Merck's vaccine was 100% effective when it was tested on more than 4,000 people who were in close contact with Ebola patients in Guinea. During the last outbreak, vaccine makers rushed to ready shots that had never before been tested in humans. The disease spread had unexpectedly spiraled out of control, especially in the first few months, and public health officials initially struggled to curb the infections.

The Ebola vaccine, otherwise known as rVSV-ZEBOV, is currently licensed by Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK). Although not yet approved, the New York Times reported the vaccine is so effective that an emergency stockpile of 300,000 doses has been ordered. In 2014, NewLink Genetics Corp (NASDAQ: NLNK) agreed to a licensing and collaboration with Merck for rVSV-ZEBOV, that provided an upfront payment of $30 million, along with $20 million upon start of rVSV-ZEBOV GP in a trial arm. In addition to these payments, NewLink negotiated for royalties based on Merck's potential commercial sales. The money was useful in helping develop many of the biologic and small-molecule immunotherapy product candidates they provide today. As for how this may affect the company moving forward, NewLink Genetics chief financial officer told Benzinga, “There are no further milestone payments [from Merck] to be had [on rVSV-ZEBOV].” He continued, “The Ebola vaccine is highly unlikely to drive future profit.” Despite this, NewLink's CFO stated that the company is “very proud of their role” as an active participant in bringing the Ebola vaccine into the market with Merck.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV was studied in a trial involving 11, 841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded in 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases in 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organisation (WHO), together with Guinea's Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in collaboration with other international partners. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author. The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11 300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinee, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called "ring vaccination" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox. When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain "contacts of contacts". A total of 117 clusters (or "rings") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a three-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine's efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than six years. In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so called "herd immunity"). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured," said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects. It was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea. "This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement," said Dr John-Arne Røttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group. In January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 3, 00,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure. Additional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called "compassionate use" that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO's partners are working to compile data to support license applications. The rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO's R&D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics. The rVSV-ZEBOV trial is funded by WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust, the UK Government through the Department for International Development; the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health through the Research Council of Norway, the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the International Development Research Centre, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development and Medecins Sans Frontieres. The trial team includes experts from The University of Bern, the University of Florida, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England, the European Mobile Laboratories among others. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy. rVSV-ZEBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials have shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans. Analysis only included cases occurring 10 days after receiving the vaccine to account for the incubation period of the Ebola virus.

It’s time we stopped demonising in-laws   Ebola vaccine may be 'up to 100% effective': WHO SHARE : AFP Tweet A health worker injects a woman with an Ebola vaccine during a trial in Monrovia, February 2, 2015. PHOTO: REUTERS A prototype vaccine for Ebola may be “up to 100 percent effective” in protecting against the deadly virus, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Friday. If all goes well, the vaccine could become available in 2018 under a fast-track approval process, it said. In a major clinical trial, nearly 6,000 people in Guinea were given the test vaccine last year, at the tail end of a lethal epidemic of Ebola. Pulmonary disease: COPD kills one person every 10 seconds  Not one of the 6,000 contracted the disease. But in a control group of volunteers that did not receive the vaccine, 23 Ebola cases occurred, researchers reported in The Lancet medical journal. “If we compare zero to 23, this strongly suggests that the vaccine is very effective, that it could be up to 100 percent effective,” Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s assistant director-general and lead author of the study, told AFP. Her team of three dozen researchers calculated a 90-percent likelihood during a full-fledged epidemic that the vaccine, dubbed rVSV-ZEBOV, would work in more than 80 percent of cases. “After 40 years, we appear to now have an effective vaccine for Ebola virus disease to build upon,” Thomas Geisbert, a scientist at Galveston National Laboratory in Texas who did not take part in the study, wrote in a commentary, also in The Lancet. Viral disease: Flu cases on the rise in Sargodha  First identified in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Ebola virus erupted periodically in outbreaks of up to a couple hundred cases, mainly across west and east Africa. In early 2014, however, a handful of infections in southern Guinea mushroomed rapidly into an epidemic. Over the next two years, more than 28,000 people fell ill, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some 11,300 died. With a mortality rate above 40 percent, the disease — one of a category of so-called haemorrhagic fevers — has an incubation period of up to three weeks. It causes violent and painful symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhoea, organ failure and internal bleeding. The new vaccine was initially developed in Canada by public health authorities before being taken over by pharmaceutical giant Merck. It is slated to be submitted by Merck to health authorities in the United States and Europe sometime next year under a fast-track approval process. “We may have a vaccine which is registered in 2018,” Kieny told journalists at a press conference Thursday, noting that the standard approval process for a new drug takes a decade, if not more. In the meantime, Merck has committed to ensuring that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergencies under a protocol called “compassionate use”. “They will be able to produce a million in very short period of time,” Kieny noted. There are still questions to be resolved concerning the vaccine, including side effects. Initial tests last year did not include children, while the most recent trials covered those over six years old. Brace yourself for new mosquito-borne disease  Of the more than 6,000 people injected with the Ebola vaccine only two showed serious adverse effects, the study reported. Both recovered fully. But it is still unknown if the vaccine is safe for children six and under, pregnant women, or people with the AIDS virus — all groups that were excluded from the most recent trials. Another unknown is how long innoculation lasts. “With the Canadian Merck vaccine, you have a protection very early after vaccination, but we don’t know if it will last after six months,” Kieny said. Other Ebola vaccines under development — some of which have been tested in humans — could prove more effective over a longer period. British firm Glaxosmithkline and Johnson & Johnson, based in the United States, each have experimental products in the pipeline. China and Russia have also developed vaccines, with the Russian one having just finished the second phase of three-step clinical trials. Some of these vaccines require two doses three weeks apart, and may confer a longer immunity. “That might be better suited to immunise health workers in advance of an outbreak,” Kieny said. Health officials also point to the fact that other strains of the virus — including one in Sudan — will require the development of separate vaccines.

Among 5,837 people who received the rVSV-EBOV vaccine in the trial in Guinea in 2015, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination, signalling 100 percent protection. More than 11,300 people died in West Africa's 2013-2016 epidemic of the virus, which causes hemorrhagic fever. "When the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Marie-Paule Kieny, a World Health Organisation (WHO) assistant director-general and one of the lead researchers in the trial. Merck's rVSV-EBOV has already been used in Sierra Leone to contain a flare-up there. The Guinea trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, which was still seeing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. It used a "ring vaccination" approach, in which, when a new Ebola case was diagnosed, researchers traced all people who might have been in recent contact and logged them as clusters, or "rings", made up of an average of 80 people. At first, the clusters were assigned to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a three-week delay. After interim results showed 100 percent protection in those vaccinated immediately, the trial design was switched to allow all clusters to be given the shot straight away.   Continued...

The vaccine — rVSV-ZEBOV — was developed with the help of the Canadian government and is under development by the U.S. drug manufacturer Merck. The vaccine was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea in 2015. According to the study published in the journal Lancet, among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. By comparison, 23 cases were reported among the control group whose members did not receive the vaccine. Although a few mild side-effects — headache, fatigue and muscle pain — were reported, only two serious adverse effects — one case of fever and one of an allergic reaction — were found to be related to the vaccine. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," Marie-Paule Kieny, the World Health Organization's (WHO) assistant director-general for health systems and innovation, and the lead author the study detailing the test results, said in a statement. In order to study the efficacy of the vaccine, the researchers employed a "ring-vaccination" approach — the same technique that was used to eradicate small pox in the 1970s. It involved vaccinating all people who may have come in contact with that particular case within the previous three weeks — friends, family and other visitors. "Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine," the WHO said. "After interim results were published showing the vaccine’s efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years." Related Stories Gavi, Merck Sign Deal For Experimental Ebola Vaccine Ebola Can Linger For Over A Year In Semen Although the vaccine is yet to be approved by regulators, 300,000 doses have already been created by Merck for use in case of another outbreak. The company is expected to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe sometime next year. Although Ebola was discovered in what was then Zaire in 1976, it grabbed international headlines only in 2014, after an outbreak in West Africa quickly spiraled out of control and assumed epidemic proportions. Between 2013 and 2016, over 15,200 cases were confirmed in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, of which 11,300 died. The outbreak provided the sociopolitical and economic incentive for research into an effective Ebola vaccine — efforts that, over the past four decades, had failed to bear fruit. "Had a vaccine been available earlier in the Ebola epidemic, thousands of lives might have been saved,” Jeremy Farrar, director of the London-based Wellcome Trust, which supported the trial, said in a statement. “We have to get ahead of the curve and make promising diagnostics, drugs and vaccines for diseases we know could be a threat in the future."

Produced by U.S. pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp & Dohme, the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was trialed on close to 12,000 people in the west African country of Guinea. Of the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, none contracted Ebola 10 or more days after their vaccination. By contrast, 23 cases were recorded among those who did not receive the vaccine in the same time frame, set to allow for the disease's incubation period. The trial took place in 2015 and was led by WHO, working alongside with Guinea's Ministry of Health, Medicins sans Frontiers and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, with other international collaborators. Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's assistant director-general for health systems and innovation, described the news as "compelling" in a press statement, adding that should Ebola break out again, "we will not be defenceless." Ebola killed more than 11,300 people in west Africa during its 2013-2016 outbreak, according to WHO's press release. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine does not treat those already suffering from the disease, but rather prevents its transmission. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Its trial used a so-called "ring vaccination" method – the same technique that helped eradicate small pox. Researchers contacted all those known to have come into contact with an infected person in the three weeks prior to his/her diagnosis. These people then received the vaccine. Funding from the Global Alliance for Vaccines (GAVI) was given to Merck in January towards future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved by WHO. Part of GAVI's agreement with Merck means that 300,000 doses of the vaccine will be available for emergency use before this time. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country," said Dr Sakoba Keita, coordinator of Guinea's Ebola response, said in WHO's statement. She also described her pride in helping develop a vaccine that will "prevent other nations from enduring what we endured." Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Among 5,837 people who received the rVSV-EBOV vaccine in the trial in Guinea in 2015, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination, signaling 100 percent protection. More than 11,300 people died in West Africa's 2013-2016 epidemic of the virus, which causes hemorrhagic fever. "When the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Marie-Paule Kieny, a World Health Organization (WHO) assistant director-general and one of the lead researchers in the trial. Merck's rVSV-EBOV has already been used in Sierra Leone to contain a flare-up there. More on this... You could have Ebola and not even know it Canadian lab worker possibly exposed to Ebola from pigs Texas hospital reaches settlement with nurse infected with Ebola The Guinea trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guin'e, which was still seeing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. It used a "ring vaccination" approach, in which, when a new Ebola case was diagnosed, researchers traced all people who might have been in recent contact and logged them as clusters, or "rings", made up of an average of 80 people. At first, the clusters were assigned to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a three-week delay. After interim results showed 100 percent protection in those vaccinated immediately, the trial design was switched to allow all clusters to be given the shot straight away. The WHO said that if Ebola outbreaks occurred before the vaccine was given full regulatory approval, it could be made available though a compassionate use procedure after informed consent. John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modeling at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, whose team helped design the trial, hailed its success as "historic". "When Ebola strikes again we will be in a much better position to offer help to affected communities, as well as protect the brave volunteers who help control this terrible disease," he said in an emailed statement. GAVI, the global vaccine alliance, provided $5 million earlier this year to buy 300,000 doses of rVSV-EBOV as a stockpile for use during future Ebola outbreaks.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11 841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by WHO, together with Guineas Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners. While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africas Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless, said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHOs Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the studys lead author. The vaccines manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 20132016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11 300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called ring vaccination approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox. When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain contacts of contacts. A total of 117 clusters (or rings) were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccines efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years. In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so called herd immunity). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured, said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects. It was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea. This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement, said Dr John-Arne Røttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group. In January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300 000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHOs Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure. Additional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called compassionate use that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHOs partners are working to compile data to support license applications. The rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHOs R&D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics.Notes to editors The rVSV-ZEBOV trial is funded by WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust; the UK Government through the Department for International Development; the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Norwegian Institute of Public Health through the Research Council of Norway,; the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the International Development Research Centre, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development; and Médecins Sans Frontières. The trial team includes experts from The University of Bern, the University of Florida, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England, the European Mobile Laboratories among others. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy. Interim results of the trial, published in August 2015 rVSV-ZEBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials have shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans. Analysis only included cases occurring 10 days after receiving the vaccine to account for the incubation period of the Ebola virus.

The new vaccine, whose trials were done in Guinea, was developed by Merck and Co, a pharmaceutical company. Tests have shown that the vaccine offers protection against Ebola by up to 100 per cent. The vaccine has been accepted for review by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for emergency use assessment and listing. Dubbed the Ebola Zaire vaccine V920, expectations are that it will offer much-needed cushion against the virus. According to WHO, 28,616 Ebola cases have been reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,310 deaths were also reported during the 2014-2015 outbreak. Merck’s vice president for clinical research, Paula Annunziato said: “This application to the WHO is an important step toward enabling V920 to be used if a public health emergency of international concern were to be declared for the Ebola Zaire species prior to licensure of the vaccine candidate.” ALSO READ: Artificial leaf copies nature to manufacture medicine During the study, 11,000 people were put on trial. Those who received a shot of the vaccine in the final stage of the study did not report any cases of Ebola even after an incubation for period of 10 days. The study offers a reprieve for Africa, which has suffered the ravages of Ebola, especially West Africa. The study’s lead author, Marie-Paule Kieny, Assistant Director-General for health systems and innovation at WHO, said: “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless.” Before the vaccine is approved for commercial distribution, it will have to be subjected to studies regarding quality, safety; efficacy and effectiveness; as well as the risk and benefit analysis for emergency use. However, 300,000 doses of the virus are in stock in case of an outbreak again. Initially engineered by scientists from Canada by the Public Health Agency, the V920 was licensed to Newlink Genetic Corporation at a time when the Ebola outbreak had hit its peak. Clinical trials are going on in USA, Canada, the European Union and Africa. During the last outbreak, Kenya put in place stringent measures to prevent an outbreak.

(NYSE: MRK) appear to have made a major breakthrough in prevention of one of the deadliest diseases in the world. This week, The Lancet reported 100 percent efficacy in Merck's final-stage trial of an experimental Ebola vaccine administered to more than 11,000 people exposed to the disease during a 2013–2016 outbreak in Guinea. The outbreak killed more than 11,300 people in West Africa. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless,” the World Health Organization’s Marie-Paule Kieny said. Shares of the $162 billion pharma giant Merck barely moved on the news, but shares of $313 million NewLink were up 10.49 percent in Friday’s session. Competitors In The Space Rejoice Alongside Merck, NewLink Surprisingly, shares of rival Ebola vaccine biotech stocks are joining in on the NewLink rally, even though their vaccine research is in much earlier stages. Sarepta Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: SRPT) shares were up 4.97 percent on Friday. The company’s Ebola vaccine candidate is currently in Phase I testing. BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: BCRX) shares were up by 7.9 percent. The company’s Ebola vaccine candidate is currently in Phase I testing as well. NewLink Chief Financial Officer John Henneman told Benzinga that the company will not be receiving any further milestone payments from Merck from this point forward.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV was studied in a trial involving 11, 841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded in 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases in 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organisation (WHO), together with Guinea's Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in collaboration with other international partners. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author. The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11 300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinee, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called "ring vaccination" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox. When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain "contacts of contacts". A total of 117 clusters (or "rings") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a three-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine's efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than six years. In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so called "herd immunity"). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured," said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects. It was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea. "This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement," said Dr John-Arne Røttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group. In January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 3, 00,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure. Additional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called "compassionate use" that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO's partners are working to compile data to support license applications. The rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO's R&D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics. The rVSV-ZEBOV trial is funded by WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust, the UK Government through the Department for International Development; the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health through the Research Council of Norway, the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the International Development Research Centre, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development and Medecins Sans Frontieres. The trial team includes experts from The University of Bern, the University of Florida, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England, the European Mobile Laboratories among others. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy. rVSV-ZEBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials have shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans. Analysis only included cases occurring 10 days after receiving the vaccine to account for the incubation period of the Ebola virus.

Credit: Baz Ratner/Reuters A prototype vaccine for Ebola may be "up to 100 percent effective" in protecting against the deadly virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Friday. If all goes well, the vaccine could become available in 2018 under a fast-track approval process, it said. In a major clinical trial, nearly 6,000 people in Guinea were given the test vaccine last year, at the tail end of a lethal epidemic of Ebola. Not one of the 6,000 contracted the disease.  But in a control group of volunteers that did not receive the vaccine, 23 Ebola cases occurred, researchers reported in The Lancet medical journal. "If we compare zero to 23, this strongly suggests that the vaccine is very effective, that it could be up to 100 percent effective," Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's assistant director-general and lead author of the study, told AFP. Her team of three dozen researchers calculated a 90 percent likelihood during a full-fledged epidemic that the vaccine, dubbed rVSV-ZEBOV, would work in more than 80 percent of cases. "After 40 years, we appear to now have an effective vaccine for Ebola virus disease to build upon," Thomas Geisbert, a scientist at Galveston National Laboratory in Texas who did not take part in the study, wrote in a commentary, also in The Lancet.  'Compassionate use' First identified in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Ebola virus erupted periodically in outbreaks of up to a couple hundred cases, mainly across west and east Africa. In early 2014, however, a handful of infections in southern Guinea mushroomed rapidly into an epidemic.  Over the next two years, more than 28,000 people fell ill, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some 11,300 died. With a mortality rate above 40 percent, the disease — one of a category of so-called hemorrhagic fevers — has an incubation period of up to three weeks. It causes violent and painful symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhoea, organ failure and internal bleeding. The new vaccine was initially developed in Canada by public health authorities before being taken over by pharmaceutical giant Merck. It is slated to be submitted by Merck to health authorities in the United States and Europe sometime next year under a fast-track approval process. "We may have a vaccine which is registered in 2018," Kieny told journalists at a press conference Thursday, noting that the standard approval process for a new drug takes a decade, if not more. In the meantime, Merck has committed to ensuring that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergencies under a protocol called "compassionate use." "They will be able to produce a million in very short period of time," Kieny noted. Unanswered questions There are still questions to be resolved concerning the vaccine, including side effects. Initial tests last year did not include children, while the most recent trials covered those over six years old.  Of the more than 6,000 people injected with the Ebola vaccine only two showed serious adverse effects, the study reported. Both recovered fully. But it is still unknown if the vaccine is safe for children 6 and under, pregnant women, or people with the AIDS virus — all groups that were excluded from the most recent trials. Another unknown is how long innoculation lasts. "With the Canadian Merck vaccine, you have a protection very early after vaccination, but we don't know if it will last after six months," Kieny said. Other Ebola vaccines under development — some of which have been tested in humans — could prove more effective over a longer period. British firm Glaxosmithkline and Johnson & Johnson, based in the United States, each have experimental products in the pipeline. China and Russia have also developed vaccines, with the Russian one having just finished the second phase of three-step clinical trials. Some of these vaccines require two doses three weeks apart, and may confer a longer immunity. "That might be better suited to immunise health workers in advance of an outbreak," Kieny said. Health officials also point to the fact that other strains of the virus — including one in Sudan — will require the development of separate vaccines. While you are here...

Final trial results confirm Ebola vaccine provides high protection against disease: WHO - Irish Sun Issue 016/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Final trial results confirm Ebola vaccine provides high protection against disease: WHO Irish Sun (ANI) Saturday 24th December, 2016 Geneva [Switzerland], Dec. 24 (ANI): An experimental Ebola vaccine was highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to results published today in The Lancet. The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV was studied in a trial involving 11, 841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded in 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases in 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organisation (WHO), together with Guinea's Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in collaboration with other international partners. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author. The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11 300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinee, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called "ring vaccination" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox. When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain "contacts of contacts". A total of 117 clusters (or "rings") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a three-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine's efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than six years. In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so called "herd immunity"). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured," said Dr Ke ta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects. It was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea. "This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement," said Dr John-Arne R ttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group. In January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 3, 00,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure. Additional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called "compassionate use" that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO's partners are working to compile data to support license applications. The rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO's R D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics. The rVSV-ZEBOV trial is funded by WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust, the UK Government through the Department for International Development; the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health through the Research Council of Norway, the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the International Development Research Centre, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development and Medecins Sans Frontieres. The trial team includes experts from The University of Bern, the University of Florida, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England, the European Mobile Laboratories among others. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy. rVSV-ZEBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck Co. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials have shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans. Analysis only included cases occurring 10 days after receiving the vaccine to account for the incubation period of the Ebola virus.

Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

PHOTO: REUTERS A prototype vaccine for Ebola may be “up to 100 percent effective” in protecting against the deadly virus, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Friday. If all goes well, the vaccine could become available in 2018 under a fast-track approval process, it said. In a major clinical trial, nearly 6,000 people in Guinea were given the test vaccine last year, at the tail end of a lethal epidemic of Ebola. Pulmonary disease: COPD kills one person every 10 seconds  Not one of the 6,000 contracted the disease. But in a control group of volunteers that did not receive the vaccine, 23 Ebola cases occurred, researchers reported in The Lancet medical journal. “If we compare zero to 23, this strongly suggests that the vaccine is very effective, that it could be up to 100 percent effective,” Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s assistant director-general and lead author of the study, told AFP. Her team of three dozen researchers calculated a 90-percent likelihood during a full-fledged epidemic that the vaccine, dubbed rVSV-ZEBOV, would work in more than 80 percent of cases. “After 40 years, we appear to now have an effective vaccine for Ebola virus disease to build upon,” Thomas Geisbert, a scientist at Galveston National Laboratory in Texas who did not take part in the study, wrote in a commentary, also in The Lancet. Viral disease: Flu cases on the rise in Sargodha  First identified in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Ebola virus erupted periodically in outbreaks of up to a couple hundred cases, mainly across west and east Africa. In early 2014, however, a handful of infections in southern Guinea mushroomed rapidly into an epidemic. Over the next two years, more than 28,000 people fell ill, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some 11,300 died. With a mortality rate above 40 percent, the disease — one of a category of so-called haemorrhagic fevers — has an incubation period of up to three weeks. It causes violent and painful symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhoea, organ failure and internal bleeding. The new vaccine was initially developed in Canada by public health authorities before being taken over by pharmaceutical giant Merck. It is slated to be submitted by Merck to health authorities in the United States and Europe sometime next year under a fast-track approval process. “We may have a vaccine which is registered in 2018,” Kieny told journalists at a press conference Thursday, noting that the standard approval process for a new drug takes a decade, if not more. In the meantime, Merck has committed to ensuring that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergencies under a protocol called “compassionate use”. “They will be able to produce a million in very short period of time,” Kieny noted. There are still questions to be resolved concerning the vaccine, including side effects. Initial tests last year did not include children, while the most recent trials covered those over six years old. Brace yourself for new mosquito-borne disease  Of the more than 6,000 people injected with the Ebola vaccine only two showed serious adverse effects, the study reported. Both recovered fully. But it is still unknown if the vaccine is safe for children six and under, pregnant women, or people with the AIDS virus — all groups that were excluded from the most recent trials. Another unknown is how long innoculation lasts. “With the Canadian Merck vaccine, you have a protection very early after vaccination, but we don’t know if it will last after six months,” Kieny said. Other Ebola vaccines under development — some of which have been tested in humans — could prove more effective over a longer period. British firm Glaxosmithkline and Johnson & Johnson, based in the United States, each have experimental products in the pipeline. China and Russia have also developed vaccines, with the Russian one having just finished the second phase of three-step clinical trials. Some of these vaccines require two doses three weeks apart, and may confer a longer immunity. “That might be better suited to immunise health workers in advance of an outbreak,” Kieny said. Health officials also point to the fact that other strains of the virus — including one in Sudan — will require the development of separate vaccines.

Health officials also point to the fact that other strains of the virus — including one in Sudan — will require the development of separate vaccines.

Among 5,837 people who received the rVSV-EBOV vaccine in the trial in Guinea in 2015, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination, signalling 100 percent protection. More than 11,300 people died in West Africa's 2013-2016 epidemic of the virus, which causes hemorrhagic fever. The largest analysis to date of the tail-end of the Ebola epidemic, which swept through West Africa in 2014, found some of the last cases were passed on via unconventional routes, such as semen and breast milk WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?  After interim results showed 100 percent protection in those vaccinated immediately, the trial design was switched to allow all clusters to be given the shot straight away. The WHO said that if Ebola outbreaks occurred before the vaccine was given full regulatory approval, it could be made available though a compassionate use procedure after informed consent. 'When the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,' said Marie-Paule Kieny, a World Health Organisation (WHO) assistant director-general and one of the lead researchers in the trial. Merck's rVSV-EBOV has already been used in Sierra Leone to contain a flare-up there. The Guinea trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, which was still seeing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. It used a 'ring vaccination' approach, in which, when a new Ebola case was diagnosed, researchers traced all people who might have been in recent contact and logged them as clusters, or 'rings', made up of an average of 80 people. At first, the clusters were assigned to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a three-week delay.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Groundbreaking study finds BLINDING superbugs could stop...

Share this article Share 111 shares After interim results showed 100 percent protection in those vaccinated immediately, the trial design was switched to allow all clusters to be given the shot straight away. The WHO said that if Ebola outbreaks occurred before the vaccine was given full regulatory approval, it could be made available though a compassionate use procedure after informed consent. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: 'This study supports previous research suggesting that the virus can persist in bodily fluids for a long time after recovery' John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, whose team helped design the trial, hailed its success as 'historic'. 'When Ebola strikes again we will be in a much better position to offer help to affected communities, as well as protect the brave volunteers who help control this terrible disease,' he said in an emailed statement. GAVI, the global vaccine alliance, provided $5 million earlier this year to buy 300,000 doses of rVSV-EBOV as a stockpile for use during future Ebola outbreaks.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases PR Distribution Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 22, 2016December 23, 2016 by Press Release Merck Gilead Patent Suit: Maker Of Hepatitis C Drugs Harvoni And Sovaldi Ordered To Pay $2.54B In Royalties By Delaware Jury Gilead Sciences Inc. has been ordered to pay Merck & Co. $2.54 billion in royalties in a patent lawsuit over Gilead’s blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. A federal court jury in Delaware found Thursday Merck’s patent, originally issued to Idenix Pharmaceuticals, a company Merck bought in 2014, was valid and that Gilead “willfully” infringed on it. The lawsuit was filed by Idenix in 2013. The decision was Merck’s second victory over Gilead. It won a $200 million verdict against Gilead in March in another patent infringement case involving the hepatitis C drugs, but that verdict was overturned. Gilead, based in Forest City, California, said it would appeal. Merck sought 9 percent royalties on Harvoni and Sovaldi going forward. “The jury’s verdict upholds patent protections that are essential to the development of new medical treatments,” Merck said in a statement. “The patent at issue in this case facilitated significant advances in the treatment of patients with [hepatitis C] infection and was appropriately granted. Achieving these advancements required many years of research and significant investment by our subsidiary and its partners.” Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi’s active ingredient with another drug, and Solvadi cured hepatitis C in 90 percent of patients but at a price. Harvoni lists for $1,125 per pill. A 12-week regimen runs $94,500. In 2015, Gilead made $20 billion from the two drugs. The decision sent Gilead stock down 1.8 percent in after hours trading. The decision came as Express Scripts added Harvoni to its 2017 national formulary but did not say whether it would be covered. Negotiations are still underway between Express Scripts and Gilead. Some 25 million people suffer from hepatitis C, a liver infection that can result in chronic disease. The virus is spread by contact with contaminated blood. Most people have no symptoms, and those who do suffer fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite and yellowing of the eyes and skin.

Source: AFP 23 Dec 2016 - 11:49 AM  UPDATED 23 Dec 2016 - 11:57 AM Tweet If all goes well, the vaccine could become available in 2018 under a fast-track approval process, it said. In a major clinical trial, nearly 6000 people in Guinea were given the test vaccine last year, at the tail end of a lethal epidemic of Ebola. Not one of the 6000 contracted the disease. But in a control group of volunteers that did not receive the vaccine, 23 Ebola cases occurred, researchers reported in The Lancet medical journal. "If we compare zero to 23, this strongly suggests that the vaccine is very effective, that it could be up to 100 per cent effective," Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's assistant director-general and lead author of the study, told AFP. Her team of three dozen researchers calculated a 90-per cent likelihood during a full-fledged epidemic that the vaccine, dubbed rVSV-ZEBOV, would work in more than 80 per cent of cases. "After 40 years, we appear to now have an effective vaccine for Ebola virus disease to build upon," Thomas Geisbert, a scientist at Galveston National Laboratory in Texas who did not take part in the study, wrote in a commentary, also in The Lancet. Experts warn of Ebola complacency The World Health Organisation has urged for action to fully develop vaccines and prepare for future outbreaks of Ebola. Ebola no longer poses global risk: WHO The World Health Organisation has confirmed West Africa's Ebola outbreak no longer poses a global threat. 'Compassionate use' First identified in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Ebola virus erupted periodically in outbreaks of up to a couple hundred cases, mainly across west and east Africa. In early 2014, however, a handful of infections in southern Guinea mushroomed rapidly into an epidemic. Over the next two years, more than 28,000 people fell ill, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some 11,300 died. With a mortality rate above 40 per cent, the disease - one of a category of so-called haemorrhagic fevers - has an incubation period of up to three weeks. It causes violent and painful symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhoea, organ failure and internal bleeding. The new vaccine was initially developed in Canada by public health authorities before being taken over by pharmaceutical giant Merck. It is slated to be submitted by Merck to health authorities in the United States and Europe sometime next year under a fast-track approval process. "We may have a vaccine which is registered in 2018," Kieny told journalists at a press conference Thursday, noting that the standard approval process for a new drug takes a decade, if not more. In the meantime, Merck has committed to ensuring that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergencies under a protocol called "compassionate use". "They will be able to produce a million in very short period of time," Kieny noted. People pass a banner reading 'STOP EBOLA' forming part of Sierra Leone's Ebola free campaign in the city of Freetown, Sierra Leone. Unanswered questions There are still questions to be resolved concerning the vaccine, including side effects. Initial tests last year did not include children, while the most recent trials covered those over six years old. Of the more than 6000 people injected with the Ebola vaccine only two showed serious adverse effects, the study reported. Both recovered fully. But it is still unknown if the vaccine is safe for children six and under, pregnant women, or people with the AIDS virus - all groups that were excluded from the most recent trials. Another unknown is how long innoculation lasts. "With the Canadian Merck vaccine, you have a protection very early after vaccination, but we don't know if it will last after six months," Kieny said. Other Ebola vaccines under development - some of which have been tested in humans - could prove more effective over a longer period. British firm Glaxosmithkline and Johnson & Johnson, based in the United States, each have experimental products in the pipeline. China and Russia have also developed vaccines, with the Russian one having just finished the second phase of three-step clinical trials. Some of these vaccines require two doses three weeks apart, and may confer a longer immunity. "That might be better suited to immunise health workers in advance of an outbreak," Kieny said. Health officials also point to the fact that other strains of the virus - including one in Sudan - will require the development of separate vaccines.

If all goes well, the vaccine could become available in 2018 under a fast-track approval process, it said. In a major clinical trial, nearly 6,000 people in Guinea were given the test vaccine last year, at the tail end of a lethal epidemic of Ebola. Not one of the 6,000 contracted the disease. But in a control group of volunteers that did not receive the vaccine, 23 Ebola cases occurred, researchers reported in The Lancet medical journal. "If we compare zero to 23, this strongly suggests that the vaccine is very effective, that it could be up to 100 percent effective," Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's assistant director-general and lead author of the study, told AFP. Her team of three dozen researchers calculated a 90-percent likelihood during a full-fledged epidemic that the vaccine, dubbed rVSV-ZEBOV, would work in more than 80 percent of cases. "After 40 years, we appear to now have an effective vaccine for Ebola virus disease to build upon," Thomas Geisbert, a scientist at Galveston National Laboratory in Texas who did not take part in the study, wrote in a commentary, also in The Lancet. 'COMPASSIONATE USE' First identified in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Ebola virus erupted periodically in outbreaks of up to a couple hundred cases, mainly across west and east Africa. In early 2014, however, a handful of infections in southern Guinea mushroomed rapidly into an epidemic. Over the next two years, more than 28,000 people fell ill, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some 11,300 died. With a mortality rate above 40 percent, the disease -- one of a category of so-called hemorrhagic fevers -- has an incubation period of up to three weeks. It causes violent and painful symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, organ failure and internal bleeding. The new vaccine was initially developed in Canada by public health authorities before being taken over by pharmaceutical giant Merck. It is slated to be submitted by Merck to health authorities in the United States and Europe sometime next year under a fast-track approval process. "We may have a vaccine which is registered in 2018," Kieny told journalists at a press conference Thursday, noting that the standard approval process for a new drug takes a decade, if not more. In the meantime, Merck has committed to ensuring that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergencies under a protocol called "compassionate use". "They will be able to produce a million in very short period of time," Kieny noted. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS There are still questions to be resolved concerning the vaccine, including side effects. Initial tests last year did not include children, while the most recent trials covered those over six years old. Of the more than 6,000 people injected with the Ebola vaccine only two showed serious adverse effects, the study reported. Both recovered fully. But it is still unknown if the vaccine is safe for children six and under, pregnant women, or people with the AIDS virus -- all groups that were excluded from the most recent trials. Another unknown is how long inoculation lasts. "With the Canadian Merck vaccine, you have a protection very early after vaccination, but we don't know if it will last after six months," Kieny said. Other Ebola vaccines under development -- some of which have been tested in humans -- could prove more effective over a longer period. British firm Glaxosmithkline and Johnson & Johnson, based in the United States, each have experimental products in the pipeline. China and Russia have also developed vaccines, with the Russian one having just finished the second phase of three-step clinical trials. Some of these vaccines require two doses three weeks apart, and may confer a longer immunity. "That might be better suited to immunize health workers in advance of an outbreak," Kieny said. Health officials also point to the fact that other strains of the virus -- including one in Sudan -- will require the development of separate vaccines.

Among 5,837 people who received the rVSV-EBOV vaccine in the trial in Guinea in 2015, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination, signaling 100 percent protection. More than 11,300 people died in West Africa's 2013-2016 epidemic of the virus, which causes hemorrhagic fever. "When the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Marie-Paule Kieny, a World Health Organization (WHO) assistant director-general and one of the lead researchers in the trial. Merck's rVSV-EBOV has already been used in Sierra Leone to contain a flare-up there. The Guinea trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, which was still seeing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. It used a "ring vaccination" approach, in which, when a new Ebola case was diagnosed, researchers traced all people who might have been in recent contact and logged them as clusters, or "rings", made up of an average of 80 people. At first, the clusters were assigned to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a three-week delay. After interim results showed 100 percent protection in those vaccinated immediately, the trial design was switched to allow all clusters to be given the shot straight away. The WHO said that if Ebola outbreaks occurred before the vaccine was given full regulatory approval, it could be made available though a compassionate use procedure after informed consent. John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modeling at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, whose team helped design the trial, hailed its success as "historic". "When Ebola strikes again we will be in a much better position to offer help to affected communities, as well as protect the brave volunteers who help control this terrible disease," he said in an emailed statement. GAVI, the global vaccine alliance, provided $5 million earlier this year to buy 300,000 doses of rVSV-EBOV as a stockpile for use during future Ebola outbreaks.

FILE | NATION MEDIA GROUP  AFP Friday, December 23   2016 at  11:33 comment A prototype vaccine for Ebola may be "up to 100 per cent effective" in protecting against the deadly virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Friday.

It is slated to be submitted by Merck to health authorities in the United States and Europe sometime next year under a fast-track approval process. "We may have a vaccine which is registered in 2018," Kieny told journalists at a press conference Thursday, noting that the standard approval process for a new drug takes a decade, if not more. In the meantime, Merck has committed to ensuring that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergencies under a protocol called "compassionate use". "They will be able to produce a million in very short period of time," Kieny noted. Unanswered questions There are still questions to be resolved concerning the vaccine, including side effects. Initial tests last year did not include children, while the most recent trials covered those over six years old. Of the more than 6,000 people injected with the Ebola vaccine only two showed serious adverse effects, the study reported. Both recovered fully. But it is still unknown if the vaccine is safe for children six and under, pregnant women, or people with the AIDS virus — all groups that were excluded from the most recent trials. Another unknown is how long innoculation lasts. "With the Canadian Merck vaccine, you have a protection very early after vaccination, but we don't know if it will last after six months," Kieny said. Other Ebola vaccines under development — some of which have been tested in humans — could prove more effective over a longer period. British firm Glaxosmithkline and Johnson & Johnson, based in the United States, each have experimental products in the pipeline. China and Russia have also developed vaccines, with the Russian one having just finished the second phase of three-step clinical trials.

If all goes well, the vaccine could become available in 2018 under a fast-track approval process, WHO said. In a major clinical trial, nearly 6,000 people in Guinea were given the test vaccine last year, at the tail end of a lethal epidemic of Ebola. Not one of the 6,000 contracted the disease. But in a control group of volunteers that did not receive the vaccine, 23 Ebola cases occurred, researchers reported in The Lancet medical journal. “If we compare zero to 23, this strongly suggests that the vaccine is very effective, that it could be up to 100 percent effective,” Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s assistant director-general and lead author of the study, told AFP. Her team of three dozen researchers calculated a 90-percent likelihood during a full-fledged epidemic that the vaccine, dubbed rVSV-ZEBOV, would work in more than 80 percent of cases. First identified in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Ebola virus erupted periodically in outbreaks of up to a couple hundred cases, mainly across west and east Africa. In early 2014, however, a handful of infections in southern Guinea mushroomed rapidly into an epidemic. Over the next two years, more than 28,000 people fell ill, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some 11,300 died. 20 cases was reported in Nigeria in 2014, 8 infected persons died, while 12 survived following the isolation of the first case, the government moved swiftly to approve a special intervention plan to contain and prevent the spread of the Ebola outbreak. The plan was propped up with the release of USD $11.5 million to support implementation. With a mortality rate above 40 percent, the disease - one of a category of so-called haemorrhagic fevers - has an incubation period of up to three weeks. It causes violent and painful symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhoea, organ failure and internal bleeding. The new vaccine was initially developed in Canada by public health authorities before being taken over by pharmaceutical giant Merck. It is slated to be submitted by Merck to health authorities in the United States and Europe sometime next year under a fast-track approval process. “We may have a vaccine which is registered in 2018,” Kieny told journalists at a press conference Thursday, noting that the standard approval process for a new drug takes a decade, if not more.

Scientists have struggled to develop an Ebola vaccine over the years, and this is the first one proven to work. Efforts were ramped up after the infectious disease caused a major outbreak, beginning in 2013 in Guinea and spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,300 people died, foxnews.com wrote. The World Health Organization, which acknowledged shortcomings in its response to the West Africa outbreak, led the study of the vaccine, which was developed by the Canadian government and is now licensed to the US-based Merck & Co. Merck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the US and Europe sometime next year. The experimental vaccine was given to about 5,800 people last year in Guinea, as the virus was waning. All had some contact with a new Ebola patient. They got the vaccine right away or three weeks later. After a 10-day waiting period, no Ebola cases developed in those immediately vaccinated, 23 cases turned up among those with delayed vaccination. The Lancet paper mostly crystallizes what was already largely known from interim results released last year. The vaccine proved so effective that the study was stopped midway so that everyone exposed to Ebola in Guinea could be immunized. "I really believe that now we have a tool which would allow (us) to control a new outbreak of Ebola of the Zaire strain," said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a WHO assistant director-general who was the study's lead author. "It's the first vaccine for which efficacy has been shown." She noted that other Ebola vaccines are undergoing testing, and that a vaccine is also needed to protect against a second strain, Sudan. The virus first turned up in Africa in 1976 and had caused periodic outbreaks mostly in central Africa, but never with results as deadly as the West Africa outbreak. Many previous vaccine attempts have failed. Among the hurdles: The sporadic nature of outbreaks and funding shortages.     KeyWords Ebola effective confirm   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Common viruses pose deadly threat at nursing homes Iran among world’s top 10 vaccine producers Wearable biosensors tell when you are getting sick Wearable biosensors can flag illness New procedure shown to help treat bronchial condition in adults Exercise on weekends may reduce death risk High cholesterol intake not tied to memory disorders Studies find worrying over- and underuse of medicine worldwide How to cure a cold: Vitamin C does not get rid of symptoms Why is asthma worse in black patients?

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year, said the World Health Organisation (WHO) in a news release on Friday. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015, according to The Lancet. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless," said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's assistant director-general for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author. The WHO led the study of the vaccine, which was initially developed by the Canadian government and was eventually licensed to Merck, a leading US drugmaker. Merck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the United States and Europe sometime next year. The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck Sharpe & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck, received Breakthrough Therapy Designation this year from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since the Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa, but never as deadly as the West African Ebola outbreak of 2013-2016, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, according to WHO estimates. -- BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Malaysians Have Right To Assess Working Visit To China - Zahid Adapt To Changes In Education Field, Says PM Tun M Is Now U-Turn Champion - PM Najib Other News Headlines Tun Dr Mahathir Realises Importance Of BR1M - Shahrir- politic PNB Subsidiary Completes Mydin Mall Seremban 2 Purchase For RM240 Mln- business Mohd Faiz Gets RM20,000 From KFA- sports Keeping Malaysian Higher Education Quality At Its Best- features Islamophobic Attack Targets Muslims In Eastern France- world Most Read News Fireworks Mishap Report To Be Tabled At State Exco Meeting On Wednesday Dayang Nurfaizah To Dedicate Performance At AJL31 To Adenan Satem BNM Steps Up Initiatives Aiming To Improve Financial Literacy Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2017 BERNAMA.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, according to the results published in The Lancet journal. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author. In the most recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa that started in late 2013, more than 11,000 people lost their lives. The WHO removed the global emergency tag for the disease early this year. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea's Ministry of Health and other international partners. The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials had shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,000 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinee, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects, the study reported. --IANS gb/vm SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Modi with charkha replaces Gandhiji!

(file photo) A prototype vaccine for Ebola has proven effective in Guinea, according to the World Health Organization. It hopes fast-track approval will emerge by 2018. The hemorrhagic virus killed 11,300 people in western Africa. WHO assistant director-general Marie-Paule Kieny wrote in the medical journal "The Lancet" that an "effective vaccine" for Ebola, dubbed rVSV-ZEBOV should be 80 percent effective in a fully-fledged epidemic. The Canadian-developed vaccine was given to nearly 6,000 people in Guinea's coastal region of Gasse-Guinée in a "phase 3" clinical trial last year. It was carried out last year at the tail end of western Africa's epidemic that began in early 2014 and also spanned Liberia and Sierra Leone, prompting world alarm. Not one person contracted the disease, but among a control group of unvaccinated volunteers 23 cases did occur, wrote Kieny who led a team at the WHO which took over the study. "When the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless," she said, adding that the pharmaceutical giant Merck would seek fast-track approval in the USA and Europe next year.

"They will be able to produce a million in [a] very short period of time," she noted. 'Effective vaccine' A Texas expert, who did not take part in the study, Thomas Giesbert of the Galverston National Laboratory, said the world appeared to have an effective vaccine to work on after 40 years of uncontrollable outbreaks. Infectious disease professor John Edmunds, whose team at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine helped design the trial, spoke of a "historic" success. Ebola was first identified in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and erupted periodically in several hundred cases, mainly across western and eastern Africa. Clusters of contact persons vaccinated In Basse-Guinée, researchers used a "ring vaccination" approach by tracing all people who had had contact with the patient at the center of each new Ebola case. The rings typically comprised 80 people. Some received the prototype vaccine immediately, others after a three-week delay. When interim results showed 100 percent protection for those vaccinated immediately, all trial participants were given shots straight away. Among the 5,800 people vaccinated, 80 suffered side effects, which had all been successfully remedied. Russian 'vaccine' not proven The global vaccine alliance GAVI contributed $5 million (4.7 million euros) earlier this year to buy 300,000 doses of rVSV-EBOV as a preliminary stockpile. Kieny told the German Protestant church news agency EPD that a substance declared to have been a vaccine by Russian President Vladimir Putin in January had proven to have no protective effect. ipj/jm (AFP, Reuters, epd) West Africa Pharaohs Eager to Claim Afcon After Seven Years Egypt return to the African Nations Cup finals for the first time in seven years and are eager to prove their… Read more » Previous Story Ebola Vaccine Shows 100 Percent Protection, Study Shows Next Story Ebola Vaccine Shows 100 Percent Protection, Study Shows Previous Story   Copyright © 2016 Deutsche Welle.

(QCOM) Stock Signals More Growth Recent Posts: The Dow Jones Industrial Average Is Focused on the Financials Trade of the Day: Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Signals More Growth Markets Are Looking to the Nasdaq to Lead View All Posts On Wednesday, investors endured another day of relatively quiet trading with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still unable to penetrate the 20,000 level. Even though tax and regulatory cuts, along with an increase in infrastructure spending, seemed to indicate that next year will be highlighted by an increase in corporate earnings, investors seemed more focused on the upcoming holidays than on stocks. Volume has waned, and yesterday the Dow traded its narrowest range since 2013. All three major indices fell 0.2%. The Dow was led lower by a 1.8% decline in the price of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), which fell 1.8% and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) which lost 1.4%. The Nasdaq felt a mild sting of selling from the biotechnology group. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (ETF) (NASDAQ:IBB) fell 1.1%. And technology stocks were flat as a result of ground lost by Accenture Plc’s (NYSE:ACN) missing estimates and lowering guidance for this year. ACN fell 5.0%. Crude oil (WTI) fell to $52.49 per barrel, off 1.5%, due to a government report that cited an increase in stockpiles by 2.3 million barrels last week vs. an expected decline of 2.3 million barrels. An increase in net imports was indicated as the reason for the faulty estimate. The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2017 At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33 points to 19,942, the S&P 500 lost 6 points falling to 2,265, the Nasdaq closed at 5,471, a decline of 13 points, and the Russell 2000 lost 9 at 1,375. The NYSE’s primary exchange traded 698 million shares with total volume of 2.8 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 1.5 billion shares. On the Big Board, decliners led advancers by 1.2-to-1, and on the Nasdaq decliners led by 1.6-to-1. Blocks on the NYSE fell to 5,416 from 6,195 on Tuesday. Click to Enlarge   The Dow traded in the narrowest range in three years as interest volume fell until the close when a big selling block hit the tape. Block selling accounted for the spike in sales on Friday, which failed to deter a new closing high on Tuesday. Sentiment is moving to the bullish side, and MACD is still positive, though weakening. The first support for the Dow is at yesterday’s low at 19,942 and then at the support line at 19,520 drawn from November’s breakout base. Conclusion: The consolidation from the advance from the December jump to the current pattern with its support at yesterday’s low is all part of a “continuation pattern.” This pattern is bullish and within a short time should result in an advance through the psychological barrier at 20,000. Calling the Dow’s resistance at 20,000 a “psychological barrier” does not reduce its meaning. What technicians are indicating by this title is that there is no technical barrier of sellers to penetrate. Piercing the Dow’s line at 20,000 would be heralded around the globe and probably result in attracting new money from abroad. Bring them on, since the bull market is alive with new highs every other day or so. Today’s Trading Landscape To see a list of the companies reporting earnings today, click here.

Final test results confirm an experimental Ebola vaccine is highly effective, a major milestone that could help prevent the spread of outbreaks like the one that killed thousands in West Africa. (AP Photo/Youssouf Bah, File) , By JAMEY KEATEN / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF GENEVA – Final test results confirm an experimental Ebola vaccine is highly effective, a major milestone that could help prevent the spread of outbreaks like the one that killed thousands in West Africa. Scientists have struggled to develop an Ebola vaccine over the years, and this is the first one proven to work. Efforts were ramped up after the infectious disease caused a major outbreak, beginning in 2013 in Guinea and spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,300 people died. The World Health Organization, which acknowledged shortcomings in its response to the West Africa outbreak, led the study of the vaccine, which was developed by the Canadian government and is now licensed to the U.S.-based Merck & Co. Results were published Thursday. Merck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe sometime next year. The experimental vaccine was given to about 5,800 people last year in Guinea, as the virus was waning. All had some contact with a new Ebola patient. They got the vaccine right away or three weeks later. After a 10-day waiting period, no Ebola cases developed in those immediately vaccinated, 23 cases turned up among those with delayed vaccination. The Lancet paper published Thursday mostly crystallizes what was already largely known from interim results released last year. The vaccine proved so effective that the study was stopped midway so that everyone exposed to Ebola in Guinea could be immunized. “I really believe that now we have a tool which would allow (us) to control a new outbreak of Ebola of the Zaire strain,” said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a WHO assistant director-general who was the study’s lead author. “It’s the first vaccine for which efficacy has been shown.” She noted that other Ebola vaccines are underdoing testing, and that a vaccine is also needed to protect against a second strain, Sudan. The virus first turned up in Africa in 1976 and had caused periodic outbreaks mostly in central Africa, but never with results as deadly as the West Africa outbreak. Many previous vaccine attempts have failed. Among the hurdles: the sporadic nature of outbreaks and funding shortages.

Scientists have struggled to develop an Ebola vaccine over the years, and this is the first one proven to work. Efforts were ramped up after the infectious disease caused a major outbreak, beginning in 2013 in Guinea and spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,300 people died. More on this... Canadian lab worker released after Ebola infection scare Inovio's Zika vaccine evokes robust response in human study AIDS experts say new vaccine trial may offer hope for a cure The World Health Organization, which acknowledged shortcomings in its response to the West Africa outbreak, led the study of the vaccine, which was developed by the Canadian government and is now licensed to the U.S.-based Merck & Co. Results were published Thursday. Merck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe sometime next year. The experimental vaccine was given to about 5,800 people last year in Guinea, as the virus was waning. All had some contact with a new Ebola patient. They got the vaccine right away or three weeks later. After a 10-day waiting period, no Ebola cases developed in those immediately vaccinated, 23 cases turned up among those with delayed vaccination. The Lancet paper published Thursday mostly crystallizes what was already largely known from interim results released last year. The vaccine proved so effective that the study was stopped midway so that everyone exposed to Ebola in Guinea could be immunized. "I really believe that now we have a tool which would allow (us) to control a new outbreak of Ebola of the Zaire strain," said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a WHO assistant director-general who was the study's lead author. "It's the first vaccine for which efficacy has been shown." She noted that other Ebola vaccines are underdoing testing, and that a vaccine is also needed to protect against a second strain, Sudan. The virus first turned up in Africa in 1976 and had caused periodic outbreaks mostly in central Africa, but never with results as deadly as the West Africa outbreak. Many previous vaccine attempts have failed. Among the hurdles: the sporadic nature of outbreaks and funding shortages.

(AP Photo/Aurelie Marrier d'Unienville) Share Written by Yomi Kazeem Obsession Contagion December 23, 2016 Quartz africa The next time Ebola strikes, Africa, and everywhere else, will be better prepared. Findings from tests of rVSV-ZEBOV, a trial vaccine, show a 100% protection rate with thousands of people tested in Guinea all confirmed as virus-free within 10 days. The World Health Organization, which led the trial, says the vaccine could be available for mass use by 2018. To meet that timeline, the regulatory approval process for the vaccine is being fast-tracked. In the meantime, backed by GAVI, a global vaccine alliance, pharmaceutical giants Merck have made 300,000 doses of the vaccine available in the event of an outbreak. The possibility of an Ebola vaccine is a major leap for Africans at risk of the disease following a devastating outbreak mainly in three West African countries which started in 2014. Though now controlled, World Bank estimates put the cost of the outbreak’s economic impact at more than $3 billion in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia—the worst affected countries. Published findings from the test say results from the test “add weight to the interim assessment that rVSV-ZEBOV offers substantial protection against Ebola virus disease, with no cases among vaccinated individuals from day 10 after vaccination in both randomized and non-randomized clusters.” Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s assistant director-general for health systems and innovation, says the vaccine will be vital to Africa survival of another outbreak. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless.” Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.

They used the same strategy that was used to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. Called ring vaccination, it calls for vaccinating people who have been in contact with patients, and contacts of contacts. Doctor Francis Kateh from Redemption Hospital volunteering to receive a trial vaccine against Ebola at Redemption Hospital on the outskirts of Monrovia. ZOOM DOSSO / AFP - Getty Images file It worked, the team led by the World Health Organization found. "Vaccine efficacy was 100 percent," they wrote in their report, published in Friday's issue of the Lancet medical journal. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless," said WHO's Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, who led the trial. Related: Experimental Vaccine Could Stop Ebola It's not a surprise - researchers had been working on an Ebola vaccine for years but because the virus only usually caused occasional, small outbreaks, it was hard to test it. “Vaccine efficacy was 100 percent.” Plus no governments or companies had invested the time or money needed to develop a vaccine. Then the epidemic started in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in late 2013. By the time it was completely stopped earlier this year, it had infected 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 of them. Researchers rushed several vaccines into production. This vaccine was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, which licensed it to a company called NewLink Genetics. Pharma giant Merck & Co. bought the license and is making it. Related: Ebola Vaccine Trials Offer Hope It uses an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The virus is harmless to people. Vaccine makers genetically engineered it to carry a little piece of Ebola DNA to stimulate an immune response. Experts including Dr. Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who helped led the campaign to eradicate smallpox, designed a ring vaccination trial. Henderson died in August. By the time all this work was done, the epidemic was waning. It's hard to test a vaccine if disease is not spreading, but the international team tried it out in a coastal region of Guinea where Ebola cases were still being reported. Related: Experimental Ebola Shot Looks Good The virus spreads by direct contact, either between people or with bodily fluids such as blood from someone very ill with Ebola, or who has died from it. The researchers tracked down every person who may have been in contact with a case, including family members and friends. Then they found people who had been in contact with those people. Each of these "rings" ended up including about 80 people. “We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured.” Half got vaccine and half did not. The trial was stopped when it became clear that the vaccine was truly protecting people from infection, even after they'd been in direct contact with an Ebola victim. The Food and Drug Administration gave the vaccine breakthrough designation to allow quick licensing. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, has made a $5 million down payment to Merck to make sure the vaccine is available when it's next needed. Merck has promised to make 300,000 doses of the vaccine available for emergency use. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured," said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, coordinator of the Ebola response in Guinea.

Subscribe Home News National and World Ebola vaccine shown to be 'highly protective' against deadly virus in major trial Story Comments Print Create a hardcopy of this page Font Size: Default font size Larger font size Posted: Friday, December 23, 2016 12:00 pm Ebola vaccine shown to be 'highly protective' against deadly virus in major trial By Ariana Eunjung Cha The Washington Post SentinelSource.com Scientists on Thursday announced a milestone in the fight against Ebola, reporting that a major trial of an experimental vaccine shows that it may be “highly protective” against the virus, which has infected nearly 30,000 people and killed 11,000 worldwide since 2013. Although the current outbreak has been contained, health officials fear the deadly pathogen could come back and have been racing to develop new ways to stop it should that scenario unfold. The new study, led by the World Health Organization, was based in a coastal region of Guinea known as Basse-Guinee. The vaccine showed 100 percent efficacy in protecting those who got it. More than 11,800 people participated in the trial. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless,” Marie-Paule Kieny, the study’s lead author and WHO assistant director general for health systems, said in announcing the results. When preliminary findings were unveiled in July 2015, WHO Director General Margaret Chan called the vaccine a potential “game-changer.” Guinea was one of three West African nations hit hardest by Ebola beginning in 2014. Researchers are running two parallel studies of the same vaccine in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the other epicenter countries. The vaccine used in the study, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and licensed by Merck, involves just a single shot. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have designated it for streamlined regulatory approval. A number of other vaccines — developed by GlaxoSmithKline and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, among other groups — also have shown promise and are advancing in human trials. The Guinea trial, described in the Lancet, used an approach known as “ring vaccination,” which the researchers described as the same approach used to eradicate smallpox. It involves tracing all individuals who may have been in contact with every new person diagnosed with the virus, from relatives who live in the same household to visitors and those who may have been in close contact with the infected person’s clothes or linens. In some cases, contacts of contacts also were considered to be at risk. Ultimately, researchers identified 117 “rings,” or clusters of people, for the study. Each was made up of an average of 80 people. At the beginning of the trial, which took place in 2015 when the virus was still actively spreading in the region, the rings were randomly divided into two groups. One was to get the vaccine immediately and the other after a three-week delay. When the first results showed that the vaccine was working, everyone was offered it immediately. Those 18 and older got it initially, then children older than 6. The results were striking: In the group of 5,837 people who received the vaccine immediately, there were zero Ebola cases. In the other group, which included those who got a delayed vaccination as well as those who were never vaccinated, there were 23 cases. Kieny and research team members from Guinea’s Health Ministry and other international partners also noted that vaccination appeared to create a type of “herd immunity” that indirectly protected people who had not been vaccinated. But more research will be needed to confirm this theory, they said. Two serious adverse events were reported after vaccination, with one participant spiking a fever and another suffering an allergic reaction. Everyone else either reported no side effects or very mild ones such as headache, fatigue and muscle pain. No effects were long term. Despite researchers’ caution that more studies are needed to confirm the vaccine’s safety for children and other vulnerable groups, such as individuals with HIV, they already are making plans to accelerate its rollout should future trials further confirm safety and effectiveness. Merck has committed to having 300,000 emergency doses available soon and to submit the licensing application to regulatory authorities by the end of 2017. In a commentary piece — optimistically titled “First Ebola virus vaccine to protect human beings?” — virologist Thomas Geisbert of the University of Texas wrote that the study data were so strong that it seemed likely that the vaccine “probably contributed to controlling the 2013-16 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Guinea.” As encouraged as he seemed by the study, Geisbert also raised a number of questions. Researchers still don’t know whether the vaccine is long-lasting, he said, asking, “Is it still protective, for example, 2-3 years after the vaccination?” He also noted that safety questions came up in the early testing. Still, he wrote, “After 40 years we appear to now have an effective vaccine for Ebola virus disease to build upon.” Discuss Print Posted in National and World, News on Friday, December 23, 2016 12:00 pm.

Which vaccine will stop Ebola in its tracks? Technology Friday 23 December 2016 - 5:08pm File: Liberia was the country worst hit by Ebola which has claimed 11,300 lives since December 2013, the vast majority in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Photo: AFP / Pascal Guyot PARIS, France - Forty years after emerging in what is today the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Ebola virus may finally have met its match in a vaccine which could be "up to 100 percent effective", according to its makers. Dubbed rVSV-ZEBOV, the vaccine is one of at least 15 being designed worldwide. Since the end of the West African Ebola outbreak earlier this year, however, developers sit with a unique dilemma: they can only test a vaccine's ultimate efficacy by checking if it protects people in the midst of an epidemic. READ: Ebola patients may not show any symptoms - study Here are brief descriptions of the leading contenders for a vaccine to stop the deadly haemorrhagic fever, for which there is no cure. rVSV-ZEBOV The frontrunner vaccine candidate has been developed by pharma company Merck, Sharp & Dohme and funded by the World Health Organisation (WHO), Canada's Public Health Agency and other donors. It uses a modified version of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which causes illness in rodents, cattle, pigs and horses. Not dangerous to humans, the virus has had one of its genes replaced by an Ebola virus gene. The vaccine prompts the human body to develop antibodies against the invader, so that when Ebola attacks, the antibodies are quick to identify it and fight back. According to final trial results released by the WHO on Friday, not one of the nearly 6,000 people given the vaccine in Guinea contracted Ebola within 10 days. The trial was conducted when the outbreak was already winding down in 2015. In a comparison group of similar size, not given the vaccine, there were 23 cases in the 10 days. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were the countries hardest hit by the 2014-16 outbreak which made nearly 29,000 people ill and killed more than 11,300. rVSV-ZEBOV could become available for use in 2018, under a fast-track drug-approval process. chAd3 Britain's GlaxoSmithKline and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have been developing the other of the two most advanced trial vaccines. It is based on a type of chimp cold virus, known as an chimpanzee adenovirus type 3 (ChAd3), to which an Ebola virus gene has been added. Phase I trials, the first step in vetting a new drug for safety and effectiveness, were conducted in the United States, Britain, Switzerland and Mali. These showed the drug was safe, and people injected with it developed Ebola antibodies. It went straight to Phase III tests in Liberia, but the epidemic ended and the trial was stopped without reporting any results. A Phase III trial is meant to test whether a vaccine protects people under natural disease conditions -- the final step before licensing. Other An experimental double-dose vaccine consisting of two different virus-based vaccines, Ad26-EBOV and MVA-EBOV, has passed a Phase I trial in England. It is developed by Crucell, a subsidiary of US company Johnson & Johnson, in cooperation with the National Institutes of Health. It is more onerous, requiring two shots three weeks apart, but may ultimately provide longer-lasting protection than a single dose. Elsewhere, China has conducted early-stage human testing with a vaccine, while Russia is developing at least two -- one of which, also a dual-dose drug, is already registered in Russia for emergency use. The ideal is to have more than one vaccine type -- preferably a combination of an easy-to-administer, quick-acting, single-shot version to be given to the general population to stop an outbreak, and a double-dose vaccine to confer longer-term protection on health personnel.

Early trials conducted in Guinea, one of the West African countries most affected b of Ebola show it offers 100% protection. The vaccine is now being fast-tracked for regulatory approval. Manufacturer Merck has made 300,000 doses of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine available for use should another outbreak of Ebola strike again. Results, published in The Lancet this week, revealed that of nearly 6,000 people receiving the vaccine, all were free of the virus 10 days later.

Only one person who was vaccinated had a serious side effect that the researchers think was caused by the jab. They suffered very high temperature but made a full recovery. However it is not yet known how effective the vaccine will work on children who were not used in the trial. The director of British-based medical research institute the Wellcome Trust described the findings as “remarkable”. Jeremy Farrar said: “Had a vaccine been available earlier in the Ebola epidemic, thousands of lives might have been saved.

Scientists have struggled to develop an Ebola vaccine over the years, and this is the first one proven to work. Efforts were ramped up after the infectious disease caused a major outbreak, beginning in 2013 in Guinea and spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,300 people died. The World Health Organization, which acknowledged shortcomings in its response to the West Africa outbreak, led the study of the vaccine, which was developed by the Canadian government and is now licensed to the U.S.-based Merck & Co. Results were published Thursday. A woman gets vaccinated during the first clinical trials of an Ebola vaccine in Guinea. (Photo: Cellou Binani/AFP/Getty) Merck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe sometime next year. The experimental vaccine was given to about 5,800 people last year in Guinea, as the virus was waning. All had some contact with a new Ebola patient. They got the vaccine right away or three weeks later. After a 10-day waiting period, no Ebola cases developed in those immediately vaccinated, 23 cases turned up among those with delayed vaccination. The Lancet paper published Thursday mostly crystallizes what was already largely known from interim results released last year. The vaccine proved so effective that the study was stopped midway so that everyone exposed to Ebola in Guinea could be immunized. "I really believe that now we have a tool which would allow (us) to control a new outbreak of Ebola of the Zaire strain." "I really believe that now we have a tool which would allow (us) to control a new outbreak of Ebola of the Zaire strain,'' said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a WHO assistant director-general who was the study's lead author. "It's the first vaccine for which efficacy has been shown.'' She noted that other Ebola vaccines are undergoing testing, and that a vaccine is also needed to protect against a second strain, Sudan. The virus first turned up in Africa in 1976 and had caused periodic outbreaks mostly in central Africa, but never with results as deadly as the West Africa outbreak. Many previous vaccine attempts have failed. Among the hurdles: the sporadic nature of outbreaks and funding shortages.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Maggie Fox Dec 23rd 2016 10:20AM An experimental Ebola vaccine completely protected people from the killer virus at the end of the west African epidemic, researchers report. They used the same strategy that was used to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. Called ring vaccination, it calls for vaccinating people who have been in contact with patients, and contacts of contacts. It worked, the team led by the World Health Organization found. "Vaccine efficacy was 100 percent," they wrote in their report, published in Friday's issue of the Lancet medical journal.

Related: Experimental Vaccine Could Stop Ebola It's not a surprise - researchers had been working on an Ebola vaccine for years but because the virus only usually caused occasional, small outbreaks, it was hard to test it. "VACCINE EFFICACY WAS 100 PERCENT." Plus no governments or companies had invested the time or money needed to develop a vaccine. Then the epidemic started in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in late 2013. By the time it was completely stopped earlier this year, it had infected 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 of them. HealthGrove | Graphiq Researchers rushed several vaccines into production. This vaccine was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, which licensed it to a company called NewLink Genetics. Pharma giant Merck & Co. bought the license and is making it. Related: Ebola Vaccine Trials Offer Hope It uses an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The virus is harmless to people. Vaccine makers genetically engineered it to carry a little piece of Ebola DNA to stimulate an immune response. Experts including Dr. Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who helped led the campaign to eradicate smallpox, designed a ring vaccination trial. Henderson died in August. By the time all this work was done, the epidemic was waning. It's hard to test a vaccine if the disease is not spreading, but the international team tried it out in a coastal region of Guinea where Ebola cases were still being reported. Related: Experimental Ebola Shot Looks Good The virus spreads by direct contact, either between people or with bodily fluids such as blood from someone very ill with Ebola, or who has died from it. The researchers tracked down every person who may have been in contact with a case, including family members and friends. Then they found people who had been in contact with those people. Each of these "rings" ended up including about 80 people. Half got the vaccine and half did not. The trial was stopped when it became clear that the vaccine was truly protecting people from infection, even after they'd been in direct contact with an Ebola victim. The Food and Drug Administration gave the vaccine breakthrough designation to allow quick licensing. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, has made a $5 million down payment to Merck to make sure the vaccine is available when it's next needed. Merck has promised to make 300,000 doses of the vaccine available for emergency use. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured," said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, coordinator of the Ebola response in Guinea.

The World Health Organisation, which led the trial, says the vaccine could be available for mass use by 2018. To meet that timeline, the regulatory approval process for the vaccine is being fast-tracked. In the meantime, backed by GAVI, a global vaccine alliance, pharmaceutical giants Merck have made 300,000 doses of the vaccine available in the event of an outbreak. The possibility of an Ebola vaccine is a major leap for Africans at risk of the disease following a devastating outbreak mainly in three West African countries which started in 2014. Although now controlled, World Bank estimates put the cost of the outbreak’s economic impact at more than $3 billion in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia—the worst affected countries. Published findings from the test say results from the test “add weight to the interim assessment that rVSV-ZEBOV offers substantial protection against Ebola virus disease, with no cases among vaccinated individuals from day 10 after vaccination in both randomized and non-randomised clusters.” Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s assistant director-general for health systems and innovation, says the vaccine will be vital to Africa survival of another outbreak. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless,” Kieny said.

An experimental Ebola vaccine was highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to results published in The Lancet. The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health and other international partners. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,” said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study’s lead author. The vaccine’s manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called “ring vaccination” approach — the same method used to eradicate small pox. When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain “contacts of contacts.” A total of 117 clusters (or “rings”) were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine’s efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years. In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so-called “herd immunity”). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. “Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured” said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects. It was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea. “This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement,” said Dr John-Arne Røttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group. In January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO’s Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure. Additional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called “compassionate use” that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO’s partners are working to compile data to support license applications. The rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO’s R&D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics.

Scientists have struggled to develop an Ebola vaccine over the years, and this is the first one proven to work. Efforts were ramped up after the infectious disease caused a major outbreak, beginning in 2013 in Guinea and spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,300 people died. The World Health Organization, which acknowledged shortcomings in its response to the West Africa outbreak, led the study of the vaccine, which was developed by the Canadian government and is now licensed to the U.S.-based Merck & Co. Results were published Thursday in the journal Lancet. Merck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe sometime next year. The experimental vaccine was given to about 5,800 people last year in Guinea as the virus was waning. All had had some contact with a new Ebola patient. They got the vaccine right away or three weeks later. After a 10-day waiting period, no Ebola cases developed in those immediately vaccinated, while 23 cases turned up among those with delayed vaccination. The Lancet paper mostly crystallizes what was already largely known from interim results released last year. The vaccine proved so effective that the study was stopped midway so that everyone exposed to Ebola in Guinea could be immunized. “I really believe that now we have a tool which would allow (us) to control a new outbreak of Ebola of the Zaire strain,” said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a WHO assistant director-general who was the study’s lead author. “It’s the first vaccine for which efficacy has been shown.” She noted that other Ebola vaccines are undergoing testing, and that a vaccine is also needed to protect against a second strain, Sudan. The Merck vaccine uses a modified version of the vesicular stomatitis virus, which causes illness in rodents, cattle, pigs and horses. Not dangerous to humans, the virus has had one of its genes replaced by an Ebola virus gene. The vaccine prompts the human body to develop antibodies against the invader, so that when Ebola attacks, the antibodies are quick to identify it and fight back. The virus first turned up in Africa in 1976 and had caused periodic outbreaks mostly in Central Africa, but never with results as deadly as the West Africa outbreak. Many previous vaccine attempts have failed. Among the hurdles: the sporadic nature of outbreaks and funding shortages. The WHO declared the epidemic over in January this year, but this was followed by flare-ups in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Liberia said it was Ebola-free in June, prompting the WHO to declare the official end of the outbreak. Ebola was named after a river in the Democratic Republic of Congo, then known as Zaire. Four of the virus species are known to cause disease in humans: Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo and Tai Forest. The West African outbreak was caused by a variant, called Makona, of the Zaire species, which has historically been the most deadly in humans. Before the recent West African outbreak, Ebola had killed about 1,700 people in four decades. The virus’ natural reservoir animal is probably the bat, which does not fall ill but can pass the germ on to humans who hunt it for “bush meat.” Other dinner-time favorites in parts of Africa — chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines — are also suspected of transmitting Ebola. Among humans, the virus is passed on by contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected or recently deceased person. This can include touching a sick or dead person, and likely also sexual intercourse. Those infected do not become contagious until symptoms appear. They become more and more contagious until just after their death, which poses great risks during funerals. Following an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat. That is often followed by vomiting and diarrhea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding. Aftereffects have often been observed in survivors, including arthritis, problems with vision, eye inflammation and hearing difficulties.

By Ariana Eunjung Cha / The Washington Post Scientists on Thursday announced a milestone in the fight against Ebola, reporting that a major trial of an experimental vaccine shows that it may be “highly protective” against the virus, which has infected nearly 30,000 people and killed 11,000 worldwide since 2013. Although the current outbreak has been contained, health officials fear the deadly pathogen could come back and have been racing to develop new ways to stop it should that scenario unfold. The new study, led by the World Health Organization, was based in a coastal region of Guinea known as Basse-Guinee. The vaccine showed 100 percent efficacy in protecting those who got it. More than 11,800 people participated in the trial. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless,” Marie-Paule Kieny, the study’s lead author and WHO assistant director general for health systems, said in announcing the results. When preliminary findings were unveiled in July 2015, WHO Director General Margaret Chan called the vaccine a potential “game-changer.” Guinea was one of three West African nations hit hardest by Ebola beginning in 2014. Researchers are running two parallel studies of the same vaccine in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the other epicenter countries. The vaccine used in the study, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and licensed by Merck, involves just a single shot. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have designated it for streamlined regulatory approval. A number of other vaccines — developed by GlaxoSmithKline and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, among other groups — also have shown promise and are advancing in human trials. The Guinea trial, described in the Lancet, used an approach known as “ring vaccination,” which the researchers described as the same approach used to eradicate smallpox. It involves tracing all individuals who may have been in contact with every new person diagnosed with the virus, from relatives who live in the same household to visitors and those who may have been in close contact with the infected person’s clothes or linens. In some cases, contacts of contacts also were considered to be at risk. Ultimately, researchers identified 117 “rings,” or clusters of people, for the study. Each was made up of an average of 80 people. At the beginning of the trial, which took place in 2015 when the virus was still actively spreading in the region, the rings were randomly divided into two groups. One was to get the vaccine immediately and the other after a three-week delay. When the first results showed that the vaccine was working, everyone was offered it immediately. Those 18 and older got it initially, then children older than 6. The results were striking: In the group of 5,837 people who received the vaccine immediately, there were zero Ebola cases. In the other group, which included those who got a delayed vaccination as well as those who were never vaccinated, there were 23 cases. Ms. Kieny and research team members from Guinea’s Health Ministry and other international partners also noted that vaccination appeared to create a type of “herd immunity” that indirectly protected people who had not been vaccinated. But more research will be needed to confirm this theory, they said. Two serious adverse events were reported after vaccination, with one participant spiking a fever and another suffering an allergic reaction. Everyone else either reported no side effects or very mild ones such as headache, fatigue and muscle pain. No effects were long term. Despite researchers’ caution that more studies are needed to confirm the vaccine’s safety for children and other vulnerable groups, such as individuals with HIV, they already are making plans to accelerate its rollout should future trials further confirm safety and effectiveness. Merck has committed to having 300,000 emergency doses available soon and to submit the licensing application to regulatory authorities by the end of 2017. In a commentary piece — optimistically titled “First Ebola virus vaccine to protect human beings?” — virologist Thomas Geisbert of the University of Texas wrote that the study data were so strong that it seemed likely that the vaccine “probably contributed to controlling the 2013-16 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Guinea.” As encouraged as he seemed by the study, Mr. Geisbert also raised a number of questions. Researchers still don’t know whether the vaccine is long-lasting, he said, asking, “Is it still protective, for example, 2-3 years after the vaccination?” He also noted that safety questions came up in the early testing. Still, he wrote, “After 40 years we appear to now have an effective vaccine for Ebola virus disease to build upon.” GlaxoSmithKline - Margaret Chan - West Africa - Guinea - Africa Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Your e-mail: Your Name: Friends e-mail: Friends Name: Message: Captcha Submit Advertisement Create a free PG account.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV was studied in a trial involving 11, 841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded in 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases in 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organisation (WHO), together with Guinea's Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in collaboration with other international partners. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author. The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11 300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinee, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called "ring vaccination" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox. When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain "contacts of contacts". A total of 117 clusters (or "rings") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a three-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine's efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than six years. In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so called "herd immunity"). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured," said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects. It was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea. "This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement," said Dr John-Arne Røttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group. Read More In January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 3, 00,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure. Additional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called "compassionate use" that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO's partners are working to compile data to support license applications. The rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO's R&D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics. The rVSV-ZEBOV trial is funded by WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust, the UK Government through the Department for International Development; the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health through the Research Council of Norway, the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the International Development Research Centre, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development and Medecins Sans Frontieres. The trial team includes experts from The University of Bern, the University of Florida, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England, the European Mobile Laboratories among others. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy. rVSV-ZEBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials have shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans. Analysis only included cases occurring 10 days after receiving the vaccine to account for the incubation period of the Ebola virus.

Science News from research organizations Devastating elephantiasis disease facing elimination Date: December 22, 2016 Source: University of Warwick Summary: The elimination of elephantiasis disease lymphatic filariasis is nearing closer, report investigators. About one billion people in 54 countries live with threat of disease, which disables victims. The researchers' mathematical model works out the potential impact of treating and preventing disease with three drugs. Share: FULL STORY A disabling parasitic disease which causes elephantiasis, and threatens around one billion people globally -- Lymphatic filariasis -- could be eliminated more quickly, thanks to research by the University of Warwick. Dr Deirdre Hollingsworth, who leads the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) Modelling Consortium, led an international team that has discovered that if a recently proposed combination of three particular drugs is used together, the disease can be prevented or treated rapidly, in a maximum amount of people, using fewer rounds of drugs. Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease, which causes serious damage to the lymphatic system. It is caused by parasitic worms, and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Many people with the disease develop elephantiasis or lymphoedema, causing pain and profound disfigurement -- such as large swelling of the arms, legs or genitals -- and leading to permanent disability. These patients are not only physically disabled, but suffer mental, social and financial losses contributing to stigma and poverty. A large proportion of the billion people living with the threat of transmission are in India, Indonesia and Myanmar where the triple drug combination could be used. Currently, people with Lymphatic filariasis require multiple rounds of treatment -- but if the drugs ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole are used together recent clinical studies have shown that the drugs are more effective at killing the worms. The new modelling work shows that this meant that the number of rounds of mass drug administration needed to treat the disease may fall from many rounds to only two or three. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has targeted the disease for elimination as a public health problem by the by the year 2020. The drug companies Merck, GlaxoSmithKline and Eisai have pledged to donate drugs to help eradicate the disease globally. Initial studies show the triple drug regimen is far more effective at clearing the parasite from its human host and that is has a good safety profile. However, experts note that campaigns can run into trouble when they go on for too long because populations can lose interest in taking the drug when the disease is not very common. At this stage the researchers can't predict how fast this new regimen will speed up elimination, and if so, in which countries. Mathematical models were used simulate a mass drug administration campaign in different settings. As there are many unknowns about the transmission of the disease and how a population responds to intervention, three independently-developed models were used to estimate the impact of the new regimen. The models were developed at the University of Warwick, Erasmus Medical Centre, and Notre Dame Universities. All three models were in agreement in the effectiveness of the regimen in reducing the prevalence of disease. The researchers noted that more effective treatment with fewer drugs rounds is crucial in poorer countries where transmission is high but resources are low. Dr Hollingsworth, who is based at the University of Warwick's Mathematics Institute and School of Life Sciences, comments: "This more effective treatment has the potential to revolutionise the control of this disease, but it will require that in over a few rounds of treatment the programs are able to treat almost the whole population, even the most inaccessible. Dr Mike Irvine, University of British Columbia in Canada, is the first author of the paper, said: "Our results show that this regimen could potentially overcome important issues plagued by elimination campaigns, by making elimination as a public health problem achievable in a few years." Dr Wilma Stolk, from Erasmus Medical Centre, added: "We use very different approaches, but our models all have the same message. This new drug regimen can reduce the number of rounds, but it still depends on the programs being well-run. Even with the best possible regimen elimination is difficult to achieve if many people repeatedly don't participate in mass drug administration." Professor Edwin Michael, from Notre Dame University said: "This study demonstrates the power of using multiple models, an important trend in complex systems modelling and use of models for policy making. It allows us to be sure that our insights are robust." Story Source: Materials provided by University of Warwick. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

Scientists have struggled to develop an Ebola vaccine over the years, and this is the first one proven to work. Efforts were ramped up after the infectious disease caused a major outbreak, beginning in 2013 in Guinea and spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,300 people died. The World Health Organization, which acknowledged shortcomings in its response to the West Africa outbreak, led the study of the vaccine, which was developed by the Canadian government and is now licensed to the U.S.-based Merck & Co. Results were published Thursday in the journal Lancet. Merck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe sometime next year. The experimental vaccine was given to about 5,800 people last year in Guinea as the virus was waning. All had had some contact with a new Ebola patient. They got the vaccine right away or three weeks later. After a 10-day waiting period, no Ebola cases developed in those immediately vaccinated, while 23 cases turned up among those with delayed vaccination. The Lancet paper mostly crystallizes what was already largely known from interim results released last year. The vaccine proved so effective that the study was stopped midway so that everyone exposed to Ebola in Guinea could be immunized. “I really believe that now we have a tool which would allow (us) to control a new outbreak of Ebola of the Zaire strain,” said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a WHO assistant director-general who was the study’s lead author. “It’s the first vaccine for which efficacy has been shown.” She noted that other Ebola vaccines are undergoing testing, and that a vaccine is also needed to protect against a second strain, Sudan. The Merck vaccine uses a modified version of the vesicular stomatitis virus, which causes illness in rodents, cattle, pigs and horses. Not dangerous to humans, the virus has had one of its genes replaced by an Ebola virus gene. The vaccine prompts the human body to develop antibodies against the invader, so that when Ebola attacks, the antibodies are quick to identify it and fight back. The virus first turned up in Africa in 1976 and had caused periodic outbreaks mostly in Central Africa, but never with results as deadly as the West Africa outbreak. Many previous vaccine attempts have failed. Among the hurdles: the sporadic nature of outbreaks and funding shortages. The WHO declared the epidemic over in January this year, but this was followed by flare-ups in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Liberia said it was Ebola-free in June, prompting the WHO to declare the official end of the outbreak. Ebola was named after a river in the Democratic Republic of Congo, then known as Zaire. Four of the virus species are known to cause disease in humans: Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo and Tai Forest. The West African outbreak was caused by a variant, called Makona, of the Zaire species, which has historically been the most deadly in humans. Before the recent West African outbreak, Ebola had killed about 1,700 people in four decades. The virus’ natural reservoir animal is probably the bat, which does not fall ill but can pass the germ on to humans who hunt it for “bush meat.” Other dinner-time favorites in parts of Africa — chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines — are also suspected of transmitting Ebola. Among humans, the virus is passed on by contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected or recently deceased person. This can include touching a sick or dead person, and likely also sexual intercourse. Those infected do not become contagious until symptoms appear. They become more and more contagious until just after their death, which poses great risks during funerals. Following an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat. That is often followed by vomiting and diarrhea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding. Aftereffects have often been observed in survivors, including arthritis, problems with vision, eye inflammation and hearing difficulties.

Although the current outbreak has been contained, health officials fear the deadly pathogen could come back and have been racing to develop new ways to stop it should that scenario unfold. The new study, led by the World Health Organization, was based in a coastal region of Guinea known as Basse-Guinee. The vaccine showed 100 percent efficacy in protecting those who got it. More than 11,800 people participated in the trial. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless,” Marie-Paule Kieny, the study’s lead author and WHO assistant director general for health systems, said in announcing the results. When preliminary findings were unveiled in July 2015, WHO Director General Margaret Chan called the vaccine a potential “game-changer.” Guinea was one of three West African nations hit hardest by Ebola beginning in 2014. Researchers are running two parallel studies of the same vaccine in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the other epicenter countries. The vaccine used in the study, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and licensed by Merck, involves just a single shot. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have designated it for streamlined regulatory approval. A number of other vaccines – developed by GlaxoSmithKline and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, among other groups – also have shown promise and are advancing in human trials. The Guinea trial, described in the Lancet, used an approach known as “ring vaccination,” which the researchers described as the same approach used to eradicate smallpox. It involves tracing all individuals who may have been in contact with every new person diagnosed with the virus, from relatives who live in the same household to visitors and those who may have been in close contact with the infected person’s clothes or linens. In some cases, contacts of contacts also were considered to be at risk. Ultimately, researchers identified 117 “rings,” or clusters of people, for the study. Each was made up of an average of 80 people. At the beginning of the trial, which took place in 2015 when the virus was still actively spreading in the region, the rings were randomly divided into two groups. One was to get the vaccine immediately and the other after a three-week delay. When the first results showed that the vaccine was working, everyone was offered it immediately. Those 18 and older got it initially, then children older than 6. The results were striking: In the group of 5,837 people who received the vaccine immediately, there were zero Ebola cases. In the other group, which included those who got a delayed vaccination as well as those who were never vaccinated, there were 23 cases. Kieny and research team members from Guinea’s Health Ministry and other international partners also noted that vaccination appeared to create a type of “herd immunity” that indirectly protected people who had not been vaccinated. But more research will be needed to confirm this theory, they said. Two serious adverse events were reported after vaccination, with one participant spiking a fever and another suffering an allergic reaction. Everyone else either reported no side effects or very mild ones such as headache, fatigue and muscle pain. No effects were long term. Despite researchers’ caution that more studies are needed to confirm the vaccine’s safety for children and other vulnerable groups, such as individuals with HIV, they already are making plans to accelerate its rollout should future trials further confirm safety and effectiveness. Merck has committed to having 300,000 emergency doses available soon and to submit the licensing application to regulatory authorities by the end of 2017. In a commentary piece – optimistically titled “First Ebola virus vaccine to protect human beings?” – virologist Thomas Geisbert of the University of Texas wrote that the study data were so strong that it seemed likely that the vaccine “probably contributed to controlling the 2013-16 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Guinea.” As encouraged as he seemed by the study, Geisbert also raised a number of questions. Researchers still don’t know whether the vaccine is long-lasting, he said, asking, “Is it still protective, for example, 2-3 years after the vaccination?” He also noted that safety questions came up in the early testing. Still, he wrote, “After 40 years we appear to now have an effective vaccine for Ebola virus disease to build upon.” (c) 2016, The Washington Post · Ariana Eunjung Cha Joe #breaking now 54 years later, you still have to pay to use Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous ‘I Have a Dream’ speech It’s one of the most famous speeches in American history, one you never forget if you ever heard it.… 0 Comments 28838 Views CIA director warns Trump to watch what he says The outgoing CIA director called Donald Trump’s comments about the U.S. intelligence community “outrageous” and suggested the president-elect’s attitude… 0 Comments 103130 Views Celebrities and N.Y.

The vaccine proved so effective that the study was stopped midway so that everyone exposed to Ebola in Guinea could be immunized. “I really believe that now we have a tool which would allow (us) to control a new outbreak of Ebola of the Zaire strain,” said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a WHO assistant director-general who was the study’s lead author. “It’s the first vaccine for which efficacy has been shown.” She noted that other Ebola vaccines are underdoing testing, and that a vaccine is also needed to protect against a second strain, Sudan. The virus first turned up in Africa in 1976 and had caused periodic outbreaks mostly in central Africa, but never with results as deadly as the West Africa outbreak. Many previous vaccine attempts have failed. Among the hurdles: the sporadic nature of outbreaks and funding shortages.

It hopes fast-track approval will emerge by 2018. The hemorrhagic virus killed 11,300 people in western Africa. WHO assistant director-general Marie-Paule Kieny wrote in the medical journal "The Lancet" that an "effective vaccine" for Ebola, dubbed rVSV-ZEBOV should be 80 percent effective in a fully-fledged epidemic. The Canadian-developed vaccine was given to nearly 6,000 people in Guinea's coastal region of Gasse-Guinée in a "phase 3" clinical trial last year. It was carried out last year at the tail end of western Africa's epidemic that began in early 2014 and also spanned Liberia and Sierra Leone, prompting world alarm. Not one vaccinated person contracted the disease, but among a control group of unvaccinated volunteers 23 cases did occur, wrote Kieny who led a team at the WHO which took over the study. "When the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless," she said, adding that the pharmaceutical giant Merck would seek fast-track approval in the USA and Europe next year. "We may have a vaccine which is registered in 2018," Kieny told journalists in Geneva. "They will be able to produce a million in [a] very short period of time," she noted. We will not be defenseless next time, says Kieny 'Effective vaccine' A Texas expert, who did not take part in the study, Thomas Giesbert of the Galverston National Laboratory, said the world appeared to have an effective vaccine to work on after 40 years of uncontrollable outbreaks. Infectious disease professor John Edmunds, whose team at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine helped design the trial, spoke of a "historic" success. Ebola was first identified in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and erupted periodically in several hundred cases, mainly across western and eastern Africa. Clusters of contact persons vaccinated In Basse-Guinée, researchers used a "ring vaccination" approach by tracing all people who had had contact with the patient at the center of each new Ebola case. The rings typically comprised 80 people. Some received the prototype vaccine immediately, others after a three-week delay. When interim results showed 100 percent protection for those vaccinated immediately, all trial participants were given shots straight away. Among the 5,800 people vaccinated, 80 suffered side effects, which had all been successfully remedied. Russian 'vaccine' not proven The global vaccine alliance GAVI contributed $5 million (4.7 million euros) earlier this year to buy 300,000 doses of rVSV-EBOV as a preliminary stockpile. Kieny told the German Protestant church news agency EPD that a substance declared to have been a vaccine by Russian President Vladimir Putin in January had proven to have no protective effect.

By Tareq Haddad December 23, 2016 02:50 GMT WHO: Global health care needs revamping to avoid Ebola-like 'tragedy'IBTimes UK An experimental vaccine developed to fight against Ebola has been found to be "highly effective", the World Health Organisation has said. In a major trial carried out in Guinea, none of the 5,837 people who received the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine recorded any traces of the deadly virus 10 days or more after vaccination. Meanwhile, 23 cases were recorded among the 6,007 people who were not vaccinated. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation and the study's lead author. The WHO said it recognised the need to develop a vaccine for Ebola, after it claimed more than 11,300 people's lives between 2013 and 2016. It worked alongside the vaccine's manufacturer Merck, Sharpe & Dohme to develop the drug and to enable faster regulatory approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration and from the European Medicines Agency. The trial took place in Guinea, as the African country was still experiencing new Ebola cases when testing started in 2015. Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Guinea's Director of the National Agency for Health Security, said: "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured." The study's findings were published in the Lancet medical journal on Friday (23 December). Despite the high efficacy rate, authors said the further testing would be required to look at the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations, such as those with HIV. As a result of agreements between Merck and the WHO, if the vaccine is fully approved, the drug company will ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine would be available for emergency use. It must also submit the vaccine for licencing by the end of 2017. More from IBTimes UK Possible breakthrough in preventing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Want to be happy this Christmas?

The vaccine was studied in a trial involving more than 11,000 people in Guinea. Of those who received the shot in a final-stage trial, no Ebola cases were recorded after a ten-day incubation period, according to a study published in the medical journal, the Lancet. The outbreak of Ebola from 2013 to 2016 triggered a public health crisis in West Africa, resulting in more than 11,300 deaths, primarily in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. It also exposed holes in global infectious disease preparedness, with infected travellers reaching as far away as Texas. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,” Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general for health systems and innovation at the World Health Organization, and the study’s lead author, said in a statement. The trial, called “Ebola ça Suffit" -- French for “Ebola that’s enough” -- was led by the WHO, Guinea’s Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, as well as other international partners. Breakthrough Designation The vaccine is called rVSV-ZEBOV and  manufactured by Merck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of the U.S. drugmaker. Merck this year received breakthrough therapy designation for the shot from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which enables faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted, according to the WHO statement. Thursday’s findings re-confirmed a July 2015 study that the vaccine would be a potent weapon against future disease spread. The most important business stories of the day.

It was eventually licensed to Merck, which signed an agreement in January with Gavi, the world’s biggest funder of vaccines for developing countries, to submit the experimental Ebola vaccine for regulatory approval by the end of 2017. Gavi, which brings together funds from governments, companies, United Nations agencies and philanthropic groups like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, committed $5 million to the development of the vaccine. In July 2015, a study published in the Lancet medical journal reported that Merck’s vaccine was 100 percent effective when it was tested on more than 4,000 people who were in close contact with Ebola patients in Guinea. During the last outbreak, vaccine makers rushed to ready shots that had never before been tested in humans. The disease spread had unexpectedly spiraled out of control, especially in the first few months, and public health officials initially struggled to curb the infections.

Scientists have struggled to develop an Ebola vaccine over the years, and this is the first one proven to work. Efforts were ramped up after the infectious disease caused a major outbreak, beginning in 2013 in Guinea and spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,300 people died. Story continues below The World Health Organization, which acknowledged shortcomings in its response to the West Africa outbreak, led the study of the vaccine, which was developed by the Canadian government and is now licensed to the U.S.-based Merck & Co. Results were published Thursday. READ MORE: Winnipeg lab employee potentially exposed to Ebola virus Merck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe sometime next year. The experimental vaccine was given to about 5,800 people last year in Guinea, as the virus was waning. All had some contact with a new Ebola patient. They got the vaccine right away or three weeks later. After a 10-day waiting period, no Ebola cases developed in those immediately vaccinated, 23 cases turned up among those with delayed vaccination.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens， and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year， said the World Health Organization (WHO) in a news release on Friday. The vaccine， called rVSV-ZEBOV， was studied in a trial involving 11，841 people in Guinea during 2015， according to The Lancet. Among the 5，837 people who received the vaccine， no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison， there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic， they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits， we will not be defenseless，" said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny， WHO's assistant director-general for Health Systems and Innovation， and the study's lead author. The WHO led the study of the vaccine， which was initially developed by the Canadian government and was eventually licensed to Merck， a leading U.S. drugmaker. Merck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the United States and Europe sometime next year. The vaccine's manufacturer， Merck Sharpe & Dohme， a subsidiary of Merck， received Breakthrough Therapy Designation this year from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency， enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since the Ebola virus was first identified in 1976， sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa， but never as deadly as the West African Ebola outbreak of 2013-2016， which resulted in more than 11，300 deaths， according to WHO estimates. | PRINT | RSS SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

Nick Summers, @nisummers 12.23.16 in Medicine Comments 1548 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Kimberley Steeds, a member of the Ebola vaccine trial team, at Donka Hospital in Conakry, Guinea. WHO/S. Hawkey An Ebola vaccine has proven to be 100 percent effective during test trials in Guinea. The shot has yet to be approved by a regulator, but Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has already committed $5 million so a stockpile of 300,000 doses can be produced. The results of the trial, which covered 11,841 citizens, were published in The Lancet medical journal this week. Of the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, none came down with Ebola after 10 days. (Those who showed symptoms before this time were not counted, as it was assumed they had been infected before vaccination.) By way of comparison, there were 23 cases in the group that didn't receive the vaccine. "We were able to estimate the efficacy of the vaccine as being 100 percent in a trial," Ira Longini, a biostatistician who worked on the project said. "It's very unusual to have a vaccine that protects people perfectly." That's not to say the new formula is bulletproof -- while its effectiveness is high, the percentage is likely to drop as more people are tested. Furthermore, the vaccine's potency will probably fall over time. In 2015, cases of Ebola were already on the decline, so the team used an unusual "ring vaccination" approach to test its effectiveness. When a new case was diagnosed, the researchers would offer the shot to everyone who had been in contact with the patient recently. Once administered, they would approach the people closest to them -- a cluster, or "ring" averaging 80 people. All of the trial subjects were then randomised and received the vaccine immediately, or up to three weeks later. The first results were so promising, however, that the trial's design was changed so everyone could access the vaccine immediately, including children. The cure is called rVSV-EBOX and was first developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and the United States Army over a decade ago. It's now being developed and manufactured by Merck, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. While effective, it's far from perfect. As The New York Times reports, it only combats one of the two most common Ebola strains. The shot also comes with some reported side effects, such as joint pain and headaches. Questions have also been raised over the long-term effectiveness of the vaccine. Merck will seek approval from the World Health Organisation (WHO), which in turn will need a sign-off from a regulator such as the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the European Medicines Agency. Should it be endorsed, the vaccine could provide a vital defence against Ebola outbreaks in the future. The virus was first discovered in 1976, and there have been attempts before to develop successful vaccines. The epidemic in 2014, which affected nearly 30,000 people and took more than 11,000 lives, has provided governments, businesses and scientific institutions the necessary push to complete an effective vaccine. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation at WHO, and the study's lead author said.

The scientists' study, published in the Lancet, notes that zero cases of Ebola were reported in Guinean subjects vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV immediately after contact with another Ebola patient, suggesting a 100 percent success rate against the disease. The vaccine was hurried into development after last year's outbreak of the disease in west Africa in which more than 10,000 people are believed to have died. Scientists had previously struggled to combat the Ebola virus, but the new vaccine was found to be so effective that control group tests were halted early in Guinea, allowing everyone exposed to the disease to be immunized. The trials were so successful they were stopped early Scientists had previously split the test subjects up, giving some the vaccination immediately after Ebola contact, and waiting three weeks before providing it for others. 5,837 people received the vaccine during the Guinea trial in total, with 23 cases of Ebola reported in those who got the delayed vaccine, and zero among those who got it immediately. "We have to get ahead of the curve and make promising diagnostics, drugs and vaccines for diseases we know could be a threat in the future," Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust told the Guardian. “Had a vaccine been available earlier in the Ebola epidemic, thousands of lives might have been saved." The manufacturer of the vaccine has applied for it to be fast tracked It's not clear when the vaccine will go into full production, but Merck and Co. — the pharmaceutical firm that will manufacture the vaccine — has already received permission to to fast-track its licensing procedures in the US and Europe. The trials themselves were funded by organizations like the WHO, as well as the Canadian and Norwegian governments. The World Health Organization had come under fire for its slow response to the Ebola epidemic in west Africa, but the discovery of a vaccine that had previously eluded scientists should help save thousands of lives in the future. Farrar says this global approach can help quash epidemics faster. "My hope is that this success story provides the inspiration we need to make this happen and change the way the world prepares for epidemics," he said.

[NK India] "Mamata Banerjee is playing the dirtiest vote bank politics in Malda and in Bengal. In that she tries to communalise issues. There is a terror mechanism that is trying to be spread by her and there are extremist forces that are being used by Mamata's administration for their own benefit," BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh told ANI. "All this is coming out in the open and Malda is a classic book example of how the government under Mamata is functioning," he added. Sharpening his attack on Mamata, Singh further said that the 'vote bank' politics was affecting the national security, to which the BJP would fight against. "BJP will raise their voice when it comes to national security and therefore we have decided to go to the Home Minister and the President of India and will apprise them of the entire situation for an appropriate action," Singh said. Earlier, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) had hit out at the BJP for trying to 'communalise' the Malda incident and maintained that the state government had handled the situation 'tactfully'. "It's a sensitive border town. 10 arrests have been made and there have been no injuries or deaths. They are trying to communalise a criminal incident and we are not surprised. This is the BJP RSS strategy of trying to change the narrative with 100 days to go to polls," TMC leader Derek O'Brien told ANI. On Monday, a three-member fact-finding delegation of the BJP who went to Malda to take stock of the ground situation was forced to return as they were detained at the Railway station by the local administration. "The District Magistrate told us himself that Section 144 had been imposed due to the law and order situation in the area. We said that we have not come here to destabilise the situation but to help the people. We want to know the truth," BJP MP (fact finding committee member) SS Ahluwalia told ANI. Stating that the delegation had arrived to find the truth about the situation in Kaliachak, the fact-finding team expressed disappointment at not being allowed to enter the violence-hit area.

Photo: WHO/S. Hawkey Print 23 December 2016  The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) has said that an experimental Ebola vaccine has been found to be highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea. “The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year,” WHO said in a news release, noting the results of the latest trial, published earlier today in the medical journal The Lancet. According to WHO, the vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,” said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO' Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author. The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 and caused sporadic outbreaks in Africa. However, the 2013-2016 outbreak in west Africa, that killed more than 11,300 people, underlined the urgent need of a vaccine. Guinea, along with Liberia and Sierra Leone, was one of the worst affected countries. Noting the significance of the latest results, Dr. KeÏta Sakoba, the Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of Guinea's National Agency for Health Security, said: “Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured.” A team of contact tracers visited a community in Conakry, Guinea, in 2015 after a family member was infected with Ebola. The family was provided with buckets and chlorine and taught how to wash hands properly at home. Photo: UNMEER/Martine Perret 'Ring vaccination' approach The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. It employed an innovative design, a so-called “ring vaccination” approach – the same method used to eradicate small pox. This involved tracing all people who may have been in contact with a new Ebola case within the previous three weeks as well as certain “contacts of contacts.” These “rings” were randomized to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a three-week delay. In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach. However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. “This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement,” said Dr. John-Arne Røttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group. Also, WHO said that an international vaccine-focussed organization,GAVI, provided $5 million to Merck, one of the vaccine's manufacturers, towards its future procurement once the vaccine is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure.

AFP photo A prototype vaccine for Ebola may be “up to 100 percent effective” in protecting against the deadly virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday, reports AFP from Paris. If all goes well, the vaccine could become available in 2018 under a fast-track approval process, it said. In a major clinical trial, nearly 6,000 people in Guinea were given the test vaccine last year, at the tail end of a lethal epidemic of Ebola. Not one of the 6,000 contracted the disease. But in a control group of volunteers that did not receive the vaccine, 23 Ebola cases occurred, researchers reported in The Lancet medical journal. “If we compare zero to 23, this strongly suggests that the vaccine is very effective, that it could be up to 100 percent effective,” Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s assistant director-general and lead author of the study, told AFP. Her team of three dozen researchers calculated a 90-percent likelihood during a full-fledged epidemic that the vaccine, dubbed rVSV-ZEBOV, would work in more than 80 percent of cases. “After 40 years, we appear to now have an effective vaccine for Ebola virus disease to build upon,” Thomas Geisbert, a scientist at Galveston National Laboratory in Texas who did not take part in the study, wrote in a commentary, also in The Lancet. First identified in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Ebola virus erupted periodically in outbreaks of up to a couple hundred cases, mainly across west and east Africa. In early 2014, however, a handful of infections in southern Guinea mushroomed rapidly into an epidemic. Over the next two years, more than 28,000 people fell ill, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some 11,300 died. With a mortality rate above 40 percent, the disease—one of a category of so-called haemorrhagic fevers—has an incubation period of up to three weeks. It causes violent and painful symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhoea, organ failure and internal bleeding. The new vaccine was initially developed in Canada by public health authorities before being taken over by pharmaceutical giant Merck. It is slated to be submitted by Merck to health authorities in the United States and Europe sometime next year under a fast-track approval process. “We may have a vaccine which is registered in 2018,” Kieny told journalists at a press conference Thursday, noting that the standard approval process for a new drug takes a decade, if not more. In the meantime, Merck has committed to ensuring that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergencies under a protocol called “compassionate use”. “They will be able to produce a million in very short period of time,” Kieny noted.There are still questions to be resolved concerning the vaccine, including side effects. Initial tests last year did not include children, while the most recent trials covered those over six years old. Of the more than 6,000 people injected with the Ebola vaccine only two showed serious adverse effects, the study reported. Both recovered fully.         Ebola vaccine may be up to 100pc effective: WHO AFP from Paris A prototype vaccine for Ebola may be up to 100 percent effective in protecting against the deadly virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday, reports AFP from Paris.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, according to the results published in The Lancet journal. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author. In the most recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa that started in late 2013, more than 11,000 people lost their lives. The WHO removed the global emergency tag for the disease early this year. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea's Ministry of Health and other international partners. The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinee, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects, the study reported. --IANS gb/vm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Since the end of 2013, Ebola — highly infectious and often and marked fever and severe internal bleeding — killed more than 11,300 West Africans. The study and the experimental vaccine — called rVSV-ZEBOV — came in response to that outbreak. To identify people in Guinea at risk of contracting Ebola, researchers used a “ring vaccination” method inspired by the one used to wipe out smallpox in the 1970s. It works by immunizing immediate contacts — friends, family, neighbors — of a person who gets sick, effectively forming a ring to prevent transmission. About 11,000 people were vaccinated. No one given the vaccine developed the virus after a 10-day incubation period, researchers reported in the study published in The Lancet. Just two patients suffered serious reactions to the vaccine, and no long-term issues were reported. Researchers are at work to determine how long the vaccine is effective for. In the meantime, the vaccine, licensed by US firm Merck, has been fast-tracked for approval by regulators, CNN reports. The pharmaceutical company has promised to have 300,000 doses ready in case of emergency. Science has found an effective new weapon to fight the Ebola virus, above.

According to the UN health agency, as part of the trials, the immunogen rVSV-ZEBOV was tested with very positive results in 5,837 people in Guinea, the nation from where the epidemic spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia in 2014 . Among those who received the vaccine, no case of Ebola was recorded within 10 days or more after the inoculation, Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation has reported. The research also covered 6,000 additional volunteers who did not receive the injection and were followed up by WHO teams who reported 23 cases of the disease in this group. According to Kieny, although these convincing results came too late for those who died in the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, when the next outbreak appears we will have a defense. However, it still remains to be determined how long the immunity with this vaccine lasts and if only one dose is required to be effective. A report on the vaccine will be submitted to the registration process in the United States and the European Union and a response is expected in 2018, which will allow the medicine to be marketed. The vaccine - rVSV-ZEBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and is produced by the US pharmaceutical company Merck. Ebola is a disease caused in humans by the Ebola virus and usually its symptoms - fever, sore throats, and headaches - begin within between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus. Usually, this is followed by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with hepatic and renal failure. At this time, some patients begin to suffer hemorrhagic complications. Since the epidemic of 2014, whichoriginated in West Africa, there have been outbreaks on other continents. sgl/Ym/yor/dsa/rml Temas Relacionados: WHO Reports Effectiveness of First Vaccine Against Ebola 23 de diciembre de 2016, 12:08Geneva, Dec 23 (Prensa Latina) The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced the effectiveness of the clinical trials of the first vaccine against Ebola, whose last outbreak claimed more than 11,000 lives.

Most of those biologics - drugs made using living cells - went on to notch blockbuster sales. In many ways, the market for drugs aimed at preventing migraine is at a similar juncture. Four pharma heavyweights including Amgen Inc as well as smaller drug developer Alder Biopharmaceuticals Inc are racing to bring their biologics to market. Amgen is expected to be the first to file a marketing application next year. (http://bit.ly/2hyb70G) "Migraine today can be characterized as similar to RA in the past, in that it's a large but under-treated, and also under-diagnosed, market," Piper Jaffray analyst Charles Duncan told Reuters. "The burden of disease in terms of patient quality of life, function, and resource utilization is also high. Because of these market dynamics, there is likely room for multiple agents - even of the same mechanism - to be profitable." Migraine patients are currently treated with a host of drugs including anti-depressants, hypertension medicines and even botox - with little success. About 40 million, or one in every eight Americans, suffer from migraines, 13 million of whom are afflicted with a severe form of the disease. The size of the migraine market is expected to increase to more than $10 billion in 2025 from about $3 billion in 2015 in the United States, parts of Europe and Japan, according to healthcare data provider Decision Resources Group. The lack of effective medicines and the sheer number of patients guarantee that each drug, if approved, will eventually generate at least $1 billion in sales, analysts said. The first three rheumatoid arthritis (RA) biologics - drugs made using living cells - were approved between 1998 and 2002, starting with Amgen's Enbrel. To be sure, these drugs were also approved for other autoimmune conditions, which in part contributed to their blockbuster sales. The migraine treatments could also be eventually used in other disorders characterized by headaches. SAFETY FIRST Amgen, which is developing its migraine drug in collaboration with Novartis AG, said last month the medicine succeeded in a second late-stage study. Late-stage data from the two other companies developing similar drugs - Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd - is expected in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Alder's ALD403 is expected to be the last to file for approval but could still capture a sizable share of the market, thanks to its less-frequent dosing schedule and multiple modes of administration. These drugs target a protein associated with pain signaling called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Most attempts at developing traditional, chemically-synthesized drugs targeting CGRP, including migraine-relief treatments from Merck & Co Inc, were abandoned due to toxicity concerns. Available safety and efficacy data on the new crop of biologics, however, has been encouraging and there is not much to differentiate the drugs. ASKING PRICE What could set the migraine drugs apart from RA treatments is pricing. AbbVie Inc's success, for instance, has been mainly driven by its RA treatment Humira - the world's top-selling drug. Biologics are typically more expensive than traditional drugs but Amgen and its rivals may end up pricing their migraine treatments more conservatively to avoid regulatory scrutiny. Drug pricing has become a lightening rod for criticism with several drugmakers coming under federal investigation for price gouging. Most analysts, however, agree that migraine drug companies could make up in volumes what they might lose in pricing. Insurers are also unlikely to push back, given the lack of effective medicines. For now, the drug developers are hopeful they will capture a large share of the market. "We've got 13 million candidate patients ... and at least initially there will be four drugs addressing what is five times as many patients (as the RA market)," Randy Shultz, chief executive of Alder, told Reuters. "We would argue that each of these drugs has the potential to be a blockbuster alongside each other."

Business Cybersecurity Detection Disasters Government Infrastructure Public Safety Public health Regional Sci-Tech Surveillance Terrorism Transportation Water EbolaFinal trial results confirm Ebola vaccine provides high protection against disease Published 27 December 2016 Share | Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. An experimental Ebola vaccine was highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to results published in The Lancet. The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. All primates can be infected with the Ebola virus // Source: theconversation.com An experimental Ebola vaccine was highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to results published in The Lancet. The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded ten days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were twenty-three cases ten days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health and other international partners. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,” said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study’s lead author. The Lancet reports that the vaccine’s manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called “ring vaccination” approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox. When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain “contacts of contacts”. A total of 117 clusters (or “rings”) were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people.

The UN health agency noted the results of the latest trial published on Friday in the medical journal “The Lancet’’. According to WHO, the vaccine, ‘rVSV-ZEBOV’, was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. It said among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases in 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine, the global health organisation said. The report quoted Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study’s lead author, as saying the result was “defensive” against future Ebola outbreaks. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,” Kieny said. The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 and caused sporadic outbreaks in Africa. However, the 2013-2016 outbreaks in West Africa, that killed more than 11,300 people, underlined the urgent need for a vaccine. Guinea, along with Liberia and Sierra Leone, was one of the worst affected countries. Dr KeÏta Sakoba, the Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of Guinea’s National Agency for Health Security, noted the significance of the latest results. “Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. “We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured,” Sakoba said. The reports said the trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. “It employed an innovative design, a so-called `ring vaccination’ approach – the same method used to eradicate small pox. “This involved tracing all people who may have been in contact with a new Ebola case within the previous three weeks as well as certain “contacts of contacts. “These `rings’ were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a three-week delay.” In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, it said the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach. However, the authors noted that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. Dr John-Arne Ruttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group, said the trial was historical and innovative. “This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement,” Ruttingen said. Also, WHO said that an international vaccine-focussed organisation, GAVI, provided five million U.S. dollars to Merck, one of the vaccine’s manufacturers, towards its future procurement once the vaccine is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. The reports said as part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensuring that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO’s Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure.

Ebola vaccine found safe and effective in human trials - Irish Sun Issue 016/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Ebola vaccine found safe and effective in human trials Irish Sun (IANS) Friday 23rd December, 2016 London, Dec 23 (IANS) In a large human trial led by the World Health Organisation (WHO), an experimental Ebola vaccine was found highly protective against the deadly virus, promising an effective weapon against any future outbreak. The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, according to the results published in The Lancet journal. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author. In the most recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa that started in late 2013, more than 11,000 people lost their lives. The WHO removed the global emergency tag for the disease early this year. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea's Ministry of Health and other international partners. The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe amp; Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guine, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects, the study reported. --IANS gb/vm Share this article: Back to Irish Sun Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

Most of those biologics - drugs made using living cells - went on to notch blockbuster sales. In many ways, the market for drugs aimed at preventing migraine is at a similar juncture. Four pharma heavyweights including Amgen Inc as well as smaller drug developer Alder Biopharmaceuticals Inc are racing to bring their biologics to market. Amgen is expected to be the first to file a marketing application next year. (bit.ly/2hyb70G) "Migraine today can be characterized as similar to RA in the past, in that it's a large but under-treated, and also under-diagnosed, market," Piper Jaffray analyst Charles Duncan told Reuters. "The burden of disease in terms of patient quality of life, function, and resource utilization is also high. Because of these market dynamics, there is likely room for multiple agents - even of the same mechanism - to be profitable." Migraine patients are currently treated with a host of drugs including anti-depressants, hypertension medicines and even botox - with little success. About 40 million, or one in every eight Americans, suffer from migraines, 13 million of whom are afflicted with a severe form of the disease. The size of the migraine market is expected to increase to more than $10 billion in 2025 from about $3 billion in 2015 in the United States, parts of Europe and Japan, according to healthcare data provider Decision Resources Group. The lack of effective medicines and the sheer number of patients guarantee that each drug, if approved, will eventually generate at least $1 billion in sales, analysts said. The first three rheumatoid arthritis (RA) biologics - drugs made using living cells - were approved between 1998 and 2002, starting with Amgen's Enbrel. To be sure, these drugs were also approved for other autoimmune conditions, which in part contributed to their blockbuster sales. The migraine treatments could also be eventually used in other disorders characterized by headaches. SAFETY FIRST Amgen, which is developing its migraine drug in collaboration with Novartis AG, said last month the medicine succeeded in a second late-stage study. Late-stage data from the two other companies developing similar drugs - Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd - is expected in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Alder's ALD403 is expected to be the last to file for approval but could still capture a sizable share of the market, thanks to its less-frequent dosing schedule and multiple modes of administration. These drugs target a protein associated with pain signaling called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Most attempts at developing traditional, chemically-synthesized drugs targeting CGRP, including migraine-relief treatments from Merck & Co Inc, were abandoned due to toxicity concerns. Available safety and efficacy data on the new crop of biologics, however, has been encouraging and there is not much to differentiate the drugs. ASKING PRICE What could set the migraine drugs apart from RA treatments is pricing. AbbVie Inc's success, for instance, has been mainly driven by its RA treatment Humira - the world's top-selling drug. Biologics are typically more expensive than traditional drugs but Amgen and its rivals may end up pricing their migraine treatments more conservatively to avoid regulatory scrutiny. Drug pricing has become a lightening rod for criticism with several drugmakers coming under federal investigation for price gouging. Most analysts, however, agree that migraine drug companies could make up in volumes what they might lose in pricing. Insurers are also unlikely to push back, given the lack of effective medicines. For now, the drug developers are hopeful they will capture a large share of the market. "We've got 13 million candidate patients ... and at least initially there will be four drugs addressing what is five times as many patients (as the RA market)," Randy Shultz, chief executive of Alder, told Reuters. "We would argue that each of these drugs has the potential to be a blockbuster alongside each other."

See my options Scientists on Thursday announced a milestone in the fight against Ebola, reporting that a major trial of an experimental vaccine shows that it may be ‘highly protective’ against the virus, which has infected nearly 30,000 people and killed 11,000 worldwide since 2013. Although the current outbreak has been contained, health officials fear the deadly pathogen could come back and have been racing to develop new ways to stop it should that scenario unfold. The new study, led by the World Health Organization, was based in a coastal region of Guinea known as Basse-Guinee. The vaccine showed 100 percent efficacy in protecting those who got it. More than 11,800 people participated in the trial. ‘While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless,’ Marie-Paule Kieny, the study’s lead author and WHO assistant director general for health systems, said in announcing the results. When preliminary findings were unveiled in July 2015, WHO Director General Margaret Chan called the vaccine a potential ‘game-changer.’ The vaccine used in the study, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and licensed by Merck, involves just a single shot. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have designated it for streamlined regulatory approval. A number of other vaccines — developed by GlaxoSmithKline and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, among other groups — also have shown promise and are advancing in human trials. In August, K-State professor Jurgen Richt received $2.4 million in grants to study the vaccine’s safety in livestock at the Biosecurity Research Institute on campus. Richt’s research is ongoing.

Antibodies Market from its database. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this mark (EMAILWIRE.COM, December 23, 2016 ) Breast cancer is characterized by the malignancy of cells in the tissues of the breast. HER-2 breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer. The HER-2 protein, present on the surface of normal breast cells, affects the growth of the malignant cells. The uncontrolled synthesis of this protein stimulates the growth and division of malignant cells. Antibodies are the proteins produced by B-cells (in the bone marrow) in the immune system. These proteins attach themselves to antigens, which act as markers, and are then destroyed by phagocytes. B-cells produce different antibodies, which attach themselves to different sites of an antigen. mAbs are monospecific, as they are the clones of a single parent cell. Publisher's analysts forecast the global breast cancer monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) market to post a revenue of 13.7 billion by 2020.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 Mail News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai Migraine drugs may repeat rheumatoid arthritis success By Natalie Grover ReutersDecember 23, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share By Natalie Grover (Reuters) - Nearly two decades ago, several drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis hit the shelves in rapid succession, opening up a huge market for the treatment of the autoimmune joint disorder. Most of those biologics - drugs made using living cells - went on to notch blockbuster sales. In many ways, the market for drugs aimed at preventing migraine is at a similar juncture. Four pharma heavyweights including Amgen Inc as well as smaller drug developer Alder Biopharmaceuticals Inc are racing to bring their biologics to market. Amgen is expected to be the first to file a marketing application next year. (http://bit.ly/2hyb70G) "Migraine today can be characterized as similar to RA in the past, in that it's a large but under-treated, and also under-diagnosed, market," Piper Jaffray analyst Charles Duncan told Reuters. "The burden of disease in terms of patient quality of life, function, and resource utilization is also high. Because of these market dynamics, there is likely room for multiple agents - even of the same mechanism - to be profitable." Migraine patients are currently treated with a host of drugs including anti-depressants, hypertension medicines and even botox - with little success. About 40 million, or one in every eight Americans, suffer from migraines, 13 million of whom are afflicted with a severe form of the disease. The size of the migraine market is expected to increase to more than $10 billion in 2025 from about $3 billion in 2015 in the United States, parts of Europe and Japan, according to healthcare data provider Decision Resources Group. The lack of effective medicines and the sheer number of patients guarantee that each drug, if approved, will eventually generate at least $1 billion in sales, analysts said. The first three rheumatoid arthritis (RA) biologics - drugs made using living cells - were approved between 1998 and 2002, starting with Amgen's Enbrel. To be sure, these drugs were also approved for other autoimmune conditions, which in part contributed to their blockbuster sales. The migraine treatments could also be eventually used in other disorders characterized by headaches. SAFETY FIRST Amgen, which is developing its migraine drug in collaboration with Novartis AG, said last month the medicine succeeded in a second late-stage study. Late-stage data from the two other companies developing similar drugs - Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd - is expected in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Alder's ALD403 is expected to be the last to file for approval but could still capture a sizable share of the market, thanks to its less-frequent dosing schedule and multiple modes of administration. These drugs target a protein associated with pain signaling called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Most attempts at developing traditional, chemically-synthesized drugs targeting CGRP, including migraine-relief treatments from Merck & Co Inc, were abandoned due to toxicity concerns. Available safety and efficacy data on the new crop of biologics, however, has been encouraging and there is not much to differentiate the drugs. ASKING PRICE What could set the migraine drugs apart from RA treatments is pricing. AbbVie Inc's success, for instance, has been mainly driven by its RA treatment Humira - the world's top-selling drug. Biologics are typically more expensive than traditional drugs but Amgen and its rivals may end up pricing their migraine treatments more conservatively to avoid regulatory scrutiny. Drug pricing has become a lightening rod for criticism with several drugmakers coming under federal investigation for price gouging. Most analysts, however, agree that migraine drug companies could make up in volumes what they might lose in pricing. Insurers are also unlikely to push back, given the lack of effective medicines. For now, the drug developers are hopeful they will capture a large share of the market. "We've got 13 million candidate patients ... and at least initially there will be four drugs addressing what is five times as many patients (as the RA market)," Randy Shultz, chief executive of Alder, told Reuters. "We would argue that each of these drugs has the potential to be a blockbuster alongside each other."

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, according to the results published in The Lancet journal. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author. In the most recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa that started in late 2013, more than 11,000 people lost their lives. The WHO removed the global emergency tag for the disease early this year. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea's Ministry of Health and other international partners. The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects, the study reported. --IANS gb/vm SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Modi with charkha replaces Gandhiji!

The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea's Ministry of Health and other international partners. The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe amp; Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials had shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,000 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinee, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects, the study reported. --IANS gb/vm Share this article: Back to Irish Sun Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

The vaccine trial included nearly 12,000 people during 2015, when new cases of Ebola were still appearing in West Africa. Among 5,800 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. But 23 cases developed among those who did not get vaccinated, the researchers reported. The trial was conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), Guinea's Ministry of Health and international partners. The results were published Dec. 22 in The Lancet. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless," lead author Marie-Paule Kieny said in a journal news release. She is WHO's assistant director-general for health systems and innovation. The vaccine is called rVSV-ZEBOV. Vaccine maker Merck will submit the vaccine for regulatory approval by the end of 2017. The company has promised to make 300,000 doses available for emergency use in the interim. Further studies are needed to determine the vaccine's safety in children and other vulnerable groups, such as people with HIV, the researchers said. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa sickened more than 28,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and killed more than 11,000.

Final test results confirm Ebola vaccine highly effective by: JAMEY KEATEN, Associated Press Updated: Dec 22, 2016 - 9:15 PM Twtter GENEVA (AP) - Final test results confirm an experimental Ebola vaccine is highly effective, a major milestone that could help prevent the spread of outbreaks like the one that killed thousands in West Africa. Scientists have struggled to develop an Ebola vaccine over the years, and this is the first one proven to work. Efforts were ramped up after the infectious disease caused a major outbreak, beginning in 2013 in Guinea and spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,300 people died. The World Health Organization, which acknowledged shortcomings in its response to the West Africa outbreak, led the study of the vaccine, which was developed by the Canadian government and is now licensed to the U.S.-based Merck & Co. Results were published Thursday. Merck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe sometime next year. The experimental vaccine was given to about 5,800 people last year in Guinea, as the virus was waning. All had some contact with a new Ebola patient. They got the vaccine right away or three weeks later. After a 10-day waiting period, no Ebola cases developed in those immediately vaccinated, 23 cases turned up among those with delayed vaccination. The Lancet paper published Thursday mostly crystallizes what was already largely known from interim results released last year. The vaccine proved so effective that the study was stopped midway so that everyone exposed to Ebola in Guinea could be immunized. "I really believe that now we have a tool which would allow (us) to control a new outbreak of Ebola of the Zaire strain," said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a WHO assistant director-general who was the study's lead author. "It's the first vaccine for which efficacy has been shown." She noted that other Ebola vaccines are underdoing testing, and that a vaccine is also needed to protect against a second strain, Sudan. The virus first turned up in Africa in 1976 and had caused periodic outbreaks mostly in central Africa, but never with results as deadly as the West Africa outbreak. Many previous vaccine attempts have failed. Among the hurdles: the sporadic nature of outbreaks and funding shortages. ___ Online: WHO: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/en/ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Source: AP) A prototype vaccine for Ebola may be “up to 100 per cent effective” in protecting against the deadly virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday. If all goes well, the vaccine could become available in 2018 under a fast-track approval process, it said. In a major clinical trial, nearly 6,000 people in Guinea were given the test vaccine last year, at the tail end of a lethal epidemic of Ebola. Not one of the 6,000 contracted the disease. But in a control group of volunteers that did not receive the vaccine, 23 Ebola cases occurred, researchers reported in The Lancet medical journal. “If we compare zero to 23, this strongly suggests that the vaccine is very effective, that it could be up to 100 percent effective,” Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s assistant director-general and lead author of the study, told AFP. Watch What Else is Making News Her team of three dozen researchers calculated a 90-per cent likelihood during a full-fledged epidemic that the vaccine, dubbed rVSV-ZEBOV, would work in more than 80 percent of cases. “After 40 years, we appear to now have an effective vaccine for Ebola virus disease to build upon,” Thomas Geisbert, a scientist at Galveston National Laboratory in Texas who did not take part in the study, wrote in a commentary, also in The Lancet. First identified in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Ebola virus erupted periodically in outbreaks of up to a couple hundred cases, mainly across west and east Africa. In early 2014, however, a handful of infections in southern Guinea mushroomed rapidly into an epidemic. Over the next two years, more than 28,000 people fell ill, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some 11,300 died. With a mortality rate above 40 per cent, the disease –one of a category of so-called haemorrhagic fevers — has an incubation period of up to three weeks. It causes violent and painful symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhoea, organ failure and internal bleeding. The new vaccine was initially developed in Canada by public health authorities before being taken over by pharmaceutical giant Merck. It is slated to be submitted by Merck to health authorities in the United States and Europe sometime next year under a fast-track approval process. “We may have a vaccine which is registered in 2018,” Kieny told journalists at a press conference Thursday, noting that the standard approval process for a new drug takes a decade, if not more. In the meantime, Merck has committed to ensuring that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergencies under a protocol called “compassionate use”. “They will be able to produce a million in very short period of time,” Kieny noted.

The results offer hope of better protection against the disease that ravaged West Africa in 2014, killing more than 11,000 people. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured," said Dr. KeÏta Sakoba, the director of the national agency for health security in Guinea. The vaccine The experimental vaccine was given in 2015 to people in Guinea who were in contact with patients who had recently confirmed cases of Ebola. A few months after the early trials, the World Health Organization said the preliminary results were an "extremely promising development." While the study's participants were initially randomized, the process was stopped after initial results in order to get the vaccine to those in need. The trial involved more than 11,000 people, according to the WHO, which led the trial in conjunction with Guinea's Ministry of Health. A total of 5,837 people were given the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, and none had a recorded case of Ebola after 10 days or longer, the study says. Among people who were not immediately given the vaccine, there were 23 cases. Some people who had the vaccine reported headaches, fatigue and muscle pain. Two patients had serious reactions, including one who had an allergic reaction. Ring strategy Ebola was first discovered in 1976, and before the 2014 outbreak, it typically hit isolated African communities -- those outbreaks were much more manageable for medical teams to parachute in and treat patients. But the virus reached cities in 2014, spreading like wildfire and catching the global health community off guard. Ebola is highly contagious once patients are symptomatic, so as families and close-knit communities tried to care for sick loved ones, they risked infection. To combat this, researchers doled out the vaccine to so-called "clusters" or "rings" -- groups of people who had been in contact with an Ebola patient. It's the same strategy that was used to eradicate smallpox. "The premise is that by vaccinating all people who have come into contact with an infected person, you create a protective 'ring' and stop the virus from spreading further," John-Arne Rottingen of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, which has been involved in implementing the trial, told CNN last year. The vaccine was manufactured by Merck, Sharp & Dohme and is being fast-tracked by US and European regulatory agencies. Merck has promised to ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine will be available in case of a new Ebola flareup. It will submit the vaccine for licensing by the close of 2017.

A National Retail Federation services 12%. Of Americans surveyed would not by their last two gift. Until December 23 and nearly half of consumers. Planned to go shopping in the week after Christmas to your numbers and do your research jive with that. Well that that trend that we've seen over the last few years. Certainly. Would be brought to bear because I mean you know that's what we do is human beings now we leave everything and so last minute. I think of it you know I'm not I don't know that much about hockey. But when I watch hockey game all of the action seems to happen in their last two minutes. And that's what Christmas shopping really has become just like everything else we leave it to the end so that's what I'll be doing that we get out this all call anyway I don't know. You OK well how how is this Christmas shopping season. Going to be remembered. Well I think it will be remembered as transitional. As far as the way that. Three decades or so we we often thought of Christmas is. The shopping seasons starting the day after Thanksgiving and ending on that day before Christmas. And you mentioned in the lead it. That you know walk shopping the week after Christmas that week after. Has become at least as important as the week before because everything is on sale we gift cards we wanna target then. So retailers really rely on a good turnout that we but it starts so much earlier than it used to so the way that we can calculate those statistics. And how does this year shape up against last this year look. It's no longer an apples to apples comparison like it any type years ago. We're just let me ask you this will retailers. Ever ever managed to get shoppers not to wait until. The last minute or the last minute people the small percentage of of the bunch. No I think I think that you know try as we might you know we thank you for coming in shop every single day of the year. And but but. It's it's it's just such a busy time of the year and four I think just people walking around. Say at least it's just such a crunch time you've got everything from. You know all the activities that are happening school to kids coming home from college to all the nearly things that are going on. And suddenly think oh my gosh I've got to go shopping home. And that what retailers have done two things work a bit of the victim of our own marketing. I think customers know. Well that's right wait until the twentieth of December. I can get it for this much more often used to before they can be double edged sword if you wait too long it might lose the exact site but. But at the same time you might get a great price that's something else instead. I get a Eskew Amazon and they have changed the landscape over the years but now there's Amazon prime now. With two hour delivery and thirty cities what do you think about that. I hit it does you know Amazon continues to change everything that we do from from shopping to watching television. So. They're going to keep innovating they're going to keep coming up with ways to challenge the traditional brick and mortar retailers. Also every year what happens is there is that disappointing customer who didn't get that thing on time. You know politics is is a bad snowstorm in in a major hubs like Chicago. To slow down all the plane and then suddenly you have fewer things under the tree that you hope so again like like waiting until the last minute by something they might because. Ordering something can also be. I'm a double edged sword so so it's it's a judgment that we consumers ethnic all the time. And that we as retailers have face and figure out to this step up to that challenge. They tell have you guys ever done any research on what percentage of gifts bought. Those proposals for Christmas are ultimately returned after Christmas. Now as far as is that we haven't gotten that far into it but we do know that returns. You know written returns are of course a huge part of what turned into Christmas sale and how retailers calculate it. One of the things retailers hope is that when you come in and he do you view returning guests that you'll go back into the store by two things instead of the one that you return. But the problem too for retailers is that the retail basket this is a different story entirely for the return this concern. Is huge place where fraud can be perpetrated it can be really costly the merchant and ultimately the crisis that we can't shoppers. So Merck and have to be very careful about what they except as returns. But at the same time they have to be very open about it because. We want to make it easy. And if you got something that's the wrong size of off color we want to bring him back we want to lake historic optical back getting hit two instead of one. They just thank you a Merry Christmas. Seeing you thank you could attract as Ted intricacies executive vice president of the New York State retail. Cultural are our top stories are coming up today's also fest of this.

Namrata Tripathi   December 23, 2016 11:34 IST This is the first Ebola vaccine which has proven to work so well. . (Representational Image)Reuters The Ebola epidemic days may be behind us as reports state that an experimental vaccine for the deadly disease has proved to be almost 100 percent effective against the contagious infection. The success of the vaccine is a major milestone in the scientific research and can stop any future outbreaks of the disease. The Ebola epidemic, which started in December 2013 in Guinea, was termed the deadliest ever and majorly affected the lives of people in West African countries of Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Reports state that although the vaccine has not yet been approved by any regulatory authority, it is considered so effective that the researchers have already created an emergency stockpile of around 300,000 doses of it to use in any future flare-up of the disease which killed thousands of people in West Africa. Ever since Ebola was discovered in the former Zaire in 1976, researchers have been trying to formulate an effective vaccine with little success. The sense of urgency of coming up with vaccine usually dissipated due to lack of funding over the years. However, after Ebola struck Africa in 2013 and killed around 11,000 people in the most horrific ways, the urgency was renewed and the researchers set to work again with global funding for the vaccine. This is the first vaccine which has proved to work so well. It was said to be so effective that the testing was stopped early when the interim results of its effectiveness came out. The vaccine has been developed by the Canadian government and is now licensed to the U.S.-based Merck & Co. Merck. Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever transmitted by the Ebola viruses. The virus spreads by direct contact with body fluids of an infected person or an animal. It has killed over 11,000 people globally since its outbreak in December 2013 and affected over 28,000 people.

Karen HaoDec. 22, 2016 6:40 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email DragonImages/iStock Scientists have developed a vaccine that could successfully prevent the spread of Ebola, according to a study published Thursday in The Lancet. The study was conducted in response to the West African Ebola crisis—the largest and deadliest recorded Ebola outbreak to date—and is the first to report a promising solution for the deadly virus. Since December 2013, Ebola—a highly infectious virus that causes severe hemorrhagic fevers and has a 50 percent fatality rate—has killed over 11,300 people in West Africa. Considered a global health crisis, the outbreak took nearly two years to control and was complicated by a lack of international funding and widespread fear and mistrust of doctors among African locals. Though the virus was discovered in 1976, early attempts to develop vaccines stalled in the absence of financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies. Until 2014, Ebola outbreaks were rare and controlled relatively quickly. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless," said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, the World Health Organization's assistant director-general for health systems and innovation, and a lead author of the study, in a press release accompanying the study. Though the virus was discovered in 1976, early attempts to develop vaccines stalled in the absence of financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies. Amid the Ebola crisis, researchers from the WHO and more than a dozen other international partners, tested the new vaccine on 5,937 at-risk individuals in Guinea and found it was 100 percent effective when administered soon after exposure. None of the roughly 3,900 people vaccinated within three weeks of Ebola exposure ended up catching the virus 10 or more days after the vaccination. (Researchers discounted any individuals who got Ebola within 10 days—the typical incubation period for the virus—under the assumption that they had already contracted it prior to vaccination.) The vaccine appears to be less effective the longer the researches waited after an exposure: Of the roughly 2,000 people vaccinated more than three weeks after an exposure, 16 got Ebola. To find people at risk of getting Ebola, researchers used a unique method, "ring vaccination," inspired by the strategy used to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. Each time a new Ebola case was confirmed, researchers traced all the people the patient had come in direct contact with, as well as the people who had come in contact with those people within the previous three weeks. The clusters, or "rings," were then randomly assigned to either immediate or delayed vaccinations. After noticing positive results in the first few months, the researchers stopped the delayed vaccinations altogether. Eventually, the researchers began vaccinating children, which was also 100 percent effective. The "ring vaccination" technique additionally had a positive impact on public health: Communities of those who were vaccinated were also less likely to get sick. That proved crucial not only in studying the vaccine, but also in quashing the outbreak itself. The team still needs to do more research on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations, such as people with HIV. Other questions also remain about how long the protective effects of a single vaccination can last and whether it can be modified to reduce side effects without compromising efficacy. In the meantime, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, a global health partnership that includes the WHO, gave $5 million to pharmaceutical giant Merck in January to procure the vaccine after its approval. Merck also committed to making 300,000 doses of the vaccine available, should an emergency arise in the interim. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country," Dr KeÏta Sakoba, coordinator of the Ebola response in Guinea, said in the press release. "We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured." Get the scoop,  straight from Mother Jones.

RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images A vaccine has been shown to prevent ebola for the first time, giving doctors a weapon against the next outbreak. The jab offered 100 per cent protection during a trial that fast-tracked testing during last year’s epidemic. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s ebola epidemic, they show that when the next ebola outbreak hits we will not be defenceless,” said Marie-Paule Kieny, of the World Health Organisation, who led the trial.

The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015.
