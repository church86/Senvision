The campaign is championed by Aisha Buhari, wife of President Muhammadu Buhari. The launch held in Abuja, Nigeria is in partnership with Senate Committee on Health; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development and Future Assured organization. Merck More than a Mother continues its commitment to break stigma around infertility and empower infertile women by improving access to information, education, healthcare and change of culture and mind-set to de-stigmatize infertility. In her address, Mrs. Buhari pledged her support and the support of Nigerian governors’ wives in the implementation of Merck More than a Mother’s activities in Nigeria focusing on eliminating infertility stigma and creating awareness and providing information and education on causes of infertility; facilitating access to healthcare; and economic and social empowerment of infertile women. The Nigerian women leaders also supported the empowering of infertile women who form a vulnerable part of the population. Infertile women in Nigeria and many other African countries who can no longer be treated have been empowered socially and economically to lead independent and happier lives through Empowering Berna initiative. Empowering Berna is part of Merck More than a Mother campaign. Helen Phillip, a Nigerian woman from the North, shared her story of suffering from infertility stigma and expressed her gratitude to the support Merck more than a Mother provided her through establishing new business so that she could become an independent productive member in her community.

Women have not been coming out openly because they are traumatized. With this campaign we will encourage them to speak out and we pledge our support and collaboration,” Aisha Alhassan, Nigeria’s minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, said. “Merck More than a Mother campaign is a great initiative to break the stigma around infertility and to empower an unprivileged category of women in Africa, women who suffer infertility. Infertile women have been neglected, mistreated and discriminated because they cannot bear a child, yet 50% of infertility is due to male factors. We can together improve access to education, information, awareness, health care and change of mind-set and culture to stop these women’s suffering,” Rasha Kelej, chief social officer, Merck Healthcare, said. Isaac Adewole, minister of Health, said: “We are responsible for policy at the Ministry level and this is where we can make a difference in improving access to fertility care in Nigeria. We will work through training institutions we are responsible for to strengthen fertility management by making it a sub-specialty. We will also as a Ministry work with private sector, the Senate and the National Assembly to improve governance and quality of care to provide standards to protect infertile men and women seeking treatment.” Merck More than a Mother was first implemented in Kenya in 2015 followed by Uganda, Cote d’Ivoire, Central African Republic and Nigeria. —  Jan 9, 2017 @ 18:40 GMT | No Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 09, 2017 11:40am   Comments Share: Related ZIOP Ziopharm Traders Got A Little Too Excited Watch These 5 Huge Call Purchases In Tuesday Trade Benzinga recently had the chance to speak with ZIOPHARM Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ: ZIOP) CEO Dr. Laurence James Neil Cooper about the upcoming JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, partnerships with Intrexon Corp (NYSE: XON) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and whether shareholders should be concerned about the company’s rising expenses. JPMorgan Conference Cooper will be presenting at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference on Wednesday. Cooper said that his presentation at the conference will focus on the cancer side of Ziopharm’s gene therapy research. Ziopharm’s viral therapy program involves using engineered adenovirus to control delivery of a cytokine called interleukin 12, or IL-12. “We have essentially completed the Phase 1 trial,” Cooper told Benzinga. “We expect to be at the FDA to discuss that trial and the next steps, and we are anticipating that we’re going to be a Phase 3 company next year.” Cooper added that a pivotal trial for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) could be a banner moment for Ziopharm. “I can’t promise, but all the indications are going in that direction,” he said. Strategic Partnerships Last year, Ziopharm renegotiated a long-standing partnership with Intrexon for an 80/20 split of unpartnered programs in favor of Ziopharm. “We renegotiated out relationship with Intrexon for the purposes of essentially looking more like a biotechnology company, in other words a company that if somebody is interested in us, I am not saying they are, but if they were interested in us, they would essentially be able to understand the relationship with Intrexon as a partner with us,” Cooper clarified. In addition, Merck has partnered with Ziopharm and selected a pair of undisclosed CAR targets, a project about which Cooper says he is “very happy at the moment.” R&D Spending Cooper noted that Ziopharm has made a conscious decision to ramp-up its spending in recent quarters. “We needed to complete essentially the adenoviral trial to get to the FDA so we could turn the corner and be in the pivotal trials,” Cooper told Benzinga. “So our cash position supports all of that, supports our ability to take on the registration trial.” However, Cooper acknowledged that the cash won’t last forever. When asked about the possibility of raising cash in the coming quarter, Cooper said the company will explore all options. “We may or may not. We have not made a decision about that,” he said, adding that partnering some of the programs, such as the NK cell program or the adenoviral program, could also help solve any cash issues. Looking Ahead When Benzinga asked what investors have in store in coming quarters, Cooper said he is hoping to provide shareholders with some important updates. “We are really looking forward to being able to update the Street about our adenoviral program with GBM. If we can get this essentially through the next period of regulatory review, we have a complete shot on goal to make a drug and commercialize it,” he said. In addition to the adenoviral trial, Cooper said Ziopharm will continue to explore the viability of its TCR program and its NK cell programs in 2017.

The launch held in Abuja, Nigeria is in partnership with Senate Commission on Health; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development and Future Assured organization. Merck More than a Mother continues its commitment to break stigma around infertility and empower infertile women by improving access to information, education, healthcare and change of culture and mind-set to de-stigmatize infertility. Her Excellency Mrs. Buhari pledged her support and the support of Nigerian Governors’ wives in the implementation of Merck More than a Mother’s activities in Nigeria focusing on eliminating infertility stigma and creating awareness and providing information and education on causes of infertility; facilitating access to healthcare; and economic and social empowerment of infertile women. The Nigerian women leaders also supported the empowering of infertile women who form a vulnerable part of the population. Infertile women in Nigeria and many other African countries who can no longer be treated have been empowered socially and economically to lead independent and happier lives through Empowering Berna initiative. Empowering Berna is part of Merck More than a Mother campaign. Helen Phillip, a Nigerian woman from the North shared her story of suffering from infertility stigma and expressed her gratitude to the support Merck more than a Mother provided her through establishing new business so that she can become an independent productive member in her community.

Women have not been coming out openly because they are traumatized. With this campaign we will encourage them to speak out and we pledge our support and collaboration,” said Hon. Aisha Alhassan, Nigeria’s Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development.  “Merck More than a Mother campaign is a great initiative to break the stigma around infertility and to empower an unprivileged category of women in Africa, women who suffer infertility. Infertile women have been neglected, mistreated and discriminated because they cannot bear a child, yet 50% of infertility is due to male factors. We can together improve access to education, information, awareness, health care and change of mind-set and culture to stop these women’s suffering,” said Dr. Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. Prof. Isaac Adewole Hon. Minister of Health emphasized: “We are responsible for policy at the Ministry level and this is where we can make a difference in improving access to fertility care in Nigeria. We will work through training institutions we are responsible for to strengthen fertility management by making it a sub-specialty. We will also as a Ministry work with private sector, the Senate and the National Assembly to improve governance and quality of care to provide standards to protect infertile men and women seeking treatment.” Merck More than a Mother was first implemented in Kenya in 2015 followed by Uganda, Cote d’Ivoire, Central African Republic and Nigeria.

Incyte and Merck to Advance Clinical Development Program Investigating the Combination of Epacadostat with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Additional pivotal studies evaluating Incyte’s IDO1 inhibitor in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with non-small cell lung, renal, bladder and head and neck cancers expected to start in 2017 Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Small Preview Thumbnail January 09, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time WILMINGTON, Del. & KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Incyte Corporation (Nasdaq:INCY) and Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the decision to advance the clinical development program investigating the combination of epacadostat, Incyte’s investigational oral selective IDO1 inhibitor, with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy. With the expansion of the clinical development program, the companies plan to initiate pivotal studies of epacadostat in combination with KEYTRUDA in four additional tumors: non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Presentations of data from the ongoing studies of epacadostat in combination with KEYTRUDA, which support this decision, are expected at upcoming medical meetings. “We are very pleased to announce the decision with Merck to initiate additional Phase 3 studies that will further evaluate the clinical utility of epacadostat in combination with KEYTRUDA,” said Steven Stein, M.D., Incyte’s Chief Medical Officer. “Data from across the ECHO development program for epacadostat continues to be accrued, including from the ECHO-202 Phase 2 cohorts in combination with KEYTRUDA which support the decision to move forward into pivotal studies beyond melanoma. We look forward to initiation of these new Phase 3 trials as we seek to help improve clinical outcomes for patients with these cancers.” “The expansion of our clinical trial program with Incyte is an important component of our comprehensive approach to investigating the potential for KEYTRUDA in combination with promising compounds, such as epacadostat, to help make a difference in the lives of people with these cancers,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president, head of clinical development, and Chief Medical Officer, Merck Research Laboratories. About ECHO The ECHO clinical trial program was established to investigate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat as a core component of combination therapy in oncology. Ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating epacadostat in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors collectively plan to enroll over 900 patients in a broad range of solid tumor types as well as hematological malignancies. ECHO-301 (NCT02752074), a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating pembrolizumab in combination with epacadostat or placebo for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, is also underway. ECHO-301 was initiated in June 2016 and initial data from this study are expected to be available in 2018. About Epacadostat (INCB024360) Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a key immunosuppressive enzyme that modulates the anti-tumor immune response by promoting regulatory T cell generation and blocking effector T cell activation, thereby facilitating tumor growth by allowing cancer cells to avoid immune surveillance. Epacadostat is a first-in-class, highly potent and selective oral inhibitor of the IDO1 enzyme that reverses tumor-associated immune suppression and restores effective anti-tumor immune responses. In single-arm studies, the combination of epacadostat and immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown proof-of-concept in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In these studies, epacadostat combined with the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab or the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab improved response rates compared with studies of the immune checkpoint inhibitors alone. About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single use vial. KEYTRUDA Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis.

Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA.

Soon, everyone else will get a chance. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jan 9, 2017 at 8:22AM You might be too busy to pay much attention to every tiny biotech that goes public. There's one initial public offering (IPO) coming up, though, that I think you'll want to keep your eyes on. Jounce Therapeutics filed a few days ago for an IPO in 2017. Any company that Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) is willing to invest in big-time is one that is worth watching.  Image source: Getty Images. What Celgene liked Jounce has a grand total of one candidate in clinical testing -- experimental cancer drug JTX-2011. And it's only in early-stage development. JTX-2011 has enough potential, though, that Celgene paid the small biotech $225 million up front and bought a $36 million stake in the company. The deal also includes an option for Celgene to license up to four other immunotherapies. What's the attraction for JTX-2011? It's a monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates a protein known as ICOS (which is a lot easier to say than its full name -- inducible T-cell co-stimulator). ICOS is found on the surface of white blood cells produced or processed by the thymus gland (called T cells) that are found in many solid tumors. Jounce thinks that JTX-2011 can amplify the immune response in "good" T cells within a tumor while reducing the number of "bad" T cells. This double whammy just might prove effective at fighting cancer. In pre-clinical testing, Jounce found that JTX-2011 stimulates a significant T cell immune response against solid tumors. The biotech currently has a phase 1/2 clinical study in progress with safety data expected in the first half of 2017 and preliminary efficacy data in the second half of the year. For precision medicines like Jounce's JTX-2011 to be most effective, the patients that can benefit from the drugs need to first be identified. Celgene really liked that Jounce has a way to prioritize targets and potential predictive biomarkers to match the right therapy to the right patients. Jounce calls its approach for accomplishing this its "Translational Science Platform." This platform allows the biotech to profile the immune cellular and molecular characteristics of human solid tumors. The biotech thinks that this biomarker-driven approach will ultimately enable it to develop companion diagnostics for its therapies. Combinations on the way Jounce's clinical study is evaluating JTX-2011 as a stand-alone treatment and in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) Opdivo. Jounce also has plans to test its lead candidate with its own anti-PD-1 antibody, JTX-4014, at some point down the road. JTX-4014 is currently in pre-clinical testing. While JTX-2011 is only being evaluated in combination with Opdivo right now, there's no reason to think Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug is the only potential combo partner. Jounce stated in its IPO filing that it intends to explore use of JTX-2011 in combination with "other future product candidates." I'd put Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda high on the list. Keytruda has already demonstrated better efficacy than Opdivo as a first-line treatment of lung cancer in clinical studies. Merck is moving ahead with clinical studies of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy and several other drugs. JTX-2011 should be a good fit as well. A good bet? There's an old saying that you don't bet on the horse -- you bet on the jockey. In Jounce's case, I'd say the horse and the jockey(s) could be good bets.  One of Jounce's founders is James Allison. Dr. Allison is currently chairman of immunology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the leading cancer research centers in the world. He was one of the first scientists to identify the T cell receptor and is recognized as one of the pioneers of cancer immunotherapy. Allison's research helped lead to the development of Bristol-Myers Squibb's blockbuster CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor Yervoy. The company's CEO, Richard Murray, came from Merck. Murray most recently served as Merck's senior vice president of biologics and vaccine research. Chief scientific officer Deborah Law also came from Merck, where she served as vice president of therapy area biology for immunology, oncology, and immunomodulators. It wouldn't be surprising if those Merck connections help open doors for combo studies with Keytruda. Jounce's IPO hopes to raise $75 million. That shouldn't be hard to do. The biotech already has over $271 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, boosted largely by the Celgene deal. If there's one biotech IPO to watch in 2017, I think Jounce is it.  Keith Speights owns shares of Celgene. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Celgene.

Julia Bradshaw 9 January 2017 • 12:04am The pharmaceuticals industry is set for a surge in deal-making this year, as companies under pressure from weak drugs pricing and higher costs take advantage of low valuations and a tax-friendly political climate in the US to bolster faltering sales growth. Even those with solid growth prospects may pursue M&A, leading to a sharp rise in the value of deals this year, according to a report from EY. “This could be a banner year for deal-making, as industry and political forces converge,” said Pamela Spence, a co-author of the report. “From a macro perspective, there was pent-up demand for deals in a holding pattern going into the US presidential election, but the deal chatter in the waning weeks of 2016 indicate much firepower could soon be unleashed in 2017.” Global pharmaceutical firms have navigated choppy waters in recent years. Spiralling R&D costs have eroded margins while blockbuster drugs have lost their patents, hitting profit growth. Drugs pricing and reimbursement have becoming thorny issues for Big Pharma Meanwhile, pricing pressure in the US and stricter reimbursement rules from health authorities in other countries have piled further pressure on the likes of Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline. Political uncertainty in the US in the run up to the presidential elections weighed further on the valuations of these companies. That meant that the value of M&A deals in the sector fell to $273.7bn (£222bn) last year, a far cry from the $392.4bn recorded in 2015, according to figures from Mergermarket. “Biotech and big pharma valuations fell steadily throughout the year,” the EY report said. "This trend may offer further clues to 2017’s outlook. The last time biopharma valuations experienced such acute declines was during the 2008 financial crisis. This pronounced downturn was quickly followed by a handful of 2009 megadeals.” Indeed, 2009 was the year in which Pfizer bought Wyeth, Roche bought Genentech, and Merck acquired Schering-Plough. “So there’s a precedent for big pharma ramping up deal-making in 2017, and potentially dominating M&A share for several years,” said the report. Expectations that Donald Trump’s administration will relax corporate tax rates and allow US companies to repatriate the billions of dollars worth of cash stockpiled overseas at a low, one-off charge, will give US pharmaceuticals a huge amount of firepower with which to pursue acquisitions to bolster growth. Like him or not, his tax policies are favoured by corporates Jeffrey Greene, one of the report’s authors, said: “You tend to see companies acting in advance of regulatory changes, rather than waiting, so I think we will see a few very large deals greater than $20bn or so. "It's likely that we will have more mega mergers among the top 25 pharmaceutical companies in the world, but there will be deals all the way down the spectrum." Ms Spence also expects a wave of divestitures, where companies sell off parts of their business, as well as further asset swaps, in a similar vein to the one carried out by GlaxoSmithKline and Swiss drugs giant Novartis in 2015. “There will also be several smaller, specific straight bolt on acquisitiosn that fuel the R&D pipeline, which tend to go under the radar, as well as further joint ventures between pharma and technology companies, such as Alphabet which did a deal last year with GSK.” This year could also herald a spate of M&A from cash-rich Asian companies looking to gain a foothold in US and European markets. The Chinese are eyeing up western pharmaceutical assets “I think we will see acquisitions from Asia inbound to the US and Europe,” Ms Spence said. “But because of the nature of the capital, which is mostly private equity, it is difficult to estimate how much funding there is for inorganic growth, but it’s certainly an area to watch.” She added: “I see this as a potential tipping point. Companies have been cautious over last 18 months, especially big pharma, but they know which assets they want and it is going to be a first mover advantage. "So, there will be a little bit of a price war as some assets are more desireable than others. My advice to the industry is don’t hold back if you know what you want, go and get it.” Follow Telegraph Business READ MORE ABOUT: Biotech Pharmaceutical industry Show more Business latest 15 Jan 2017, 11:12pm Danger of fresh steel crisis eases as industry wins relief green taxes 15 Jan 2017, 11:01pm Davos 2017: what to expect as global leaders gather ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration 15 Jan 2017, 10:48pm Comment: Trump’s win, the Brexit vote… life is tough for today’s market pundits Tom Stevenson Premium 15 Jan 2017, 10:41pm Comment: Whisper it, but this could be a good year for growth Roger Bootle Premium 15 Jan 2017, 10:26pm The Duchess of Cambridge's fashion favourites among festive performers 15 Jan 2017, 10:23pm O2 and Vodafone hope mast deal will help battle with BT  15 Jan 2017, 10:19pm Mauritius payment knocks Fundsmith profits despite surge of new customers 15 Jan 2017, 10:19pm Mitie's new chief set to review accounting at troubled outsourcer 15 Jan 2017, 10:17pm Blackrock launches fight against oversized pay packets and undeserved pensions 15 Jan 2017, 10:16pm Wellesley to freeze crowdfunding campaign as it courts City investors 15 Jan 2017, 10:08pm Javad Marandi: from Iranian refugee to Soho House investor 15 Jan 2017, 9:29pm Comment: In 2017, responsible leaders must start to take action Martin Gilbert Premium 15 Jan 2017, 9:14pm Rare earth miner to list Burundi project on London Stock Exchange 15 Jan 2017, 8:54pm High time for a high-rise?

"Those are illness that could bankrupt our society if we don't get good solutions to them," he said in an interview with CNBC's "Closing Bell." The pharmaceutical industry has come under scrutiny for the cost of prescription drugs, with President-elect Donald Trump vowing to do something to bring down prices. Frazier said Merck has tried to take a "responsible approach" to pricing. "Affordability is critical so that patients have access to medicines. At the same time, it's also important that we have the kind of incentives that allow us to do the kinds of studies that we need to do to go after these diseases like Alzheimer's," he said.

Jan 09, 2017, 16:05 ET Share this article SAN DIEGO, Jan. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: HALO), a biotechnology company developing novel oncology and drug-delivery therapies, today provided program updates and its annual financial guidance at the 35th annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference. "We enter the year with strongly supportive data from our HALO 202 study in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients and momentum in our HALO 301 global registration trial for our investigational new drug PEGPH20 in a similar, targeted HA-High patient population," said Dr. Helen Torley, president and chief executive officer. "In 2017 we expect to make continued progress demonstrating the pan-tumor potential of PEGPH20, as we also focus on near-term catalysts in our revenue-generating ENHANZE™ platform, including the potential approval of rituximab SC in the U.S. and progressing other partnered programs in the clinic." In addition to HALO 301, the company has ongoing studies of PEGPH20 in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in gastric and non-small-cell lung cancer patients and in collaboration with Eisai in combination with HALAVEN® (eribulin) in breast cancer patients. Two new studies exploring four tumor types are planned to start in 2017 as part of a recently announced clinical collaboration with Genentech. Under the collaboration, Genentech will evaluate PEGPH20 in combination with its anti-PDL1 TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab) in pancreas and gastric cancer and Halozyme will evaluate the same combination in gallbladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. Halozyme has also been included in an innovative, patient-centered clinical trial planned for initiation in 2017 called Precision Promise, led by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. In the Halozyme ENHANZE™ platform business, the company announced in November 2016 that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted Genentech's Biologics License Application for a subcutaneous formulation of rituximab in multiple blood cancer indications with an action date in June. This is a co-formulation with Halozyme's proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme (ENHANZE platform), approved and marketed under the MabThera® SC brand in countries outside the U.S. In addition, Halozyme plans in 2017 to support ongoing development of subcutaneous formulations for Roche's PERJETA® and Janssen's DARZALEX®, work with existing ENHANZE platform partners to advance development of additional licensed targets, and seek to sign new global licensing and collaboration agreements. The company also provided financial guidance for 2017 of: Revenue of $115 million to $130 million, excluding revenue from any new ENHANZE global collaboration and licensing agreements that may be signed during the year. The company expects to report $20 million in 2016 revenue for reimbursed partner R&D expenses that will not recur in 2017; Operating Expenses of $240 million to $250 million, supporting the ongoing Phase 3 study in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients and the continued execution of clinical programs to study the pan-tumor potential of PEGPH20; Year-end cash balance of $100 million to $110 million. Dr. Torley will present at 3 p.m. PST, Jan. 9 at the conference. Her presentation will be webcast through the "Investors" section of www.halozyme.com, and a recording will be made available for 90 days following the event. To access the live webcast, please log on approximately fifteen minutes prior to the presentation to register and download any necessary audio software.

Energy stocks declined with the price of oil amid an increase of US drilling.  Even so, optimism remains that Wall Street will continue to scale fresh record highs. "Our view about the Dow [hitting] 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," Matt Jones, US head of equity strategy at JP Morgan Private Bank in New York, told Reuters. Meanwhile, investors flocked to the perceived safety of US Treasuries, pushing yields on the 10-year note four basis points lower to 2.38 percent. Shares of VCA soared after Mars said it agreed to buy the pet healthcare provider with about 800 animal hospitals in the US and Canada, for about US$7.7 billion to grow its pet business.  Privately-held Mars will acquire all of the outstanding shares of VCA for US$93 per share, or a total value of about US$9.1 billion including US$1.4 billion in outstanding debt, the McLean, Virginia-based company said in a statement. Shares of VCA soared 28 percent to US$90.60 as of noon trading in New York. “VCA is a leader across pet health care and the opportunity we see together—for pets, pet owners, veterinarians and other pet care providers —is tremendous,” Mars Chief Executive Officer Grant Reid said in a statement. “Together, we will be able to provide even greater value, better service and higher quality care to pets andpet owners.”  In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.5 percent drop from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index declined 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index slid 0.5 percent. However, the UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.4 percent as exporters benefitted from a weakening pound, declining more than 1 percent against the greenback, amid concern about the UK’s Brexit strategy following comments by Prime Minister Theresa May. "The market just takes the most negative view—it assumes that because May is keeping her cards as close as possible to her chest, there is no plan for Brexit and that we're going to 'hard Brexit' out of the EU," BMO Capital Markets currency strategist Stephen Gallo told Reuters.

The law — House Bill 2 (HB2) — has incited a state-wide civil liberties battle. Here is the timeline of the so-called "bathroom bill." Ali Rizvi, Nicole L. Cvetnic and Sohail Al-Jamea / McClatchy The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) civil rights organization, and Equality NC, the statewide organization working to secure equal rights and justice for LGBTQ North Carolinians, and other civic leaders held a press conference on, Monday, Sept. 19, 2016 at the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center. Some companies that opposed House Bill 2 contributed money to the campaigns of lawmakers who voted for the law and the governor who signed it. John D. Simmons jsimmons@charlotteobserver.com 1 of 2 i By Jim Morrill and Gavin Off jmorrill@charlotteobserver.com goff@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Nearly 200 companies joined the fight last year against North Carolina’s House Bill 2, signing on to public protests and affirming their commitment to LGBT rights. But some of those same companies, mainly through their political action committees, contributed money to the campaigns of lawmakers from both parties who voted for the law and the governor who signed it. PACs representing a half-dozen companies gave almost $200,000 to North Carolina lawmakers who voted for HB2, according to an Observer analysis. Some support was less direct. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which criticized HB2, gave $600,000 to the Republican Governors Association. The RGA in turn spent $3.6 million on behalf of former GOP Gov. Pat McCrory. Pfizer also gave $170,000 to a GOP group that spent almost a million dollars to re-elect Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a vocal HB2 supporter. When it passed last March, HB2 created a national backlash. Critics said the law, which requires transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate in government buildings, discriminates against the LGBT community. Many companies took a stand in protest. [List of companies supporting, opposing HB2] To be sure, many PACs and executives who publicly opposed HB2 also gave to Democrats and McCrory’s opponent, Roy Cooper. And companies, like individuals, have multiple interests. Bank of America’s PAC, for example, gave $2,000 to GOP and Democratic caucuses in the House and the Senate. “We interact on a bipartisan basis with public officials on a range of topics,” said a bank spokesman, Dan Frahm. “And we have been public and consistent with our support for repeal of HB2.” Gay rights advocates say contributors should consider a candidate’s stand on HB2. “We strongly encourage companies committed to leading the way forward to include LGBTQ legal equality among the priorities they consider when they’re supporting candidates,” said Stephen Peters, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest gay rights group. One Charlotte transgender activist criticized the donations. “That’s hypocritical if they say they’re supporters,” said Erica Lachowitz. Pfizer’s contributions Last spring the HRC released a list of 130 companies and CEOs opposed to the law. Most of those companies – including prominent names such as Starbucks, Facebook, Apple, IBM and Kellogg’s – have no PACs registered in North Carolina and don’t routinely get involved in N.C. campaigns. Among those that do, a half-dozen PACs had given $192,000 to McCrory and Republican lawmakers who voted for HB2 through September, the last reports available. Final reports are due this month. New York-based Pfizer, which has a manufacturing plant in Sanford, gave $25,000 to GOP lawmakers through its PAC in addition to the company’s contributions to the RGA and the Republican State Leadership Committee. The RSLC spent $850,000 on behalf of Forest. “We contribute to policymakers from both sides of the aisle based on their stance on issues that impact patient access to innovative medicines and vaccines,” said spokeswoman Sharon Castillo. “Our contributions are not based on a policy maker’s position on any social, religious or political issue. To suggest otherwise is both inaccurate and misleading.” Wells Fargo’s PAC gave at least $61,700 to lawmakers who supported HB2. Asked about the contributions, Wells offered a statement saying, “Gov. McCrory and other elected officials were well aware of our opposition to HB2.” PACs for Merck, Pepsico and Time Warner Cable also gave to McCrory or lawmakers who voted for HB2. ‘Multiple interests’ The PAC for Merck, which has two state manufacturing facilities, gave McCrory and GOP lawmakers at least $41,000. Chairman and CEO Kenneth Frazier signed the HRC’s letter protesting HB2. “Our company is committed to participating constructively and responsibly in the political process,” Merck spokeswoman Lanie Keller said in a statement. “The PAC supports legislators from both major parties who understand and appreciate the work we do … “Our chairman and CEO … joined corporate leaders across the country in signing open letters that urge lawmakers in North Carolina to repeal HB2, because it sanctions discriminatory practices.” The Observer also looked at contributions through September from employees of the roughly 185 companies that publicly denounced HB2. Workers for at least 33 companies donated to North Carolina’s Republican Party or party leaders after the bill was signed. McCrory received more than $54,000, the Observer found. Employees making donations ranged from secretaries and accountants to professors and social workers. Some were retired. Workers at 65 of the companies gave to Cooper or the Democratic Party. Cooper received some $313,000 and the party, $344,000. Individuals give money for reasons of their own, including their party affiliation. Companies also give for a variety of reasons. For many it’s access. Campaign contributions typically flow to those in positions of power. “(Companies) have multiple interests,” said Eric Heberlig, a political scientist at UNC Charlotte. “If they think Republicans are going to be more helpful to them on taxes or regulations they still have an incentive to support them, even if they disagree on social issues or things like HB2.” HB2 has been blamed for the loss of jobs, sporting events and millions in lost visitor spending. Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality NC, said companies and their PACs should see the law as an economic issue. “Doing business in a state like North Carolina is that much harder when candidates actively work against LGBT equality,” he said. Staff writer Deon Roberts contributed. Contributions Some PACs whose affiliated companies publicly opposed HB2 contributed to N.C. Republican lawmakers who passed it and to former Gov. Pat McCrory. Here are some, along with company executives who signed an open letter from the Human Rights Campaign protesting the law.

Soon, everyone else will get a chance. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jan 9, 2017 at 8:22AM You might be too busy to pay much attention to every tiny biotech that goes public. There's one initial public offering (IPO) coming up, though, that I think you'll want to keep your eyes on. Jounce Therapeutics filed a few days ago for an IPO in 2017. Any company that Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) is willing to invest in big-time is one that is worth watching.  Image source: Getty Images. What Celgene liked Jounce has a grand total of one candidate in clinical testing -- experimental cancer drug JTX-2011. And it's only in early-stage development. JTX-2011 has enough potential, though, that Celgene paid the small biotech $225 million up front and bought a $36 million stake in the company. The deal also includes an option for Celgene to license up to four other immunotherapies. What's the attraction for JTX-2011? It's a monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates a protein known as ICOS (which is a lot easier to say than its full name -- inducible T-cell co-stimulator). ICOS is found on the surface of white blood cells produced or processed by the thymus gland (called T cells) that are found in many solid tumors. Jounce thinks that JTX-2011 can amplify the immune response in "good" T cells within a tumor while reducing the number of "bad" T cells. This double whammy just might prove effective at fighting cancer. In pre-clinical testing, Jounce found that JTX-2011 stimulates a significant T cell immune response against solid tumors. The biotech currently has a phase 1/2 clinical study in progress with safety data expected in the first half of 2017 and preliminary efficacy data in the second half of the year. For precision medicines like Jounce's JTX-2011 to be most effective, the patients that can benefit from the drugs need to first be identified. Celgene really liked that Jounce has a way to prioritize targets and potential predictive biomarkers to match the right therapy to the right patients. Jounce calls its approach for accomplishing this its "Translational Science Platform." This platform allows the biotech to profile the immune cellular and molecular characteristics of human solid tumors. The biotech thinks that this biomarker-driven approach will ultimately enable it to develop companion diagnostics for its therapies. Combinations on the way Jounce's clinical study is evaluating JTX-2011 as a stand-alone treatment and in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) Opdivo. Jounce also has plans to test its lead candidate with its own anti-PD-1 antibody, JTX-4014, at some point down the road. JTX-4014 is currently in pre-clinical testing. While JTX-2011 is only being evaluated in combination with Opdivo right now, there's no reason to think Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug is the only potential combo partner. Jounce stated in its IPO filing that it intends to explore use of JTX-2011 in combination with "other future product candidates." I'd put Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda high on the list. Keytruda has already demonstrated better efficacy than Opdivo as a first-line treatment of lung cancer in clinical studies. Merck is moving ahead with clinical studies of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy and several other drugs. JTX-2011 should be a good fit as well. A good bet? There's an old saying that you don't bet on the horse -- you bet on the jockey. In Jounce's case, I'd say the horse and the jockey(s) could be good bets.  One of Jounce's founders is James Allison. Dr. Allison is currently chairman of immunology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the leading cancer research centers in the world. He was one of the first scientists to identify the T cell receptor and is recognized as one of the pioneers of cancer immunotherapy. Allison's research helped lead to the development of Bristol-Myers Squibb's blockbuster CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor Yervoy. The company's CEO, Richard Murray, came from Merck. Murray most recently served as Merck's senior vice president of biologics and vaccine research. Chief scientific officer Deborah Law also came from Merck, where she served as vice president of therapy area biology for immunology, oncology, and immunomodulators. It wouldn't be surprising if those Merck connections help open doors for combo studies with Keytruda. Jounce's IPO hopes to raise $75 million. That shouldn't be hard to do. The biotech already has over $271 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, boosted largely by the Celgene deal. If there's one biotech IPO to watch in 2017, I think Jounce is it.  Keith Speights owns shares of Celgene. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Celgene.

Heavens The charm of a New England village, in South Jersey Jan 15 When tax abatements expire, property values don't suffer, study shows Jan 15 When a new fence fails to impress Jan 15 One in a continuing series spotlighting real estate markets in the region's communities. Slideshow A place where many roads (and a few rails) lead Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon What road should you take to get to Upper Gwynedd? Unlike many locations in the region, this Montgomery County township gives you a choice, which makes a visit there all the more interesting. A favorite route is Sumneytown Pike, which will take you through North Wales. Or there are Route 202 and Welsh Road, both of which take you through Lansdale. Upper Gwynedd provides a fabulous interactive map at app.skyline.carrigangeo.com/view/3GYXHA8ua5D - not so much to help you find Smile Lane, but to give you a better feel for the township's real estate. (For those rail-riders among you, SEPTA's Doylestown Line trains stop at Pennbrook station in Upper Gwynedd and North Wales.) It's very clear that Upper Gwynedd is interested in managing the growth that can often overwhelm towns in areas that are targeted by both residential and commercial developers. That's why it supports the 240-acre Gwynedd Wildlife Preserve, which, in turn, supports a diverse variety of habitats, including ponds and wetlands, open meadows, wildflower meadows, hedgerows, deciduous forests, and conifer plantations. Upper Gwynedd is also the home of Merck & Co., the pharmaceuticals giant and one of the area's major employers, with facilities in the West Point section and elsewhere in the 8.1-square-mile township. According to Diane Williams, an agent with Weichert Realtors in Blue Bell who sells in the township, Upper Gwynedd has 35 active listings, ranging from a condo flat going for $109,900 to a 4.5-acre estate priced at $1,390,000. "Property sales are averaging 17 a month, meaning that the price absorption rate is two months," Williams says. In the last year, 225 properties sold here, with an average price of $315,397, she says; sale prices ranged from $93,000 to $660,000. Average time on market for a property is 53 days, she notes. Nineteen sales are pending, ranging in price from $115,000 to $525,000, Williams says. In the last three months, 54 homes sold in Upper Gwynedd, compared with 74 in the same three months of 2015, according to Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Fox & Roach Realtors HomExpert Market Report. The median sale price was $283,450 (half the homes sold for more, half for less). That was up 3.3 percent from $274,325 in the same three-month period of 2015, according to HomExpert. Williams says there is one new-construction project in Upper Gwynedd, called the Preserve at Gwynedd. Featured at the Preserve, built by Better Living Homes, are 19 townhouses and four single-family detached homes. The townhouses sell for $329,000 to $404,900, while the singles are going for $499,990. Bob Acuff, of Re/Max Services in Blue Bell, is the listing agent for the Preserve at Gwynedd. Upper Gwynedd is in the 12,719-student North Penn School District, which has three middle schools and 13 elementary schools. Its high school ranks 46th in Pennsylvania, and 1,526th nationally. The district plays an oversized role in the real estate of Upper Gwynedd and the other municipalities that comprise it: the Boroughs of North Wales, Lansdale and Hatfield and Towamencin, Montgomery and Hatfield Townships. "Montgomery Township has a higher average resale price, at $340,000," Williams says, but Upper Gwynedd has a higher average resale price than Hatfield Township or Towamencin Township." There are three over-55 communities in Upper Gwynedd, Williams says. Two offer homes priced from $195,000 into the $200,000s: Gwynedd Commons and Gwynedd Woods. The Reserve at Gwynedd is higher-end, Williams says, and includes several high-rise buildings with "attractive flats, twins, carriage houses, and singles." The flats range from the mid-$200,000s to mid- $300,000s. The twins, carriage houses, and singles range from the high $400,000s to $558,000. aheavens@phillynews.com 215-854-2472 @alheavens Real Estate Tools Looking for a new home?

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow's pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P's energy sector dropped 1.5 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. "People are waiting for more information. We're waiting for political news, we're waiting for earnings. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we'll see some movement," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector fell 0.8 percent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is some hope we'll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first," said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs' 0.8 percent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine's 0.9 percent drop and Exxon Mobil's 1.7 percent decline. The Dow had come tantalizingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 percent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 percent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 percent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P's health sector was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq's biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals , which closed up 72.9 percent on a US$5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 percent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug program with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Reuters Published Monday, Jan. 09, 2017 4:14PM EST Last updated Monday, Jan. 09, 2017 5:15PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s benchmark stock index finished lower on Monday as energy stocks fell with tumbling oil prices, and financial, telecom and industrial stocks also weighed on the market. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index ended down 107.10 points, or 0.69 per cent, at 15,388.95. Two stocks declined for every gainer. The most influential movers on the index included some of its biggest oil and gas producers, with the energy group down 2.5 per cent overall as oil prices fell on fears that record Iraqi crude exports and growing U.S. output could undermine OPEC’s efforts to reduce supply. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd fell 3.1 per cent to C$41.82, and Suncor Energy Inc lost 1.4 per cent to C$43.49. Seven Generations Energy slumped 9.1 per cent to C$27.06 after reporting lower-than-expected production in the fourth quarter. “A lot of momentum was in that name. ... It was really being pushed in the broker channels. It probably ran a little bit ahead of itself,” said Bryden Teich, a portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management. The financials group, which accounts for 35 per cent of the index weight, lost 0.5 per cent, with Brookfield Asset Management Inc off 1.3 per cent at C$43.56 and insurer Sun Life Financial Inc down 1.5 per cent at C$51.46. Industrials and telecoms both lost 0.8 per cent. On the positive side, Quebecor Inc rose 2 per cent to C$38.12 and Shaw Communications Inc added 1.9 per cent to C$22.77 after RBC upgraded its view of the two cable companies’ stock. RBC also raised its view on exchange operator TMX Group Ltd , while downgrading telecom companies Rogers Communications Inc and BCE Inc as well as mortgage lender Home Capital Group Inc. TMX advanced 3.5 per cent to C$75.60, Rogers declined 1.5 per cent to C$51.40, BCE lost 1.1 per cent to C$57.94, and Home Capital shed 2.4 per cent to C$30.54. Canadian companies are more optimistic about sales as demand picks up and they plan to boost investment and hiring, but businesses are uncertain about U.S. protectionism, and the labor market shows signs of substantial slack, the Bank of Canada said on Monday. Oil drop stymies Dow’s march to 20,000; health stocks boost Nasdaq Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow ‘s pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P’s energy sector dropped 1.5 per cent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 per cent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. “People are waiting for more information. We’re waiting for political news, we’re waiting for earnings. There’s a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we’ll see some movement,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector fell 0.8 per cent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 per cent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 per cent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “There is some hope we’ll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first,” said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs’ 0.8 per cent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine’s 0.9 per cent drop and Exxon Mobil’s 1.7 per cent decline. The Dow had come tantalizingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. “Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when,” said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 per cent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P’s health sector was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. <MRK. N> the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq’s biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals, which closed up 72.9 per cent on a $5.20-billion buyout deal with Japan’s Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 per cent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug program with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Petroleum-linked shares tumbled on Monday (Jan 9) on lower oil prices as the Dow pulled back from its campaign to hit 20,000 points. US stocks opened the week on a generally downcast note, with the Nasdaq edging up, but the Dow and S&P 500 retreating. "I think that people are having a hard time justifying going dramatically above 20,000 in the Dow because of what it would represent in terms of valuation," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 76.42 points (0.38 per cent) to close at 19,887.38. The broad-based S&P 500 fell 8.08 points (0.35 per cent) to 2,268,90, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index rose 10.76 points (0.19 per cent) to 5,531.82, a new closing record. Petroleum-oriented companies ExxonMobil, Halliburton and Apache all lost one per cent or more as oil prices fell sharply on questions about the effectiveness of an OPEC deal to cut output. Pharmaceutical stocks mostly pushed higher, with Merck, Amgen and Mylan all climbing by more than one percent. Utility company Entergy shed 2.9 per cent after it announced a deal with state officials to close the Indian Point nuclear power plant near New York. The company will take a US$2.4 billion charge in the fourth-quarter due to the move. Veterinary and pet-care company VCA surged 28.3 per cent after it announced a deal to be acquired by privately-held Mars for US$9.1 billion. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Last quarter was the slowest three-month period for drug company initial public offering in four years, according to Bloomberg data. And in all of 2016, only 36 biotech and pharmaceutical companies went public in the U.S., according to data gathered by Bloomberg, compared with 68 in 2015 and a record 85 in 2014. The long drought comes ahead of the health-care industry’s biggest gathering of companies and investors, the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, which begins Monday. The week before the massive conference typically serve as a launchpad for fresh offerings. This year? Nothing. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter “Biotech had a difficult year generally from a performance perspective, and so a bunch of the generalists have exited the market and money’s become much tighter,” said Bryan Roberts, a partner at Venrock, a technology and health-care venture capital firm with about $3.1 billion under management. “When people’s comfort with risk goes down, IPOs are one of the first things to fall off the edge of the cliff.” There are several reasons at play. The market has been in a slump: the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index of 164 companies was down 22 percent in 2016, the first yearlong losing streak since 2008 and the worst year since 2002. And with a new president taking office and promising to cut taxes and overhaul the health-care system, bankers and investors may be choosing to wait and see. ‘A Bit Spoiled’ “I think in the 2014 to 2015 period we were a bit spoiled as an industry,” said David Sabow, a managing director at Silicon Valley Bank. “After two consecutive years of a very liquid market, we thought that may be the new normal, but 2016 showed us that was not the case.” Only $444.1 million was raised in U.S.-listed biotechnology and pharmaceutical IPOs during the fourth quarter of 2016 as seven companies went public, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In 2016, seven U.S. biotechnology and drug companies announced their intent to go public in the first eight days of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Not a single one has raised their hand so far this January. Bruce Booth, a partner at investment firm Atlas Venture, said he’s not worried about that holdup. “If the ‘new normal’ is a steady flow of 25-plus biotech IPOs each year, that would be a sign of a very healthy, maturing sector,” Booth said. “We should start to see a few IPOs by end of January or early February. I’d anticipate four to five of them by the end of February.” Booth’s fund, which manages around $700 million, has investments in gene editing firm Intellia Therapeutics Inc. and cancer drugmaker Unum Therapeutics Inc. Trump Bump There could also be a pickup thanks to the broader stock market surge that has followed President-elect Donald Trump’s election victory. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is up 6.4 percent since the Nov. 8 election day. “CEO confidence is a critical factor in driving M&A,” said Richard Landgarten, Barclays Plc’s head of health-care and real estate banking. “Right now they feel good about the stock market broadly and, for example, the potential for pro-business tax reform from the new administration.” Several biotech names have been floated for 2017 IPOs, including Jounce Therapeutics and Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, which have announced their intention to go public in the coming year without giving an exact date. IPOs could also be prodded if takeovers increase in the industry. Big drugmakers have been sitting on cash left overseas, waiting on potential tax reform from Trump and Republicans in Congress. They’ve promised to lower rates, which could help repatriate $98 billion of overseas cash among large pharma companies, according to Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford. Cash Waiting Johnson & Johnson has about $40 billion overseas, followed by Merck & Co. with about $20 billion, then Pfizer with nearly $15 billion, according Holford’s Nov. 9 note to clients. Some of that money will stay invested abroad and the rest could be brought back for potential acquisitions. “The smartest money in this space is watching the first 100 days” of the Trump administration, said Sabow. Andy Weisenfeld, a partner at health-care investment banking firm MTS Health Partners LP, said he expects 2017 to be similar to 2016, with drugmakers letting smaller biotechs take the risks of research and development, then stepping in to snap experimental products once they’ve proven themselves. “Prices for the better targets might go up, but if something hasn’t been de-risked, I think for the most part these companies would rather pay more and have it de-risked then pay real money and have it fail,” Weisenfeld said.

Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jan 8, 2017 at 7:21AM Most investors' idea of impressive earnings growth is, say, 20% or more per year. So what does that say about companies that grow their earnings by more than 100% in a year? That's what Wall Street expects three biotechs to achieve over the next year. Here's how Corcept Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CORT), Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY), and Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) just might double their earnings in 2017. Image source: Getty Images Corcept: A low starting point helps Wall Street analysts expect Corcept Therapeutics to grow earnings by a whopping 500% in 2017. That would be a tremendous feat, but there's one minor detail to note: Corcept's earnings for last year will probably only be around $5 million, making 2016 the company's first profitable year ever. A low starting point helps make growth look a lot better on paper. Nonetheless, there's no doubt that Corcept is on a roll. The biotech has one product on the market, Korlym. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Korlym in 2012 for treating Cushing's syndrome, a condition caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol. There are around 20,000 patients in the U.S. with Cushing's syndrome. Korlym will continue to be Corcept's primary growth-driver for a while. Corcept recently announced positive results from a phase 1/2 study of the drug in combination with Halaven in treating triple-negative breast cancer. The company also has one other clinical candidate in its pipeline: CORT125134. Enrollment is under way for a phase 2 study evaluating the selective cortisol modulator in treating Cushing's syndrome and another phase 1/2 study of the drug in treating solid tumors.  Incyte: All "JAKked" up Incyte has a couple of things in common with Corcept. The biotech was unprofitable until recently, and it makes most of its money from one drug, JAK inhibitor Jakafi. Analysts project that Jakafi will power earnings growth of 129% this year. Jakafi generated revenue of more than $675 million in 2015, including royalties received from sales outside of the U.S. by the biotech's partner Novartis. In just the first three quarters of 2016, revenue for the drug topped $709 million. Peak annual sales for Jakafi are expected to reach around $1.5 billion. Incyte has more than just Jakafi going for it, though. The biotech has another product on the market in Europe, cancer drug Iclusig, which Incyte licensed from Ariad Pharmaceuticals. Incyte also licensed JAK inhibitor baracitinib to Lilly in 2009. Lilly expects an approval decision by the FDA this month for baracitinib in treating rheumatoid arthritis. The company's pipeline includes several other experimental cancer drugs. Epacadostat is furthest along in development. The selective inhibitor of the enzyme IDO1 is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials, including a pivotal late-stage study in combination with Merck's Keytruda in treating melanoma.  Exelixis: Soaring even higher Thanks to kinase inhibitor cabozantinib, Exelixis ranked as one of the best biotech stocks of 2016. Exelixis markets the drug under two brand names, Cometriq and Cabometyx. Wall Street expects the biotech's earnings to increase over 110% during the next year, primarily on the growth prospects from Cabometyx. Cometriq hit the market first, winning regulatory approval in late 2012 to treat medullary thyroid cancer. Exelixis really hit its stride, though, with the launch of Cabometyx this year as a treatment for kidney cancer. In a short time, Cabometyx has gained around 20% market share as a second-line treatment for kidney cancer and 35% as a third-line treatment. The biggest opportunity for Cabometyx still awaits. A late-stage study found that the drug outperformed the current leader, Sutent, as a first-line treatment of kidney cancer. Exelixis is moving forward with the regulatory approval process for the additional indication. There's also the potential for Cabometyx to be used in combination with other drugs.  Double in price? With expectations for doubling earnings in the coming year, are all three of these stocks on their way to doubling also? Probably not. The market is always looking ahead. Significant earnings growth is already baked into the price of all three stocks. However, I think each of these biotech stocks should still perform well in 2017. My view is that Exelixis, in particular, still has room to move higher. I also think the company could become an acquisition target down the road. So could Corcept and Incyte, for that matter. Impressive earnings growth tends to attract a lot of attention. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Exelixis.
