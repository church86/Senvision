Incyte and Merck will share responsibilities for funding these pivotal studies, and Merck will be responsible for conducting the trials.  “We are pleased to announce further details of our collaboration with Merck and to be moving forward with multiple Phase 3 studies in these four additional tumor types as quickly as possible,” said Steven Stein, M.D., chief medical officer, Incyte. “We look forward to our continued clinical collaboration, the initiation of these additional pivotal trials and to further exploring the potential of this novel immune-therapy combination as a treatment for patients with cancer.”  ”Our clinical trial program with Incyte represents an important part of our multi-pronged efforts to investigate the potential for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in combination with promising compounds, such as epacadostat,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president, head of clinical development, and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “Through these trials, our long-term goal is to help make a difference in the lives of people with a wide range of cancers.”  About ECHO The ECHO clinical trial program was established to investigate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat as a core component of combination therapy in oncology. Ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating epacadostat in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors collectively plan to enroll over 900 patients in a broad range of solid tumor types as well as hematological malignancies. ECHO-301 (NCT02752074), a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with epacadostat or placebo for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, is also underway.  About Epacadostat (INCB024360) Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a key immunosuppressive enzyme that modulates the anti-tumor immune response by promoting regulatory T cell generation and blocking effector T cell activation, thereby facilitating tumor growth by allowing cancer cells to avoid immune surveillance. Epacadostat is a first-in-class, highly potent and selective oral inhibitor of the IDO1 enzyme that reverses tumor-associated immune suppression and restores effective anti-tumor immune responses. In single-arm studies, the combination of epacadostat and immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown proof-of-concept in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In these studies, epacadostat combined with the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab or the PD-1 inhibitor KEYTRUDA improved response rates compared with studies of the immune checkpoint inhibitors alone.  About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.  KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single-dose vial.  KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.  KEYTRUDA is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.  In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 28 (15%) of 192 patients with HNSCC, including Grade 3 (0.5%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor-blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (≥1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs ipilimumab were fatigue (28% vs 28%), diarrhea (26% with KEYTRUDA), rash (24% vs 23%), and nausea (21% with KEYTRUDA). Corresponding incidence rates are listed for ipilimumab only for those adverse reactions that occurred at the same or lower rate than with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of 682 patients with metastatic NSCLC. The most common adverse event resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 20% of patients and at a higher incidence than with docetaxel) were decreased appetite (25% vs 23%), dyspnea (23% vs 20%), and nausea (20% vs 18%). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of 192 patients with HNSCC. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC, with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3 or 4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of 210 patients with cHL and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 26% of patients. Fifteen percent (15%) of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (³1%) included pneumonia, pneumonitis, pyrexia, dyspnea, GVHD, and herpes zoster. Two patients died from causes other than disease progression; one from GVHD after subsequent allogeneic HSCT and one from septic shock. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ³20% of patients) were fatigue (26%), pyrexia (24%), cough (24%), musculoskeletal pain (21%), diarrhea (20%), and rash (20%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a study of 40 pediatric patients with advanced melanoma, PD-L1–positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma, patients were treated with KEYTRUDA for a median of 43 days (range 1 to 414 days), with 24 patients (60%) receiving treatment for 42 days or more. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA. Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (³15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).  About Incyte Incyte Corporation is a Wilmington, Delaware-based biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics.

Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor-blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (≥1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs ipilimumab were fatigue (28% vs 28%), diarrhea (26% with KEYTRUDA), rash (24% vs 23%), and nausea (21% with KEYTRUDA). Corresponding incidence rates are listed for ipilimumab only for those adverse reactions that occurred at the same or lower rate than with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of 682 patients with metastatic NSCLC. The most common adverse event resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 20% of patients and at a higher incidence than with docetaxel) were decreased appetite (25% vs 23%), dyspnea (23% vs 20%), and nausea (20% vs 18%). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of 192 patients with HNSCC. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC, with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3 or 4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of 210 patients with cHL and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 26% of patients. Fifteen percent (15%) of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥1%) included pneumonia, pneumonitis, pyrexia, dyspnea, GVHD, and herpes zoster. Two patients died from causes other than disease progression; one from GVHD after subsequent allogeneic HSCT and one from septic shock. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue (26%), pyrexia (24%), cough (24%), musculoskeletal pain (21%), diarrhea (20%), and rash (20%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a study of 40 pediatric patients with advanced melanoma, PD-L1–positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma, patients were treated with KEYTRUDA for a median of 43 days (range 1 to 414 days), with 24 patients (60%) receiving treatment for 42 days or more. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA. Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).

Incyte and Merck Provide Additional Details on Previously Announced Collaboration Investigating Epacadostat and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Clinical Program Now Includes Seven Registrational Trials Across Five Tumor Types Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Small Preview Thumbnail March 31, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time WILMINGTON, Del. & KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Incyte Corporation (Nasdaq:INCY) and Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced additional details of their clinical development program investigating the combination of epacadostat, Incyte’s investigational oral selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor, with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients across five tumor types: metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). The expanded collaboration now includes seven pivotal studies: A Phase 3 study in metastatic melanoma (trial underway); two Phase 3 studies in first-line NSCLC, including both PD-L1 high-expressing and PD-L1 unselected populations; two Phase 3 studies in bladder cancer, including one in first-line bladder cancer and one in second-line bladder cancer; a Phase 3 study in first-line RCC; and a Phase 3 study in first-line SCCHN. Incyte and Merck will share responsibilities for funding these pivotal studies, and Merck will be responsible for conducting the trials. “We are pleased to announce further details of our collaboration with Merck and to be moving forward with multiple Phase 3 studies in these four additional tumor types as quickly as possible,” said Steven Stein, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Incyte. “We look forward to our continued clinical collaboration, the initiation of these additional pivotal trials and to further exploring the potential of this novel immune-therapy combination as a treatment for patients with cancer.” “Our clinical trial program with Incyte represents an important part of our multi-pronged efforts to investigate the potential for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in combination with promising compounds, such as epacadostat,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president, head of clinical development, and Chief Medical Officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “Through these trials, our long-term goal is to help make a difference in the lives of people with a wide range of cancers.” About ECHO The ECHO clinical trial program was established to investigate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat as a core component of combination therapy in oncology. Ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating epacadostat in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors collectively plan to enroll over 900 patients in a broad range of solid tumor types as well as hematological malignancies. ECHO-301 (NCT02752074), a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with epacadostat or placebo for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, is also underway. About Epacadostat (INCB024360) Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a key immunosuppressive enzyme that modulates the anti-tumor immune response by promoting regulatory T cell generation and blocking effector T cell activation, thereby facilitating tumor growth by allowing cancer cells to avoid immune surveillance. Epacadostat is a first-in-class, highly potent and selective oral inhibitor of the IDO1 enzyme that reverses tumor-associated immune suppression and restores effective anti-tumor immune responses. In single-arm studies, the combination of epacadostat and immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown proof-of-concept in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In these studies, epacadostat combined with the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab or the PD-1 inhibitor KEYTRUDA improved response rates compared with studies of the immune checkpoint inhibitors alone. About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single-dose vial. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 28 (15%) of 192 patients with HNSCC, including Grade 3 (0.5%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor-blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (≥1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs ipilimumab were fatigue (28% vs 28%), diarrhea (26% with KEYTRUDA), rash (24% vs 23%), and nausea (21% with KEYTRUDA). Corresponding incidence rates are listed for ipilimumab only for those adverse reactions that occurred at the same or lower rate than with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of 682 patients with metastatic NSCLC. The most common adverse event resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 20% of patients and at a higher incidence than with docetaxel) were decreased appetite (25% vs 23%), dyspnea (23% vs 20%), and nausea (20% vs 18%). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of 192 patients with HNSCC. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC, with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3 or 4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of 210 patients with cHL and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 26% of patients. Fifteen percent (15%) of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥1%) included pneumonia, pneumonitis, pyrexia, dyspnea, GVHD, and herpes zoster. Two patients died from causes other than disease progression; one from GVHD after subsequent allogeneic HSCT and one from septic shock. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue (26%), pyrexia (24%), cough (24%), musculoskeletal pain (21%), diarrhea (20%), and rash (20%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a study of 40 pediatric patients with advanced melanoma, PD-L1–positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma, patients were treated with KEYTRUDA for a median of 43 days (range 1 to 414 days), with 24 patients (60%) receiving treatment for 42 days or more. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA. Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).

Merck, the global pharmaceutical and health care firm, is considering Austin for a new technology center that could create up to 600 jobs and serve as a major anchor for the innovation district emerging around the Dell Medical School. According to city fillings made public this morning, Merck will request $856,000 from the city in performance-based incentives over a 10-year period. In exchange, the company would provide the new jobs, which pay an average annual salary of $84,586, the city’s economic development department said in a release. According to a draft economic development proposal, the company also would invest almost $29 million in facilities and equipment by 2023. The project would establish a new Merck tech hub “focused on digital health and other information technology solutions,” the city’s release said. A memo from department director Kevin Johns said the project would “elevate the status of our bio and life-sciences industry to the level of other global (Merck) locations such as Prague … and Singapore.” The Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce said the project “would be a really good fit for Austin.” Merck and the Dell Medical School have not struck a formal partnership, but Clay Johnston, dean of the school, said such partnerships “could create unique opportunities to fulfill our mission in different and far-reaching ways.” “We have discussed projects and initiatives to improve health, reduce inequities, improve patient outcomes and lower community health costs, potentially ranging from an effort to eradicate human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer in Austin, to pilot projects around better uses of health data, to community-based programs that increase the pipeline from schools in to the health professions,” Johnston said in a written statement. “These kinds of initiatives would be difficult to achieve without a relationship with this specific kind of collaborator.” More details to follow.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Calypso Biotech Licenses CALY-001 Best-In-Class Anti-MMP-9 Antibody to EA Pharma Geneva, Switzerland, March 31, 2017 / B3C newswire / — Calypso Biotech SA announced today that it has entered a global licensing and collaboration agreement with EA Pharma Co., Ltd. to develop CALY-001, a best-in-class anti-MMP-9 fully human monoclonal antibody. CALY-001 is a promising novel treatment for indications such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), potentially capable of preventing disease complications. “This agreement highlights the strong potential for CALY-001, which possesses a unique mode of action through binding and inhibiting active MMP-9“ says Alain Vicari, CEO of Calypso Biotech. “By teaming with EA Pharma, a leader in gastrointestinal diseases with full value chain, we will fulfill our vision to bring new therapeutics to patients suffering from severe gastrointestinal diseases. Beyond IBD, CALY-001 represents a promising and advantageous therapeutic option for several oncology, inflammation and fibrosis indications”. Under the agreement, Calypso Biotech will grant EA Pharma an exclusive and world-wide license for the development, manufacturing and marketing of CALY-001. Both companies will collaborate to develop CALY-001 for IBD. Calypso Biotech will receive an upfront, milestone and royalty payments from EA Pharma. Staatz Business Development & Strategy acted as transaction advisor to Calypso Biotech. About MMP-9 Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is an extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme. In IBD, MMP-9 is excessively expressed and activated within the inflamed gastrointestinal tissue. MMP-9 is also associated with other pathologies including cancer, chronic inflammation and fibrotic diseases. MMP-9 is mostly secreted as inactive pro-enzyme, which is activated when cleaved by other proteinases.    About CALY-001 CALY-001 is a novel, best-in-class fully human therapeutic antibody that uniquely binds to and neutralizes the active form of MMP-9. “This selective mode of action prevents in vivo antibody elimination through binding to the abundant pro-enzyme form of MMP-9, while preserving full enzymatic inhibition of activated and disease-relevant MMP-9” highlights Yolande Chvatchko, CSO of Calypso Biotech.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 April 2017 by Military News Ready for Spring Allergies? THURSDAY, March 30, 2017 (HealthDay News) — Spring routinely spells misery for allergy sufferers, but a recent survey reveals that most patients don’t try to manage their symptoms until it’s too late. The survey asked more than 1,000 adults with seasonal allergies and more than 500 parents of children with seasonal allergies how they prepared for the high pollen counts that come with warmer weather. The survey found that three out of four only thought about managing symptoms once they were experiencing those symptoms or when allergy season had already started. Also, more than half did not know what prescriptions were available to ease their allergy symptoms, while roughly a third did not know their allergy triggers or how to ease symptoms. And less than half of adults surveyed visited a doctor for advice or got a prescription for an allergy treatment before allergy season began. The survey was conducted by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America and drug maker Merck & Co. Not thinking about allergies until symptoms occur is inviting misery, said Dr. Rita Kachru, an allergist at UCLA Medical Center. “Once triggered, you are playing catch-up,” she explained. So what can you do? Start by closing the windows in your home and staying indoors on high pollen count days, Kachru said. If you have to go outside and breathe in all those allergens, nasal gargling can help, Kachru said. This decreases exposure to the allergen before it binds to the nasal mucus and triggers the inflammatory response, she explained. To perform nasal gargling, buy an irrigation bottle, available at drug stores and online. Fill it with 8 ounces of distilled or boiled water that’s been brought to room temperature. Add a half teaspoon of salt and a quarter teaspoon of baking soda. Halve the recipe for children, Kachru said. Sniff up the water from the tip of the bottle; 4 ounces per nostril for adults, half that for children. Never use unboiled tap water, she said. “Tap has a certain amount of bacteria that is not good up the nose,” Kachru explained. But, nasal gargling usually doesn’t appeal to small children, said Dr. Vivian Hernandez-Trujillo, section chief of allergy and immunology for Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami. Older children may balk too, she said. For them she prefers the neti pot to nasal gargling. A neti pot is a slightly different device from an irrigation bottle, although both are meant to help clear nasal passages. If children won’t use either method, Hernandez-Trujillo recommends avoidance of allergens if possible. Otherwise, medications such as oral antihistamines, intranasal steroids and intranasal antihistamines can help, she said. Before using anything, however, it’s crucial to identify if the symptoms are due to allergies, Hernandez-Trujillo said. It’s best to get tested: Some parents think their child has allergies and it turns out to be a sinus infection. Talk to your primary care doctor or your pediatrician before using medication, she said, and ask about testing. Allergy shots, or immunotherapy, are another option, Kachru said. The course of treatment, with a small amount of the allergen injected to desensitize, is about three to five years. “The longer you do it, the better,” she said. “Eighty-five percent of people who undergo allergy immunotherapy will be asymptomatic and have that last for eight to 10 years.” Testing for allergies, done with either skin or blood tests, is generally covered by most health insurance plans, Kachru said.

NEW PRESS RELEASE CATEGORIES ﻿ Health Asia Pacific is Expected to Register the Strongest Growth in the Human Vaccines Market Human Vaccines Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2016 - 2024   PR-Inside.com: 2017-03-31 12:23:08 The vendor landscape of the global market for human vaccines features a markedly high level of consolidation, with the companies Merck & Co, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc., and Sanofi, Pfizer, Inc., collectively accounting for over 70% of the overall market in 2015, notes Transparency Market Research in a recent report. To outplay competitors, companies are focusing on establishing ties with national and international healthcare bodies, strengthening distribution chains, and investing funds in the development and deployment of innovative and more efficient storage and transportation techniques.  Transparency Market Research states that the global human vaccines market will exhibit a promising 11.2% CAGR from 2016 through 2024, rising from a valuation of US$28.3 bn in 2015 to US$72.5 bn by 2024. Browse Market Research Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/human-vaccines-market.html Combination Vaccines to See Increased Rate of Adoption Based on the type of vaccine, the market for human vaccines has been examined in the report for conjugate vaccines, recombinant vaccines, inactivated vaccines, combination vaccines, and attenuated vaccines. Of these, the segment of conjugate vaccines contributed the bulk of revenue to the global market in 2015. Although the segment will continue to be one of the leading product varieties, the segment of combination vaccines will expand at an outstanding pace over the forecast period.  From a geographical standpoint, the North America human vaccines market dominated in 2015 and is expected to retain dominance throughout the forecast period, thanks to the presence of some of the world’s leading human vaccine manufacturers. The regional market is expected to reach a valuation of US$28.0 bn by 2024. In the forthcoming years, the Asia Pacific market is expected to emerge as the region with the most promising growth opportunities. The region will exhibit a 12.5% CAGR over the report’s forecast period.  High Level of Consumer Confidence about Minimal Side Effects Bolster Market’s Growth Prospects  It has been established over the several decades of their use that vaccines present a significantly low risk of fatal and serious side effects. This confidence happens to be the key factors associated with the immense popularity of vaccines for the treatment of a number of diseases among consumers as well as among healthcare practitioners. Several notable healthcare organizations also recommend the use of vaccines to tackle a number of conditions and international agencies such as WHO place massive attention on the state of development of ongoing research activities in the area of human vaccines. For more information on this report, fill the form @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_ .. High Costs of Products Could Hinder Growth Prospects across Cash-sensitive Regional Markets The research, development, clinical trials involved in bringing to market a new vaccine is a highly expensive affair. Moreover, the storage and transportation of human vaccines require specialized and advanced equipment, adding to the overall cost of marketing these products. Moreover, strict regulatory hurdles involved in the process of approval of human vaccines and bulk purchases by government bodies also bring down profitability of the human vaccines market. These factors are especially more challenging in developing and less-developed economies, wherein high cost of products could lead to reduced consumption and demand.  This review of the market is based on a recent market research report published by Transparency Market Research, titled “Human Vaccines Market (Vaccine Type - Conjugate, Recombinant, Inactivated, Combination, and Attenuated; Product - Pneumococcal, Influenza, Hepatitis, HPV, Meningococcal, Rotavirus, Measles, Typhoid, and Combination; Age Group - Pediatrics, Adolescents, Adults, and Geriatrics; Distribution Channel - Hospital Pharmacies and Drugstores) - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 - 2024.”  About Us Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

Wells Tags: cesium, Fukushima, invention, nuclear, nuclear radiation, patent, radiation, save humanity (Natural News) It is truly anti-science to push cancer-causing food on humans, to say that mercury is safe when injected via vaccines, and to push a global warming hoax that’s based solely on a political Ponzi scheme agenda. Still, that can’t stop Stephanie Lee, a wanna-be-journalist and pseudo-“technology news reporter” who writes an obscene blog for Buzzfeed, clamoring on for hours, accusing anyone and everyone who points out lies and deception as being “anti-science.” Just another moronic charlatan and industry-funded journo-prostitute for Monsanto, Merck and Pfizer, Stephanie Lee will post any biotech-written or pharma-scripted propaganda to get herself a paycheck to spend on her favorite past-time, which is learning more about how she can shill for the pharmaceutical industry. She also claims to speak on health panels – most likely to help people eat experimental GMOs, get mercury-laden flu shots, and acquire cancer and dementia sooner in life. It’s truly amazing that hucksters and hacks at Buzzfeed have the gall to criticize, demonize and try to character assassinate the most well-researched journalists, reporters and real scientists on planet Earth, namely Mike Adams, Editor of Natural News and lead scientist at CWC labs. One of the most visionary humanitarian scientists on planet Earth just donated a lifesaving patent that could save millions of people from radiation poisoning Tens of millions of Americans are now educated and smart enough to eat organic food regularly, stay clear of toxic prescription medications, avoid unproven and experimental vaccines, and rarely, if ever, eat genetically modified corn, soy or canola. Why? The Editor of Natural News, Mike Adams, has published thousands and thousands of articles over the past dozen years on the power of natural food and remedies to assist people’s pleasant and rewarding journey of longevity through organic living. Also, over the past few years, Mike Adams has dedicated massive amounts of time and energy to building and running a food forensics lab, from the ground up, and testing food and medicines (and supplements) for dangerous toxins like heavy metals, pesticides, synthetic contaminants and even radiation. Unfortunately, there are many bitter and twisted people who despise real science and the truth about food and medicine. These internet “science” trolls want nothing more than a paycheck for bad-mouthing the pioneers who have saved lives, extended lives, emboldened lives and accomplished all of that through research and hard work. Food science researcher Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, has patented the world’s first dietary supplement that is laboratory validated to bind with and capture cesium isotopes (including cesium-137), and it’s called Cesium Eliminator. Taking “incredible” to the next level, Adams has now dedicated this amazing formulated discovery and patented invention as a donation for humanity in the event of a nuclear catastrophe. No kidding. The critics have nothing sensible left to say as Mike Adams’ science breakthrough could save millions of lives in the aftermath of a nuclear event Using simple natural ingredients, including seawater extract, dehydrated seaweed, zeolites, Hawaiian spirulina and chlorella (at specific particle sizes and ratios), the patented formula literally eliminates radioactive cesium isotopes from the human digestive tract if contaminated food and water have been ingested. Thanks to a mainstream media blackout of any news regarding the horrific situation at Fukushima nuclear facility in Japan, most people have no clue that the radiation leakage is far worse than that of Chernobyl decades ago. This same type of catastrophe could easily happen in the United States, not to mention if terrorists purposely caused an event or if some rogue country like Iran or North Korea started a nuclear war. Mike Adams says he is ready to donate the licensing and manufacturing rights to his patented invention to any state or national government in need. Plus, Adams has stockpiled the raw materials to replicate the product should there be a massive incident in Texas or the U.S.A. Where’s the CDC, the FDA and the EPA now? Why haven’t they already done this? Do they even care? We all know that the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA are like bad jokes when it comes to protecting Americans or rescuing them during or after natural catastrophes, not to mention doing anything to protect us all prior to such an event. The EPA can’t even protect our tap water. How could we ever expect them to invent or patent something to save us all from nuclear radiation poisoning? Cesium-137 is a deadly radioisotope created in the aftermath of nuclear bombs with a half-life of 30 years. That means any land affected would be completely contaminated and ruined for any agriculture for a few generations. Millions of people would die from cancer if they did not eliminate the majority of the cesium from their digestive tract before it gets absorbed into the blood and deposited in soft tissues throughout the body. Let’s all congratulate Mike Adams and thank him for his tireless efforts to help people all around the world learn how to protect their health from disease, disorder, and now nuclear radiation. What a difference a little dedication can make!

Most people aren't prepared to manage symptoms that come with a high pollen count, allergists say To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript. (*this news item will not be available after 06/28/2017) Thursday, March 30, 2017 THURSDAY, March 30, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Spring routinely spells misery for allergy sufferers, but a recent survey reveals that most patients don't try to manage their symptoms until it's too late. The survey asked more than 1,000 adults with seasonal allergies and more than 500 parents of children with seasonal allergies how they prepared for the high pollen counts that come with warmer weather. The survey found that three out of four only thought about managing symptoms once they were experiencing those symptoms or when allergy season had already started. Also, more than half did not know what prescriptions were available to ease their allergy symptoms, while roughly a third did not know their allergy triggers or how to ease symptoms. And less than half of adults surveyed visited a doctor for advice or got a prescription for an allergy treatment before allergy season began. The survey was conducted by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America and drug maker Merck & Co. Not thinking about allergies until symptoms occur is inviting misery, said Dr. Rita Kachru, an allergist at UCLA Medical Center. "Once triggered, you are playing catch-up," she explained. So what can you do? Start by closing the windows in your home and staying indoors on high pollen count days, Kachru said. If you have to go outside and breathe in all those allergens, nasal gargling can help, Kachru said. This decreases exposure to the allergen before it binds to the nasal mucus and triggers the inflammatory response, she explained. To perform nasal gargling, buy an irrigation bottle, available at drug stores and online. Fill it with 8 ounces of distilled or boiled water that's been brought to room temperature. Add a half teaspoon of salt and a quarter teaspoon of baking soda. Halve the recipe for children, Kachru said. Sniff up the water from the tip of the bottle; 4 ounces per nostril for adults, half that for children. Never use unboiled tap water, she said. "Tap has a certain amount of bacteria that is not good up the nose," Kachru explained. But, nasal gargling usually doesn't appeal to small children, said Dr. Vivian Hernandez-Trujillo, section chief of allergy and immunology for Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami. Older children may balk too, she said. For them she prefers the neti pot to nasal gargling. A neti pot is a slightly different device from an irrigation bottle, although both are meant to help clear nasal passages. If children won't use either method, Hernandez-Trujillo recommends avoidance of allergens if possible. Otherwise, medications such as oral antihistamines, intranasal steroids and intranasal antihistamines can help, she said. Before using anything, however, it's crucial to identify if the symptoms are due to allergies, Hernandez-Trujillo said. It's best to get tested: Some parents think their child has allergies and it turns out to be a sinus infection. Talk to your primary care doctor or your pediatrician before using medication, she said, and ask about testing. Allergy shots, or immunotherapy, are another option, Kachru said. The course of treatment, with a small amount of the allergen injected to desensitize, is about three to five years. "The longer you do it, the better," she said. "Eighty-five percent of people who undergo allergy immunotherapy will be asymptomatic and have that last for eight to 10 years." Testing for allergies, done with either skin or blood tests, is generally covered by most health insurance plans, Kachru said.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News PharmaPoint: Dyslipidemia – Global Drug Forecast and Market Analysis to 2023 GlobalData estimates that the total market size for the 8MM in 2013 was $15.4bn, comprised of $11.0bn in branded drug sales (72%) and $4.4bn in generic sales (28%). GlobalData expects that the dyslipidemia drug market will grow at a CAGR of 9.4% over the ten year forecast period, resulting in a market value of $37.9bn by 2023, of which 71% will be attributed to branded drug sales ($26.9bn) and 29% to generic drug sales ($11.0bn). The current dyslipidemia market is dominated by the statins, the revolutionary drugs that reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and that have been proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. Other major lipid-modulating drugs, such as Zetia (ezetimibe), the fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, omega-3 fish oil agents, and rare-disease therapies comprise the remainder of the current dyslipidemia space. The launch of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) biologics and the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors will reshape the sales landscape of the dyslipidemia market moving forward. Highlights Key Questions Answered – How will major clinical trials of currently marketed therapies impact the future of the dyslipidemia market? Particular attention will be given to the HPS2-THRIVE and IMPROVE-IT Phase III studies of niacin and Zetia (ezetimibe). – What role will statins play in the future of the dyslipidemia market? – What are the clinical, regulatory, and commercial prospects of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibodies (PCSK9 mAbs) from Amgen, Sanofi/Regeneron, and Pfizer and the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors from Eli Lilly, Merck, and Dezima Pharma? – How will novel lipid-modulating agents, such as Esperion Therapeutics ETC-1002 and Cerenis Therapeutics CER-001, impact the dynamics of the dyslipidemia market? – What are the key market drivers, barriers, and unmet needs that remain unaddressed by currently marketed therapies? What will remain unaddressed by the current dyslipidemia pipeline? Key Findings – The highest-impact driver of the dyslipidemia market will be the launch of the PCSK9 inhibitors, human monoclonal antibody biologics that will be used to treat high LDL-C in addition to statins. Therapeutic novelty combined with biologic pricing will make the PCSK9s the largest contributors to dyslipidemia market growth, even if their use is reserved for niche or high-risk cases. – The CETP inhibitors in the late-stage pipeline have the potential to bring a novel tool to bear against high LDL-C and low HDL-C. However, their success at the regulatory level will depend heavily on their success in major Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trials, making the CETPs the wild-cards of the dyslipidemia pipeline. – Due to the maturity of the current dyslipidemia market, new therapies will need to exploit novel mechanisms of action and/or target orphan drug targets and are more likely to be utilized as add-on therapies to existing treatments. There is a unique opportunity in the familial hypercholesterolemia arena, where effective LDL-C lowering therapies are needed that exhibit clean safety/side-effect profiles. Scope – Overview of dyslipidemia, including epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment guidelines. – Annualized dyslipidemia therapeutics market revenue, annual cost of therapy and treatment usage pattern data from 2013 and forecast for ten years to 2023. – Key topics covered include strategic competitor assessment, market characterization, unmet needs, clinical trial mapping, and implications for the dyslipidemia therapeutics market. – Pipeline analysis: comprehensive data split across different phases, emerging novel trends under development, and detailed analysis of late-stage pipeline drugs. – Analysis of the current and future market competition in the global dyslipidemia therapeutics market. Insightful review of the key industry drivers, restraints and challenges. Each trend is independently researched to provide qualitative analysis of its implications. Reasons to buy – Develop and design your in-licensing and out-licensing strategies through a review of pipeline products and technologies, and by identifying the companies with the most robust pipeline. Additionally a list of acquisition targets included in the pipeline product company list. – Develop business strategies by understanding the trends shaping and driving the dyslipidemia therapeutics market. – Drive revenues by understanding the key trends, innovative products and technologies, market segments, and companies likely to impact the dyslipidemia therapeutics market in the future. – Formulate effective sales and marketing strategies by understanding the competitive landscape and by analysing the performance of various competitors. – Identify emerging players with potentially strong product portfolios and create effective counter-strategies to gain a competitive advantage. – Track drug sales in the 8MM dyslipidemia therapeutics market from 2013-2023. – Organize your sales and marketing efforts by identifying the market categories and segments that present maximum opportunities for consolidations, investments and strategic partnerships.

13:30 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Mar. 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Antifungal Drugs Market 2017-2021" report to their offering. The global antifungal drugs market to grow at a CAGR of 3.20% during the period 2017-2021. Antifungal drugs are chemical compounds used to kill or inhibit the growth of fungi. These drugs act by various mechanisms such as the inhibition of cell division, the inhibition of cell wall formation, and cell membrane disruption. The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global antifungal drugs market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, the report considers revenue generated from the sales of branded, generics and OTC drugs used for the treatment and prevention of various fungal infections. The report also considers the revenue to be generated from the sales of drugs that are expected to be launched in the market along with the decline in revenue from the patent expiries of the marketed drugs during the forecast period. The report also includes a discussion of the Key vendors operating in this market. The latest trend gaining momentum in the market is increased funding for antifungal research. Currently, few companies are investing in the discovery and R&D of drugs for these infections. This can be attributed to the increased regulatory guidelines and the decreased profits available for the development of antifungal drugs. According to the report, one of the major drivers for this market is rising popularity of OTC antifungal drugs for dermal infections. Many OTC products or cosmeceuticals are available in the market for the treatment of dermal infections. Extensive advertisements and endorsements of OTC products have increased their sales over prescription drugs. OTC products are cost-effective in nature compared to their branded counterparts. Further, the report states that one of the major factors hindering the growth of this market is antifungal drug resistance. The development of multidrug resistant microbes is one of the major threats to the human health in the present days. The microbe changes itself to protect against the antimicrobial agent used and thereby develops resistance to the drug. This develops primarily due to the irrational use of drugs. The incorrect prescription of the drugs by the physicians or the incorrect dosing or course taken by the patients along with the increased use in agriculture and animal husbandry industry leads to the development of such resistance. Market Dynamics Market drivers QIDP and other special regulatory designations Increase in prevalence of infections and environmental changes Rising popularity of OTC antifungal drugs for dermal infections Market challenges Antifungal drug resistance Increased availability of generics and alternative therapies Poor patient adherence Market trends Increased funding for antifungal research Increased focus on combination therapies Incorporation of novel technology for product development Strategic alliances and M&A Key vendors Pfizer Merck Astellas Pharma Novartis Johnson & Johnson Other prominent vendors Allergan Almirall Amgen Aqua Pharmaceuticals AstraZeneca Bayer Bristol-Myers Squibb Celgene Dermira Elorac F.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Global Farm & Companion Animal Health Market Veterinary healthcare products include pharmaceuticals, nutrition (feed additives) and devices for both companion and livestock animals. Companion animals include pets such as dogs, cats and horses; although in recent years the market has expanded reasonably for avian pets, reptiles and exotic fish. The healthcare products have transformed the health and quality of life for millions of pets across the world. The greatest challenge of maintaining pets is seeking the keenness to understand if an animal is sick and creating the proper diagnostic tests to look out for the most likely illness that affects the animal. Due to environmental factors such as the weather, flora and fauna in the immediate vicinity, each veterinary medical professional has to rely on knowledge of the surroundings and each case of illness in different region presents specific challenges for treatment. Meanwhile, the range of products for animal health keep increasing with newer anti-infectives, anti-bacterials, anti-parasitics, reproductive aids, prosthetics, and topical solutions and imaging devices. This report focuses on the global emerging demand for companion animal healthcare products. Conventionally the companion animal segment received low attention due to sheer lack of volume associated since only households with stable income. In 2012, U.S. households had approximately 160 million pets and spent close to US$ 500 annually on preliminary veterinary visits and can spend up to US$ 10,000 for taking care of serious illnesses. Surgeries such as cataract and insulin injections along with pain management medications are a regular norm now. Yet, this is a stark picture in front of the actual potential worldwide, since a significant percentage of households in developing countries and negligible number of welfare and adoption centres. There are over 10,000 animal shelters across North America and EU5, and maintain health of companion animals such as dogs and cats. The annual expenditure on healthcare products of a shelter housing 30-40 animals spends approximately US$ 50,000 annually to operate whereas large sized shelters that can handle over 1000 animals spend approximately US$ 500,000 each year. In emerging countries, awareness of animal illnesses is increasing drastically prompting significant expenditure for animal care. Request Free Report Sample@ www.sa-brc.com/Global-Farm–Companion-Animal-Health-Marke… Key segments in this market include animal vaccines, nutrition and dietary products along with pharmaceuticals. In United States, the Dept. of Agriculture sets regulations for these products whereas in United Kingdom, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) which is part of the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The VMD is also responsible for regulating and tracking drug resistance in animals. However, unlike drug resistance in humans which is found to be severe in several cases, the drug resistance in animals does not hold any clinical problems. The overall market for companion animal health market is highly fragmented with well over 50 competitors that includes players such as Avian Biotech International, Dechra Pharmaceuticals, Elandco Animal Health, Merck & Co., Lohmann Animal Health, DuPont Qualicon, Virbac SA, Novartis Animal Health, Novus International, Elanco, Zoetis, Bayer Animal Health, Merial, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Ceva Sante Animale, Vetoquinol, Biobest Laboratories and Ortho-Equine.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Global Oral Vaccines Market The global market for oral vaccines is primarily driven by increasing prevalence of infectious diseases in developing countries, bioterrorism, resistance to existing vaccines, etc. In addition to this, patient adherence to needle-free vaccine regime, preference to oral vaccines by children and geriatric population, cost effective nature, recent FDA approvals to oral vaccines for diseases such as cholera etc. are some of the factors expected to fuel the growth of global oral vaccines market. However, compromised immunogenicity in children and cost for maintaining a cold chain, inaccessibility in remote areas etc. are some of the factors limiting growth of global oral vaccines market. For instance, maintenance of cold chain for oral vaccines across the globe costs over US$ 300 Mn per year. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/14395 Development of new delivery system for oral vaccines may result in more efficiency of these products and may result in less failure rate for clinical trials. Development of low cost oral vaccines for new indications not yet covered by existing vaccines presents huge opportunity for researchers in this field as this may increase the uptake of countries with low immunization accessibility. Currently, several oral vaccine products are being evaluated in clinical trials, but they require more extensive human studies to establish the efficacy. Based on product type, the global oral vaccines market has been classified as live attenuated vaccines, killed/inactivated vaccines, recombinant vaccines and others (ribosomal fractions, antigenic preparations). Among all product types, killed/inactivates vaccines segment is expected to take maximum share in the global market due to high adoption for safety and efficacy. Based on end user, the global oral vaccines market has been classified as hospitals, clinics, government vaccination centers, and research institutes. Government vaccination centers are expected to contribute highest market share in the global oral vaccines market due to strong patient pool towards national immunization programs.

At a conference next week, Bristol-Myers hopes to prove its medications are effective at fighting cancer. (Newscom) ALLISON GATLIN 3/31/2017 Reprints Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Yervoy combo will likely improve overall survival in melanoma patients, an analyst said Friday, ahead of the American Association of Cancer Research meeting next week. The results of the trial of Opdivo and Yervoy in melanoma could prove a long-standing theory that coupling immuno-oncology drugs provides a more potent cancer defense. Bristol is the first to unveil results of an immuno-oncology combo. At the closing bell on the stock market today, Bristol stock was down 1.8%, to 54.38. At the cancer research association's annual gathering April 1-5 in Washington, D.C., Bristol is set to release data in several immuno-oncology trials. Drugs like Opdivo and Yervoy work to teach the immune system to identify cancer cells. What it identifies, it can fight. Opdivo targets the PD-1 protein, whereas Yervoy targets the CTLA-4 protein receptor. Bristol is also working on another target called IDO-1. On Monday, Bristol will unveil the results of its combination of Opdivo and Yervoy vs. Opdivo alone and Yervoy alone in first-line melanoma. Earlier results showed strong progression-free survival in the combo, but this will look at overall survival. Evercore analyst Umer Raffat expects Bristol to hit its goal of improving overall survival in melanoma patients on the combined drug. The FDA conditionally approved Opdivo and Yervoy to treat first-line melanoma on strong earlier trial results. IBD'S TAKE: The immuno-oncology sector could be worth $25 billion by 2025 just based on the targets already identified, an analyst told IBD in February. Head to IBD's Technology page for the deep dive. Bristol will also release the results of a five-year study of Opdivo in previously untreated advanced lung cancer patients later Monday. On Tuesday, Bristol will present data on its IDO-1 inhibitor, known only as BMS-986205, alone and in combination with Opdivo in advanced tumors. The company also has 10 more presentations highlighting studies and research in multiple tumor types including lung, melanoma, and head and neck cancers. Bristol's Opdivo competes against Merck's (MRK) Keytruda as both are PD-1 antibodies approved in advanced lung cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancers. Opdivo has several more approvals than Keytruda and a broader market share. Roche (RHHBY), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Incyte (INCY) also are working on immuno-oncology drugs. Roche's Tecentriq is approved in advanced lung cancer and advanced bladder cancer. Incyte's epacadostat, which targets IDO-1, is being explored in seven tumor types in combination with Merck's Keytruda.
