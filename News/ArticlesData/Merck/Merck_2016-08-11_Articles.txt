Through the organisation’s ‘Merck More Than A Mother’ initiative which aims to define interventions to reduce the stigma and social suffering of infertile women, empower them and raise awareness about male infertility, the pharmaceutical company would support Jackline Mwende, the recent victim of infertility stigma, throughout the rest of her life. ‘Merck More Than A Mother’ initiative will provide Mwende with a monthly income of $250, then will establish a business for her in which she will be able to generate a sustainable monthly income of not less than $250. At the same time, Merck will provide her with prosthetic hands in addition to the needed physical and physiological rehabilitation to enable her to support herself and stand on her own two feet despite the challenge of her brutal disability that was caused by the stigma of infertility – even though her husband was the one who was found with the infertility problem. In a release to announce the support, Hon Joyce Lay, Member of Parliament and the Ambassador for ‘Merck More Than A Mother’ in Kenya, said, “It is so shocking that someone would go to such an extent to batter his own wife and leave her nearly dead. Infertility should never be a reason to separate, hurt or kill your partner. There are so many options out there available to manage infertility.” “Mwende didn’t deserve what she went through and especially that her husband is the one who was found with the infertility problem and not her. Society, government and all stakeholders need to continue to join hands with Merck in their campaign to encourage the acceptance people live with infertility because the stigma associated with infertility puts pressure on them to a point where they do crazy and criminal things. We need to know that it’s a shared responsibility, not just for the couple but for the society too,” Joyce Lay added. “No sane person should torture a woman for failing to produce children. Men should not think that their failure to be a biological father is due to women’s infertility. Why torture a fellow human being and inflict such permanent bodily harm for a fault that could be yours? No amount of justice in the courts of law will bring back Mwende’s arms. Justice will only prevail if Mwende’s case marks a turning point in society that appreciates one fact- “that women are women irrespective of their ability to bear children. They need to be respected,” Hon Sarah Opendi, Uganda Minister of State of Health and Uganda Ambassador of ‘Merck More Than A Mother’, emphasized.

BLRX, -4.55% (tase:BLRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to identifying, in-licensing and developing promising therapeutic candidates, today reports its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016. Highlights and achievements during second quarter of 2016 and to date: Submission of regulatory filings to initiate Phase 2a study in pancreatic cancer for BL-8040 in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA [®] , under immuno-oncology collaboration with Merck announced earlier this year Signing of additional immuno-oncology collaboration, this time with MD Anderson Cancer Center, for second Phase 2a study in pancreatic cancer for BL-8040 in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA Continued enrollment in large (n=194), randomized Phase 2b study for BL-8040 as consolidation treatment for AML patients following standard induction treatment  Commercial launch of BL-5010 as OTC treatment for non-surgical removal of skin lesions by Omega Pharma (a division of Perrigo), following CE Mark approval in March In-licensing of liver fibrosis project under Novartis collaboration Philip A. Serlin appointed Chief Executive Officer, effective October 2016 Expected upcoming significant milestones for remainder of 2016: Initiation of Phase 2a study in pancreatic cancer, under immuno-oncology collaboration with Merck, following expected regulatory approval in Q3 2016 Second Phase 2a immuno-oncology study in pancreatic cancer, under collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center, expected to commence by end of 2016  Full set of data from Phase 2a study for BL-8040 in r/r AML to be presented at the Society of Hematologic Oncology (SOHO) annual meeting, September 7-10, 2016, in Houston, Texas   Partial results from Phase 2 study for BL-8040 in stem-cell mobilization for allogeneic transplantation expected by end of 2016 Regulatory submission for BL-7010 clinical efficacy study, for marketing purposes as food supplement Expansion of commercial rollout of BL-5010 by Omega to additional countries and development of 2 [nd] OTC indication for the product   Philip A. Serlin, Chief Financial and Operating Officer of BioLineRx, remarked, "The second quarter of 2016 highlighted the continued execution of our plans as we advance and expand our lead oncology platform, BL-8040; see the initial market penetration of BL-5010; continue the development of BL-7010 as a food supplement, and maintain active asset screening and in-licensing activities with Novartis. "We are pleased to have entered into an immuno-oncology collaboration with MD Anderson for a second Phase 2a study of BL-8040 with Merck's KEYTRUDA in pancreatic cancer, which provides additional validation of the potential of our lead oncology drug platform in the cancer immunotherapy space. We continue to examine other potential collaborations in this space. In addition, we are looking forward to announcing full results from our successful Phase 2a study for relapsed and refractory AML at the upcoming Society of Hematology Oncology Meeting in September and we continue to push forward in our Phase 2b trial in an earlier treatment line for AML as a consolidation treatment following standard induction treatment. We also look forward to initiating our Phase 2a study in pancreatic cancer under our collaboration with Merck, expected by the end of this quarter," added Mr. Serlin. "BL-5010, our first product in the market, is already being sold in a number of countries in Europe. Omega Pharma plans to continue to gradually launch the product in additional European countries over the next 6-9 months, and beyond that time frame, to additional territories. To date, we have not recorded material revenues from this collaboration, but we expect revenues to gradually increase as the first product launch expands and the second product launch commences. In addition, we have in-licensed a drug candidate for the treatment of liver fibrosis, specifically nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), under our strategic collaboration with Novartis for the co-development of selected Israeli-sourced novel drug candidates, and we expect to in-license additional promising projects to the collaboration in the next few months," continued Mr. Serlin. "In closing, we ended the second quarter with $41.8 million of cash on our balance sheet. With our focus on achieving our expected milestones, we remain well positioned to carry out our strategic and operational plans," Mr. Serlin concluded. Financial Results for Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2016 Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $2.7 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 5.2%, compared to $2.9 million for the comparable period in 2015. The small decrease resulted primarily from lower spending on BL-7010 in the 2016 period, partially offset by increased spending related to clinical trial preparations for BL-8040. Research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $5.3 million, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 13.5%, compared to $6.1 million for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease resulted primarily from lower expenditures for BL-7010 during the 2016 period, as well as the conclusion of one of the clinical trials for BL-8040 in 2015. Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $0.3 million, similar to the comparable period in 2015. Sales and marketing expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $0.5 million, similar to the comparable period in 2015. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $0.9 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 12.5%, compared to $1.0 million for the comparable period in 2015. The small decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in salary-related payments and depreciation. General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $1.8 million, similar to the comparable period in 2015. The Company's operating loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 amounted to $3.8 million, compared with an operating loss of $4.2 million for the corresponding 2015 period. The Company's operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 amounted to $7.6 million, compared with an operating loss of $8.5 million for the corresponding 2015 period. Non-operating income (expenses) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily relate to fair-value adjustments of warrant liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. These fair-value adjustments, which were not material in the 2016 periods, are highly influenced by the Company's share price at each period end (revaluation date). Financial income (expenses), net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily relate to investment income earned on bank deposits, as well as banking fees. The decrease from 2015 to 2016 reflects a lower cash balance and a continued reduction in global investment yields. The Company's net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 amounted to $3.7 million, compared with a net loss of $4.8 million for the corresponding 2015 period. The Company's net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 amounted to $7.2 million, compared with a net loss of $9.1 million for the corresponding 2015 period. The Company held $41.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits as of June 30, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities was $7.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $7.1 million for the comparable period in 2015. The $0.3 million increase in net cash used was primarily the result of a decrease in trade payables and accruals. Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $4.2 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $17.9 million for the comparable period in 2015. The changes in cash flows from investing activities relate primarily to investments in, and maturities of, short-term bank deposits and other investments during the respective periods. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.5 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $28.6 million for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease in cash flows from financing activities reflects the underwritten public offering which was completed in March 2015.

A high-profile failure in lung cancer patients punished Bristol-Myers Squibb's invetors and rewarded Merck & Co.'s investors. Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Aug 10, 2016 at 6:40PM Image source: Getty Images. Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) Opdivo failed to deliver the goods in a key lung cancer trial, causing Bristol-Myers' shares to plummet. The failure also prompted investors to rush into Bristol-Myers Squibb's competitors, including Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK). which markets Keytruda, a drug that works similarly to Opdivo. Does Opdivo's disapointment make Merck a better buy than Bristol-Myers?  Squaring off Opdivo and Keytruda are already approved for use in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC) who have seen their disease return after chemotherapy, and both companies are studying if their drugs are effective in previously untreated patients. Merck reported data from a trial evaluating Keytruda instead of chemotherapy in previously untreated NSCLC patients in June, and the results were good enough that independent monitors recommended Merck's trial be halted early so that patients in the chemotherapy arm of the study could be offered Keytruda.  The positive outcome of that trial sparked optimism that Bristol-Myers' trial of Opdivo in previously untreated NSCLC patients would similarly pan out. Both Keytruda and Opdivo inhibit PD-1 to keep cancer from hiding from the immune system. Unfortunately, investor optimism for Opdivo's trial proved to be unwarranted. Opdivo failed to significantly delay disease progression relative to chemotherapy, clearing the way for Keytruda to have the first-line NSCLC treatment market to itself. Digging into the details Keytruda's win and Opdivo's loss in untreated NSCLC patients may say more about the relationship of PD-1 expression and the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors than it does about these individual drugs. That's because the two trials were designed quite differently from one another. The Keytruda study only involved patients with very high PD-L1 expression, while Opdivo's trial included patients with both low- and high-levels of PD-L1 expression. Specifically, Keytruda's results came from its use in patients with PD-L1 expression equal to or greater than 50%, while Opdivo's results came from its use in a patient pool with PD-L1 expression greater than 5%. Since Opdivo's trial included results from both low- and high-expressing patients, the biggest takeaway from these diverging trial results is that PD-1 inhibitors efficacy appears to be highly correlated to PD-L1 expression. Obviously, we won't know if that's true for sure until we see full results from Opdivo's trial (Bristol-Myers Squibb plans to release more information at a key conference later this year), but it wouldn't surprise me if Opdivo's efficacy in patients with 50% or greater PD-L1 expression matches up with Keytruda's. Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb Irons in the fire Even if the full analysis of Bristol-Myers Squibb's trial doesn't show that Keytruda's advantage over Opdivo was due to trial design, Keytruda's potential to be the go-to in this indication could be short-lived. Bristol-Myers Squibb is conducting a trial that combines Opdivo with another one of its immunology drugs, Yervoy, and with chemotherapy, and those approaches may yield better response rates and progression-free survival data than Keytruda monotherapy. In June, Bristol-Myers Squibb presented phase 1b results showing that 57% of lung cancer patients in the Opdivo/Yervoy combination arm responded to the treatment, including 92% of patients with PD-L1 expression of 50% or higher. Results from a phase 3 trial of this combination could be available as early as 2018. Although results can vary widely from indication to indication for drug combinations, the use of Opdivo/Yervoy in first-line metastatic melanoma is already the single most prescribed therapy in the U.S. for that indication. Additionally, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) is developing its own PD-1 drug, durvalumab, and phase 3 studies combining durvalumab with another AstraZeneca drug, tremelimumab, in NSCLC could be available in 2018, too. Tying it together Non-small lung cancer represents 85% of the 224,000 lung cancer diagnosis every year in the U.S., and with five-year survival rates of less than 18%, there's a big, unmet need for new treatment options that work better. The size of the NSCLC patient population and the fact that Opdivo and Keytruda carry six-figure price tags mean a lot of money is at stake in the indication, and therefore, Opdivo's trial failure shouldn't be ignored. However, investors may want to keep the positive impact for Merck of this failure in perspective, especially given all the ongoing R&D in the indication. Overall, while this is clearly a short-term win for Merck, the long-term winner has yet to be determined. Todd Campbell has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Tweet   The Most Recent Top Six Medical Conspiracy Cover-Ups Exposed! The most recent Top Six Clinical Conspiracy theories Exposed!   Miracle Alternatives, LLC   Medical Conspiracy Cover-Ups Exposed!   (EMAILWIRE.COM, August 11, 2016 ) Chicago, - IL - The mainstream media is focused this week on attempting to persuade you that "clinical conspiracy theory concepts" are wacky and incorrect. Released by Reuters, UNITED STATE Today and various other conventional media outlets, a fake tale based upon distorted exploration is currently attempting to encourage you that there is no such point as a "clinical conspiracy." No, drug companies never performed experiments on kids, killing various at the same time. No, the NIH never took part in scoundrel medical experiments on detainees. No, the United States government never lied to you, or covered natural cures, or conspired with remarkable Pharma. GMOs were established by people who LIKE the environment, as well! That's the rubbish we're all supposed to believe, according to the mainstream media. By conjuring up the expression "conspiracy theory concepts," junk science authors and corporate-sellout journalists attempt to marginalize real record of incredible Pharma felony criminal offenses, medical experiments on children, valid government collusion with market and the remarkable damage which has actually been carried out on the American individuals by the medical industrial made complex. In fact, the mainstream media's insurance coverage of all this is certainly Orwellian, as if the Ministry of Reality is aiming to revise U.S. record to eliminate all the components where medicine companies, the NIH and the United States government quite absolutely murdered detainees, blacks, infants and soldiers for "scientific treatment.". I refuse to gloss through the history of REAL clinical conspiracy theories and all the lives lost to the damaging quest of medical profits at the cost of human dignity. So to address the mainstream media's delusional effort to gloss via the genuine history of real clinical conspiracy theories, we have actually assembled the leading 10 REAL clinical conspiracy theories along with links to resources. Read and find out real record the mainstream media is trying to erase! Top 10 REAL #medical #conspiracies. # 1) Pfizer habits clinical experiments on Nigerian children - In 2009 (and in succeeding years, as follow-up), we reported on just how gigantic medicine manufacturer Pfizer was bought to make up Nigerian families after performing unlawful clinical testing that left ratings of Nigerian children either hurt or dead:. The instance started in 1996, when Pfizer essential a human trial to profit authorization for its brand-new antibiotic Trovan. When an infective disease of meningitis, cholera and measles broke out in Kano, Nigeria, the company promptly assembled an expedition team and flew them to that country. Pfizer set up an outdoor tents right near the clinical terminal where medical professionals Without Borders were providing totally free treatments and recruited 200 kids to become part in an unlicensed medicine trial. Moms and dads mention they weren't told that proven medications were being dispersed just backyards away, that their kids were being enrolled in a medicine trial, or that pet researches had actually advised that Trovan can create liver and joint pain. Eleven of the 200 youngsters in the study died, and parents declare that experienced mind hurt, body organ failing and various other serious negative effects. # 2) illegal rate fixing to cheat the American people and state governments from billions - Apparently, the significant Government/ tremendous Pharma cabal in Washington would certainly have you believe that medicine manufacturers just have your absolute interests in mind, not their revenues or power. As a matter of fact, for several years drug makers have typically conspired to participate in unlawful rate repairing, as confirmed by numerous legal actions and court. As I at one time reported:. In what is currently the major criminal scam negotiation ever to bulge of the pharmaceutical sector, GlaxoSmithKline has begged guilty and accepted pay $1 billion in criminal penalties and $2 billion in civil penalties going after a nine-year government investigation right into its jobs. According to UNITED STATE government detectives, GlaxoSmithKline:. - Consistently paid off medical professionals with deluxe trips and paid talking gigs. - Made medicine safety and security data and lied to the FDA. - Defrauded Medicare and Medicaid out of billions. - Tricked regulators about the efficiency of its medicines. - Relied on its misleading techniques to gain billions of dollars supplying potentially unsafe medications to innocent customers and medical patients. And this is merely the part they got captured doing. GSK does not also reject any of this. The business quickly paid the $3 billion appropriate, apologized to its buyers, and proceeded conducting business as usual. # 3) Vaccine manufacturers realeased their vaccines were killing individuals - One of Merck's leading designers understood that the firm's polio vaccinations were heavily infected with carcinogenic viruses. The scientist, Dr. Maurice Hilleman, may be heard reviewing it in this stunning video. He and various other "scientist" associates are really heard on the recording giggling about the fact that the stealth viruses would eliminate individuals. The mainstream media has never ever reported on this vital item of medical history for the reason that it would subject the reality about injections. # 4) Merck misstated injection proof - A pair of previous virologists publicly claimed that the firm conspired to commit vaccine expedition fraud through the spiking of human blood examples with pet antibodies. As we reported in 2012:. The previous Merck virologists compete that the multivalent mumps component has a greatly boiled down efficacy which is essentially responsible for mumps outbreaks all through the last decade which prompted global calls for MMR booster injection every 4 - 8 years ... By blending the extremely low degrees of human antibodies with animal antibodies, a much higher total level of virus neutralization was acquired compared to could develop from human antibodies alone. The human antibody degrees alone would never secure in the real life contrary wild mumps. But after adding pet antibodies, the human blood examples which had at once fell short under the old "gold requirement" screening were retested making use of the "boosted" methods and passed with flying shades. New 'enhanced' examinations revealed ONE HUNDRED% effectiveness, not in contrast wild mumps virus, but in contrast the mumps vaccination virus. # 5) UNITED STATE government collusion to dedicate medical murder - In just what must shock all Americans to discover, the government-funded National Institutes of Health and a number of medication companies conspired to behavior illegal medical experiments on prisoners held in Guatemalan jails. Head of state Obama was in fact compelled to provide a public apology for this wrong greater than sixty years after it occurred. As Natural Information at one time reported:. The U.S. government intentionally moneyed and purposefully participated in criminal clinical experiments contrary Guatemalan prisoners from 1946 - 1948, which individuals took part in these criminal offenses were then promoted to high ranks of impact in the clinical area. A minimum of 5,500 individuals were composed into the experiments, this consists of kids, females and the mentally ill. The number intentionally infected with sexually-transmitted diseases (Sexually transmitted diseases) went beyond 1,300 (that we know of). Victims weren't even informed they were being polluted with Sexually transmitted diseases. The whole experiment was a private procedure relating to a confessed conspiracy theory between tremendous Pharma and the U.S. government. Obvious proof has actually currently emerged that the doctors and clinical researchers associated with the experiment actively took steps to hide exactly what they were doing. # 6) Conspiracy theory to classify poisonous chemicals "fluoride" and get the public to drink them - It is a historical reality that the fluoride and oral sectors have actually conspired to misguide individuals right into believe "fluoride" is a conveniently happening substance. The truth is, the fluorine compounds made use of in the public water supply are surely by-products of plant food processing or phosphate mining procedures, and they commonly contain heavy metals. Even many mainstream scientists currently end that fluoride reduces IQs and ruins the brain celebration of youngsters. So why are we still being suggested that fluoride is a "public health step" that assists everybody? Go to any common council or various other government company choosing on whether or not to fluoridate your regional supply of water, and you'll get health officials insisting that fluoride is all-natural, and hence safe. They do not trouble to say that quickly taking place fluoride is calcium fluoride, while right stuff bought by neighborhoods to fluoridate their water is salt fluoride, a substantially hazardous mix of hexafluorosilicic acid and salt silicofluoride. ALRIGHT so exactly what can we do to stay clear of becoming a target of future #medical #Conspiracies? Do exactly what millions of individuals are doing now.

11, 2016, 08:02 ET Share this article KENILWORTH, N.J., Aug. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The increased attention on water sanitation issues in Rio has raised a lot of questions about water-related illnesses from people worldwide. To help inform the public and increase prevention awareness, the Merck Manuals today released a list of waterborne illnesses that people tend to overlook in the United States, leaving them vulnerable to diseases caused by bacteria and microscopic parasites. Originating in oceans, lakes, rivers or pools, these hidden dangers can cause illnesses that range from uncomfortable and inconvenient to life threatening. To shed light on these dangers, infectious disease specialist Dr. Larry Bush has identified five waterborne illnesses to be aware of when heading to the water and key steps to preventing them on MerckManuals.com: 1. Giardiasis is an infection of the small intestine caused by the parasite Giardia, which lives in fresh water. The most common parasitic intestinal infection in the United States, Giardia can be present even in clean-appearing mountain streams, so hikers are at risk. Symptoms typically appear one or two weeks after infection and include abdominal cramps, gas and watery diarrhea. If you think you have Giardiasis, make an appointment with a doctor, who will likely ask for a stool sample. Treatment typically involves a course of antiparasitic drugs. 2. Shigellosis is an infection caused by the bacteria Shigella. An estimated 500,000 people in the U.S. develop the infection every year from water contaminated with human waste and inadequately chlorinated pools. Individuals don't have to ingest very much water contaminated with Shigella to become infected. Symptoms include fever and diarrhea along with painful abdominal cramps. More severe infections may lead to dysentery – frequent bowel movements that may contain blood, mucus and pus. Treatment for Shigellosis includes fluids with salt and antibiotics for more severe cases. 3. Vibriosis is an infection caused by about a dozen Vibrio bacteria. Cholera is the most serious illness caused by the bacteria, but is not very common in the U.S. Noncholera Vibrio bacteria live in warm salt water or mixed salt and fresh water, like bays. Most noncholera Vibrio infections are intestinal infections caused by consuming inadequately cooked shellfish (especially oysters) harvested from contaminated waters. People can also develop Vibrio skin infections if they have an open cut and swim in contaminated water or cut themselves on a crustacean that harbors vibrio. Vibriosis causes 80,000 illnesses each year in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control. Symptoms include diarrhea, cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills. Treatment is limited to drinking lots of water to replace lost fluids. 4. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a group of bacteria that normally reside in the intestine of healthy people. However, some strains can cause infection, the most common being E. coli O157:H7. It can be contracted by swallowing inadequately chlorinated water that's been contaminated by the stool of infected individuals, for example in public pools. Symptoms, primarily diarrhea and cramps, begin about three days after exposure. For E. coli 0157:H7, treatment is usually limited to administering fluids, and symptoms typically resolve within eight days. 5. Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) is an infection of the brain caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba. The amoeba lives in warm fresh water throughout the world and enters the brain by traveling up nerves from the nose. PAM is rare, only 138 people have died from it since 1962, according to the CDC, however it has recently made headlines in the U.S. When the amoeba reaches the brain, it causes inflammation, tissue death and bleeding. Symptoms, which appear within one to two weeks, include a change in smell or taste, headache and stiff neck, sensitivity to light, nausea and vomiting. The infection moves fast, often causing death within 10 days. Keys to prevention The most effective prevention strategies go hand in hand with good overall health – make sure all vaccinations are up to date, drink only properly treated water and practice good personal hygiene. But there are more specific steps you can take before, during and after you go in the water to limit the risk. Before you go in the water: Check for official updates on the condition of the water and advisories warning people not to swim. Inspect water for signs of bacteria or algae, which can cause skin irritation. Avoid swimming in water where babies are wearing diapers or people have open cuts. Shower to wash away any bacteria on you. During your time in the water: Avoid swimming with open cuts – even waterproof bandages do little to prevent bacteria entering a wound. Swallow as little water as possible. It's all right to open your eyes – eyes are mostly impervious to bacteria in the water. After you get out of the water: Take a shower immediately. If you do contract an illness, alert the pool, township, park, etc. as quickly as possible with as many details as possible.

By Amy Feldman Biography October 18, 2014 When markets are turbulent, as they’ve been lately, there’s something to be said for sticking with funds that have a long history of downside protection. Franklin Mutual Global Discovery (ticker: TEDIX), which has $26 billion in assets and a 22-year history of buying undervalued stocks, is one such fund. “Obviously, the names change, and the world changes, but our fundamental approach is very consistent,” says co-manager Peter Langerman, who is also Franklin Mutual Advisors’ CEO. The fund’s strategy, since the days when Mutual Series was run by Max Heine and legendary value investor Michael Price, has involved searching for companies, wherever they might be, that trade at a discount to what the managers figure is their intrinsic value.

Photo: Mike McGregor The result is a portfolio of 135 holdings that’s heavy on companies that have stumbled and are in various stages of restructuring; add some distressed deals and merger arbitrage opportunities and you’ve got a mix that, today, spans Apple AAPL -0.813953488372093% Apple Inc.

Langerman and his co-managers—Philippe Brugère-Trélat and Timothy Rankin—aren’t afraid to be activists, pushing holdings to reallocate capital or make other changes to their businesses, and they’re not averse to waiting. Turnover, at 24%, is well below that of the fund’s world-stock peers, according to Morningstar. The fund’s results have been especially good in down markets, such as 2001, though performance tends to trail rival funds during rallies, as occurred in 2012. Over the past five years, Franklin Mutual Global Discovery has returned an average annualized 8.6%, versus 6.5% for the MSCI World Index. Barron’s visited the managers in their Short Hills, N.J., office, to see where they’re finding opportunities today. The global fund’s exposure to U.S. stocks has continued to climb—U.S. stocks now make up 52% of the portfolio, up from just 14% five years earlier. But they’re also finding value in global energy companies and European banks. The fund also has a cash stake of 9%, giving it the flexibility to move quickly as deals come up. Until the recent selloff, Langerman said, the fund had been trimming and getting out of positions that were approaching their target valuations. “It’s harder today than it’s been for a while,” he said then. But as the market has tumbled, it has created a better environment for these value managers to buy—and they’re searching out new ideas and adding to existing equity and debt positions on the cheap.

Sources: Morningstar; MSCI; Franklin Templeton Langerman, 59, and Brugère-Trélat, 64, have been running the fund since 2009; Rankin, 42, became a co-manager in 2010. But all three have been at the firm for many years. Langerman, a onetime bankruptcy attorney, joined the firm in 1986 as an analyst. Brugère-Trélat joined two years earlier, after French President François Mitterrand nationalized the private bank where he had been working. Rankin, 42, arrived at the firm in 1997 after a stint as an equity analyst. Today, the trio is finding opportunities in energy, which represents 10% of holdings, and includes Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) and Apache APA 1.8248759404514168% Apache Corp.

Both are restructuring plays, snapped up during difficulties. “We don’t want to just make a commodity bet,” Langerman says. At Shell, for example, the managers wrote a letter to the management and board, and held follow-up calls. Today, they’re heartened by Shell’s new CEO, Ben van Beurden, who has committed to selling assets and cutting investment spending. In Europe, the managers historically owned food, drink, and tobacco stocks, but today, they’re finding better deals in financials, especially the banks. “There was a perception that the European banks were behind the curve in adapting to the new market environment, compared with the U.S. banks, both in terms of balance-sheet size and capital ratios, but there has been a tremendous change in the way banks have managed those two issues over the past two years,” says Brugère-Trélat, who also manages the Franklin Mutual European fund (TEMIX). The Global Discovery fund owns banks in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy, including BNP Paribas BNP.FR -1.279676713251389% BNP Paribas S.A.

While clouds still loom in Europe’s low growth, many of Europe’s best banking franchises are cheap, he says. “We like very solid retail-oriented banks that are trading at a significant discount, relative to American banks. Where else can you find banks trading at a discount to book?” The trio also likes some U.S. financials, such as large banks, including Citigroup C 0.5971479500891266% Citigroup Inc.

It’s a little bit over book value at this point, and it’s got low-double-digit earnings growth per share. And they’re still in the midst of their restructuring.” Mergers and acquisitions have begun to pick up amid low growth and low interest rates, Langerman says. “We’ve been quite active,” he says. That activity has included controversial tax inversions, in which one company buys another based in a lower-tax country, with the intention of moving the joined firm’s headquarters there.

Distressed companies, historically a larger part of the fund, have been a tougher bet recently as default rates among corporate bonds have stayed at low levels. “We’re looking, and they’re chunky,” Langerman says. “It’s like M&A: You’re not doing anything, and then all of a sudden, there’s a huge deal and you can put $500 million to work. You just have to be there and be able, ready, and willing to act.” With a few billion in cash on hand, the ability to move quickly shouldn’t be a problem.

With the cloud of severe pricing legislation starting to lift some, investors are focusing on fundamentals and near-term catalysts that could provide a tailwind for some of the biotech leaders. In a series of recent research reports from the analysts at Jefferies, they pointed to companies with specific catalysts that could have a tremendous impact on shares. Three companies show up on the radar that all have the potential to move big for shareholders. Biogen Jefferies is very bullish on this large cap biotech, and the stock is down over 30% from highs that were printed in March of last year. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) discovers, develops and delivers to patients worldwide innovative therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, hematologic conditions and autoimmune disorders. Founded in 1978, Biogen is one of the world’s oldest independent biotech companies, and patients worldwide benefit from its leading multiple sclerosis (MS) and innovative hemophilia therapies. While many on Wall Street acknowledged in the past that the company’s core MS drug market is facing challenges going forward, with most diagnosed patients now treated, payers limiting net benefits from price increases and competing entrants expected. With those issues in mind, the firm is still positive on Tysabri, especially for secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis, with upcoming clinical data a big factor. Biogen posted outstanding earnings in July and the stock has rallied sharply on rumors of a buyout by a large pharmaceutical company. The Jefferies analysts think the company is indeed a legitimate takeout candidate and cite Pfizer, Shire and Roche as companies that could be buyers, in addition to Merck and Allergan. They note that the potential to be a neuroscience bolt-on, the company’s consistent operating cash flows from the MS business and the recent CEO departure as all positives for a potential suitor. The Jefferies price target for the stock is $319, and the Wall Street consensus target is $333.60. The stock closed Wednesday at $308.87 per share.

The launch of several new lipid-targeting therapies, which offer clinical effectiveness for statin-intolerant patients and patients who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein C (LDL-C) in combination to statin therapy, will drive the ACS market, according to research and consulting firm GlobalData. The companys latest report states that this growth, which will occur across the seven major markets (7MM) of the USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and Japan, can be attributed to launches of the first proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9 inhibitors), Repatha (evolocumab) and Praluent (alirocumab) by 2016, the launch of ETC-1002 by 2021, and increases in the global prevalence of ACS. Michela J. McMullan, GlobalDatas analyst covering cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, explains: 'At present, a large proportion of patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease cannot reach guideline recommended levels of LDL-C with the standard of care therapies, which leads to recurrent ACS events.' 'However, the revolutionary PCSK9 inhibitors Repatha and Praluent have both truly demonstrated their efficacy in lowering LDL-C in their pivotal Phase III trials, as 57% and 58% reductions in LDL-C from baseline compared to placebo were observed for evolocumab and alirocumab, respectively,' she added. Esperions ETC-1002, a novel lipid-lowering drug, is another therapy set to drive the ACS market. It has shown impressive efficacy in its Phase IIb study and is initiating a sweep of Phase III trials in 2016. As the drug is an oral, once-daily treatment, GlobalData believes that Esperion may be a viable competitor in the latter half of the forecast period by capturing the majority of patient share from the statin-intolerant patient population. McMullan continues: 'Generally speaking, the ACS market is a highly lucrative area for pharmaceutical companies to invest in drug development. Historically, Merck & Co. was the leading innovator in this space, boasting a multitude of therapies to combat atherosclerosis, such as the first-in-class statin Mevacor (lovastatin), as well as Zocor (simvastatin) and the cholesterol absorption inhibitor Zetia (ezetimibe). 'However, all of these drugs will lose patent exclusivity within the first half of the forecast period, so it is unlikely that Merck will maintain a competitive position during the forecast period. Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron, developers of the newly launched PCSK9 inhibitors Repatha (evolocumab) and Praluent (alirocumab), respectively, are now seen as the leading innovators in the lipidlowering arena,' McMullan concluded.

America PUNE, India, August 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The vaccines market is expected to reach $48.03 billion by 2021 from USD 32.24 billion in 2016 at a CAGR of 8.3% driven by increasing focus on immunization programs and rising government and nongovernment funding for vaccine development while North America is expected to dominate the market globally. Complete report on vaccines market spread across 158 pages, profiling 10 companies and supported with 89 tables and 55 figures is now available at http://www.rnrmarketresearch.com/vaccine-market-by-technology-types-trend-analysis-by-various-classes-live-attenuated-subunit-toxoid-conjugate-dna-recombinant-vector-synthetic-dentritic-vaccines-and-by-indications-i-market-report.html. The global vaccines market is segmented based on technology, type, disease indication, end-users, and regions. The conjugate vaccines segment is expected to register the highest growth rate in the vaccines market, by technology, during the forecast period. The high growth in this segment is attributed to the increasing company investments in development of new vaccines. Based on end-users, the vaccines market is segmented into pediatrics and adults. The pediatrics segment is expected to account for the largest share of the market in 2016. Increasing prevalence of diseases in children and the rising number of awareness programs to promote vaccination will drive the growth of this market. Geographically, the vaccines market is dominated by North America, followed by Europe, Asia, and the Rest of the World (RoW). Growth in the North American segment is primarily driven by rising government funding for vaccine research in the North American countries. The major factors contributing to the growth of the vaccines market include high prevalence of diseases; rising government and nongovernment funding for vaccine development, and increasing focus on immunization programs.

Meet the Contributors → Heron Gains FDA Support For Nausea Drug After A Year Under Review David Holley August 10th, 2016 @xconholley @xconomy Like Us Xconomy San Francisco —  The decision that Heron Therapeutics has been waiting on for almost a year is finally in: The FDA has approved the Redwood City, CA-based company’s drug for nausea and vomiting associated with certain chemotherapy regimens. Heron (NASDAQ: HRTX) first submitted a new drug application for the treatment, granisetron (Sustol), to the FDA in September 2015. The regulatory agency extended its expected decision date three times, most recently in April. Now, with the approval in hand, Heron says it hopes to begin selling the drug in the fourth quarter of this year. Granisetron is an extended-release, injectable drug that aims to help cancer patients—particularly those with breast cancer—deal with both immediate and delayed nausea and vomiting resulting from chemotherapy, for up to five days. The drug works to counter the side effects of a couple of the most commonly prescribed types of chemotherapy, such as anthracycline and cyclophosphamide combinations, Heron says. The company’s stock rose about 9.8 percent from yesterday’s closing price, to $21.80, as of 9:57 a.m. in New York. Waltham, MA-based Tesaro won approval in September 2015 for another anti-nausea drug being sold as rolapitant (Varubi), which ran into trouble after it missed clinical goals in the first two of its three late-stage trials. The company’s third attempt at a Phase 3 trial hit all of its primary and secondary goals, as Xconomy previously reported. There are a number of other drugs that aim to aid patients with chemo-induced nausea, including Merck’s aprepitant (Emend) and palonosetron (Aloxi), which is marketed and distributed by Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai. In its news release, Heron says it aims to make granisetron stand out by noting its ability to potentially protect patients for up to five days. In particular, Heron says that other drugs, “including palonosetron, are generally effective for 48 hours or less.” On the palonosetron website, the drug is touted as being used to treat nausea on the day of chemo, as well as up to five days following chemotherapy. Heron didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on pricing of the newly approved drug. David Holley is Xconomy's national correspondent based in Austin, TX.

The Brexit referendum first buoyed the stock as the pound slumped ahead of the U.K.’s likely departure from the European Union, reducing research and manufacturing costs for local companies like AstraZeneca, whose largest market is the U.S. The next month, Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot kindled takeover speculation when he touted the company’s prolific product pipeline -- offerings that were highlighted again last week when rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. reported a research setback. “Astra is showing a bit of leg this year because of pipeline missteps by others,’’ said Daniel Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital LLP, who owns Astra stock. “It wouldn’t surprise me if the shares move up more from here. The pipeline is coming into view.’’ Also to Astra’s benefit, having the best data or being the first to sell a new treatment aren’t the only ways to win market share in the U.S. anymore, Mahony said. With pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts and CVS increasingly having a say in which drugs patients get access to, the ability to offer the best prices to payers, especially for costly combination products, could also determine success. Opdivo Failure Astra shares rose to a record last week, while Bristol-Myers plunged the most in 14 years after the U.S. company announced that its immune oncology drug Opdivo had failed in a lung cancer trial that would have been the basis for widely expanding use of the treatment. The U.K. drugmaker’s stock slumped 0.3 percent to 5,146 pence as of 9:28 a.m. local time on Friday. With Bristol-Myers’s stumble, Astra got a leg up in the immune oncology race, where it has long been a laggard. Competitors Bristol-Myers, Merck & Co. and Roche Holding AG are already on the market with their checkpoint inhibitors, and Merck KGaA could file for approval of its drug this year, putting Astra in fifth place.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter Astra is betting on its combination of immune oncology agents to give it an edge over competitors that have to work with other drugmakers to create combination treatments. It’s conducting a late-stage trial, called the Mystic study, of its immune oncology drug durvalumab, which is used in combination and also alone as a first-line treatment for patients with lung cancer. Securing an approval for such use would give the drugs a much wider potential market than Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo, which isn’t currently approved as a first-line therapy. Mystic Trial Data As fund managers position their portfolios for the coming year, Astra’s Mystic data, set to be announced in the first half of next year, could make its shares a compelling buy. Meanwhile, analysts at Citigroup Inc. published a note on July 27 calling Astra the “most attractive” acquisition target for Novartis AG to pursue, from among a field including Bristol-Myers and Incyte Corp. “There’s a huge amount of potential pipeline value riding on the outcome of that clinical trial,” said Dani Saurymper, manager of the AXA Framlington Health Funds in London, who oversees $875 million in healthcare stocks. “Novartis would be taking on significant risk if they were to pursue an acquisition of AstraZeneca prior to the announcement of those clinical trial results.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

World GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT WATCH Op-Ed Can river blindness enter the elite club of eradicated diseases? Impact of River Blindness in Burkina Faso. World Health Organization African Region In this undated photo taken during the World Health Organization's efforts to control river blindness in Burkina Faso, a child leads two men impaired by the disease. In this undated photo taken during the World Health Organization's efforts to control river blindness in Burkina Faso, a child leads two men impaired by the disease. (World Health Organization African Region) Dr. Matshidiso Moeti It has been 44 years since a World Bank president traveled to drought-stricken Upper Volta in West Africa — today called Burkina Faso — and encountered a startling and disturbing scene. Blind people were everywhere, with children often leading adults around. The cause of their blindness was a tiny worm, called a “filarial nematode,” transmitted by bites from black flies that swarmed the rivers and streams of Burkina Faso. Strangely, the worms do their damage by dying, which generates toxins that can create lesions on the skin and on the cornea of the eyes. Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa. World Health Organization Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa. Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa. (World Health Organization) The buildup of cornea lesions from several years of exposure to the disease causes permanent blindness. That’s why, though technically known as onchocerciasis, it’s more commonly called river blindness. In the wake of that impressionable 1972 visit, the world mobilized to tackle the problem on a large scale. Fast-forward to the present, and river blindness is once again bringing disease experts back to Burkina Faso. But they are coming to mark a milestone in the global onchocerciasis control effort. Disease control has been so successful in Burkina Faso and other affected countries that we’re ready to move beyond merely containing the disease. Elimination of river blindness is the new goal — both from its key strongholds in Africa, where 99% of the disease occurs, and from smaller pockets of infection in Latin America and Yemen. Completely eliminating onchocerciasis from all areas where it is known to exist would take the world to an extremely rare place: disease eradication. Disease experts don’t use the term eradication lightly. The club of the eradicated human disease is supremely elite. It has only one member, smallpox. There are other candidates. Polio is perhaps closest to gaining entry into this club. But disease experts and policymakers are now considering how 40 years of work combating onchocerciasis in Africa has made eradication a plausible scenario. A man impaired by river blindness is featured in this undated photo taken during the World Health Organization's efforts to control the disease in Burkina Faso, World Health Organization African Region A man impaired by river blindness is featured in this undated photo taken during the World Health Organization's efforts to control the disease in Burkina Faso, A man impaired by river blindness is featured in this undated photo taken during the World Health Organization's efforts to control the disease in Burkina Faso, (World Health Organization African Region) Before intensive control efforts were launched in the 1970s, 40 million people were infected with the disease and 160 million were at risk. Now in at least 10 West African countries, it is no longer considered a public health threat. Other areas are not far behind. An analysis published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases of Poverty found that in one large swath of disease hot spots outside West Africa, infections have plummeted to at or near zero. The battle against river blindness has been waged with two key weapons. Insect control is one factor, but the most decisive intervention involves treating entire communities repeatedly with the anti-parasite medication ivermectin. Merck, the drug’s key manufacturer, has been donating the medication to the World Health Organization, allowing it to be deployed forcefully against river blindness in mass treatment campaigns in which everyone in an area at risk is treated regardless of symptoms. Repeating mass treatment over several years can eventually eliminate the disease from an endemic region. It does this by breaking the cycle of infection, the passage of onchocerciasis larvae from flies to humans and from humans back to flies. Mass treatment campaigns have reached well over 100 million people. Several weeks ago, in Ouagadougou, Burkino Faso’s capital, I witnessed the administration of the 1-billionth tablet of ivermectin in the fight against river blindness.  A nurse in Kouadioa-Allaikro, Ivory Coast, gives medicine against onchocerciasis, commonly called river blindness, in 2008.

(Issouf Sanogo / AFP/Getty Images) The success against onchocerciasis is having a profound influence on the broader effort to fight other “neglected tropical diseases.” It has prompted WHO to launch the new Expanded Special Project for Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases. This initiative will continue the fight against river blindness while targeting several other diseases for elimination, including lymphatic filariasis (also known as elephantiasis) and debilitating helminth infections, which are transmitted through soil carried by parasitic worms. Also, these campaigns involve a significant effort to mobilize resources that empower local communities to strengthen their primary healthcare capabilities. The focus on developing integrated health programs at the local level is precisely one of the approaches that is needed as countries strive to attain universal health coverage. But fighting infectious diseases is like riding a bicycle. To move forward, you have to keep pedaling. It is extremely important that we keep pedaling against river blindness, all the more vigorously because we are entering what may be the crucial last mile that leads to eradication. By maintaining support for the battle against river blindness, we will continue to blaze a trail toward elimination for other neglected diseases to follow — to a point in the not too distant future when the club of the eradicated disease may have several new members.

On Thursday afternoon, chatter spread that the company had canceled out of Citigroup's 11th Annual Biotech Conference. Benzinga reached out to a spokesperson at Biogen, who confirmed that the company did cancel out of the conference. The spokesperson said there was a scheduling conflict, and that Biogen executives would be in an all-day meeting. The company will be attending a Morgan Stanley conference the following week. This cancellation comes on the heels of some M&A rumors at the beginning of the month. On August 2, Biogen shares were halted on volatility, as the Wall Street Journal reported the company was drawing interest from Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK) and Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN). The following day, Reuters reported Biogen had "not received any formal expressions of interest from suitors and is not soliciting offers." Rumors continued the week after on August 8, when Dealreporter suggested Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) may be showing interest in Biogen. Shares of Biogen traded recently at $314.03. Posted-In: News M&A Events Exclusives Best of Benzinga © 2016 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

Here's how the two biotechs stack up. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Aug 11, 2016 at 10:45AM Image source: Getty Images. At first glance, the choice between Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:INO) and Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) seems like a no-brainer for biotech investors. Incyte has the bigger market cap, more revenue, and that nice little thing called profits. But could the smaller up-and-coming biotech stock actually be the better buy? Let's take a look. The case for Inovio You're not going to buy Inovio's stock based on its financial results. What revenue the company makes stems largely from grants and collaborations. Inovio lost over $18.7 million in the second quarter.  The biotech's pipeline, however, should (and does) interest many investors. Inovio's lead candidate is cervical dysplasia immunotherapy VGX-3100. Phase 2 testing of VGX-3100 found that just under half of the 167 patients in the study experienced regression from high grade to low grade cervical dysplasia or no disease. Over 40% of patients experienced regression to low grade or no disease, plus human papillomavirus (HPV) clearance. These positive results seem to position Inovio well for the next stage of testing. The company has worked with the FDA and European Medicines Agency to clear the path to begin pivotal late-stage testing in the fourth quarter of this year. Assuming all goes well, VGX-3100 could reach peak annual sales of around $500 million. And if VGX-3100 proves to be successful, that should be good news for another Inovio candidate: INO-3112. Inovio is partnering with AstraZeneca's (NYSE: AZN) MedImmune division on developing the vaccine targeting cervical cancer and head and neck cancer. INO-3112 combines VGX-3100 with a DNA-based immune activator encoded for interleukin 12 (IL-12). Inovio boasts an extraordinarily deep pipeline for a biotech its size. The company has three other cancer vaccines in early-stage testing, plus nine vaccines for infectious diseases, including Ebola and hepatitis B. But the pipeline candidate attracting the most attention is Inovio's experimental Zika vaccine. The company announced in May that its Zika vaccine had produced robust immune responses in monkeys. That major step paved the way for Inovio to begin phase 1 testing in humans in July. Interim results from this study are expected later this year. The case for Incyte While Inovio's stock has soared over 30% so far this year, Incyte shares are down more than 20%. A double whammy of bad news caused the drop. First, in January Incyte discontinued a phase 2 study of Jakafi in treating colorectal cancer. Second, the company stopped another phase 3 study of the drug in treating pancreatic cancer. On a positive note, Jakafi's sales continue to soar for its already-approved hematological indications. Incyte reported that revenue for the chemotherapy increased 52% year over year in the first half of 2016. Despite the setbacks earlier this year, the company still expects Jakafi to reach peak annual sales of $1.5 billion. Incyte has two other potential blockbuster drugs waiting in the wings. Phase 3 results for rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib were great, with patients reporting better quality of life metrics compared to industry-leading Humira. Analysts think baricitinib could hit peak annual sales of $3 billion. Incyte's partner Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) stands to keep much of the revenue, but Incyte should receive royalty payments of around $1 billion if all goes well. The company expects to obtain regulatory approval for baricitinib in early 2017. Another candidate, epacadostat, could eventually become an even bigger winner for Incyte than baricitinib or Jakafi. A phase 3 study of epacadostat and Merck's Keytruda for treating advanced or metastatic melanoma is currently in progress. Four other clinical trials are also underway for epacadostat in treating various other cancers. Analysts project the drug could reach peak annual sales of over $3 billion. Better buy Both of these biotechs have a lot going for them. Which is the better buy? Inovio currently has no products on the market. The company's lead product, VGX-3100, has yet to begin late-stage testing. There's still some risk that the immunotherapy won't win regulatory approval. Other Inovio candidates, while promising, are still at best several years away from commercialization. Incyte, on the other hand, already has a big winner with Jakafi. It seems likely that baricitinib will win approval based on its phase 3 results. Although there's more risk with epacadostat since the drug is still in late-stage testing, I think the odds for approval are pretty good. Even with some uncertainties, there's no question in my mind that Incyte's pipeline has less risk overall than Inovio's does. I like Inovio, but my pick as the better buy in this case is Incyte. Better financials. Less pipeline risk. Those are two good reasons to invest in Incyte. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Bloomberg first caught wind of Doll’s re-hiring this morning, based on his recently updated LinkedIn profile revealing his new position at Apple: Director of Health Software Engineering. He starter at Apple last month, as per LinkedIn, which doesn’t expand further on his role. During his nearly-six-year tenure at the Cupertino firm as Senior iPhone Engineer from 2003 to 2009, he helped develop the original iPhone’s operating system before leaving the company to co-found Flipboard with Mike McCue. He left Flipboard in September 2015. Apple recently hired Sage Bionetworks founder and Merck & Co. veteran Stephen Friend and former Nest Labs technology chief Yoky Matsuoka, who joined the company’s growing health team. According to industry sources who recently spoke with Taiwan’s Economic Daily News, Apple is working on a “killer new health-tracking gadget” that will use 3D Touch, debut in 2017 and “set off a new whirlwind” within the technology industry.

Apple Inc. has hired Flipboard co-Founder Evan Doll to help the world's largest publicly trading technology company develop more health-related software, according to Doll's LinkedIn profile. Doll became a director of health software engineering at Apple last month, according to LinkedIn, which doesn't expand further on his role. During his previous stint at Apple, from about 2003 to 2009, the software engineer helped develop the iPhone operating system. He left to found digital news magazine app Flipboard with Mike McCue. When Apple unveiled its News service in June 2015, it was compared to Flipboard's offering and the startup took it as a competitive move. Doll left Flipboard in September, part of an exodus of executives and other talent from the struggling company. Apple has been beefing up its engineering team for health-care applications, hiring Sage Bionetworks founder and Merck & Co. veteran Stephen Friend and former Nest Labs technology chief Yoky Matsuoka earlier this year. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is increasingly positioning the Apple Watch as a wellness accessory as he tries to win a slice of the $4.6 trillion U.S. health and fitness industry. An Apple spokeswoman and Doll didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment Wednesday. The new operating system for the Watch, which will be rolled out to consumers later this year, includes more prominent placement for fitness tracking measures and an app which guides users through breathing exercises to foster relaxation. After leaving Flipboard, Doll spent several months as an entrepreneur-in-residence at Menlo Park, California-based Redpoint Ventures.
