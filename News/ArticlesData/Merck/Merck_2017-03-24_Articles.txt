PFE and German partner Merck KGaA's investigational cancer treatment, avelumab, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare and aggressive form of skin cancer. Pfizer's shares are up 5.5% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry's return of 6.6%. Avelumab, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody, will be marketed by the trade name of Bavencio for intravenous use for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic MCC. However, Bavencio received accelerated approval. Continued approval in this indication will depend upon the verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies. With the FDA approval, avelumab becomes the first immunotherapy option for the treatment of metastatic MCC, a rare form of skin cancer, which until now was being treated only with chemotherapy. Only less than 50% of the metastatic MCC patients survive more than one year and fewer than 20% survive beyond five years, thereby creating a vital need for treatment options. Avelumab is under review in EU for the indication. The U.S. filing was based on positive data from the phase II study, JAVELIN Merkel 200. Avelumab was granted priority review for the treatment of metastatic MCC. Pfizer collaborated with Merck KGaA in Nov 2014 to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. Currently, avelumab is being developed for many types of tumors including gastric/gastroesophageal junction, head and neck, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung, ovarian, renal cell carcinoma and urothelial (primarily bladder). Avelumab has also gained priority review in the U.S. for a second indication - for the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma. A response from the FDA for the regulatory application should be out by Aug 27, 2017. Interest in immunotherapy is building up fast. The basic concept of cancer immunotherapy or immuno-oncology is to utilize certain parts of the immune system to fight the disease. This can be done by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells or by introducing immune system components into the body. Merck & Co., Inc.'s MRK anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, is being studied for more than 30 types of cancers. Amgen, Inc.'s AMGN Blincyto, a BiTE antibody, gained earlier-than-expected FDA approval in Dec 2014. Blincyto has the potential to be developed for other hematologic malignancies as well. Smaller biotechs like Juno Therapeutics and Kite Pharma, Inc. KITE are also developing immuno-oncology treatments. Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 March 2017 by Military News European Medicines Agency’s CHMP Recommends Approval of Merck’s KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for the Treatment of Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), the company’s anti-PD-1 therapy, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who have failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and brentuximab vedotin (BV), or who are transplant-ineligible and have failed BV. The recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission for marketing authorization in the European Union. A decision on approval is expected in the second quarter of 2017. “This CHMP positive recommendation brings us one step closer to offering appropriate patients in the European Union with classical Hodgkin lymphoma a new treatment option to help fight this hematologic cancer,” said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. “Today’s news reflects Merck’s ongoing commitment to bring forward new options for patients with a wide range of cancers.” The positive opinion was based on data from the KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-013 trials. These multicenter, open label trials evaluated patients with cHL who failed ASCT and BV, who were ineligible for ASCT because they were unable to achieve a complete or partial remission after salvage chemotherapy and failed BV, or who failed ASCT and did not receive BV. Both studies included patients regardless of PD-L1 expression. The major efficacy outcome measures, overall response rate and complete remission rate, were assessed by blinded independent central review according to the 2007 revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival. About Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that develops in the white blood cells, called lymphocytes, which are part of the immune system. Hodgkin lymphoma can start almost anywhere – most often in lymph nodes in the upper part of the body, with the most common sites being in the chest, neck or under the arms. Worldwide, there were approximately 66,000 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma and 25,500 people died from the disease in 2012. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for about 95 percent of all cases of Hodgkin lymphoma in developed countries. About KEYTRUDA ®(pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single-dose vial. KEYTRUDA Indications and Dosing in the U.S. Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA ®  (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 28 (15%) of 192 patients with HNSCC, including Grade 3 (0.5%) hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in post-marketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA versus the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed GVHD, one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor-blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (≥1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs ipilimumab were fatigue (28% vs 28%), diarrhea (26% with KEYTRUDA), rash (24% vs 23%), and nausea (21% with KEYTRUDA). Corresponding incidence rates are listed for ipilimumab only for those adverse reactions that occurred at the same or lower rate than with KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-002, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 12% of 357 patients with advanced melanoma; the most common (≥1%) were general physical health deterioration (1%), asthenia (1%), dyspnea (1%), pneumonitis (1%), and generalized edema (1%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 14% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were dyspnea (1%), diarrhea (1%), and maculopapular rash (1%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs chemotherapy were fatigue (43% with KEYTRUDA [pembrolizumab]), pruritus (28% vs 8%), rash (24% vs 8%), constipation (22% vs 20%), nausea (22% with KEYTRUDA), diarrhea (20% vs 20%), and decreased appetite (20% with KEYTRUDA). Corresponding incidence rates are listed for chemotherapy only for those adverse reactions that occurred at the same or lower rate than with KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of 682 patients with metastatic NSCLC. The most common adverse event resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 20% of patients and at a higher incidence than with docetaxel) were decreased appetite (25% vs 23%), dyspnea (23% vs 20%), and nausea (20% vs 18%). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of 192 patients with HNSCC. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC, with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3 or 4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of 210 patients with cHL and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 26% of patients. Fifteen percent (15%) of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥1%) included pneumonia, pneumonitis, pyrexia, dyspnea, GVHD, and herpes zoster. Two patients died from causes other than disease progression; one from GVHD after subsequent allogeneic HSCT and one from septic shock. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue (26%), pyrexia (24%), cough (24%), musculoskeletal pain (21%), diarrhea (20%), and rash (20%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a study of 40 pediatric patients with advanced melanoma, PD-L1–positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma, patients were treated with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for a median of 43 days (range 1-414 days), with 24 patients (60%) receiving treatment for 42 days or more. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA. Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).

Join Today Already a member? Login Search Pharma Stock Roundup: Is Sanofi Buying Flexion? Pfizer, Merck KGaA Drug Approved March 24, 2017, 07:47:00 AM EDT By Arpita Dutt, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo Shortly after the release of the Budget Blueprint for 2018, which could require companies to shell out higher fees for regulatory reviews as well as a reduction of $5.8 billion in the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) spending, the President continued to focus on drug prices at a meeting with members of the Congressional Black Caucus. The President spoke about instituting a strong bidding process to bring down drug prices and make them the lowest anywhere in the world.   Meanwhile, French pharma giant Sanofi SNY is rumored to be close to buying Flexion. Recap of the Week's Most Important Stories Sanofi Close to Buying Flexion: According to a FiercePharma article, Sanofi is close to buying specialty pharma company, Flexion FLXN for an offer price in the mid-$30s which would make the deal worth more than $1 billion. Flexion's shares jumped 33.4% on the acquisition rumors. Flexion is known for its focus on musculoskeletal conditions -- its lead pipeline candidate, Zilretta is currently under FDA review for osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, with a response from the agency expected by Oct 6, 2017. Sanofi already has a presence and expertise in this market with Synvisc. Sanofi has been on the lookout for an acquisition deal for quite a while now having failed in its efforts to acquire Medivation and Actelion earlier (Read more: Flexion Stock Soars 35% on $1 Billion Sanofi Buyout ). Meanwhile, Sanofi and partner Regeneron have filed a lawsuit against Amgen related to their eczema drug Dupixent, which could gain FDA approval later this month. The companies have filed a lawsuit seeking a court order that their drug does not infringe a patent held by Amgen. This is a proactive move by Sanofi and Regeneron to prevent Amgen from initiating a patent infringement lawsuit like it had related to Sanofi and Regeneron's PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent.   Accelerated Approval for Pfizer/Merck KGaA Drug: The FDA granted accelerated approval to Pfizer PFE and partner Merck KGaA's immunotherapy drug, Bavencio. The drug has been approved for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC), a rare and aggressive skin cancer. Bavencio is being studied for several other types of cancer and is currently under priority review in the U.S. for the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma. A response from the FDA for this indication is expected on Aug 27, 2017. Bristol-Myers Expands CytomX Deal: Bristol-Myers BMY has expanded its 2014 agreement with CytomX related to the use of the latter's proprietary Probody platform. While under the initial agreement, Bristol-Myers had selected four oncology targets, the company now gets exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize Probody therapeutics for up to six additional oncology targets and two non-oncology targets. CytomX will get an upfront payment of $200 million as well as research funding over the course of the research term. Moreover, CytomX could receive up to $448 million on the achievement of development, regulatory and sales milestones and tiered royalties on commercialized products (Read more: Bristol-Myers Squibb and CytomX Therapeutics Extend Deal ). Lilly Breast Cancer Drug Scores in Late-Stage Study: Lilly's LLY experimental treatment, abemaciclib, was found to be superior when used in combination with Faslodex (fulvestrant) compared to Faslodex plus placebo alone in advanced breast cancer patients.   Lilly intends to seek FDA approval for the CDK 4/6 inhibitor in the second quarter of 2017. Abemaciclib is currently in several other studies as well and the company intends to submit another regulatory application in the third quarter based on results from a second study (Read more: Lilly's Breast Cancer Combo Drug Phase III Results Positive ). Meanwhile, Lilly and its partner Boehringer Ingelheim said that they have initiated an outcomes program on diabetes drug, Jardiance. The program consists of two phase III studies that will evaluate the drug in adults with chronic heart failure including patients who may or may not be diabetic. The studies are expected to complete in 2020. Lilly is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Novartis Heart Drug Fails in Study: Novartis' NVS experimental acute heart failure treatment, RLX030 (serelaxin), failed in a late-stage study. The drug missed the primary endpoints of reduced cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure in patients with acute heart failure. The company is analyzing the data further and will evaluate the next steps for the program. We note that RLX030 had received a complete response letter from the FDA in 2014 with the agency asking for further evidence on the drug's efficacy (Read more: Novartis' Acute Heart Failure Drug Fails in Late-Stage Study ).

Global Thyroid Gland Disorder Treatment Market to Witness Growth, Owing to Increase in Awareness Programs: Technavio Technavio has published a new report on the global thyroid gland disorder treatment market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Technavio has published a new report on the global thyroid gland disorder treatment market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail March 24, 2017 12:03 PM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The global thyroid gland disorder treatment market is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 3% during the forecast period, according to Technavio’s latest market research. In this market research report, Technavio covers the market outlook and growth prospects of the global thyroid gland disorder treatment market for 2017-2021. The market is further categorized into two segments based on the type of disorder, which are hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. “Globally, 750 million people suffer from thyroid disorders, among which more than half are undiagnosed. The major players in the market are introducing innovative and improved formulations and drugs using new drug-delivery technologies. The quick and easy delivery routes used by new formulations along with increased awareness are expected to increase patient compliance, thereby, fostering the market growth during the forecast period,” says Sapna Jha, a lead cardiovascular and metabolic disorders research expert from Technavio. Technavio’s healthcare and life sciences research analysts segment the global thyroid gland disorder treatment market into the following regions: Americas EMEA APAC Thyroid gland disorder treatment in the Americas The thyroid gland disorders treatment market in the Americas is growing at a moderate pace as compared to the global market, owing to the introduction of natural extracts drugs. Associations such as American Thyroid Association (ATA) and Human Growth Foundation are involved in spreading awareness about the disorder and the available treatment options. For instance, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) has initiated a campaign to increase public awareness about the thyroid disorder and educate the Americans about the treatment. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=57206 Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Thyroid gland disorder treatment market in EMEA EMEA is emerging and facing challenges regarding regulatory guidelines such as rigorous analytical data to compare similarity with the approved products. However, the thyroid gland disorder treatment market in EMEA is expected to benefit from the growing incidence of hypothyroidism in key regions such as Europe. “The rising number of individuals with hypothyroid, and increasing thyroid awareness programs contribute to this growth,” says Sapna. For instance, in 2016, Merck Sharp & Dohme collaborated with Thyroid Federation International (TFI) for a campaign called Catching the butterflies, which detects the symptoms of thyroid disorders in children. Thyroid gland disorder treatment market in APAC APAC is expected to grow at a higher rate compared to EMEA and the Americas, due to the growing awareness programs through various companies. For instance, in 2015, Abbott collaborated with Indian Thyroid Society (ITS) to spread thyroid awareness in coastal Andhra Pradesh in India. The data estimated from these awareness programs suggests that one in 10 adults in India suffer from hypothyroidism, and the disease ranked ninth among other common ailments such as depression, asthma, cholesterol problem, diabetes, insomnia, and heart problems. The top vendors in the global thyroid gland disorder treatment market as highlighted in this market research analysis are: Abbott AbbVie Allergan Merck Sharp& Dohme Pfizer RLC LABS Browse Related Reports: Global Endocrinology Drugs Market 2016-2020 Global Pharmerging Markets 2017-2021 Global Central Nervous System Disorders Therapeutics Market 2016-2020 Become a Technavio Insights member and access all three of these reports for a fraction of their original cost.

Tullow native Yvonne Jones (née O’Toole) was appointed as president of the organisation at its AGM last Tuesday night. The annual meeting was hosted at MSD, Carlow and was also the launch of some of the main events to mark the 70th anniversary of the County Carlow Chamber. “It is a privilege for me to be taking over the role of president of County Carlow Chamber in a key milestone year in this history of this organisation,” said Yvonne. “Over the last 70 years, the chamber has worked to identify and tackle the issues of concern to the business community and it remains our responsibility to keep abreast of issues that affect the business community and respond to them appropriately, whether it be lobbying local or national government, local elected representatives or any other body.” The new president of Carlow chamber Yvonne OToole receives the chain of office from outgoing president Derek Shannon Photo: Karl McDonough Over the last 11 years, Yvonne has been involved in the chamber and more recently has become well known as the chairperson of Love Carlow, an initiative started by the chamber in 2016 in response to the decline of Carlow town centre. Love Carlow has achieved a lot over a short time, including securing a €150,000 economic development fund for Carlow following meetings with minister Simon Coveney in 2016. Yvonne takes over as president from Derek Shannon, manager of Bank of Ireland in Carlow, who held the office for the last two years. Derek led the chamber through many successes during his tenure and was instrumental in the chamber’s work to secure a half-hour’s free parking in Carlow town. At the AGM, Derek’s dedication and commitment to business in Carlow was commended, with members agreeing that his direction through his presidency had further strengthened the chamber in many ways. In her address, Yvonne highlighted some of the events planned to mark the chamber’s 70th anniversary. These include a past presidents’ think tank in April, a mid-summer 70th anniversary ball on Saturday 17 June, an ideas marathon in July and a special 70th anniversary Chamber Business Awards ceremony in September. “Yvonne is someone who has continuously demonstrated her dedication to and passion for Carlow and the chamber in many ways, especially in her work with Love Carlow,” said Brian O’Farrell, CEO of County Carlow Chamber. “I am looking forward to working with her in her new role as president.” Follow @cwnationalist Comments are closed.

It had already reclaimed its superpower lead before Donald Trump swept into office vowing to make America great again. With hindsight we can see ever more clearly that the Lehman crisis was a false alarm. Loss of dominance has long been a staple of US discourse. John Kennedy decried the ballistic "missile gap" with the Soviet Union before the 1960 election, when Russia had just four missiles and the US had thousands with explosive power equal to 1.3 million Hiroshima-sized bombs. Ever since I began covering the US as a journalist in the early Reagan years, there have been bouts of soul-searching.  Paul Kennedy's theory of imperial over-stretch in Rise and Fall of the Great Powers was all the rage in the late 1980s, when the Washington clerisy thought Japan destined for economic leadership. Edward Luttwack upped the ante in 1994 with Endangered American Dream, warning that the US was turning into a third world nation. This was just as the US was about establish its undisputed hegemony over the digital age. US decline was a myth then, and remains a myth today. Putative rivals have all run into trouble or face structural limits that will be obvious within a decade. India's time has not yet come. And: A decade ago the US was preparing to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) on a large scale. The terminals have since switched into export hUBS. American shale gas is being shipped to Europe. The effect is to force down the market price of gas in EU, depriving Russia's Gazprom of its lockhold on prices. Lithuania's "Independence" terminal can now import LNG, eliminating dependence on the Kremlin. Poland is following suit. That strategic implications are profound. As Goldman Sachs said this week, US shale oil can go from zero to peak output within six to nine months. It can do so on a big enough scale to hold down global crude prices, and for long enough to bleed OPEC and the Kremlin almost white. The Permian Basin in West Texas alone could match Saudi Arabia's Ghawar field within five years, topping 5m barrels a day. Fracking technology has cut break-even costs so fast that old "super-basins" are poised for stunning revivals. It is no longer a question of whether the US will become a net oil exporter, but how soon. While the US "manufacturing renaissance" has been patchy, cheap gas has restored the fortunes of the plastics, chemical, and glass industries. The American Chemistry Council is tracking $130bn of new investment along the Gulf Coast, expected to create 460,000 jobs by 2022. The US unemployment rate is 4.7pc, near a  half-century low This is the recovery that Donald Trump managed to turn into a landscape of “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones” in his dystopian inaugural address. It is of course standard fare for opposition candidates to decry the decline of America during campaigns. What is different about President Trump is that he continues to push this line after taking office, presumably because he believes his own wild claims. We all have to reach our own conclusions about Donald Trump. My view is that he matters less than we now think. His presidency may prove no more than a four-year embarrassment, leaving few traces. His plans to slash science and technology funding by 20pc would indeed risk the sort of decline he rails against. But his budget is dead on arrival in Congress. His contempt for allies and the multilateral bodies that vastly lever America's strategic power is folly but the US Senate is likely to take charge and run foreign policy on traditional lines. Grown-ups at the helm of the State, Defence, and Treasury departments will navigate the reefs. America's institutions and courts will contain Mr Trump.     David Fuller's view Donald Trump won the US Presidential election for two very different reasons. 1) He recognised that vast stretches of America between the East and West Coasts contained plenty of angry voters, who Hillary Clinton once described unwisely as “the deplorables”. Job losses due to accelerating technological innovation were a big problem, especially for less skilled workers.  For instance, people were working at Walmart for $9 an hour, while a little over a generation earlier their ancestors earned $30 an hour in steel mills.  That was before globalisation and competition from developing Asian economies led to many of the US’s rust belts.   2) Most of the financial community and a considerable number of Republican business people were fed up with onerous financial regulations, high taxation and limited economic growth. The Lehman crisis was no “false alarm”, as stated above, because it could have triggered a depression without a massive monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve and also central banks in other countries.  Unfortunately, Barack Obama was far more interested in regulation than economic stimulus.     Europe Has Forgotten What It Means for a Nation to Govern Itself. Article 50 Will Remind Them Here is this short comment by Janet Daley for The Telegraph: So it begins. This is either going to be the most tedious two years of argy-bargy, mind-numbing detail, procrastination, futile grandstanding, and empty threats ending with something that looks remarkably like the present arrangements... or it isn’t. What could and should happen is that the UK creates not just a stunning precedent in the modern European era of a country leaving what was supposed to be an everlasting relationship, but an entirely new model of the nation state fit for the 21st century. Europe has almost forgotten – sometimes with good historical reasons – what pride in nationality might mean, and how democratically responsive governments in touch with their populations might have something valuable to offer the world. Ironically, the idea of the self-governing state directly answerable to its own people was lost in the terrible shame of the twentieth century’s nationalist crimes. But the EU now finds itself harbouring a return to just the kind of populist nativism which it was designed to prevent. Will this generation of British politicians have the vision and the strength of character to re-invent nationhood? Who knows? Until this moment, I suspect that at least some of the EU establishment doubted that Theresa May would go through with it. Presumably this is why Donald Tusk has to be given forty-eight hours to make a formal response to the announcement of the actual date: he and his colleagues must be allowed to come to terms with the reality that some political leaders mean what they say. Yes, this is really happening. March 29th will be the first day of the rest of our lives.   David Fuller's view I’ve said it many times – don’t play the expensive and frustrating EU delaying game.  Leave the EU politely but quickly and without an agreement, if necessary, which can come later. The alternative, described by Janet Daley in her opening sentences above, would be like spending two years on a tiny desert island with Jean-Claude Junker.     Energy Stat: Are Electric and Autonomous Vehicles Heading Down the Road to Peak Oil Demand? Thanks to a subscriber for this fascinating report by Pavel Mulchanov for Raymond James which may be of interest. Here is a section: There is no law of nature that dictates that global oil demand must eventually reach a peak and then begin an irreversible decline. The well-known “law” of Hubbert’s Peak applies to supply, not demand, and the advent of modern technology (fracking, horizontal drilling, enhanced recovery, etc.) has led to a fundamental rethink of whether oil supply will peak after all. In this context, we see comments such as the one from Shell, suggesting that peak demand will come first, rendering peak supply a moot point. There is no direct historical precedent for worldwide demand for a major energy commodity to peak on a sustained basis. (Sorry, whale oil doesn’t count.) Despite all of the regulatory and other headwinds, for example, global consumption of coal is still growing. But it is true that there is precedent for national and even regional demand to peak. Coal demand in Europe peaked in the 1960s, and has since fallen to substantially lower levels. Oil demand in Japan peaked in the 1990s. Oil demand in Europe peaked more recently, in 2006, one year after the U.S. By definition, a peak is something that can only be known in retrospect, but with a decade having passed, it seems abundantly clear that European oil demand will never get back to its pre-2006 levels. With regard to the U.S., the situation is less clear-cut because of the demand recovery in recent years, but 2005 may well be the all-time peak. The theory of peak global oil demand holds that when enough parts of the world reach a peak, a global peak will result, because the few places still growing will not be enough to offset the decliners. In this sense, the theory is conceptually valid. Thus, we would not argue with the notion that peak oil demand is a matter of time. The real question is: how much time?   Eoin Treacy's view A link to the full report is posted in the Subscriber's Area. I had not previously seen the statistics about peak demand for Europe and Japan so I found this report enlightening and commend it to subscribers. Peak demand is an important theme and explains why Saudi Arabia guards its Asian markets so jealously; offering discounts again as recently as two weeks ago. Asia and Africa represent the two big growth markets for international oil products just as they represent the major growth areas for coal consumption.   Dow's Merck Swipes Immuno-Oncology Share From Heavyweight Rivals This article from investors.com may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: Four immuno-oncology drugs from Merck, Bristol-Myers and Roche brought in $464 million in February, declining 4% from $483 million in January, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said, citing data from tracker Symphony Health. But February was a shorter month, which could be partly responsible for the decrease, Fernandez said in a research report. Despite the slowdown, Merck's Keytruda sales grew 2% in February vs. the prior month. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers' drugs Opdivo and Yervoy held on to a collective 69% market share, falling 1% vs. January. Merck's Keytruda now has 24% of the market, up from 23% the prior month. Roche's Tecentriq was flat at 7% share. Immuno-oncology drugs fight cancer by teaching the body's immune system to identify cancer cells hiding behind specific proteins. Those proteins are called checkpoints.   Eoin Treacy's view CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is quickly revolutionising the genetics sector by reducing the cost and increasing the speed of innovation. That is particularly good news for cancer treatments because there are so many different mutations and each needs a tailored approach. In fact the end point of research and another area receiving a great deal of interest is the synthetic biology sector where custom viruses can be written to attack a patient’s personal cancer.   Not So Fast on India Stock Rally as UBS Sees Profit Bar Too High This article by Nupur Acharya and Ameya Karve for Bloomberg reiterates an argument more than a few institutional investors have made about India. Here is a section: “The markets are trading at all-time-high multiples and are pricing in a lot, or expecting reforms to continue and growth to come back fairly quickly,”  Chhaochharia said. “The risk-reward is definitely not attractive.” Skeptics like Chhaochharia are becoming harder to find as foreign and local investors pile into equities and analysts predict further gains. The S&P BSE Sensex will climb to 32,000 by year-end, up 10 percent from current levels, according to a survey of traders and investors by Bloomberg News on March 14, three days after Modi won the state polls. Citibank, which previously forecast the Sensex to reach 30,000 by September, now sees the gauge at 31,500 in December. Overseas investors have plowed a net $3 billion into Indian equities in March, the biggest monthly inflow in a year, while mutual funds have been buyers for seven months through February. The liquidity-aided euphoria saw a department store chain double in its trading debut on Tuesday, and an exchange-traded fund of state companies on Friday got bids for about four times the target.     Eoin Treacy's view 10-year local currency Indian government bonds yield 6.82%. That’s well below the 9% which was on offer in 2014 but the question of the currency is much less pressing today than it was then. More than any other factors, the combined trends of the currency and the bond market offer a window into how large foreign investors view the prospects for India.     Fuller Treacy Money Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version The information provided on this website (www.FTMoney.com) is for the purposes of information only.  This website and its content is not and should not be considered or deemed to be an offer of or invitation to engage in any investment activity.  Nothing FT Money does and nothing on this website is intended to operate or be construed as the giving of advice or the making of a recommendation by FT Money to any investor or prospective investor.

Later this year we anticipate the first clinical evaluations of this breakthrough new technology along with the release of RUO test kits,” said Evan Jones, Chairman & CEO of OpGen. “We also achieved key milestones including a strategic research collaboration with Merck and compelling data on health outcomes from our partnerships with distinguished U.S. health systems and collaborators.” 2016 Year End and Fourth Quarter Financial Results Revenue: Total revenue for the full year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.0 million, a 27% increase from the $3.2 million in 2015.

In this market research report, Technavio covers the market outlook and growth prospects of the global thyroid gland disorder treatment market for 2017-2021. The market is further categorized into two segments based on the type of disorder, which are hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. “Globally, 750 million people suffer from thyroid disorders, among which more than half are undiagnosed. The major players in the market are introducing innovative and improved formulations and drugs using new drug-delivery technologies. The quick and easy delivery routes used by new formulations along with increased awareness are expected to increase patient compliance, thereby, fostering the market growth during the forecast period,” says Sapna Jha, a lead cardiovascular and metabolic disorders research expert from Technavio. Technavio’s healthcare and life sciences research analysts segment the global thyroid gland disorder treatment market into the following regions: Americas EMEA APAC Thyroid gland disorder treatment in the Americas The thyroid gland disorders treatment market in the Americas is growing at a moderate pace as compared to the global market, owing to the introduction of natural extracts drugs. Associations such as American Thyroid Association (ATA) and Human Growth Foundation are involved in spreading awareness about the disorder and the available treatment options. For instance, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) has initiated a campaign to increase public awareness about the thyroid disorder and educate the Americans about the treatment.

Thyroid gland disorder treatment market in EMEA EMEA is emerging and facing challenges regarding regulatory guidelines such as rigorous analytical data to compare similarity with the approved products. However, the thyroid gland disorder treatment market in EMEA is expected to benefit from the growing incidence of hypothyroidism in key regions such as Europe. “The rising number of individuals with hypothyroid, and increasing thyroid awareness programs contribute to this growth,” says Sapna. For instance, in 2016, Merck Sharp & Dohme collaborated with Thyroid Federation International (TFI) for a campaign called Catching the butterflies, which detects the symptoms of thyroid disorders in children. Thyroid gland disorder treatment market in APAC APAC is expected to grow at a higher rate compared to EMEA and the Americas, due to the growing awareness programs through various companies. For instance, in 2015, Abbott collaborated with Indian Thyroid Society (ITS) to spread thyroid awareness in coastal Andhra Pradesh in India. The data estimated from these awareness programs suggests that one in 10 adults in India suffer from hypothyroidism, and the disease ranked ninth among other common ailments such as depression, asthma, cholesterol problem, diabetes, insomnia, and heart problems.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors are emerging as potential application in diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of cancer. It is also considered as a treatment option for hematological malignancies and plays important role in epigenetic or non-epigenetic regulation. The histone deacetylase inhibitors accumulates acetylated nuclear histone in tumors and normal tissues. Thus, the inhabitation results in acetylation transcription factors such as GATA-1, p53 and estrogen receptor-alpha. These enzymes are found in fungi, bacteria, animals and plants. There are around 18 human histone deacetylase known, which are classified into four classes based on their structures. Class I HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8. Class II includes HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9. Class III includes HDAC6 and HDAC10, whereas Class IV includes HDAC11. The demand for histone deacetylase inhibitors is rapidly increasing owing to growing need for innovative therapies for cancer treatment. Histone deacetylase inhibitors plays vital role in regulation of gene expression via the effects on the chromatin structure. Over the past few years, numerous histone deacetylase inhibitors molecules have undergone clinical trials for different types of cancer. These inhibitors are categorized based on their chemical structure. Among these categories hydroxamic acid-based compounds are the most widely explored class of histone deacetylase inhibitor. Histone deacetylase inhibitors market has been segmented on the basis of class, application, end user and geography. Based on application, the market is categorized into oncology, neurology, and other disease.

This article is part of a series called 'The basics of patent law', covering: Types of intellectual property protection for inventions and granting procedure; Initiating proceedings; Infringement and related actions; Validity challenges, revocation actions and other procedures to remove the effect of an IP right; Trial, appeal and settlement; Remedies and costs; Assignment and licensing and the Unified Patent Court and Unitary Patent system. The articles underpin Gowling WLG's contribution to Chambers' Global Practice Guide on Patent Litigation 2017, for which Gordon Harris and Ailsa Carter wrote the UK chapter. Choice of court Substantive legislative intellectual property law applies throughout the UK. The Patents Act 1977 governs UK patents and, post-grant, UK designations of European patents. Disputes arising under the Patents Act (for example, regarding infringement or validity) may be brought before the (relevant) court or, in some contexts, before the Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks (the "Comptroller"). The jurisdiction of the Comptroller to hear disputes regarding infringement and/or validity of a patent will be discussed in our articles coming soon titled Infringement and related actions and Validity challenges, revocation actions and other procedures to remove the effect of an IP right. The Patents Rules 2007 govern the procedure for hearing of such disputes. The UK consists of three distinct jurisdictions, each with its own legal system, courts and procedures: England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Allocation of jurisdiction between the courts of the three jurisdictions is governed by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982. In Scotland, the appropriate court for claims under the Patents Act is the Court of Session; in Northern Ireland it is the High Court in Northern Ireland. (PA s.130) In practice, the overwhelming majority of intellectual property litigation in the UK takes place in the courts of England and Wales, and it is this jurisdiction which is focussed upon in this chapter. In England and Wales, the appropriate court for claims under the Patents Act is the High Court (PA s.130, Senior Courts Act 1981 s.62). Any claim under the Patents Act (for example, for infringement or revocation of a patent) must be started in the Patents Court or the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court (IPEC). Both courts are within the Chancery Division of the High Court of England and Wales. The IPEC is the appropriate forum for less complex and smaller value claims (up to an approximate value of �1 million - which may, for example, be the 'value' of an injunction). Recoverable monetary relief is capped at �500,000 per case and recoverable costs are capped at �50,000 for the liability stage. The Patents Court is the appropriate forum for more complex and valuable claims. In the Patents Court there is no cap on recoverable monetary relief or costs. Claims for breach of confidence in respect of technical subject matter should be brought in the High Court's Chancery Division (within which the Patents Court sits), or the IPEC. Rules governing court litigation in England and Wales The conduct of civil litigation in England and Wales is governed by the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR). The over-riding objective of the rules is to enable the court to deal with cases justly and at proportionate cost. A court action is initiated by completing and filing with the court, with the appropriate fee, a completed claim form. The claim form must include details of the claimant(s) and defendant(s), brief details of the claim (i.e. the relief sought) and must indicate the value of the claim and the appropriate court fee. 'Particulars' of the claim, which set out in a brief and succinct way the alleged legal basis for the claimant's claim and the facts relied upon to substantiate liability, must be provided in the claim form, or shortly following, in accordance with the requirements as to content and the deadlines laid down in the CPR. When the filing of the claim form with the court is complete, the court issues a sealed copy (or copies) to the claimant. The court action is "commenced" when the issued claim form is served, in accordance with the CPR, on the defendant(s). Usually, service is carried out by the claimant's representatives or appointed service agent, and the time when the lawsuit is commenced is therefore largely within the control of the claimant. (In some instances, the permission of the court is required for service of the claim form to be effective, for example, and depending on the country, in respect of defendants located outside the UK). This basic initiating procedure is applicable for both claims of infringement and claims challenging the validity of a patent. The defendant may make its own request for relief by making a counterclaim. For example, a defendant alleged to infringe a patent may both deny infringement and challenge the validity of the patent in the same proceedings. Where parties initiate separate but related proceedings, they are commonly consolidated by the court and considered as a single action (see, for example, British Gas v VanClere [2015] EWHC 2087 (IPEC)). English procedural law recognises the underlying public interest that there should be finality in litigation, in the interests of the parties and the public as a whole. Where an issue could and should have been raised in earlier proceedings, a later action in respect of that issue may be considered an abuse of process (Johnson v Gore Wood [2000] UKHL 65; Dexter v Vlieland-Boddy [2003] EWCA Civ 14). If a party to litigation is aware of a claim related to proceedings on foot which it might wish to bring in the future, it should raise the matter with the court to ensure the proper use of court time and the efficient and economical conduct of litigation (Aldi v WSP [2007] EWCA Civ 1260). The mechanisms for seeking provisional relief are, except in extremely urgent cases, usually interim procedures, initiated by one party to an existing case making an application to the court for the relevant relief. For example, in the usual course, an application for an interim injunction is filed with the court and served on the respondent after the claim form is served, although it is possible for the claimant to file the application for interim relief with the claim form, to receive issued copies of both at the same time and to serve both upon the defendant together. Since the claim form is a brief, relatively formulaic document, and service can usually be completed by the claimant, it is only in unusually urgent cases that the court will consider requests for provisional relief before the claim has been commenced. For discussion of the procedural rules governing the conduct of litigation after the initial stages and the structure of the trial, please see our article on Trial, appeal and settlement which will be coming soon. Pre-action requirements Pursuant to the CPR Pre-Action Protocol, generally, before commencing proceedings, the court will expect the parties to have exchanged sufficient information to understand each other's position, make decisions about how to proceed, try to settle the issues without proceedings, consider a form of alternative dispute resolution to assist with settlement, support the efficient management of those proceedings and reduce the costs of resolving the dispute. However, the Chancery Division will not expect these requirements to be complied with where, inter alia, telling the other party would defeat the purpose of the application or the urgency of the application is such that it is not practical to comply (Chancery Guide). In the context of any pre-action communication (whether litigation is contemplated or not), parties should also be aware of the provisions of the Patents Act, s.70, according to which a claim for unjustified threats of proceedings may arise. Proprietors, licensees and entities connected with them in any way should ensure that communications are considered and phrased accordingly. Interim injunctions Provisional injunctive relief may, in the usual course, be sought by way of application made in respect of an existing claim for infringement. An interim hearing is set for the hearing of the application in accordance with the principles established in the jurisprudence (American Cyanamid v Ethicon [1975] AC 396 and subsequent case law). In accordance with the CJEU's rulings on the interpretation of EU Directive 2004/48 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights (the IP Enforcement Directive), the proportionality of the relief sought is a relevant factor. The court first considers whether there is a serious question to be tried in that a viable cause of action exists. This is a threshold requirement and usually the likelihood of success at trial is not considered. Provided that the applicant succeeds in establishing a serious issue to be tried, the court will consider the adequacy of damages in place of interim injunctive relief. If damages would adequately compensate the applicant, then interim injunctive relief will not be awarded. The adequacy of damages from the respondent's perspective is considered also i.e. whether damages pursuant to a cross-undertaking given by the applicant would be adequate compensation in the event that an interim injunction was granted but the respondent ultimately succeeded in defending the underlying claim. If the court considers that damages would not amount to adequate compensation for either party, it will then consider where the balance of justice lies in deciding whether to grant interim injunctive relief. Essentially the issue is whether protecting the applicant's interests by granting an interim injunction without a full consideration of the underlying claim is the better course despite the prejudice that would be caused to the respondent. The assessment is conducted on the basis of the facts and evidence before the court. Factors such as the dynamics of the market for the products or services in dispute, the financial position of the parties, the conduct of the parties and the overriding public interest can be relevant. The regulatory environment and market dynamics in the pharmaceutical field have led to interim injunctive relief being awarded more than in respect of other sectors. However, for inventions residing in a second or subsequent therapeutic use, concerns not to hinder the market for non-patented indications can tip the balance against awarding injunctive relief (Warner-Lambert v Actavis [2015] EWCA Civ 556). Where the court considers the balance of convenience to favour the grant of interim injunctive relief, its award will be conditional upon the applicant giving a cross-undertaking in damages. In the event the injuncted party later seeks recovery pursuant to a cross-undertaking, the award can be expected to be fair but liberal (AstraZeneca v Krka [2015] EWCA Civ 484). A party or potential party to litigation can reduce the prospects of interim injunctive relief being awarded against it by acting in accordance with the spirit of the substantive law and the procedural code. Where such a party is aware of the potential for a claim of patent infringement, it can take steps to 'clear the way' with respect to that patent, by initiating correspondence, providing transparency and/or undertakings with respect to its intended actions and, potentially, starting a claim for a declaration of non-infringement and/or for revocation of the patent. The court expects litigants to disputes to behave responsibly, so as to enable disputes to be resolved in an orderly manner. See, for example, Warner-Lambert v Teva [2011] EWHC 1691 (Pat), Merck Sharp Dohme v Teva [2013] EWHC 1958 (Pat), Warner-Lambert v Sandoz [2015] EWHC 2919 (Pat), [2015] EWHC 2924 (Pat), [2015] EWHC 3153 (Pat). Where an application for interim injunctive relief is made, the court may, rather than considering the application, order a fast procedural timetable for the hearing of the underlying claim. For example, in Napp v Dr Reddy's [2016] EWHC 1517 (Pat); [2016] EWCA Civ 1053, the underlying claim was heard and determined in a full first instance judgment less than four and a half months after the litigation was commenced, with the appeal decision returned within six months of the claim commencing. Mechanisms for obtaining evidence and information In appropriate circumstances, the court will award any of the following measures: Disclosure. This is commonly available in the usual course of litigation but may or may not be awarded in any particular case, depending upon the relevant circumstances. Where disclosure is awarded, it is usual, in respect of validity, to be limited to a window of two years either side the earliest claimed priority date; and in respect of infringement it may usually be given in the form of a product or process description. 'Anton Piller' order. This is a search and seizure order pursuant to which the successful applicant's representatives may enter and search the premises of the respondent and seize documents or articles considered to be material. To be awarded, there must be a grave danger that vital evidence will otherwise be destroyed, disposed of or otherwise put beyond use. 'Norwich Pharmacal' relief. This is an order that a person provide information on others involved in the supply of infringing goods (or goods which it is seriously arguable are infringing), made on the basis that a person, whether innocent or not, who has been caught up in wrongdoing is under a duty to assist those who have been injured by that act. Mandatory interim injunctive relief more generally. The nature of available mechanisms continues to evolve with developments in technology and the developing jurisprudence in respect of the IP Enforcement Directive. For example, the IP Enforcement Directive requires the availability of measures for preserving evidence (Article 7) and a 'right of information' (Article 8). Representation Broadly speaking, in litigation in the IPEC, parties may be represented, including at court hearings, by a solicitor, a patent attorney with an appropriate advocacy qualification, a barrister (who is usually instructed by a solicitor or patent attorney), a combination of these representatives, or by themselves (IPEC Guide). In the Patents Court, the rules regarding rights of audience at court hearings are more restrictive (CPR section 13). Barristers have rights of audience. Solicitors have rights of audience in some interim proceedings, but at trial only if they have completed an additional advocacy qualification. Patent attorneys may obtain rights of audience by completing an additional advocacy qualification. If a litigant is a corporate entity, it may be represented by an authorised employee, but for representation at trial by such a person the court's permission is required (CPR 39.6). Limitation In intellectual property claims, limitation issues are governed by the Limitation Act 1980, which provides that actions founded in tort shall not be brought after the expiration of six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued. Alternative dispute resolution Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods include arbitration and mediation. Alternative dispute resolution is encouraged by the courts and the CPR but its role in any dispute generally has no statutory basis in the UK. It is therefore for the parties to agree to adopt an alternative dispute resolution method, the outcome of which may, or may not (depending on the method) be binding upon them. Arbitrations with their seat in England and Wales or Northern Ireland are governed by the Arbitration Act 1996.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 March 2017 by Military News global cancer immunotherapy market is Expected to Witness a Spike in the Demand for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors The global cancer immunotherapy market is expected to experience a very high rate of growth over the coming years, owing to the increase in the number of patients suffering from various types of cancer. In terms of the treatment options for cancer, cancer immunotherapy is expected to make serious headway due to its proven greater efficiency over conventional treatment methods. The market is also expected to show a high growth rate over the coming years due to a highly promising treatments pipeline. However, the global cancer immunotherapy market is expected to be hindered by factors such as the high level of attrition within the development cycles of its several product types, and the overall lack of awareness of immunotherapy as a better option to conventional treatment in multiple regions of the world. Browse Market Research Report @www.transparencymarketresearch.com/cancer-immunotherapy-m… In 2015, the global cancer immunotherapy market was valued at US$37.50 bn. With its revenue expected to progress at a very strong CAGR of 14.6% within a forecast period from 2016 to 2024, the global cancer immunotherapy market is expected to reach US$124.88 bn by the end of 2024. Monoclonal Antibodies Continue Being Top Cancer Immunotherapy In terms of types of therapies, the global cancer immunotherapy market can be segmented into cancer vaccines, immune system modulators, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies have so far been the leading choice of treatment methods for a large portion of the global healthcare industry, giving it a high lead over other segments. This therapy type has been more affordable than the other types, allowing it to gain greater popularity. However, the global cancer immunotherapy market is expected to witness a spike in the demand for immune checkpoint inhibitors due to their greater percentages of success rates and higher overall efficiency. In terms of area of therapy, the global cancer immunotherapy market can be segmented into blood cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and other minor areas. Of these, breast cancer has been the leading area of immunotherapy. Lung cancer is also showing a very high increase in rate of demand owing to the growing population of smokers and the higher overall air pollution in urban areas. Fill the Form for an Exclusive Sample of this Report @www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Developed Economies Show Higher Development Rates in Cancer Immunotherapy From a geographical perspective, the global cancer immunotherapy market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the rest of the world. The market’s past has more or less been written within the developed economies of the world. North America and Europe have been base for several of the top level research and development efforts in the global cancer immunotherapy market so far. Both regions have also shown a great deal of demand for cancer immunotherapy owing to a more aware population and a better overall healthcare outreach. At the same time, the growing rate of awareness in other parts of the world – especially in Asia Pacific – is expected to guide the global cancer immunotherapy market in the coming years. Asia Pacific especially shows a very highly favorable rate of growth in cancer immunotherapy adoption due to an increasing density in urban populations, growing awareness rates of common cancer types such as prostate and breast cancers, and the booming industry of medical tourism. The leading players that have so far been in operation within the global cancer immunotherapy market include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Amgen, Inc., AstraZeneca Plc., Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline Plc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Merck & Co., Inc., Janssen Biotech, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., Novartis AG, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, and Takeda Pharmaceuticals.
