While in keeping with its focus on drugs that have lost patent protection, the deals mark a foray into new dosage forms, new therapeutic areas and into biotech drugs for Fresenius's Kabi unit, a maker of generic infusion drugs, tube feeding and blood transfusion equipment. Akorn will add products such as medical creams, ophthalmic drugs, oral liquids, ear drops, nasal sprays and respiratory drugs, where competition is relatively benign when compared with standard pills and tablets. The deal with Merck, in turn, marks the entry into biosimilar copies of complex biologic drugs made from living cells, which Fresenius has previously shunned. "We've always said the regulatory environment would have to clear up before we invest in biosimilars. A lot has been done in that area in the recent past," Fresenius Chief Executive Stephan Sturm told Reuters. Reuters earlier on Monday reported that Fresenius was close to acquiring Akorn. In a deal that has the backing of Akorn's management and its largest shareholder, Fresenius will pay $34 per share and take on Akorn's net debt of about $450 million for a total price tag of $4.75 billion, Fresenius said in a statement late on Monday. It will be financed by a broad mix of euro- and dollar-denominated debt instruments, it added. In the separate agreement with Merck KGaA, Fresenius will pay an initial 170 million euros ($185 million) and up to 500 million euros in future milestone payments tied to achievements of drug development targets as none of Merck's biosimilar drugs have been launched yet. Fresenius said it expects first revenues towards the end of 2019 and it is prepared to spend and invest an extra 1.4 billion euros to build up the business over the years through 2022. It will pay single digit percentage royalties to Merck based on sales. Fresenius, with a market capitalization of more than 40 billion euros, runs businesses in areas ranging from kidney dialysis and drug manufacturing to hospital management. Fresenius CEO Sturm, had signaled that acquisitions would be a hallmark of his leadership after he took over the top job in July last year. In September, the company made its biggest deal ever with the acquisition of Spain's private hospital chain Quironsalud for 5.8 billion euros to expand the international presence of its hospital business Helios. Group net debt as a multiple of core earnings will temporarily increase to about 3.3 after closing of both transactions but the ratio is expected to return to about 3 at the end of 2018. Fresenius has for years enjoyed low borrowing costs because of its diversified businesses in an industry that is largely immune to swings in the business cycle.

KGaA: Fresenius Kabi to strengthen and diversify product portfolio by acquiring Akorn and Merck KGaA"s biosimilars business 2017. április 24., hétfő, 22:54 DGAP-Ad-hoc: Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA / Key word(s): Mergers & Acquisitions Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA: Fresenius Kabi to strengthen and diversify product portfolio by acquiring Akorn and Merck KGaA"s biosimilars business 24-Apr-2017 / 22:54 CET/CEST Disclosure of an inside information acc. to Article 17 MAR, transmitted by DGAP - a service of EQS Group AG. The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. Fresenius Kabi to strengthen and diversify product portfolio by acquiring Akorn and Merck KGaA"s biosimilars business Acquisition of Akorn to strengthen and diversify core business and product portfolio Fresenius Kabi has agreed to acquire Akorn, Inc. a U.S.-based manufacturer and marketer of prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, for approximately US$4.3 billion, or $34 per share, plus approximately US$450 million of net debt (Fresenius projection of as of December 31, 2017). Akorn produces and markets a diverse product portfolio of injectables, topical creams, ointments and gels, sterile ophthalmics, as well as oral liquids, otic solutions (for the ear), nasal sprays and respiratory drugs. Akorn products are sold in retail pharmacies (prescription and over-the-counter) and directly to physicians, in addition to hospitals and clinics - almost exclusively in the U.S. Akorn announced today that based on a preliminary review of Q1/17 results, it is reaffirming its previously announced 2017 guidance (including revenue of US$1,010 to 1,060 million and adjusted EBITDA* of US$363 to 401 million), excluding any one-time costs related to the transaction with Fresenius Kabi. The total purchase price corresponds to approximately 12.4x adjusted EBITDA* at the mid-point of the expected 2017 range. Assuming the transaction closes at the end of 2017, Fresenius Kabi projects 2018 sales from this business of US$1,035 to 1,085 million, and EBITDA before integration costs of approximately US$380 to 420 million. Mid-term, the acquisition is expected to create cost and growth synergies of approximately US$100 million p.a. before tax. Fresenius Kabi expects a progressive ramp-up of those synergies which will be achieved by integrating and modernizing Akorn"s production network and by combining other functions. For the period from 2018 to 2022, Fresenius Kabi expects integration costs of approximately US$140 million before tax in total. The integration costs are projected to be frontloaded with the major impact in 2018. Fresenius expects the acquisition to be accretive to Group net income** and Group EPS** in 2018, excluding integration costs, and to contribute positively from 2019 onwards including integration costs. Akorn"s board recommends the approval of the transaction and merger agreement with Fresenius Kabi to its shareholders. Akorn"s largest shareholder, who beneficially controls approximately 25% of its shares, has committed to supporting the transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act in the U.S. and approval by Akorn shareholders. Closing is expected by early 2018. The purchase price will be financed by a broad mix of Euro and US-Dollar denominated debt instruments. Entry into growing biosimilars market Fresenius and Merck KGaA announced today that Fresenius Kabi will acquire Merck"s biosimilars business, which comprises the entire development pipeline and an experienced team of more than 70 employees located in Aubonne and Vevey, Switzerland. The product pipeline has a focus on oncology and autoimmune diseases. Fresenius Kabi expects first sales towards the end of 2019 and estimates to ramp-up the business to high triple-digit million sales from 2023 onwards based on the current product development schedule. Fresenius Kabi has agreed to pay single digit percentage royalties to Merck based on sales. The purchase price will be up to EUR670 million. Thereof, EUR170 million will be paid in cash upon closing. Approximately EUR500 million are milestone payments strictly tied to achievements of development targets. Analytical testing, clinical studies, quality requirements specific to biosimilars as well as marketing and sales activities are expected to result in increased costs for Fresenius Kabi. These costs are expected to occur in uneven tranches. The total expected cash-out and self-imposed investment ceiling is estimated to be up to EUR1.4 billion until projected EBITDA break-even in 2022. From 2023 onwards, the acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive to Group net income** and Group EPS**. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in H2/2017. The total investment in the biosimilars business will be mainly cash flow financed. Implications of transactions on Group Financials Fresenius confirms its 2020 earnings** target range of EUR2.4 to 2.7 billion. Both transactions combined are expected to be neutral to Group net income** and EPS** by 2020 and accretive from 2021 onwards. Before amortization and before integration costs, both transactions combined are projected to be neutral to Group net income** and EPS** by 2018 and to contribute positively from 2019 onwards. Group net debt/EBITDA will temporarily increase to approximately 3.3 after closing of both transactions. The leverage ratio is expected to return to approximately 3.0 at the end of 2018.

Terry as Executive Director of the Center, replacing retiring director Tom Ward. Terry, an experienced organizational leader and place-based educator, comes to the Center from the Student Conservation Association where he served as the Vice-President of National Programs. An educator by training, with a M.Ed. from New England College, he has deep experience developing programs and curriculum, teaching, and training educators in both wilderness programs and public schools. Through his recent work, Terry has focused on helping the conservation movement realign its principles and practices to be more inclusive of, and ultimately relevant to, developing conservationists from all backgrounds. “I was captivated by the panoramic sweep of this property from the moment that I stepped onto the farm” says Terry. “At Merck Forest and Farmland Center, we want to encourage our visitors to develop a deep connection to and a sense of stewardship for the 3,200-acre landscape. The Center’s working farm and forest, diverse ecology and expansive recreational offerings afford visitors a rich network of opportunities for personal growth and reflection. I look forward to collaborating with staff, volunteers, and the community to provide visitors from near and far with opportunities to learn about, explore, and develop a lifelong love of the natural world.” Chinn characterized the search for a new executive director as long, exhaustive, and “unprecedented” in the sixty-four year history of MFFC. Of Terry he writes, “Rob brings a set of skills — personal, administrative, technological and educational — which we believe will raise Merck Forest to a new level of statewide, regional, and even national significance. Rob is a real outdoorsman, with a deep love of landscape and learning, and we all welcome him enthusiastically to guide us into the future.” Merck Forest and Farmland Center is a non-profit educational organization located in the Taconic Mountains of southwestern Vermont. The Center’s mission is the sustainable management of its forest, the promotion of innovative agricultural practices on its upland farm, the education of local students in outdoor exploration and the study of natural sciences, and the creation of unparalleled recreational opportunities for individuals, families and school groups. The Center is located at 3270 Vermont Route 315 in Rupert, Vermont; additional information about Merck Forest & Farmland Center and its programs is available on the website www.merckforest.org.

Under the terms of the deal, Merck will pay PDL a one-off lump sum of US$19.5mln to settle the suit which is related to Merck’s skin cancer treatment, Keytruda. In return, PDL will grant Merck a “fully paid-up, royalty free, non-exclusive license” to certain patent rights related to Keytruda, while it has also agreed not to sue Merck for royalties relating to the cancer treatment. “We are pleased to resolve this patent infringement lawsuit with Merck with a favorable monetary settlement to PDL as well as eliminating potential future litigation costs related to this matter for both parties,” said PDL’s president and chief executive John McLaughlin.

News sign-up Merck drives digital progress News, 24 April 2017 Topics Digital media planning & buying NEW YORK: Merck, the pharma group, is pushing ahead into digital marketing despite the challenges of tight regulation and the need to transform long-standing mindsets. Patricia Brown, Executive Director/US Marketing at Merck & Co, discussed this subject at the 2017 ePharma Summit held by KNect365. "First of all, we are seeing a change in digital," she said. (For more details, including further strategic tips for pharma brands, read WARC's exclusive report: Merck dives into digital.) "There are two brand teams at Merck, with high digital IQs, that have significantly increased investment in the last year. And they've significantly decreased what they spend on TV. So, it is happening." As a 128-year-old organisation, Merck fits the definition of a legacy business. But Brown has found huge receptivity to digital inside its four walls. "What we've done in the last 12 to 18 months is to take a very true, real environmental scan to know what was important to our customers in the marketplace," she said. "We then did [an] internal environmental scan to see how far off we were." Their discovery: "An enormous gap. So, we got approval for a digital strategy with key areas of focus. We communicated that broadly. We incorporated [digital] objectives into everyone's personal objectives, which is critical," she continued. "We have alignment of senior leaders, which is also extremely important. And we are starting to shift the way we work across functions." Many companies, in fact, are seeking to adopt a test-and-learn approach to digital marketing, and Brown suggested pharma firms have a natural advantage in this space. "We are trying to work with that – to inspire people to do things differently. And the way we do that is to go back to our roots. All of us are trained in a scientific method. And that is: test and learn," she said. "You do an experiment. And when you learn, you do another experiment. And when you share that with our group, they say, 'Oh yeah, we're doing that across the business. We are just not thinking about it that way'. That seems to be helping when we frame it that way."

Business Lake Forest-based Akorn bought by German drug giant for $4.3 billion Akorn William DeShazer / Chicago Tribune Sanjay Patel, a research scientist with Akorn Pharmaceuticals, works in a Skokie lab in 2012. Sanjay Patel, a research scientist with Akorn Pharmaceuticals, works in a Skokie lab in 2012. (William DeShazer / Chicago Tribune) Naomi KresgeBloomberg In just 10 months at the head of Germany's Fresenius, Chief Executive Officer Stephan Sturm has now inked the health-care provider's two biggest-ever deals. With the $4.3 billion acquisition of Lake Forest-based generic drugmaker Akorn, announced late Monday, Fresenius will get a stronger foothold in the U.S., with access to a network of retail pharmacies and outpatient clinics as well as the hospitals where it has traditionally marketed its products. Akorn will complement Fresenius' Kabi medicines unit, which specializes in intravenous drugs. Fresenius, Europe's biggest publicly traded health-care provider, also made a smaller purchase Monday to gain Merck KGaA's portfolio of biosimilars, which are copycat versions of complex biotechnology drugs. It agreed to pay Merck 170 million euros ($184.7 million), plus licensing fees and as much as 500 million euros in milestones. With the two transactions, Sturm is further expanding the global reach of its Bad Homburg-based group, bolstering the medicines unit that's key to profit growth -- and making a long-term bet on biosimilars. The CEO had already agreed to spend more than $6 billion on the Spanish hospital group IDC Salud Holding SLU, known as Quironsalud, last year in the company's largest acquisition. The Akorn and biosimilar deals make even more sense together than individually, Sturm said Monday. "Akorn brings us additional U.S. market access to small- and mid-sized clinics and retail pharmacies," he said. "And that access will be important for our biosimilars." Including debt, the Akorn deal has an enterprise value of $4.75 billion. Akorn's shares had jumped 30 percent since April 6, the day before Bloomberg News reported that Fresenius was considering a deal. They were little changed at $32.80 following the announcement Monday, after the U.S. markets closed. Akorn's biggest shareholder, John Kapoor, who owns a quarter of the stock, has agreed to support the deal, Fresenius said. Integrating the businesses will save about $100 million each year, the companies predicted. Jury awards $20M in Georgia couple case's against Lake Forest drug maker Akorn Associated Press A Georgia jury has awarded more than $20 million to a retired kindergarten teacher and her husband who claimed that a pharmaceutical company failed to include a warning on a prescription drug label that it would harmfully interact with another drug she was taking. The Telegraph reports that a Houston... A Georgia jury has awarded more than $20 million to a retired kindergarten teacher and her husband who claimed that a pharmaceutical company failed to include a warning on a prescription drug label that it would harmfully interact with another drug she was taking. The Telegraph reports that a Houston... (Associated Press) The payoff for biosimilars may take longer. Fresenius said it expects to invest as much as 1.4 billion euros in patient trials and other development costs for biosimilars before the unit breaks even in 2022. The first sales are targeted for the end of 2019, with revenue expected to reach high triple-digit millions of euros by 2023. Fresenius agreed to single-digit percentage royalties for Merck KGaA -- which is a German company unrelated to Merck & Co. in the U.S. -- based on sales. Merck KGaA is working on copies of complex biologic drugs for cancer and inflammatory diseases and had a treatment in late-stage tests for chronic plaque psoriasis that's similar to AbbVie's Humira, one of the world's best-selling medicines.

With the $4.3 billion acquisition of Illinois-based generic drugmaker Akorn Inc., announced late Monday, Fresenius will get a stronger foothold in the U.S., with access to a network of retail pharmacies and outpatient clinics as well as the hospitals where it has traditionally marketed its products. Akorn will complement Fresenius’s Kabi medicines unit, which specializes in intravenous drugs. Fresenius, Europe’s biggest publicly traded health-care provider, also made a smaller purchase Monday to gain Merck KGaA’s portfolio of biosimilars, which are copycat versions of complex biotechnology drugs. It agreed to pay Merck 170 million euros ($184.7 million), plus licensing fees and as much as 500 million euros in milestones. With the two transactions, Sturm is further expanding the global reach of its Bad Homburg-based group, bolstering the medicines unit that’s key to profit growth -- and making a long-term bet on biosimilars. The CEO had already agreed to spend more than $6 billion on the Spanish hospital group IDC Salud Holding SLU, known as Quironsalud, last year in the company’s largest acquisition. The Akorn and biosimilar deals make even more sense together than individually, Sturm said Monday. “Akorn brings us additional U.S. market access to small- and mid-sized clinics and retail pharmacies,” he said. “And that access will be important for our biosimilars.” Akorn Shares Including debt, the Akorn deal has an enterprise value of $4.75 billion. Akorn’s shares had jumped 30 percent since April 6, the day before Bloomberg News reported that Fresenius was considering a deal. They were little changed at $32.80 following the announcement Monday, after the U.S. markets closed. Akorn’s biggest shareholder, John Kapoor, who owns a quarter of the stock, has agreed to support the deal, Fresenius said. Integrating the businesses will save about $100 million each year, the companies predicted. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up The payoff for biosimilars may take longer. Fresenius said it expects to invest as much as 1.4 billion euros in patient trials and other development costs for biosimilars before the unit breaks even in 2022. The first sales are targeted for the end of 2019, with revenue expected to reach high triple-digit millions of euros by 2023. Fresenius agreed to single-digit percentage royalties for Merck KGaA -- which is a German company unrelated to Merck & Co. in the U.S. -- based on sales. Merck KGaA is working on copies of complex biologic drugs for cancer and inflammatory diseases and had a treatment in late-stage tests for chronic plaque psoriasis that’s similar to AbbVie Inc.’s Humira, one of the world’s best-selling medicines. Fresenius expects the transaction to lift earnings per share from 2019 on and plans to raise both euro- and dollar-denominated debt to finance the deal. The additional borrowings should remain “manageable,” analysts at Berenberg told clients in a note on Tuesday. More large deals are unlikely for Fresenius before the end of next year, they wrote. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Meet the Contributors → Pursuing Larger Rivals, NGM Bio Tries To Make Mark On Fatty Livers Alex Lash April 22nd, 2017 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy San Francisco —  About 7,000 liver transplants occur in the U.S. each year. A condition that few people can pronounce, and no one has a treatment for, has become a main reason for those transplants. That’s why several rich, powerful drug companies are in the final expensive stage of testing new drugs to treat the liver disease nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH: there is urgent medical and financial incentive to stem the transplant tide. NASH can also lead to liver cancer. As the name implies, it’s not drinking that leads to the serious liver damage that characterizes NASH, but typically bad diet and sedentary lifestyle—yet more fallout from the obesity epidemic, with an estimated three to 12 percent of Americans already showing signs of NASH. Even though it is lagging behind others closer to regulatory approval, privately held NGM Bio thinks it can compete. Researchers are presenting data today that show a handful of NASH patients had the fat in their livers revert to normal levels after 12 weeks of daily injections of a drug from NGM, based in South San Francisco, CA. Their liver fat content was “normalized” back under the threshold of five percent, according to Stephen Harrison, medical director of Pinnacle Clinical Research in San Antonio, TX, and the lead investigator in NGM’s Phase 2 study. Harrison is presenting the data today at the annual International Liver Congress in The Netherlands. Thanks to a major deal with Merck (NYSE: MRK), NGM’s research is mainly paid for, which is why they can jump into the high-stakes NASH fray. But Merck does not have rights to NGM’s NASH candidate, called NGM-282, which is an engineered version of the hormone FGF19. The new results are full of caveats, not least of which is the small sample size. In the double-blind study, fifty-three people received NGM-282 and received either a lower or higher dose. (Twenty seven more received placebo.) Of those receiving NGM-282, 79 percent saw at least a five percent reduction in liver fat—the main goal of the study—and 34 percent, or 18 people, returned to a normal level after 12 weeks. In the two dose groups combined, 47 of 53 patients had a reduction of liver fat of at least 30 percent. “The data are encouraging, showing the reversal in such a short time,” said Anjana Pallai, medical director of the University of Chicago’s Liver Tumor Clinic. (Rivals Gilead Sciences and Bristol-Myers Squibb also presented Phase 2 NASH liver-fat reduction data at EASL yesterday. Bristol’s study was roughly the same size as NGM’s, with 24 of 44 patients across two dose levels hitting the 30 percent reduction mark; Gilead presented data from only 10 patients.) Pallai and other liver specialists not involved in the study were cautious about the NGM data. A fatty liver does not necessarily lead to NASH, and so a reduction of liver fat doesn’t necessarily equal treatment of NASH. For a NASH treatment to be successful, two other factors would also need to be reversed: scarring (also called fibrosis) and inflammation. “Ideally it would be best for all three markers to regress,” said Pallai. Easier said than done. It’s unclear why roughly 10 to 20 percent of people who show the early signs of fatty liver develop the severe fibrosis of NASH, while many others don’t. The NGM study noted that the level of several proteins associated with liver damage, and fibrosis in particular, also went down after 12 weeks. But Harrison was careful not to draw conclusions. Two proteins, abbreviated as TIMP1 and PIIINP, are not yet “well accepted” as stand-ins, or surrogates, for NASH fibrosis. Their decrease “begin(s) to tell a story that there may be an effect on fibrosis,” he said via email. “However, we would not expect a significant change in fibrosis at only 12 weeks.” “We need to see the long term effects, for sure,” said Pallai. “Is there really reversibility, and how much? If you have Stage 2 scarring and can go back to Stage 1”—with Stage 1 being normal and Stage 4 indicating cirrhosis—“that would be very encouraging.” It will take a much longer study to see potential fibrosis reversal. And NGM is also years behind NASH drugs from Tobira Therapeutics, a division of Allergan (NYSE: AGN), Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ICPT, Genfit, and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD). All are in Phase 3 studies that aim to show over years, not weeks, that they can reverse fibrosis. Intercept’s drug is the first to be approved—for a different degenerative liver condition called primary biliary cirrhosis. Another caveat was a notable spike in bad cholesterol levels among the patients taking NGM-282. It wasn’t too surprising; the Intercept NASH drug obeticholic acid (OCA) also caused a cholesterol jump in an earlier … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Alex Lash is Xconomy's National Biotech Editor.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Rising Demand for Combination Glaucoma Drugs is Likely to Encourage the Growth of Global Glaucoma Therapeutics Market in the Next Few Years The global glaucoma therapeutics market is immensely consolidated and the top five players accounted for just under 85.0% of the market in 2015. Among Novartis AG, Allergan plc., Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., and Santen Pharmaceuticals, Novartis is the clear leader with a massive share of over 33.0%. Read the Complete Details for this Market at: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/glaucoma-therapeutics-… Transparency Market Research has observed that most companies have a hold over the market owing to their well-established brands and a strong pipeline of drugs for the treatment of glaucoma. However, loss in the market share of leading companies due to patent expiry is likely to offset the competitive landscape in the coming years. The global glaucoma therapeutics market is projected to rise from a value of US$5.7 bn in 2015 to US$7.6 bn by 2024 at a modest CAGR of 3.4% therein. North America Dominates Global Market by Revenue Based on drug class, the glaucoma therapeutics market is led by the combination segment, which is projected to account for a share of 25.8% by 2024. Expanding at an 8.8% CAGR from 2016 to 2024, the segment is fueled by the cost-effective nature of these drugs as compared to individual drugs. On the basis of end use, hospitals formed the leading segment of the glaucoma therapeutics market in 2015. The maximum opportunity was also presented by this segment. Hospitals provide healthcare services at an affordable cost to citizens across the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and several other countries in Europe. This has ensured the dominance of the hospitals segment. Geographically, North America is expected to account for a large share in the glaucoma therapeutics market in terms of revenue owing to the rising usage of highly priced prostaglandins. The region accounted for almost half the market in 2015. Exhibiting a 4.2% CAGR from 2016 to 2024, Asia Pacific presents immense scope for growth. India holds a major share in the APAC market in terms of revenue owing to the rising prevalence of glaucoma in the country and a comparatively lower cost of treatment. Improving Socio-economic Living Conditions Key in Driving Uptake of Glaucoma Therapeutics The growing need to offer improved eye care and preserve the vision of the patients among healthcare providers has resulted in the development of enhanced therapeutic options for the treatment of glaucoma. “Although eye drops have, until recent years, been the primary method of treatment, the market has been witnessing an evident shift toward combination drugs,” the author notes. The strong pipeline of combination drugs for the treatment of glaucoma therefore ensures steady growth of this market. Aerie Pharmaceuticals’ pipeline of combination drugs such as Rho Kinase Inhibitor (ROCKi) and norepinephrine transport inhibitor (NETi) is a key example of this development. In addition to this, an improvement in the socio-economic conditions of people in developing countries has increased spending capacity, which has not only resulted in a rise in healthcare expenditure but also led a surge in awareness about living a healthy lifestyle. This has, in turn, upped the early detection of glaucoma and spurred the demand for glaucoma therapeutics. Perceive the Sample Report containing the Upcoming Opportunities for this Market at: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… In contrast, the possible side effects of glaucoma drugs and the growth of the generic drugs market are likely to be the key deterrents in the coming years.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Veterinary Vaccines Market Research Report by Geographical Analysis and Forecast to 2024 Veterinary Vaccines Market The global veterinary vaccines market is highly consolidated, with the top five vendors accounting for a share of nearly 65% in the overall market in 2015, reports TMR in a new study. Zoetis, Inc., Merck & Co., and Sanofi Aventis, the top three companies in the market collectively held a share of more than 45% of the overall market in the same year. Targeted in-licensing and acquisitions, expansion of global manufacturing and supply capacities, and increased investments towards research and development activities are some of the key strategies adopted by leading vendors in the market. A recent instance is the strategic alliance of Sanofi with Boehringer Ingelheim in June 2016. Under this alliance, an exchange of Boehringer Ingelheim’s consumer healthcare (CHC) unit with Sanofi’s animal health business took place. Read Full Report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/veterinary-vaccines-ma… In the past few years, factors such as globalization and intense changes in global climate have led to a vast rise in the prevalence of zoonotic diseases globally. To prevent the huge loss of livestock and potential threat to human lives that global outbreaks of several zoonotic diseases cause, there has been a surge in government initiatives aimed at mandating vaccination for companion and farm animals. Active efforts are also undertaken by government and non-government bodies to increase awareness among pet and livestock owners about rampant and hazardous animal diseases, their symptoms, and medication. Also, the vast surge in the global demand for meat, chicken, eggs, and milk is compelling livestock farmers to pay proper attention to vaccination to ensure the production excellent quality products and thereby keep their businesses sustainable and profitable. In the past few years, pet ownership and the money spent for ensuring health and wellness of companion animals has significantly increased on a global front. According to the national pet owners’ survey of 2015-2016, 65% households in the U.S. own a pet. The pet industry in the U.S. had a valuation of US$ 60.59 bn in 2015 and is expected to rise to US$62.75 bn in 2016. These factors are collectively expected to have a significant impact on the overall development of the global veterinary vaccines market in the next few years. Moreover, the market is also expected to benefit enormously from the vast rise in research and development activities and increased demand for advanced and more effective veterinary vaccines across the globe. Download exclusive Sample of this report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… National governments play a key role in deciding the profitability of the veterinary vaccines market. For instance, the Government of India purchases foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccines in bulk from manufacturers and supplies it to different parts of the country. Such bilk purchases result in reduced prices of the vaccines, substantially bringing down the profitability of manufacturers. The short product exclusivity period in the animal healthcare industry, of nearly 3-5 years results in intense competition from cheaper generic substitutes and over-the-counter products. Additionally, strict regulations for product approval and the resulting decline in the number of products that can enter the market limit the overall profitability of the global veterinary vaccines market substantially. The global market for veterinary vaccines is expected to expand at a healthy 6.9% CAGR over the period between 2016 and 2024. The market, which had a valuation of US$6,271.8 mn in 2015, is expected to rise to US$11,403.6 mn by 2024. In terms of technology type, the segment of live attenuated vaccines is presently the leading contributor to market’s overall revenues. The segment accounted for over 44% in the global market in 2015. Geography-wise, North America held nearly 37% of the global market’s overall revenues in 2015.

Akorn's largest shareholder, who beneficially controls approximately 25% of its shares, has committed to supporting the transaction. Closing is expected by early 2018. Akorn is a specialty generic pharmaceutical company engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of multisource and branded pharmaceuticals. Akorn manufactures ophthalmic, injectable and niche sterile and non-sterile harmaceuticals. The company employs more than 2,000 people and has three R&D centers and five manufacturing facilities in the United States, Switzerland and India. Akorn also announced that based on a preliminary review of first-quarter results, it is reaffirming previously announced 2017 guidance, excluding any one-time costs related to the transaction with Fresenius Kabi. Fresenius expects the acquisition to be accretive to Group net income and Group EPS in 2018, excluding integration costs, and to contribute positively from 2019 onwards including integration costs. Mid-term, Fresenius Kabi expects the acquisition to create cost and growth synergies of approximately $100 million p.a. before tax. Fresenius Kabi expects a progressive ramp-up of those synergies which will be achieved by integrating and modernizing Akorn's production network and by combining other functions. For the period from 2018 to 2022, Fresenius Kabi expects integration costs of approximately $140 million before tax in total. The integration costs are projected to be frontloaded with the major impact in 2018. John Ducker, CEO of Fresenius Kabi USA, stated: "Akorn brings to Fresenius Kabi specialized expertise in development, manufacturing and marketing of alternate dosage forms, as well as access to new customer segments like retail, ophthalmology and veterinary practices. Its pipeline is also impressive, with approximately 85 ANDAs filed and pending with the FDA and dozens more in development." Separately, Fresenius and Merck KGaA announced that Fresenius Kabi will acquire Merck's biosimilars business, which comprises the entire development pipeline and an experienced team of more than 70 employees located in Aubonne and Vevey, Switzerland. The product pipeline has a focus on oncology and autoimmune diseases. The purchase price will be up to 670 million euros. Thereof, 170 million euros will be paid in cash upon closing. Approximately 500 million euros are milestone payments strictly tied to achievements of development targets. From 2023 onwards, the acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive to Group net income and Group EPS. Fresenius Kabi expects first sales towards the end of 2019 and estimates to ramp-up the business to high triple-digit million sales from 2023 onwards based on the current product development schedule. Fresenius Kabi has agreed to pay single digit percentage royalties to Merck based on sales. Analytical testing, clinical studies, quality requirements specific to biosimilars as well as marketing and sales activities are expected to result in increased costs for Fresenius Kabi. The total expected cash-out and self-imposed investment ceiling is estimated to be up to 1.4 billion euros until projected EBITDA break-even in 2022. Fresenius said, both transactions combined are expected to be neutral to Group net income and EPS by 2020 and accretive from 2021 onwards. The company confirmed its 2020 earnings target range of 2.4 to 2.7 billion euros. Before amortization and before integration costs, both transactions combined are projected to be neutral to Group net income and EPS by 2018 and to contribute positively from 2019 onwards. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Friendly Skies: Best Airlines for Customer Satisfaction Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In May Previous Story Next Story Corporate News D-Day For CAPR Today, OMED Hands Out Pink Slips, JAZZ Hits Right Notes...

But Samsung Bioepis and partner Merck are hoping to claw away some of that market share with a new rival therapy—one that could come at a significant discount to the pricey arthritis and psoriasis treatment, which is J&J's best-selling product by far. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given the green light to Renflexis, which is now the second approved "biosimilar" of Remicade in the U.S. (the first was Pfizer's Inflectra, approved last April). Biosimilars mimic biologic drugs, which, as the name implies, are derived from biological matter rather than chemicals. They tend to be much more expensive than conventional medicines and are some of the most lucrative pharma products in the world. Click here to subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our brand new newsletter about health innovations. Since biosimilars are so new to the U.S. market (there have been just five total approved here since 2015), it's been hard to gauge whether or not they can make a formidable dent in high drug prices by offering generic alternatives to branded treatments. The initial signs haven't been all that encouraging; for instance, Pfizer announced last fall that it would price Inflectra at just a 15% discount to Remicade. Some had hoped to see a price cut of up to 30%. And in Europe, biosimilars have driven down the prices of some drug types by as much as 50%. Samsung Bioepis, which has a pipeline of these kinds of copycat treatments for a number of flagship therapies, specifically cited the price-cutting potential of biosimilars. “Since our company was established five years ago, we have strived day in and day out to realize the promise of biosimilars for patients across the United States by offering them treatment options at a lower cost. We hope this regulatory milestone will bring us a step closer to achieving this goal,” said Christopher Hansung Ko, President & CEO of the firm, in a statement. But Samsung Bioepis and Merck, which will be responsible for marketing and distributing the drug in the U.S.—somewhat ironic given that Merck actually markets branded Remicade in Europe in a partnership with J&J—haven't disclosed just what the price will be quite yet. The companies say they will announce it much closer to the product's launch later this year.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Big Tech Is Taking on Diabetes The combination of big tech and healthcare may be an unlikely matchup, but as these collaborations become more prevalent, patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Apr 24, 2017 at 2:32PM When Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) introduced Alexa, the voice-activated digital assistant, in late 2014, it probably didn't anticipate the reception she would get. Alexa has her foundations in artificial intelligence and powers the Echo, Dot, and Tap smart speakers that have become some of the top-selling items on the e-commerce giant's website. The company hasn't disclosed figures, but Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that 8.2 million U.S. consumers have purchased the devices, and analysts at Morgan Stanley believe that closer to 11 million units had been sold even before the holidays.  Amazon released a skills kit to developers early in Alexa's career, and she currently supports over 10,000 commands, from ordering pizza, to playing music, to providing daily history lessons. Amazon even equipped Alexa with a Skill Finder feature to provide users with a "skill of the day." And just when you thought there are no frontiers left for the digital diva to conquer, Amazon announced the Alexa Diabetes Challenge. Alexa voice-enabled solutions for diabetes? Image source: Amazon. Alexa-enabled diabetes solutions? Amazon has partnered with pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and is challenging developers to create Alexa-powered solutions to improve the lives of people managing Type 2 diabetes. According to Amazon, 27.5 million people in the United States suffer from the disease, and the company believes that Alexa is the key to helping them manage it. As an incentive, Amazon is offering $25,000 and 10,000 credits for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon's cloud-computing operation, for up to five finalists to develop their concept. They will then participate in a virtual accelerator, and the winning entry will be awarded a grand prize of $125,000. Amazon and Merck are also exploring ways to leverage AWS and artificial intelligence to support people with chronic diseases such as diabetes.  Watson takes on diabetes management Amazon isn't the only big tech company providing solutions for those with diabetes. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is working with Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) "to develop a new generation of personalized diabetes management solutions." IBM's Watson, the company's AI-enabled Jeopardy!-winning cognitive supercomputer, ingested data from health insurance records, 10,000 anonymous electronic patient medical records, and population data in an attempt to develop real-time personalized care. The result was Sugar.IQ, a personal assistant capable of detecting patterns of behavior and predicting diabetic events hours before they happen. Watson is also hard at work reviewing 66 years of data from the American Diabetes Association to build apps to help those afflicted. Apple's got a secret CNBC is reporting that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been secretly working to develop non-invasive sensors that continuously monitor blood sugar levels and could be a feature in a future version of Apple Watch. The report indicates the company has a small team of biomedical engineers working on the issue and that the efforts are sufficiently advanced to warrant feasibility trials. The report also indicates that Apple has hired consultants to navigate the regulatory process. Little else is known about the project, and Apple has not publicly acknowledged its efforts.  Bottom line Advances in technology have paved the way for big data applications in the field of medicine. As companies develop even greater caches of data, the potential for groundbreaking impact in medicine increases. Amazon will probably not enjoy any revenue from its investment, but the positive publicity alone will be worth far more than any money the company spends.  Danny Vena owns shares of Amazon and Apple.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 24, 2017 1:45pm   Comments Share: Overall, first-quarter earnings have been pretty positive and many CEOs struck an optimistic tone discussing outlooks for the remainder of 2017. Two industrial bellwethers, General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) and Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON), just beat Wall Street analyst expectations on Friday and credit card companies American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) and Visa Inc (NYSE: V) also reported strong results—some are taking that as a sign that consumer confidence could be translating into consumer buying. Next up in Q1, Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT), and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) report before market open on April 25. Eli Lilly & Co. Earnings: New Arthritis Drug in Focus LLY recently suffered a setback when approval for the company’s new arthritis drug, co-developed with Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ: INCY), faced delays from the FDA. LLY and INCY disagreed with the FDA’s findings in a company press release and are confident the drug will still be approved in the future. Despite the company’s confidence in the drug, LLY stock dropped about 5% in trading the day the news came out. Even with that drop, it’s still up a little over 11% on the year, outperforming the S&P 500 (SPX) and some of its pharma peers: Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). For Q1, LLY is expected to report earnings of $0.96 per share on revenue of $5.28 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. Earnings per share are expected to increase just over 15% and revenues are expected to increase about 8.5% compared to the same quarter a year ago. The options market has priced in just under a potential 2.5% share price move in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. At the monthly May expiration, short-term options trading for calls has been active at the 87.5 strike price and puts have been active at the 80 and 82.5 strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 15th percentile, much lower than normal. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Earnings: Bring F-35 Costs Down LMT had been in the presidential spotlight lately due to the cost of its F-35 stealth fighter jet program. The company worked with President Trump, who called the jet “overtly expensive”, to reduce expenses and bagged a multi-billion dollar Department of Defense order for 90 of the jets. LMT’s aeronautics division accounted for roughly 40% of its sales in the last quarter.  Heading into earnings, shares are just off their 52-week high of $274.57 hit on March 20. LMT is expected to report earnings of $2.76 per share on revenue of $11.26 billion for the first quarter, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. In the last three quarters, the company has beat earnings expectations by $0.21 to $0.41 per share. The options market has priced in about a potential 2.75% share price move in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. At the monthly May expiration, short-term options trading for calls and puts have been active at 270 strike price. The implied volatility sits at the 48th percentile. Caterpillar Earnings: Turnaround in Global Growth? CAT has been hard hit in recent years by a slowdown in global growth and a major drop in commodity prices. Revenues declined 18% in 2016 and CFRA analysts expect another decrease of 2% in 2017 before returning to 5% growth in 2018. To combat the downturn in certain business segments, management has focused on aggressively cutting costs and restructuring, including laying off 10% of its workforce in 2016. Those restructuring costs are expected to negatively impact EPS by as much as $0.60 in fiscal 2017, bringing the full-year EPS expectation to $2.30 at the midpoint of its sales and revenues outlook, according to last quarter’s earnings press release. Last quarter, the company lowered its top-line guidance for 2017 by $500 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. For the first quarter, CAT is expected to report earnings of $0.62 per share on revenue of $9.36 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. That’s the lowest estimate for earnings and revenues in the past 8 quarters with earnings per share declining about 7.5% and revenue dropping just over 1% compared to Q1 2016. The options market has priced in just over a potential 3.5% share price move in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. Short-term options trading for calls has been active at the 96.5 strike price and puts have been active at the 93 strike—just over and under the stock’s $94.32 Friday close. The implied volatility sits at the 51st percentile. For more earnings coverage, check out what might be expected when McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) report earnings tomorrow. Later in the week, tech titans Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) report after market close on Thursday.

The disease is characterized by disordered and deregulated cellular and stromal explosion along with reduced cell death and growth factor deprivation, and such other factors. At the molecular level, cancer is a genetic disease that develops due to mutation of genes in somatic cells. The phenotype includes genomic instability and chromosomal aneuploidy that allows for acceleration of genetic change. Metastasis of any cell requires immortalization, loss of checkpoint control, deregulation of growth, and survival. Lots of research has been performed to understand cellular and molecular genetic changes and the host-tumor interactions which is responsible for tumor development and progression. It was found that; molecular oncology helped to understand cancer pathogenesis and drug action, as well as helped to develop more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cancer. This includes preventative strategies as well as approaches to treat metastases. With the availability of the human genome sequence and genomic and proteomic approaches, a wealth of tools and resources are generating even more information. The challenge will be to make biological sense out of the information, to develop appropriate models and hypotheses and to translate information for the clinicians and the benefit of their patients.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Bovine Respiratory Disease Treatment Market is Projected to Reach US$1543.9 mn by 2024 thanks to Rising Consumption of Animal Protein Among the Human Population The global market for bovine respiratory disease treatment features a highly consolidated competitive landscape despite the presence of a large number of regional players, observes a recent report by Transparency Market Research. Owing to the small duration of product exclusivity in the animal health care industry – about three to five years – competition from generics and over-the-counter (OTC) products is a big threat. Read the Complete Details for this Market at: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/bovine-respiratory-dis… The rising consumption of bovine products in emerging economies such as India, China, and Brazil, the demand for effective treatment methods for respiratory disease has considerably increased. To exploit the vast growth potential, an increasing number of companies are establishing operations in these countries. A recent example is the 2016 collaboration between Merial and Zoetis, Inc., which is expected to allow the former to effectively market and distribute its product in India. Some of the other key companies in the market are Merck & Co., Inc., Bayer AG, Elanco, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, and Virbac Group. TMR estimates that the global bovine respiratory disease treatment market will exhibit a promising 7.6% CAGR from 2016 through 2024. At this rate, the market, which had a valuation of US$805.9 mn in 2015 is projected to reach US$1,543.9 mn by 2024. Asia Pacific to Lead to Lucrative Growth Opportunities In terms of distribution channel, the segment of veterinary hospitals dominated, accounting for nearly 35% of the global market in terms of revenue in 2015. From a geographic perspective, North America which held nearly 37% of the market in 2015, dominated the global market and is expected to easily retain its dominance over the forecast period as well. However, owing to the rising population of cattle and the rising incidences of bovine respiratory diseases, the Asia Pacific market will emerge as one of the most lucrative regional markets for bovine respiratory disease treatment methods. Rising Consumption of Animal Protein to Remain High-impact Driver Of the key factors driving the market, the rising consumption of beef is expected to have a prominent impact on the overall development of the market over the forecast period. According to a World Bank Group survey (2016), global human population is estimated to be 7.4 billion in 2016 and is growing at a rate of 1.8% per year. To sustain the ever rising demand for beef as well as other animal products from this mounting global population, there would be a vast rise in the world’s cattle population in the near future. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the global cattle population will increase by 73% between 2015 and 2050, from nearly 936 mn in 2015 to nearly 2.6 bn in 2050. As bovine respiratory diseases account for 65% to 80% of morbidity and 45% to 75% mortality rate in livestock animals, the rising cattle population will also intensify the need for effective treatment modalities for these diseases. This will have a significant positive impact on the global bovine respiratory disease treatment market. Strict Government Regulations to Restrain Market Several studies have demonstrated that bovine antibiotics can have a highly negative impact on human health. Issues such as induction of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and disruption of normal human intestinal flora are commonly observed in individuals who consume animal products with excessive amount of antibiotics. According to The New York Times, around 2 million people in the U.S. fall sick every year and about 23,000 of them die from antibiotic-resistant infections induced due to consumption of such products. Perceive the Sample Report containing the Upcoming Opportunities for this Market at: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… These factors have urged government bodies to regulate the use of antibiotic therapeutics in animals too. In December 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforced a new policy related to the limited use of antibiotics in production animals. This is likely to hamper the growth of the bovine respiratory disease treatment market over the forecast period.

provided by MerckManuals.com 24 Apr, 2017, 08:03 ET Share this article KENILWORTH, N.J., April 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Advances in technology allow us to visit friends through a computer screen, order clothing online and have our groceries delivered right to our doorsteps. As a result, we're not moving as much as we used to, and that leads to unintended health consequences. Research has linked a sedentary lifestyle to obesity, which is associated with heart disease, diabetes, cancer and overall mortality. Even those who don't struggle with weight gain can experience cognitive decline, depression and other health risks while living a sedentary lifestyle. Studies show that as little as seven minutes of moderate physical activity a day has been associated with reduced mortality. In order to raise awareness of the simple ways to reverse the effects of a sedentary lifestyle, Dr. Adrienne Youdim, MD FACP, Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine Cedars Sinai Medical Center, offers simple tips to incorporate healthier habits into your day on MerckManuals.com. Those tips include: 1. Use your job as a gym You don't need an expensive gym membership to get moving – simply create small breaks in your day. Set a timer on your phone to get up and move around every hour. Walk up and down a few flights of stairs or take a loop around the parking lot. Many employers have realized the benefits of a healthy workplace. Research shows active employees are more productive and have lower long-term health care costs. Some companies are now investing in standing desks and small cycles that fit under employee's desks. If your company offers this kind of equipment, taking advantage of it is a no-brainer. 2. Wake up 10 minutes earlier If you can't find time for an hour-long workout in your daily routine, create the time by setting your alarm just ten minutes earlier. Give yourself a few minutes of physical activity before your day gets crazy. But don't overlook the importance of sleep. Research points to a close connection between sleep deprivation and obesity and diabetes. Make sure you're getting at least six hours of sleep (many people need more than that). If you're getting up earlier to exercise, hit the pillow a few minutes earlier, too. 3. Pack a lunch If you do one thing to improve your daily health, make it this: pack a lunch. The average restaurant meal contains two-thirds of your daily calorie requirements. Even a salad can be spoiled by high-calorie dressings. Packing a lunch is an easy way to control your calorie intake. While you're at it, use the time you would have spent picking up takeout to go on a 15-minute walk at lunch. One short walk and five-minute breaks every hour add up to almost an hour of additional activity a day. 4. Find your best motivation Most of us are exhausted by the end of the work day. Even if we have the best intentions to exercise when we get home, it's easy to lose motivation the second we walk through the door. The key is to find things that motivate you. If there's a TV show you can't wait to watch, commit to only watching it while running on the treadmill or elliptical. Keep a log of how you feel after every workout, so you'll remember how rejuvenated you feel after some physical activity. If you feed off others' energy, join a group fitness class. 5. Explore an active hobby Being active doesn't have to mean doing jumping jacks or logging hours on an exercise bike. Spending time doing something active you love, such as dancing, gardening, fishing, rock climbing or bowling, can provide tremendous health benefits – and you'll be more likely to stick with it. Once you get started, you'll start forming habits that make it easier and easier to find the time and willpower every day.

The eventual market for the complex disease, formally known as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, is forecast to be $20 billion to $35 billion as populations with fatty diets increasingly fall victim to a condition with no approved treatments. With intense competition and pricing pressure eroding sales of medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other lucrative disease categories, and an already crowded field for developmental cancer drugs, big pharma sees NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making. "We are actively looking on the outside for opportunities... to complement our internal program," Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer for internal medicine for Pfizer, told Reuters. Pfizer currently has three early-stage drugs in the clinic aiming to block or reverse fat accumulation in the liver. "We believe that even though we're a bit behind, we still might come out with the best-in-class molecules," Birnbaum said. Bristol-Myers Squibb also confirmed it is looking for additional assets to enhance its internally-developed NASH drugs. It presented promising data for its lead NASH candidate at the big European liver meeting in Amsterdam that ended on Sunday. "It's early days, but keep your seatbelts fastened," said Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and one of the world's leading liver disease experts. Estimates for the prevalence of NASH in nations with fatty diets range from 5 to 20 percent of the population with up to 15 million potentially affected in the United States alone. Driven by the obesity and diabetes epidemics, the disease guarantees an enormous pool of patients for decades, making it a prime target for deals for promising therapies for NASH and its consequences - advanced fibrosis and liver-destroying cirrhosis. The very early stages of many of the drugs, and the complicated nature of the disease itself, pose risks for drug developers and their investors alike. But the upside potential is still enticing to Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director and senior healthcare analyst at Rodman and Renshaw. He calls NASH one of the hottest spaces in the healthcare sector. "We anticipate that there will be more transactions, more licensing deals from big pharma involving emerging biotechnology companies," he said. GILEAD A PIONEER Just a few years ago, Gilead Sciences was the lone large drugmaker talking about NASH. It was undeterred after its most advanced anti-fibrosis candidate failed, striking deals with two small companies to acquire additional NASH programs. Liver disease experts were impressed last year by Phase II data from a Gilead-developed drug that demonstrated fibrosis regression after just six months. Allergan became a top NASH contender with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics and a deal with private Akarna Therapeutics on the same day last year. Other big drugmakers with licensing deals or options on future deals in the space include Novartis, Merck & Co , Bristol-Myers and Johnson & Johnson. While many of the drugs in development are two-to-five years from reaching the market if they get that far, betting on the feverish deal activity gives investors a chance to profit near term. Many small companies developing drugs with a wide variety of approaches across the disease spectrum do not have partners. They include Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Galectin Therapeutics, Genfit and Galmed Pharmaceuticals, all with a chance to be among the first to market, as well as Enanta Pharmaceuticals , Durect Corp and little-known U.K.-traded Tiziana Life Sciences with assets much earlier in development. Galectin, which expects key data in December, has commenced preliminary partnership discussions, its chief operating officer told Reuters. Len Yaffe, who runs the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund and has long followed the liver disease space, said investors with tolerance for risk could do well to buy shares in several small-cap and micro-cap companies with promising NASH drugs in early development. He said if any one has stellar data, or lands a deal, the payoff could be considerable. When Allergan announced the $1.7 billion deal for Tobira, for example, that company's shares jumped from under $5 to over $30. Yaffe, who had singled out Tobira to investors prior to its acquisition, said the Durect drug "looks incredibly promising as it relates to inflammation and fibrosis." Enanta has the advantage of cash flow from its hepatitis C partnership with AbbVie to fund its NASH program. "You want to bet on companies that can survive even if they don't get a partnership this year or next year," Selvaraju said. Enanta Chief Executive Jay Luly said companies in earlier stages of development may have an advantage over the first wave of experimental treatments as regulators' thinking on clinical trial goals and what makes an approvable product in such a new market evolves. "When we get there, the development pathway could be not only more clearly defined, but more simplified," Luly said. MANY SHOTS ON GOAL Drugmakers are taking a wide range of approaches to treat the complex disease, given multiple health issues among NASH patients that contribute to the liver damage, such as heart disease and diabetes. There are drugs targeting inflammation to prevent or reduce fibrotic scarring. Some address lipid regulation to reduce liver fat, while others attempt to directly halt or reverse fibrosis. And some companies are testing diabetes treatments to assess their ability to also improve NASH. "The big sea change from two years ago - apart from an increased number of players - is a fairly rapid acceptance of the fact that we're going to be seeking combination therapies since it's a disease that involves multiple pathways," said Mt. Sinai's Friedman. "In the end, whatever the mechanism is, it needs to yield decreased fibrosis," he said, noting that progressing fibrosis is what ultimately causes serious health consequences. The knowledge that multiple drugs will be needed for therapeutic combinations to treat NASH, and that most experimental drugs fail, are big drivers for deal activity. Drugmakers are looking to improve chances of success by amassing numerous experimental drugs for their NASH programs. Some experts said drugs that target late-stage fibrosis and cirrhosis, where the risk of cancer and liver failure is highest, are likely to gain earliest acceptance from insurers. That fits the strategy of tiny Conatus Pharmaceuticals , whose shares more than doubled when it signed a $50 million collaboration deal with Novartis. Conatus is targeting end-stage disease with the goal of preventing transplants. But given the millions of potential patients and expense of treating advanced disease, there should be incentive for insurers to embrace medicines that target earlier stage NASH as well. "There's still a major role for drugs that work on the front end," said Dr. Arun Sanyal, a leading liver disease expert whose Virginia Commonwealth University lab discovered the compound being developed by Durect. "One size will not fit all." (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Veterinary Vaccines Market Research Report : : Analysis & Trends 2024 Global Veterinary Vaccines Market: Overview Veterinary vaccines often prove themselves to be live-savers for animals against diseases that are generally fatal or leave them impaired or handicapped. Veterinary vaccines thus offer protection to animals similar to the way humans are vaccinated against potentially incurable diseases. The way veterinary vaccines work may be different than human vaccines however. It is often encouraged for pet owners to vaccinate their pets regularly as it is much cheaper than opting for the treatment of a sick animal. It also helps reduce the transmission of germs and bacteria within animals and thus ensures a healthier environment for all animals and pets in an area. In the case of livestock, vaccination promotes a healthier output and prevents the transmission of harmful microorganisms to humans upon consumption of meat of animal products. The common diseases for which pets and livestock are vaccinated include brucellosis, pinkeye, E. coli, and rotavirus. The report on the global veterinary vaccines market offers a descriptive analysis of the factors that have been – and will be – responsible for the progress rate of the market. These factors are dissected based on the various segments available in the market for study and player diversity. The report uses all current and recent data to effectively pinpoint the situation the global veterinary vaccines market is in currently and what it will look like in the near future. The analysis of the global veterinary vaccines market is performed using tried and tested industry standards such as Porter’s Five Forces analysis and the SWOT analysis. The report also provides a highly in-depth view of the competitive landscape of the global veterinary vaccines market and its predicted future tense. Global Veterinary Vaccines Market: Trends and Opportunities: The primary driver boosting the global veterinary vaccines market is the growing consumption of animal products across the world.

Pat Meehan, R-7th Dist., is leading all Pennsylvania House members for the amount of cash he has in the bank for re-election in 2018. digital first media file photo By Rick Kauffman, rkauffman@21st-centurymedia.com, @Kauffee_DT on Twitter Posted: 04/24/17, 9:35 AM EDT | Updated: 14 hrs ago # Comments Rep. Pat Meehan is leading all Pennsylvania Congressional House members in cash totals, according to the latest campaign fundraising reports. Meehan, a Republican who represents Pennsylvania’s 7th Congressional District, reported $2,049,176.82 cash on hand, which represents about $100,000 he raised in first quarter of 2017. OpenSecrets.org showed Meehan with $1.95 million cash-on-hand at the end of 2016. According to the Federal Election Commission, that puts Meehan at 39th of all congressional incumbents cash-on-hand totals for the 2018 election. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, the top earner among Congressional candidates, has $9.4 million in his war chest. Advertisement Much of Meehan’s cash for his 2018 re-election bid was gathered by decisive victories in 2012 and 2014 where he handily defeated first George Badey, and in the first of two bouts against Mary Ellen Balchunis in 2014. He defeated Badey with 59.4 percent of the vote, and Balchunis with 62 percent of the vote. In the elections in 2014 and 2016 — where Meehan twice defeated Balchunis, the second time by 59.5 percent of the vote — he out-raised the Democratic opponent $4,388,710 to Balchunis’ $295,630. Balchunis in 2016 raised more than twice the amount she raised in 2014 but garnered 2 points less in the polls. Meehan raised more than $200,000 in the final 16 days of the third quarter in 2009, much of which was accrued refunded donations after Meehan’s exploration of a gubernatorial run. Donors simply saw a refund on their initial donation and then reapplied it to Meehan’s congressional run. In his initial House bid, raised his most money to date in an election season, raising $3,031,825 and spending all but $45,112 of it. Between the elections in 2012 and 2014, Meehan pulled in more than $1,625,840, which accounts for much of the cash he has currently has on hand.. Among the top industries that have contributed to Meehan are insurance companies, pharmaceuticals, health professionals and services, HMOs, hospitals and nursing homes through both PACs and individual contributions. Meehan was targeted for criticism after his vote in favor of the Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act. He voted in favor of moving the American Health Care Act out of the House Ways and Means Committee earlier this year. The AHCA bill was pulled before a vote in the full House and Meehan, who had indicated he was undecided in the days leading up to the vote, said he would have voted against it — but only after it was pulled. The health care debate in Washington also registers in campaign donations. Annual lobbying by insurer Blue Cross/Blue Shield has more than doubled since 2007. Contributing to the campaigns of 176 Republicans and 118 Democrats in the U.S. House, BC/BS gave an average donation of $8,095 to GOP candidates. BC/BS contributed to Meehan’s campaign $19,650 in 2016 through PACs and individual contributions, but don’t even represent the top health industry contributor to Meehan’s campaigns. That designation goes to one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, Merck & Co., which contributed $23,710 in 2016. Meehan’s top contributor is the Philadelphia-based Comcast Corp., which gave a total of $41,100. A narrow vote last month negated a Federal Communications Commission’s rule that set limits on how Internet service providers, like Comcast and Verizon, could use consumer’s information on browsing habits, app usage history and location information. Meehan was among the 215-205 to vote in favor of a move to reject the rule limiting an ISP’ss access to user data, which garnered no Democratic votes. That bill is still awaiting the signature of President Donald Trump. Comcast, however, has spread their contributions fairly evenly between parties, with the largest of all contributions going to Hillary Clinton, with nearly a half-a-million-dollar given to her campaign in 2016. Meehan was 12th on the list of recipient totals in 2016. The 7th Congressional District covers most of Delaware County and portions of Montgomery, Chester, Berks and Lancaster counties.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Large drugmakers with piles of cash are on the hunt for promising medicines being developed by small companies to treat NASH, a progressive fatty liver disease poised to become the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020. The eventual market for the complex disease, formally known as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, is forecast to be $20 billion to $35 billion as populations with fatty diets increasingly fall victim to a condition with no approved treatments. With intense competition and pricing pressure eroding sales of medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other lucrative disease categories, and an already crowded field for developmental cancer drugs, big pharma sees NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2pO6kj4 "We are actively looking on the outside for opportunities... to complement our internal program," Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer for internal medicine for Pfizer, told Reuters. Pfizer currently has three early-stage drugs in the clinic aiming to block or reverse fat accumulation in the liver. "We believe that even though we're a bit behind, we still might come out with the best-in-class molecules," Birnbaum said. Bristol-Myers Squibb also confirmed it is looking for additional assets to enhance its internally-developed NASH drugs. It presented promising data for its lead NASH candidate at the big European liver meeting in Amsterdam that ended on Sunday. "It's early days, but keep your seatbelts fastened," said Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and one of the world's leading liver disease experts. Estimates for the prevalence of NASH in nations with fatty diets range from 5 to 20 percent of the population with up to 15 million potentially affected in the United States alone. Driven by the obesity and diabetes epidemics, the disease guarantees an enormous pool of patients for decades, making it a prime target for deals for promising therapies for NASH and its consequences - advanced fibrosis and liver-destroying cirrhosis. The very early stages of many of the drugs, and the complicated nature of the disease itself, pose risks for drug developers and their investors alike. But the upside potential is still enticing to Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director and senior healthcare analyst at Rodman and Renshaw. He calls NASH one of the hottest spaces in the healthcare sector. "We anticipate that there will be more transactions, more licensing deals from big pharma involving emerging biotechnology companies," he said. GILEAD A PIONEER Just a few years ago, Gilead Sciences was the lone large drugmaker talking about NASH. It was undeterred after its most advanced anti-fibrosis candidate failed, striking deals with two small companies to acquire additional NASH programs. Liver disease experts were impressed last year by Phase II data from a Gilead-developed drug that demonstrated fibrosis regression after just six months. Allergan became a top NASH contender with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics and a deal with private Akarna Therapeutics on the same day last year. Other big drugmakers with licensing deals or options on future deals in the space include Novartis, Merck & Co , Bristol-Myers and Johnson & Johnson. While many of the drugs in development are two-to-five years from reaching the market if they get that far, betting on the feverish deal activity gives investors a chance to profit near term. Many small companies developing drugs with a wide variety of approaches across the disease spectrum do not have partners. They include Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Galectin Therapeutics, Genfit and Galmed Pharmaceuticals, all with a chance to be among the first to market, as well as Enanta Pharmaceuticals , Durect Corp and little-known U.K.-traded Tiziana Life Sciences with assets much earlier in development. Galectin, which expects key data in December, has commenced preliminary partnership discussions, its chief operating officer told Reuters. Len Yaffe, who runs the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund and has long followed the liver disease space, said investors with tolerance for risk could do well to buy shares in several small-cap and micro-cap companies with promising NASH drugs in early development. He said if any one has stellar data, or lands a deal, the payoff could be considerable. When Allergan announced the $1.7 billion deal for Tobira, for example, that company's shares jumped from under $5 to over $30. Yaffe, who had singled out Tobira to investors prior to its acquisition, said the Durect drug "looks incredibly promising as it relates to inflammation and fibrosis." Enanta has the advantage of cash flow from its hepatitis C partnership with AbbVie to fund its NASH program. "You want to bet on companies that can survive even if they don't get a partnership this year or next year," Selvaraju said. Enanta Chief Executive Jay Luly said companies in earlier stages of development may have an advantage over the first wave of experimental treatments as regulators' thinking on clinical trial goals and what makes an approvable product in such a new market evolves. "When we get there, the development pathway could be not only more clearly defined, but more simplified," Luly said. MANY SHOTS ON GOAL Drugmakers are taking a wide range of approaches to treat the complex disease, given multiple health issues among NASH patients that contribute to the liver damage, such as heart disease and diabetes. There are drugs targeting inflammation to prevent or reduce fibrotic scarring. Some address lipid regulation to reduce liver fat, while others attempt to directly halt or reverse fibrosis. And some companies are testing diabetes treatments to assess their ability to also improve NASH. "The big sea change from two years ago - apart from an increased number of players - is a fairly rapid acceptance of the fact that we're going to be seeking combination therapies since it's a disease that involves multiple pathways," said Mt. Sinai’s Friedman. "In the end, whatever the mechanism is, it needs to yield decreased fibrosis," he said, noting that progressing fibrosis is what ultimately causes serious health consequences. The knowledge that multiple drugs will be needed for therapeutic combinations to treat NASH, and that most experimental drugs fail, are big drivers for deal activity. Drugmakers are looking to improve chances of success by amassing numerous experimental drugs for their NASH programs. Some experts said drugs that target late-stage fibrosis and cirrhosis, where the risk of cancer and liver failure is highest, are likely to gain earliest acceptance from insurers. That fits the strategy of tiny Conatus Pharmaceuticals , whose shares more than doubled when it signed a $50 million collaboration deal with Novartis. Conatus is targeting end-stage disease with the goal of preventing transplants. But given the millions of potential patients and expense of treating advanced disease, there should be incentive for insurers to embrace medicines that target earlier stage NASH as well. "There's still a major role for drugs that work on the front end," said Dr. Arun Sanyal, a leading liver disease expert whose Virginia Commonwealth University lab discovered the compound being developed by Durect.

the United States - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 24 Apr, 2017, 10:30 ET Share this article DUBLIN, April 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Therapeutics Market 2017-2021" report to their offering. The global hypertrophic cardiomyopathy therapeutics market to grow at a CAGR of 1.80% during the period 2017-2021. The report, Global Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Therapeutics Market 2017-2021, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. According to the report, one driver in market is increasing cases of HF. HCM is an extended form of a diastolic HF when the heart fails to perform its functions normally. The diastolic HF occurs when the lower left chamber or the LV is not filled properly with blood during the diastolic phase. Therefore, the amount of pumped blood is less than the normal. Similarly, in HCM, the increasing myocardium size results in smaller LV cavity size accompanied by impairment of blood flow. This leads to the common symptoms of both HCM and HF such as dyspnoea, angina, palpitations, syncope, and presyncope. Hence, the drug development for relieving the symptoms of HF benefits the global HCM therapeutics market as well. As per the CDC, more than five million people are living with HF in the US, and about half of the affected population succumb within five years of diagnosis. However, the deaths due to HF have significantly declined in the past few years due to improved therapies to treat the disease. However, the risk of developing HF continues to rise with the increasing population. This risk-factor has further triggered R&D for newer drugs, which can be re-purposed for the diagnosis and treatment of HCM.

Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterial pathogen capable of causing severe infections in humans, often with fatal outcomes. According to USFDA, published studies suggest that 1- 8% of humans may be intestinal carriers of Listeria. According to Unites States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Listeria causes about 280 cases of illness in newborns in a typical year, resulting in 60 deaths and stillbirths. Infants can be infected before birth, and this infection can cause serious disability in newborns. About 35 infants are disabled as a result of infection from Listeria each year. The key factors assisting the growth of Listeria monocytogenes infections treatment market are rise in prevalence of foodborne diseases, stringent laws and policies issued by FDA, rising demand for healthy and microbial-free food, and high public awareness related to foodborne diseases in developed countries. Pipeline Analysis The phase III drugs included in the pipeline analysis are Carbavance (The Medicines Company), Telavancin (Theravance Biopharma Antibiotics, Inc.), Daptomycin (Merck & Co.), Prulifloxacin (Merck & Co.), and DTaP-IPV/Hib combined vaccine (Sanofi S.A.). According to market experts, the diversity of the several molecule types in the biologic group shows a certain level of innovation, with newer avenues being explored in accounts of recent failures. Overall, late stage clinical trials have highlighted very few molecules that could potentially replace current treatments during the forecast period. Key Market Movements Rising prevalence of foodborne infections in developed and developing countries The incidence and prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes infections is high in pediatric and geriatric population Stringent regulatory policies applied by FDA and other government agencies across the world is expected to reduce the risk of infection outbreak Novel and developed treatments in pipeline are expected to assist the overall market growth of Listeria monocytogenes infections treatment market Browse the full report Listeria monocytogenes Infections Treatment Market – Growth, Share, Opportunities, Competitive Analysis, and Forecast, 2016 – 2022 at http://www.credenceresearch.com/report/listeria-monocytogenes-infections-treatment-market About Us: Credence Research is a worldwide market research and counseling firm that serves driving organizations, governments, non-legislative associations, and not-for-benefits.

Research Pvt. Ltd. 24 Apr, 2017, 08:30 ET Share this article NEW YORK, April 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Owing to higher efficiency as compared to conventional therapies such as radiation, chemo and surgery, doctors around the globe are increasingly prescribing immunotherapy to cancer patients. Immuno-oncology therapies have low toxicity, making it easier for the patients to undergo such treatment procedures. Increasing clinical approval of immunotherapy drugs continues to support speedy adoption of immuno-oncology treatments while higher investments to further improve immunotherapies is anticipated to create greater market opportunities for drug makers. Persistence Market Research (PMR) is its latest report (Global Market Study on Immuno-Oncology: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Segment Projected to be the Most Lucrative Segment by Therapy Type) projects that the global market for immune-oncology is set to witness a CAGR of 16.5% between 2016 and 2025, to reach a valuation of US$ 27,846.3 Mn by the end of the forecast period.      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161114/438683LOGO ) Collaborative efforts and initiatives to identify therapies for difficult-to-treat illnesses is a key factor driving the overall immune-oncology market. However, high drug pricing, development costs and limited technical expertise are some of the challenges likely to dampen the surging spirit of the market over 2025. Demand for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors to Remain Robust  Currently, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is widely used for treating several carcinogenic disorders. Immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs help the body fight against certain proteins that are normally used by various tumors to suppress immune responses. Sales revenue from immune checkpoint inhibitors drugs is anticipated to reach US$ 7,321.7 Mn by 2017-end. Of late, a number immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs have been approved by the US FDA including Yervoy (anti-CTLA-4), Opdivo and Keytruda (anti-PD1) and Tecentriq (anti-PD-L1). Demand for these drugs is expected to further gain traction, owing to a significant investment by biopharmaceutical companies in developing a robust pipeline. Meanwhile, immune system modulator is the second most preferred immune-oncology therapy and is expected to create an incremental opportunity of US$ 659.9 Mn between 2017 and 2025. Two major approved drugs that fall in this category include interferons and interleukins. A sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/11329 Based on therapeutic area, demand for immune-oncology therapeutics for melanoma will remain high throughout the forecast period. By end user, hospitals account for the largest revenue share of the market and are expected to represent around US$ 5,557.1 Mn by 2017-end. Amongst regions, the immuno-oncology market in North America accounted for a revenue share of around 67.1% in 2016. The region's market is expected to witness a strong CAGR of 17.1% during the assessment period and retain its top position. In terms of revenue, the US dominates the North America immuno-oncology market and is projected to continue to do so in 2017 and beyond owing to the presence of prominent drug manufacturing companies in the country.

A researcher in a file photo. REUTERS/File 24 Apr 2017 08:15PM (Updated: 25 Apr 2017 02:05AM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail REUTERS: Large drugmakers with piles of cash are on the hunt for promising medicines being developed by small companies to treat NASH, a progressive fatty liver disease poised to become the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020. The eventual market for the complex disease, formally known as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, is forecast to be US$20 billion to US$35 billion as populations with fatty diets increasingly fall victim to a condition with no approved treatments. (Graphic: The growing threat of NASH drives deals http://tmsnrt.rs/2pO6kj4) With intense competition and pricing pressure eroding sales of medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other lucrative disease categories, and an already crowded field for developmental cancer drugs, big pharma sees NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2pO6kj4 "We are actively looking on the outside for opportunities... to complement our internal program," Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer for internal medicine for Pfizer , told Reuters. Pfizer currently has three early-stage drugs in the clinic aiming to block or reverse fat accumulation in the liver. "We believe that even though we're a bit behind, we still might come out with the best-in-class molecules," Birnbaum said. Advertisement Bristol-Myers Squibb also confirmed it is looking for additional assets to enhance its internally-developed NASH drugs. It presented promising data for its lead NASH candidate at the big European liver meeting in Amsterdam that ended on Sunday. "It's early days, but keep your seatbelts fastened," said Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and one of the world's leading liver disease experts. Estimates for the prevalence of NASH in nations with fatty diets range from 5 to 20 percent of the population with up to 15 million potentially affected in the United States alone. Driven by the obesity and diabetes epidemics, the disease guarantees an enormous pool of patients for decades, making it a prime target for deals for promising therapies for NASH and its consequences - advanced fibrosis and liver-destroying cirrhosis. The very early stages of many of the drugs, and the complicated nature of the disease itself, pose risks for drug developers and their investors alike. But the upside potential is still enticing to Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director and senior healthcare analyst at Rodman and Renshaw. He calls NASH one of the hottest spaces in the healthcare sector. "We anticipate that there will be more transactions, more licensing deals from big pharma involving emerging biotechnology companies," he said. GILEAD A PIONEER Just a few years ago, Gilead Sciences was the lone large drugmaker talking about NASH. It was undeterred after its most advanced anti-fibrosis candidate failed, striking deals with two small companies to acquire additional NASH programs. Liver disease experts were impressed last year by Phase II data from a Gilead-developed drug that demonstrated fibrosis regression after just six months. Allergan became a top NASH contender with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics and a deal with private Akarna Therapeutics on the same day last year. Other big drugmakers with licensing deals or options on future deals in the space include Novartis , Merck & Co , Bristol-Myers and Johnson & Johnson . While many of the drugs in development are two-to-five years from reaching the market if they get that far, betting on the feverish deal activity gives investors a chance to profit near term. Many small companies developing drugs with a wide variety of approaches across the disease spectrum do not have partners. They include Intercept Pharmaceuticals , Galectin Therapeutics , Genfit and Galmed Pharmaceuticals , all with a chance to be among the first to market, as well as Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Durect Corp and little-known U.K.-tradedTiziana Life Sciences with assets much earlier in development. Galectin, which expects key data in December, has commenced preliminary partnership discussions, its chief operating officer told Reuters. Len Yaffe, who runs the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund and has long followed the liver disease space, said investors with tolerance for risk could do well to buy shares in several small-cap and micro-cap companies with promising NASH drugs in early development. He said if any one has stellar data, or lands a deal, the payoff could be considerable. When Allergan announced the US$1.7 billion deal for Tobira, for example, that company's shares jumped from under US$5 to over US$30. Yaffe, who had singled out Tobira to investors prior to its acquisition, said the Durect drug "looks incredibly promising as it relates to inflammation and fibrosis." Enanta has the advantage of cash flow from its hepatitis C partnership with AbbVie to fund its NASH program. "You want to bet on companies that can survive even if they don't get a partnership this year or next year," Selvaraju said. Enanta Chief Executive Jay Luly said companies in earlier stages of development may have an advantage over the first wave of experimental treatments as regulators' thinking on clinical trial goals and what makes an approvable product in such a new market evolves. "When we get there, the development pathway could be not only more clearly defined, but more simplified," Luly said. MANY SHOTS ON GOAL Drugmakers are taking a wide range of approaches to treat the complex disease, given multiple health issues among NASH patients that contribute to the liver damage, such as heart disease and diabetes. There are drugs targeting inflammation to prevent or reduce fibrotic scarring. Some address lipid regulation to reduce liver fat, while others attempt to directly halt or reverse fibrosis. And some companies are testing diabetes treatments to assess their ability to also improve NASH. "The big sea change from two years ago - apart from an increased number of players - is a fairly rapid acceptance of the fact that we're going to be seeking combination therapies since it's a disease that involves multiple pathways," said Mt. Sinai’s Friedman. "In the end, whatever the mechanism is, it needs to yield decreased fibrosis," he said, noting that progressing fibrosis is what ultimately causes serious health consequences. The knowledge that multiple drugs will be needed for therapeutic combinations to treat NASH, and that most experimental drugs fail, are big drivers for deal activity. Drugmakers are looking to improve chances of success by amassing numerous experimental drugs for their NASH programs. Some experts said drugs that target late-stage fibrosis and cirrhosis, where the risk of cancer and liver failure is highest, are likely to gain earliest acceptance from insurers. That fits the strategy of tiny Conatus Pharmaceuticals , whose shares more than doubled when it signed a US$50 million collaboration deal with Novartis. Conatus is targeting end-stage disease with the goal of preventing transplants. But given the millions of potential patients and expense of treating advanced disease, there should be incentive for insurers to embrace medicines that target earlier stage NASH as well. "There's still a major role for drugs that work on the front end," said Dr. Arun Sanyal, a leading liver disease expert whose Virginia Commonwealth University lab discovered the compound being developed by Durect. "One size will not fit all."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Antibacterial Drugs Market will rise to US$ 38.9 Billion by 2023 Antibacterial Drugs Market Transparency Market Research, in its latest report titled “Antibacterial Drugs Market – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2015 – 2023”, reveals that the global antibacterial drugs market is forecast to witness a rather slow growth from 2015 to 2023 owing to patent expiries of blockbuster drugs. Even though the market will register a meager CAGR of 1.30% during the forecast period, the value is anticipated to decline from US$43.9 bn in 2014 to US$38.9 bn in 2023. Read Full Report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antibacterial-drugs-ma… High prevalence of infectious diseases, government support and increased research and development activities, and product differentiation through various methods drive the antibacterial drugs market. However, rise in drug-resistant species, launch of generics, and upcoming patent expirations are anticipated to restrict the growth of the global market through 2023.The report offers a pipeline analysis of some of the key antibacterial drugs such as Zempia, Actoxumab/Aezlotoxumab, RHB-105, SYM-1219, Ozenoxacin, SPL7013, Cadazolid, Arikace, Surotomycin, Eravacycline, Carbavance, Delamanid, Omadacycline, Solithromycin, Ciprofloxacin/Fluocinolone Acetonide, Delafloxacin, and Plazomycin. Based on drug class, the antibacterial drugs market is categorized into B-lactams, sulfonamides, macrolides, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, quinolones/fluoroquinolones, phenicols, and miscellaneous antibacterials. Accounting for a share of 57.70% in the overall antibacterial drugs market in 2014, B-lactams dominated the scene. However, this drug class is anticipated to witness a drop in market share by 2023. The miscellaneous antibacterials category, on the other hand, is projected to develop at the highest growth rate from 2015 to 2023. Download exclusive Sample of this report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Geographically, the global antibacterial drugs market is segmented into North America, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Europe, and Rest of the World. Asia Pacific presently dominates the overall market and is also projected to witness the fastest growth over the duration of the forecast period.

NASH - a progressive form of liver disease characterised by the accumulation of fatty deposits and fibrosis (scarring) - is predicted to overtake viral hepatitis and alcoholism as the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020, and affects millions of people around the world causing cirrhosis and liver cancer in some patients. With no approved therapies, pharma companies are developing dozens of drugs to try to tap into what some analysts predict could progress into a $35bn market in the coming years, and there has been a deal frenzy with bigger companies napping up promising assets from smaller players. Now BMS' ambitions in this endeavour have been boosted by a positive phase II trial for BMS-986036, a pegylated (long-acting) formulation of human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in patients with NASH. 16-week data from the 74-patient study reported at the International Liver Congress (ILC) in Amsterdam, show that BMS' drug was able to achieve a significant reduction in liver fat compared to placebo, and there were also improvements in serum biomarkers for liver fibrosis and injury, as well as liver stiffness which is another surrogate marker for scarring. For good measure the drug treatment also seemed to improved patients' blood lipid profiles, with triglycerides, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol all shifting in the desired direction. Previously, BMS reported phase II data for BMS-986036 in diabetic patients, and with two positive trials in hand the company says it is "looking forward to sharing these data with health authorities to determine next steps for further study of this asset". Other companies reported positive results from NASH trials at the ILC meeting, including Merck & Co-backed NGM Bio which reported phase II data on FGF19 candidate NGM282, and Gilead Sciences which presented the first clinical data on ACC inhibitor GS-0976. These earlier-phase candidates are chasing drugs in the latter stages of development including Gilead's ASK1 inhibitor selonsertib, Allergan's recently-acquired CCR2/CCR5 inhibitor cenicriviroc, Genfit's PPAR agonist elafibranor and Intercept's Ocaliva (obeticholic acid), which is already on the market for another indication (primary biliary cholangitis).

The eventual market for the complex disease, formally known as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, is forecast to be $20 billion to $35 billion as populations with fatty diets increasingly fall victim to a condition with no approved treatments. With intense competition and pricing pressure eroding sales of medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other lucrative disease categories, and an already crowded field for developmental cancer drugs, big pharma sees NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making. "We are actively looking on the outside for opportunities... to complement our internal program," Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer for internal medicine for Pfizer, told Reuters. Pfizer currently has three early-stage drugs in the clinic aiming to block or reverse fat accumulation in the liver. "We believe that even though we're a bit behind, we still might come out with the best-in-class molecules," Birnbaum said. Bristol-Myers Squibb also confirmed it is looking for additional assets to enhance its internally-developed NASH drugs. It presented promising data for its lead NASH candidate at the big European liver meeting in Amsterdam that ended on Sunday. "It's early days, but keep your seatbelts fastened," said Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and one of the world's leading liver disease experts. Estimates for the prevalence of NASH in nations with fatty diets range from 5 to 20 percent of the population with up to 15 million potentially affected in the United States alone. Driven by the obesity and diabetes epidemics, the disease guarantees an enormous pool of patients for decades, making it a prime target for deals for promising therapies for NASH and its consequences - advanced fibrosis and liver-destroying cirrhosis. The very early stages of many of the drugs, and the complicated nature of the disease itself, pose risks for drug developers and their investors alike. But the upside potential is still enticing to Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director and senior healthcare analyst at Rodman and Renshaw. He calls NASH one of the hottest spaces in the healthcare sector. "We anticipate that there will be more transactions, more licensing deals from big pharma involving emerging biotechnology companies," he said. GILEAD A PIONEER Just a few years ago, Gilead Sciences was the lone large drugmaker talking about NASH. It was undeterred after its most advanced anti-fibrosis candidate failed, striking deals with two small companies to acquire additional NASH programs. Liver disease experts were impressed last year by Phase II data from a Gilead-developed drug that demonstrated fibrosis regression after just six months. Allergan became a top NASH contender with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics and a deal with private Akarna Therapeutics on the same day last year. Other big drugmakers with licensing deals or options on future deals in the space include Novartis, Merck &amp; Co , Bristol-Myers and Johnson &amp; Johnson. While many of the drugs in development are two-to-five years from reaching the market if they get that far, betting on the feverish deal activity gives investors a chance to profit near term. Many small companies developing drugs with a wide variety of approaches across the disease spectrum do not have partners. They include Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Galectin Therapeutics, Genfit and Galmed Pharmaceuticals, all with a chance to be among the first to market, as well as Enanta Pharmaceuticals , Durect Corp and little-known U.K.-traded Tiziana Life Sciences with assets much earlier in development. Galectin, which expects key data in December, has commenced preliminary partnership discussions, its chief operating officer told Reuters. Len Yaffe, who runs the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund and has long followed the liver disease space, said investors with tolerance for risk could do well to buy shares in several small-cap and micro-cap companies with promising NASH drugs in early development. He said if any one has stellar data, or lands a deal, the payoff could be considerable. When Allergan announced the $1.7 billion deal for Tobira, for example, that company's shares jumped from under $5 to over $30. Yaffe, who had singled out Tobira to investors prior to its acquisition, said the Durect drug "looks incredibly promising as it relates to inflammation and fibrosis." Enanta has the advantage of cash flow from its hepatitis C partnership with AbbVie to fund its NASH program. "You want to bet on companies that can survive even if they don't get a partnership this year or next year," Selvaraju said. Enanta Chief Executive Jay Luly said companies in earlier stages of development may have an advantage over the first wave of experimental treatments as regulators' thinking on clinical trial goals and what makes an approvable product in such a new market evolves. "When we get there, the development pathway could be not only more clearly defined, but more simplified," Luly said. MANY SHOTS ON GOAL Drugmakers are taking a wide range of approaches to treat the complex disease, given multiple health issues among NASH patients that contribute to the liver damage, such as heart disease and diabetes. There are drugs targeting inflammation to prevent or reduce fibrotic scarring. Some address lipid regulation to reduce liver fat, while others attempt to directly halt or reverse fibrosis. And some companies are testing diabetes treatments to assess their ability to also improve NASH. "The big sea change from two years ago - apart from an increased number of players - is a fairly rapid acceptance of the fact that we're going to be seeking combination therapies since it's a disease that involves multiple pathways," said Mt. Sinai´s Friedman. "In the end, whatever the mechanism is, it needs to yield decreased fibrosis," he said, noting that progressing fibrosis is what ultimately causes serious health consequences. The knowledge that multiple drugs will be needed for therapeutic combinations to treat NASH, and that most experimental drugs fail, are big drivers for deal activity. Drugmakers are looking to improve chances of success by amassing numerous experimental drugs for their NASH programs. Some experts said drugs that target late-stage fibrosis and cirrhosis, where the risk of cancer and liver failure is highest, are likely to gain earliest acceptance from insurers. That fits the strategy of tiny Conatus Pharmaceuticals , whose shares more than doubled when it signed a $50 million collaboration deal with Novartis. Conatus is targeting end-stage disease with the goal of preventing transplants. But given the millions of potential patients and expense of treating advanced disease, there should be incentive for insurers to embrace medicines that target earlier stage NASH as well. "There's still a major role for drugs that work on the front end," said Dr. Arun Sanyal, a leading liver disease expert whose Virginia Commonwealth University lab discovered the compound being developed by Durect. "One size will not fit all." (Editing by Edward Tobin) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

FMD is a severe and contagious viral disease found in cloven-hoofed animals. FMD virus leads to illness in cows, sheep, pigs, goats, deer, and other animals with divided hooves. Animals with FMD will have fever and blisters on the tongue, lips, mammary glands, in and around the mouth, and around the hooves. These blisters pop and turn into red areas called erosions. These blisters cause pain and discomfort and will lead to other symptoms such as depression, excessive salivation, anorexia, lameness, and resistance to moving or stand. The disease weakens the animals and will affect the production of meat and milk.

Since our company was established five years ago, we have strived day in and day out to realize the promise of biosimilars for patients across the United States by offering them treatment options at a lower cost, CEO Christopher Hansung Ko said.Merck Co. vs J JThe product is a biosimilar version of J J subsidiary Janssen’s monoclonal antibody Remicade, which clocked in sales of $4.8bn in the US last year.However, the product is facing competition from Pfizer/Celltrion’s biosimilar Inflectra which gained FDA approval last April and launched on the market in November. But in the first quarter 2017, J J saw little impact from Inflectra’s presence, according to CEO Dominic Caruso during a conference call last week.“Of course, it’s early because the product [Inflectra] just launched at the end of last year,” he told investors. “As you know there is no interchangeability, so we certainly don’t expect that decisions will switch patients, they may start new patients on therapy.

X Irish medtech firm Diaceutics signs major deal with US lab Dundalk-based firm agrees five-year, multi-million euro agreement with BioReference Mon, Apr 24, 2017, 06:30 Charlie Taylor Diaceutics chief executive Peter Keeling. The firm’s deal with Jersey-headquartered BioReference Laboratories is estimated to be worth between €5 million and €10 million         Dundalk-based medtech firm Diaceutics has signed a multimillion euro deal with the third-largest full service clinical diagnostic laboratory in the United States to acquire data that will help pharmaceutical companies roll out new drugs. New Jersey-headquartered BioReference Laboratories, which has an international presence in more than 50 countries, is to supply the Irish data insights and solutions company with testing data from some 300,000 healthcare providers that have access to more than 50,000 patient samples per day. Industry insiders estimate the deal is worth between €5 million and €10 million. The partnership is expected to help improve patient testing by ensuring that pharmaceutical companies better understand the testing patterns of physicians considering precision medicine therapies for patients. Austrian biopharma group to move holding company to Dublin Limerick medtech company signs €1.1m deal to supply devices in Oman Cardinal Health to buy Medtronic units for $6.1bn Diaceutics, which works with pharmaceutical firms on diagnostic testing and data analytics that brings more personalised medicine to patients, estimates that companies are missing out on more than 20 per cent of cancer patients every year in the US due to the challenging testing landscape. Revenues jump The company, which has seen revenues jump 60 per cent each year over the past three years, expects the market for its services, which helps companies better understand testing for biomarkers and specific illnesses, will be worth €4 billion by 2020. The company has seen its revenue surge 60 per cent per year over the past three years. It has helped put in place structures that gave 48,000 cancer patients in the EU and US access to biomarker testing to ensure they have access to the right drugs. The firm predicts 70 per cent of new cancer drug launches will be diagnostic-dependent within the next five years. “Diagnostic data from laboratories like BioReference helps pharmaceutical companies better understand the testing journey that patients go on in the often difficult search for a targeted therapy. That information allows pharma to pinpoint patients that need to be on a specific – and often life-changing – drug, accelerate speed to market for new drugs and improve patient outcomes,” said chief executive Peter Keeling. Diaceutics, which recently announced plans to grow its workforce to 100 by the end of 2018, has a client list that includes Roche, Novartis, Amgen, Bristol Myers-Squibb, Pfizer, Merck, Takeda and AstraZenecca. “We have seen first-hand the improved decision-making by our pharma clients when presented with the relevant data trends in specific disease areas. Enriching our real time and retrospective analytics with BioReference’s knowledge base allows us to further map the diagnostic journey of patients and help pharmaceutical companies better understand how testing impacts precision prescribing. With this information, we can simply enable better decision making and investment in patient, physician and laboratory education,” he added.       Topics: Peter Keeling Eu BioReference Laboratories Amgen Astrazenecca Bristol-Myers Squibb Diaceutics Merck Novartis Pfizer Roche Takeda United States  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Energy & Resources Tullow Oil gets 95.3% backing for $750m share sale Work Strategies so you are not adding to unnecessary workplace stress Rugby Gerry Thornley: Leinster look closer to the mountain top Parenting Are children today getting enough ‘me’ time?

The eventual market for the complex disease, formally known as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, is forecast to be $20 billion to $35 billion as populations with fatty diets increasingly fall victim to a condition with no approved treatments. With intense competition and pricing pressure eroding sales of medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other lucrative disease categories, and an already crowded field for developmental cancer drugs, big pharma sees NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making. "We are actively looking on the outside for opportunities... to complement our internal program," Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer for internal medicine for Pfizer, told Reuters. Pfizer currently has three early-stage drugs in the clinic aiming to block or reverse fat accumulation in the liver. "We believe that even though we're a bit behind, we still might come out with the best-in-class molecules," Birnbaum said. Bristol-Myers Squibb also confirmed it is looking for additional assets to enhance its internally-developed NASH drugs. It presented promising data for its lead NASH candidate at the big European liver meeting in Amsterdam that ended on Sunday. "It's early days, but keep your seatbelts fastened," said Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and one of the world's leading liver disease experts. Estimates for the prevalence of NASH in nations with fatty diets range from 5 to 20 percent of the population with up to 15 million potentially affected in the United States alone. Driven by the obesity and diabetes epidemics, the disease guarantees an enormous pool of patients for decades, making it a prime target for deals for promising therapies for NASH and its consequences - advanced fibrosis and liver-destroying cirrhosis. The very early stages of many of the drugs, and the complicated nature of the disease itself, pose risks for drug developers and their investors alike. But the upside potential is still enticing to Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director and senior healthcare analyst at Rodman and Renshaw. He calls NASH one of the hottest spaces in the healthcare sector. "We anticipate that there will be more transactions, more licensing deals from big pharma involving emerging biotechnology companies," he said. GILEAD A PIONEER Just a few years ago, Gilead Sciences was the lone large drugmaker talking about NASH. It was undeterred after its most advanced anti-fibrosis candidate failed, striking deals with two small companies to acquire additional NASH programs. Liver disease experts were impressed last year by Phase II data from a Gilead-developed drug that demonstrated fibrosis regression after just six months. Allergan became a top NASH contender with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics and a deal with private Akarna Therapeutics on the same day last year. Other big drugmakers with licensing deals or options on future deals in the space include Novartis, Merck & Co , Bristol-Myers and Johnson & Johnson. While many of the drugs in development are two-to-five years from reaching the market if they get that far, betting on the feverish deal activity gives investors a chance to profit near term. Many small companies developing drugs with a wide variety of approaches across the disease spectrum do not have partners. They include Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Galectin Therapeutics, Genfit and Galmed Pharmaceuticals, all with a chance to be among the first to market, as well as Enanta Pharmaceuticals , Durect Corp and little-known U.K.-traded Tiziana Life Sciences with assets much earlier in development. Galectin, which expects key data in December, has commenced preliminary partnership discussions, its chief operating officer told Reuters. Len Yaffe, who runs the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund and has long followed the liver disease space, said investors with tolerance for risk could do well to buy shares in several small-cap and micro-cap companies with promising NASH drugs in early development. He said if any one has stellar data, or lands a deal, the payoff could be considerable. When Allergan announced the $1.7 billion deal for Tobira, for example, that company's shares jumped from under $5 to over $30. Yaffe, who had singled out Tobira to investors prior to its acquisition, said the Durect drug "looks incredibly promising as it relates to inflammation and fibrosis." Enanta has the advantage of cash flow from its hepatitis C partnership with AbbVie to fund its NASH program. "You want to bet on companies that can survive even if they don't get a partnership this year or next year," Selvaraju said. Enanta Chief Executive Jay Luly said companies in earlier stages of development may have an advantage over the first wave of experimental treatments as regulators' thinking on clinical trial goals and what makes an approvable product in such a new market evolves. "When we get there, the development pathway could be not only more clearly defined, but more simplified," Luly said. MANY SHOTS ON GOAL Drugmakers are taking a wide range of approaches to treat the complex disease, given multiple health issues among NASH patients that contribute to the liver damage, such as heart disease and diabetes. There are drugs targeting inflammation to prevent or reduce fibrotic scarring. Some address lipid regulation to reduce liver fat, while others attempt to directly halt or reverse fibrosis. And some companies are testing diabetes treatments to assess their ability to also improve NASH. "The big sea change from two years ago - apart from an increased number of players - is a fairly rapid acceptance of the fact that we're going to be seeking combination therapies since it's a disease that involves multiple pathways," said Mt. Sinai’s Friedman. "In the end, whatever the mechanism is, it needs to yield decreased fibrosis," he said, noting that progressing fibrosis is what ultimately causes serious health consequences. The knowledge that multiple drugs will be needed for therapeutic combinations to treat NASH, and that most experimental drugs fail, are big drivers for deal activity. Drugmakers are looking to improve chances of success by amassing numerous experimental drugs for their NASH programs. Some experts said drugs that target late-stage fibrosis and cirrhosis, where the risk of cancer and liver failure is highest, are likely to gain earliest acceptance from insurers. That fits the strategy of tiny Conatus Pharmaceuticals , whose shares more than doubled when it signed a $50 million collaboration deal with Novartis. Conatus is targeting end-stage disease with the goal of preventing transplants. But given the millions of potential patients and expense of treating advanced disease, there should be incentive for insurers to embrace medicines that target earlier stage NASH as well. "There's still a major role for drugs that work on the front end," said Dr. Arun Sanyal, a leading liver disease expert whose Virginia Commonwealth University lab discovered the compound being developed by Durect. "One size will not fit all."

The eventual market for the complex disease, formally known as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, is forecast to be $20 billion to $35 billion as populations with fatty diets increasingly fall victim to a condition with no approved treatments. With intense competition and pricing pressure eroding sales of medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other lucrative disease categories, and an already crowded field for developmental cancer drugs, big pharma sees NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making. "We are actively looking on the outside for opportunities... to complement our internal program," Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer for internal medicine for Pfizer, told Reuters. Pfizer currently has three early-stage drugs in the clinic aiming to block or reverse fat accumulation in the liver. "We believe that even though we're a bit behind, we still might come out with the best-in-class molecules," Birnbaum said. Bristol-Myers Squibb also confirmed it is looking for additional assets to enhance its internally-developed NASH drugs. It presented promising data for its lead NASH candidate at the big European liver meeting in Amsterdam that ended on Sunday. "It's early days, but keep your seatbelts fastened," said Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and one of the world's leading liver disease experts. Estimates for the prevalence of NASH in nations with fatty diets range from 5 to 20 percent of the population with up to 15 million potentially affected in the United States alone. Driven by the obesity and diabetes epidemics, the disease guarantees an enormous pool of patients for decades, making it a prime target for deals for promising therapies for NASH and its consequences - advanced fibrosis and liver-destroying cirrhosis. The very early stages of many of the drugs, and the complicated nature of the disease itself, pose risks for drug developers and their investors alike. But the upside potential is still enticing to Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director and senior healthcare analyst at Rodman and Renshaw. He calls NASH one of the hottest spaces in the healthcare sector. "We anticipate that there will be more transactions, more licensing deals from big pharma involving emerging biotechnology companies," he said. GILEAD A PIONEER Just a few years ago, Gilead Sciences was the lone large drugmaker talking about NASH. It was undeterred after its most advanced anti-fibrosis candidate failed, striking deals with two small companies to acquire additional NASH programs. Liver disease experts were impressed last year by Phase II data from a Gilead-developed drug that demonstrated fibrosis regression after just six months. Allergan became a top NASH contender with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics and a deal with private Akarna Therapeutics on the same day last year. Other big drugmakers with licensing deals or options on future deals in the space include Novartis, Merck &amp; Co , Bristol-Myers and Johnson &amp; Johnson. While many of the drugs in development are two-to-five years from reaching the market if they get that far, betting on the feverish deal activity gives investors a chance to profit near term. Many small companies developing drugs with a wide variety of approaches across the disease spectrum do not have partners. They include Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Galectin Therapeutics, Genfit and Galmed Pharmaceuticals, all with a chance to be among the first to market, as well as Enanta Pharmaceuticals , Durect Corp and little-known U.K.-traded Tiziana Life Sciences with assets much earlier in development. Galectin, which expects key data in December, has commenced preliminary partnership discussions, its chief operating officer told Reuters. Len Yaffe, who runs the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund and has long followed the liver disease space, said investors with tolerance for risk could do well to buy shares in several small-cap and micro-cap companies with promising NASH drugs in early development. He said if any one has stellar data, or lands a deal, the payoff could be considerable. When Allergan announced the $1.7 billion deal for Tobira, for example, that company's shares jumped from under $5 to over $30. Yaffe, who had singled out Tobira to investors prior to its acquisition, said the Durect drug "looks incredibly promising as it relates to inflammation and fibrosis." Enanta has the advantage of cash flow from its hepatitis C partnership with AbbVie to fund its NASH program. "You want to bet on companies that can survive even if they don't get a partnership this year or next year," Selvaraju said. Enanta Chief Executive Jay Luly said companies in earlier stages of development may have an advantage over the first wave of experimental treatments as regulators' thinking on clinical trial goals and what makes an approvable product in such a new market evolves. "When we get there, the development pathway could be not only more clearly defined, but more simplified," Luly said. MANY SHOTS ON GOAL Drugmakers are taking a wide range of approaches to treat the complex disease, given multiple health issues among NASH patients that contribute to the liver damage, such as heart disease and diabetes. There are drugs targeting inflammation to prevent or reduce fibrotic scarring. Some address lipid regulation to reduce liver fat, while others attempt to directly halt or reverse fibrosis. And some companies are testing diabetes treatments to assess their ability to also improve NASH. "The big sea change from two years ago - apart from an increased number of players - is a fairly rapid acceptance of the fact that we're going to be seeking combination therapies since it's a disease that involves multiple pathways," said Mt. Sinai´s Friedman. "In the end, whatever the mechanism is, it needs to yield decreased fibrosis," he said, noting that progressing fibrosis is what ultimately causes serious health consequences. The knowledge that multiple drugs will be needed for therapeutic combinations to treat NASH, and that most experimental drugs fail, are big drivers for deal activity.

Kikuo Johnson Rewriting Life Immunotherapy Pioneer James Allison Has Unfinished Business with Cancer Why do most patients fail to respond to the newest cures? by Adam Piore April 24, 2017 On the day I arrive at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to meet James Allison and his longtime collaborator Padmanee Sharma, they are nowhere to be found. The previous day, one of their colleagues informs me, Allison was summoned up on stage by Willie Nelson, in front of 60,000 people at a rock festival in Austin, to deliver a harmonica solo. They are still on their way back. By now, Allison is almost used to adulation. There are even murmurings that his work in cancer immunotherapy might win him the Nobel Prize. Twenty years ago, he was the first to show it’s possible to turbocharge the body’s response to cancer with a drug that releases the immune system so that it destroys tumors on its own. The drug he identified to do that, called Yervoy, went on sale in 2011 to treat metastatic skin cancer. In lucky patients, it causes otherwise fatal tumors to melt away. By last year, worldwide sales of Yervoy and two newer drugs had reached $6 billion a year, and the medications had been given to more than 100,000 people. This transformative new class of immunotherapy agents, known as checkpoint inhibitors, is acknowledged to be the most important advance against cancer since chemotherapy. This story is part of our May/June 2017 Issue See the rest of the issue Subscribe Allison, who is 68, is an unimposing man, with a slight Texas drawl and a stringy mane of white hair. He still finds it hard not to cry when he meets cancer survivors saved by his discovery. But I had gone to talk to him about unfinished business. That is because for every miracle cure, for every Jimmy Carter or 22-year-old melanoma patient pulled back from death, there are many more people who, for reasons that no one understands, can’t be saved. Of all patients dying from all types of cancer in America this year, only one in 12 would be expected to benefit from any immunotherapy drug. Some even argue that direct-to-consumer marketing, including a Super Bowl ad, has created dangerous expectations. Patients cashing in their last chance will, more likely than not, find themselves among the large majority for whom drugs like Allison’s don’t yet work. Allison has known about the shortcomings longer than anyone. He says they dampen any sense of triumph and shadow him at award banquets. Sometimes, he stays awake at night. “About 22 percent of melanoma patients that get a single round of treatment with Yervoy are alive 10 years later,” he said after receiving a Lasker Award in 2015, and then added solemnly: “We got to get that up, and we got to do it in more kinds of cancer.” James Allison with his wife and scientific partner, Padmanee Sharma. At MD Anderson I was introduced to what Allison calls the “platform.” It is a large-scale effort to determine why the immune system at times acts like the perfect weapon but in other cases fails to kick into action. Sharma, a Guyanese immigrant and practicing cancer doctor, oversees the collection of tumor samples from 100 of Anderson’s 165 cancer trials that involve immunotherapy. The tissue is then scrutinized by her lab and Allison’s for clues to how the battle is proceeding. “What is the immune response doing that leads to tumor rejection? What is the immune response doing that it stops rejecting the tumor and [it] starts growing again?” Sharma asks. “Those are big questions that we still need to understand.” Recommended for You With Neuralink, Elon Musk Promises Human-to-Human Telepathy. Don’t Believe It. Google’s New Chip Is a Stepping Stone to Quantum Computing Supremacy Big Data Exposes Big Falsehoods Flavor Networks Reveal Universal Principle Behind Successful Recipes Google’s Health Study Seeks 10,000 Volunteers to Give Up Their Medical Secrets The answers can’t come too soon for some. The pharmaceutical industry and research institutions are in the midst of a pell-mell sprint into thousands of clinical trials based on new immunotherapy agents. As of October, by one tally, more than 166,736 patients were being sought to fill slots in studies of drugs involving a single protein, called PD-1. The overall number of immunotherapy trials probably tops 3,000, says Jeff Bluestone, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who also serves as president and CEO of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. But a growing number of researchers fret that the flood of clinical trials is uncoördinated, redundant, and potentially counterproductive. That is because in many cases, the basic science remains little understood. “This is not sustainable,” Ira Mellman, the keynote speaker at the annual meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, told his colleagues when he took the stage last fall. Mellman, a vice president at the biotech behemoth Genentech, put up a byzantine diagram, consisting of concentric circles crammed with small type. The visually overwhelming slide showed trials under way to test immune-boosting therapeutics. His industry, he said, is “[throwing] plates of pasta against the wall, and hoping that something is going to stick.” Mellman told me that while Allison hadn’t invented immunotherapy, his drug had been the one that clarified its potential. Now, he says, Allison’s is one of the “few serious efforts” to better understand the mechanisms by which the immune system is killing cancers and the reasons why, too often, it is still not seeing them. “We would have a much better shot at doing what’s best for patients, doing best for science, if we understand mechanisms,” he told me. “You can just wildly try different things and hope that something works, or you can go back and try again and understand the basis of all of this. Until we know that, we’re not going to really understand why some respond and some don’t.” Checkpoint discovery Cancer is personal for Allison. At 10, he held the hand of his mother, Constance, in tiny Alice, Texas, and wondered at the burn marks up and down her neck. He had not expected her to die. Only later did he learn that the marks were from radiation, and that cancer had killed her. By the time he was 15, cancer had consumed two of his uncles. When Allison first began to chart a scientific career, he says, he recoiled from cancer. Back then, it seemed, there were few real clues. And immunology, the field he had picked, had a particular reputation for serving up fool’s gold when it came to the disease. “I couldn’t get any purchase on it,” he recalls. “I wasn’t going to go crashing into something until I knew how it worked.” At that time, in the 1970s, T cells—those tiny assassins that allow the body to fight off infections—had only recently been discovered. Allison was fascinated to learn there were molecular-level sentinels that patrolled the human body looking for trouble—that “if they see something wrong, they just deal with it.” He thought: “What could be cooler than that?” In the late 1980s, James Allison began studying the molecular basis of T-cell behavior. The existence of such immune cells did raise an obvious question: if T cells were designed to protect the body by killing infected and diseased cells, how was it that cancer managed to elude them? By then, there were hints that sometimes tumors did in fact succumb. In the 19th century surgeons had inoculated cancer patients with heat-killed bacteria, with inconsistent results. In 1980, a Time magazine cover spotlighted a scientific frenzy around a molecule called interferon, which sends the immune system into overdrive. But the treatment was indiscriminate, as likely to harm a person as heal. “It was crazy, because people were doing things and they didn’t understand how they worked,” Allison remembers. “People just said: ‘Oh, well. It causes T cells to grow. So we put tons of it into people.”’ A Time Line of Cancer Treatment Over 150 years, doctors learned to treat cancer with surgery, x-rays, chemotherapy, and vaccines. Immunotherapy is the latest weapon in the arsenal. Allison instead began studying the molecular receptors present on the T cell’s surface. One of his most important findings was to locate a receptor called CD28 that acts like a gas pedal. When it gets engaged, it is one of two key signals—in addition to a receptor that actually locks onto a tumor cell and functions somewhat like an ignition switch—that a T cell needs to initiate an attack. Even when those switches were flipped to the “on” position, however, such attacks were often short-lived and sometimes failed to start up at all. By 1992, Allison thought there might be a third switch. The most likely candidate: CTLA-4, a mysterious receptor sometimes spotted on T cells. But both Allison and Bluestone, the UCSF immunologist, found that this molecule behaved unexpectedly. When proteins bound to it, it didn’t turn a T cell on—it turned it off. These molecular brakes were called checkpoints. 1880–1957 c. 1880: Surgeon William Stewart Halsted argues that the recurrence of cancer after surgery is due to traces that remain. He helps pioneer the radical mastectomy. 1896: Emil Grubbe uses an x-ray tube to perform radiation therapy on Rose Lee, a mother of four with breast cancer. 1949: Mustard gas is approved by the FDA as the first chemotherapy after it is shown to destroy malignant white blood cells in lymphoma patients. 1957: The first bone marrow transplants are performed in Seattle. Although all six patients die within 100 days, the technique is a breakthrough. Scientists subsequently demonstrated why evolution might have favored checkpoints. When they created mice lacking CTLA-4, their T cells ended up attacking their own bodies after an infection. Without an off switch, the mice “died within a few weeks, of massive autoimmune disease,” Bluestone recalls. Bluestone initially saw the chance to develop new types of immune--suppressing drugs—say, for organ transplant patients. But Allison saw a different possibility. Releasing these brakes might strengthen the immune system’s response against cancer. One of Allison’s graduate students had already developed an antibody able to stick to a T cell’s CTLA-4 receptors, essentially jamming the switch. Allison instructed a postdoc to inject the antibody into mice riddled with tumors. The results, he recalls, “were spectacular.” “The tumors were cured,” Allison says. “I mean, it was 100 percent and zero percent—no statistics necessary.” Miracle drugs The drug, the first of the checkpoint inhibitors, would become known as ipilimumab or Yervoy, and it is now sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Manhattan. Human studies began around 2000 on 14 patients stricken with metastatic melanoma, who were steeling themselves for their finals days in hospice. But after the trial began, three saw their tumors shrink. Allison, who moved to New York City’s Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2004 to be closer to the trials, soon met one of the patients his drug had saved. Sharon Belvin was in her 20s, and had just finished college and gotten married, when metastatic melanomas appeared in her lungs, liver, and brain. She was terminal by the time her physician enrolled her in the first phase II clinical trial. The day Allison met her, she’d been in remission for a year. “[We were] just sobbing, and everybody was really happy.” “She hugged me,” Allison recalls. “Her husband hugged me, and her mother and father were there, and they all hugged me. It was just sobbing, and everybody was really happy. I walked to my office and I had a lot to think about. I cried all the way there.” Allison says by that time he was aware of his drug’s limitations. It didn’t help everyone, and it didn’t work in most cancers. And if he needed a reminder of the stakes, it came in 2005, when Allison’s brother succumbed to prostate cancer after eight years. The same year, doctors found early-stage cancer in Allison’s own prostate. He had surgery rather than chance drug treatment. As soon as cancer researchers learned that Yervoy worked on some previously incurable patients but not on others, many asked the obvious question: was it possible the body had more than one checkpoint? Another molecule, called PD-1, was quickly identified and successfully targeted with checkpoint inhibitors. Allison’s Yervoy was approved in 2011 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for patients with melanoma. Three years later the FDA approved Merck’s PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and a similar drug, also from Bristol-Myers Squibb, called nivolumab (Opdivo). One or both have since been approved to treat some types of lung cancer, kidney cancer, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, creating the most important new class of cancer drugs in a century. Gatling gun The day I arrived at MD Anderson to tour the platform, an Argentinean immunologist, Luis Vence, greeted me in a fluorescent-lit hallway. Our first stop was a lab where he swung open the door of a refrigerator-size machine to reveal 28 black canisters arrayed around a central hub, like the bundled cylinders of a Gatling gun. When cancerous samples come in, they are treated with fluorescent antibodies designed to stick to CTLA-4, PD-1, and other molecules on the surface of immune cells. The machine can then, in a few seconds, use a laser to scan all 10,000 or so cells from a biopsy, count them, and separate them by type. Vence compared it to sifting through multicolored ping-pong balls. In a nearby lab, one of his colleagues, Jorge Blando, directed me to a microscope through which I could see a panorama of a cellular battle under way. The slide contained a slice of bone marrow riddled with tumors. These were recognizable by their larger, fuller-shaped cells. Among them were the tiny immune cells, stained brown, that had infiltrated and begun to attack. Others seemed to hover around the periphery. How many eventually make it in—and how long they survive to keep fighting—determines whether the tumor is defeated. “What you are looking at in cancer is natural selection at a high speed,” Vence says. “When you treat it with chemotherapy, maybe you destroy 99 percent of the tumor. But the 1 percent that is left is resistant to chemotherapy. That’s the one that grows back and basically kills you.” This explains why even the latest targeted drugs—those designed to hit very specific molecules on, say, a breast cancer cell—typically extend patients’ life by only a few months. 1981–2006 1981: A vaccine against hepatitis B, which causes liver cancer, becomes the first cancer vaccine to reach market in the U.S. 1995: James ­Allison rids mice of tumors using a new type of treatment that unleashes the immune system: a checkpoint inhibitor. 1997: The antibody rituximab is approved to treat non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It is the first molecularly targeted cancer drug. 2006: Cancer enters the genome era. Johns Hopkins scientists apply high-speed DNA sequencing to 22 tumors. 2006: Mass vaccinations begin against the human papillomavirus, the cause of cervical cancer. Yet Vence and others believe that the immune system is inherently capable of spotting and countering any move a cancer makes. How else to explain how some advanced melanoma patients, who had tumors in their lungs or brain, are disease-free years after a course of Yervoy infusions? “The beauty of immunotherapy,” Vence says, “is that the immune system can evolve at the same time, along with the tumor. It can keep up much easier.” It was Sharma who had the idea for the platform. When she began it, few volunteers were yet receiving Yervoy, then a relatively new and unproven drug. So Sharma persuaded patients slated to have less serious tumors removed by surgery to take small doses. A biopsy sample was collected before the drug was administered. Then, comparing the initial cancer and the excised tumor, the lab could use state-of-the-art technology to track the immune response and begin to examine why it didn’t always work. Sharma’s first finding came fairly quickly. In tissue from bladder cancers treated with CTLA-4 antibodies, readings from the Gatling gun showed that T cells possessing a molecule called ICOS were “off the charts.” Sharma’s reaction was elation mixed with confusion. T cells with ICOS on them had previously been found only in the tiny sacs in the lymph nodes known as follicles, and they were believed to suppress immune responses, not enhance them. Allison decided to engineer mice whose tumors triggered ICOS. In their tumors, CTLA-4 was four times as effective. ICOS, it turns out, was part of cascade that made T cells attack tumor cells more effectively. At MD Anderson, where James Allison has his laboratory, researchers study why some people don’t benefit from immunotherapy. “I can’t believe we missed this,” Allison remembers telling Sharma. “This is amazing.” He’d been scooped by his collaborator and felt blown away. They’d been spending more and time together, talking on the phone and working on science. Now he blurted out: “I love you!” Sharma recalls plowing forward with the conversation as if nothing had been said. But he had said it. The pair were married in a small ceremony in 2014. With the help of the Boston venture capital firm Third Rock Ventures, they also started a company called Jounce Therapeutics that is developing a drug to increase ICOS levels. Human tests got under way last year, and although it’s too early to know how the drug is working, the idea has already been remunerative. Jounce went public in January, raising $117 million. Now Sharma drives a Tesla with a vanity plate that reads “ICOS.” On Allison’s Porsche, the plate says “CTLA4.” A tidal wave During the same meeting at which -Mellman castigated the industry for spaghetti throwing, I saw Allison huddled over an iPad with another scientist, discussing some of the most recent findings he, Blando, and Sharma have made using their platform. They have been studying prostate cancer, in which no checkpoint drug yet seems to work. “What we found was that prostate cancer is almost a desert immunologically,” Allison says. “It’s a very cold tumor. There’s not much in there.” But Blando’s microscope has revealed that two drugs together might make the difference. Yervoy, he found, is necessary to drive T cells into the tumor, while the addition of a PD-1 drug makes sure they start killing. On the basis of these results and further research, Sharma and Allison convinced Bristol-Myers to combine the drugs in a clinical trial for advanced prostate cancer. “I can’t believe we missed this. This is amazing ... I LOVE YOU!” Many immunotherapy trials don’t have as much new preclinical research behind them. One reason is that drug companies are still exploiting the original checkpoint discoveries. Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo has been approved for eight different cancer “indications” in two years, which must be a record. “The pace of the clinical applications of the science is much faster than understanding mechanisms in the lab,” says Gregory B. Lesinski, a scientist at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. 2011–2016 2011: Ipilimumab, or Yervoy, is approved to treat advanced melanoma. It is the first checkpoint inhibitor to reach the market. 2015: Former president Jimmy Carter, at 91, has melanoma in his liver and brain. A checkpoint drug leaves him cancer-free. 2016: Recognizing “amazing advances” in immune therapy, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden announce a new “moonshot” to cure cancer. But racing ahead of the science can also incur huge penalties. Last summer, a test of Opdivo as a first-choice treatment for advanced lung cancer led to one of the greatest fiascoes in the company’s history. Bristol had organized a trial that, in seeking the largest market, had essentially taken all comers. Its competitor Merck chose to test its drug in only lung cancer patients whose biomarkers indicated they were most likely to respond. When Merck reported its results in June, they were so good that independent monitors said patients in a control group using chemotherapy could switch to the new drug immediately. Then, in August, Bristol acknowledged that its own test had failed to show a benefit. Shares of the company dropped by 20 percent, and Bristol’s research and development chief eventually stepped down. The revival of immunotherapy now includes cancer-fighting viruses, genetically reprogrammed T cells, and vaccines designed to make tumors more visible to the immune system. Understanding the best way to put it all together is one of the crucial jobs ahead. At times, the explosion of new activity has tended to diminish the importance of Allison’s drug. Although it is still a billion-dollar-a-year blockbuster, Yervoy is now less often prescribed, in part because of side effects. One analyst called it the “iPod of immunotherapy”—a product overshadowed by the revolutionary change in thinking it caused. “Its importance would be hard to overstate in terms of what it has done to crystallize all the other activities,” says Mellman. “In my opinion, the idea that the immune system could target cancer didn’t start with Jim. But the field did.” Read next Spotting Cancer in a Vial of Blood He watched his brother die from a cancer no drug could cure. Now one of the world’s most renowned cancer researchers says it’s time for Plan B. Once a year Allison packs a sold-out venue at the American Society for Cancer Research. There his own band, the Checkpoints, plays to doctors and scientists, nearly all of whom are converts to immunotherapy. Yet Allison still recalls the reviewer who, two decades ago, told a journal to reject his breakthrough paper because “we all know that immunotherapy’s crap. It’s never worked.” Now that immunotherapy looks like the future, how far can it go? As I stood with Allison and Sharma in the MD Anderson parking lot, saying our good-byes, they seemed hopeful. Allison grabbed a piece of paper and sketched a graph. Start with everyone who has cancer, he said. Then, going out to the right, trace the survivors: how many are left after two months, six months, a year. It’s a line that, for most advanced cancers, drops relentlessly to the dust. But immunotherapy is lifting the curve. In melanoma, there are more and more long-term survivors. Allison calls it “raising the tail.” “Ultimately, the goal is to try to get the survival rate as high as we can in as many different kinds of cancers as we can,” he says. Allison has finally gotten purchase on the monster that darkened his childhood. And he is not going to let go.  Adam Piore is the author of The Body Builders: Inside the Science of the Engineered Human. The latest Insider Conversation is live!

Biotech drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals lost $1.90, or 1.6 percent, to $116.82 and Merck declined 66 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $61.89. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts dipped 59 cents to $66.46. Next Friday the government will release its report on first-quarter GDP growth, something investors pay a lot of attention to. On the same day, the federal government is scheduled to reach its borrowing limit, which could trigger a government shutdown unless Congress agrees to extend it.

While Xarelto was supposed to help cut his stroke risk, Boudreaux says it instead caused internal bleeding that required a week-long hospital stay in the intensive-care unit, several blood transfusions and multiple heart procedures. “I don’t want anybody else to suffer like I have from that drug,” the part-time security guard says. On Monday, Boudreaux urged a New Orleans jury to hold J&J and Bayer AG, which jointly developed Xarelto, responsible for the treatment’s potentially fatal side effects, in the first lawsuit targeting the medicine to go to trial. The companies are facing more than 18,000 U.S. patient suits blaming the blood thinner for internal bleeding. The medicine also has been linked to at least 370 deaths, according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration reports. Top Seller The drug is Bayer’s top-selling product, generating $3.24 billion in sales (3 billion euros) last year and $2.5 billion (2.3 billion euros) in 2015 for the Leverkusen, Germany based pharmaceutical company. Xarelto is J&J’s third-largest seller, bringing in $2.29 billion in 2016 as the New Brunswick, New Jersey, company seeks to replace revenue from its Remicade arthritis treatment, which lost patent protection a year ago. Boudreaux’s case is the first of four suits overseen by U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon in New Orleans slated for trial over the next three months. “The allegations made in the Xarelto lawsuits contradict years of data on the medicine and the FDA’s determination of its safety and efficacy,” said William Foster, a spokesman for J&J’s Janssen unit that sells the drug in the U.S. Bayer says that while there are some patient complaints, Xarelto’s bleeding risks are fully outlined on the medicine’s warning label and well known by prescribing doctors. “Bayer stands behind the safety and efficacy of Xarelto, and will vigorously defend it,” spokeswoman Astrid Kranz said in an emailed statement. U.S. regulators approved Xarelto in 2011 to prevent blood clots in users undergoing knee and hip surgeries. The drug’s use has been extended to patients, such as Boudreaux, who suffer from irregular heartbeats and are at high risk of stroke. Xarelto belongs to a new class of drugs aimed at replacing Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s Coumadin, which has thinned patients’ blood since the 1960s. Other new thinners include Pradaxa made by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, a German company that paid $650 million in 2014 to settle thousands of suits claiming it hid the medicine’s bleeding risks. No Antidote J&J and Bayer are accused of falsely marketing Xarelto as more effective at preventing strokes than Coumadin and easier to use, because Xarelto patients didn’t need frequent blood tests. Lawyers for Boudreaux and other former Xarelto patients stress the drug has no antidote, so it puts some users at high risk for bleeding out if they suffer an injury. Coumadin’s blood-thinning effects can be stemmed. J&J and Bayer officials should have warned consumers they could be tested to gauge their Xarelto bleed-out risk, patients’ attorneys claim. Financial concerns ruled out such disclosures, Brian Barr, one of Boudreaux’s lawyers, told jurors in open statements Monday. “The test that would identify people at high risk was inconsistent with the marketing plan they came up with,” he said. “The business plan came first.” J&J and Bayer point to the FDA’s finding that Xarelto is “safe and effective” for patients seeking to avoid stroke-causing clots to buttress claims the drug doesn’t pose undue risks, according to court papers. They also say millions of users have taken the drug without suffering bleeding side effects. The pharmaceutical makers also argue Boudreaux and other patients can’t prove doctors would have avoided prescribing the drug even if they’d had the kind of bleeding warnings sought by the plaintiffs, according to court filings. “Xarelto’s label is adequate as a matter of law,” the companies’ attorneys said. The companies also dispute the validity of the safety test designed to gauge Xarelto users’ bleeding risks, saying in court filings that the test didn’t provide useful information to doctors. “We don’t believe it’s a safety test because it doesn’t work with this particular drug," Beth Wilkinson, a lawyer for both companies, said in opening statements Monday. Bellwether Case The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Boudreaux’s case serves as a bellwether to help decide the strength of the Xarelto claims, said David Logan, a mass-tort law professor at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island. Fallon will allow a number of such trials to see if jurors rule for patients and award damages, Williams said. “Once the results are in, the parties may feel more confident about whether to settle the remaining claims,” he said. Xarelto cases filed in federal courts around the U.S. have been consolidated before Fallon while other suits are awaiting trials in state courts in Pennsylvania and Delaware. Fallon previously oversaw suits against Merck & Co. targeting its Vioxx painkiller that resulted in a $4.85 billion settlement. “Judge Fallon has been through the process several times,” said Carl Tobias, who teaches product-liability law at the University of Richmond in Virginia. “He knows how to get suits to trial that will give the companies and plaintiffs a good feel for what these cases are worth.” The cases are Boudreaux v. Janssen, 14-cv-2720, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana, and In RE Xarelto Products Liability Litigation, 14-MD-2592, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) Therapeutics Marke to Rear Excessive Growth During 2017 – 2025 Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) exceptional autoimmune syndrome involving improper transmission at neuromuscular junction with the key clinical symptom of muscle weakness. Weakness in muscles in LEMS is caused due to autoantibodies to voltage gated calcium channels resulting in reduction of acetylcholine released from terminals of the nerve. The necessary knowledge of elusive clinical features and laboratory oddities makes the early identification of LEMS possible. Early detection of LEMS is principally significant due to its strong correlation with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Even though LEMS can arise at any point in the path of SCLC, it serves as a marker for early detection of the disease, and thus permits better opportunity for treatment of such malignancy. Patients with LEMS should be examined and then treated by both a neurologist and if appropriate, an oncologist. In case of the diagnosis the principal concern must be appropriate treatment of malignancy. Treatment of LEMS includes immunosuppressant agents, but success of the treatment depends on toxicity and trouble involved in administering the therapy. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/13732 Treatment of LEMS involves various approaches that include reducing the amount of antibodies so as to improve the muscle function, increasing the acetylcholine quantity received by the muscles, increasing the overall acetylcholine released in the body and other mechanism which are not approved in all the regions. The therapy involving reduction in the amount of antibodies comprises of corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, monoclonal antibodies and many more. The therapy involving the amount of acetylcholine reception by the muscles comprises of Cholinesterase inhibitors. The therapy involving the increased amount of acetylcholine production in the body comprises of aminopyridines. There is a drug which treats the disorder but those are not approved in all the regions. This category includes amifampridine which is approved only in European countries. The Global Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) Therapeutics market can be segmented by Treatment type, Disease Type, Distribution Channel and Region. Geographically, the North America are anticipated to be most lucrative market during the forecast period, mainly owing to high prevalence of the disease and better reimbursement policies. Moreover the existence of several drug manufacturers and growing amount of clinical research is anticipated to promote rapid market growth in this region. Asia Pacific region is anticipated to observe high market development followed by North America and Europe mostly owing to patient population and better and affordable therapy options by the companies operating in this market. The large patient pool and refining distribution channel in the region is also likely to lift the LEMS market. Latin America and Middle East and Africa are anticipated to follow owing to growing government expenditure on the healthcare.

Adapted Media Release Liver Disease / Hepatitis Medical Devices / Diagnostics Xpert point of care test represents major advance in hep C diagnosis Published: Monday 24 April 2017 Published: Mon 24 Apr 2017 email A new test that enables diagnosis of hepatitis C infection in a single visit could improve access to early diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment service for some of the most vulnerable people in Australia and the world, according to a study published today by the Kirby Institute, UNSW Sydney in The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology. Researchers conducted the first evaluation of the Xpert HCV Viral Load test (manufactured by Cepheid) - a point-of-care hepatitis C virus test that can detect active infection - from a finger-stick sample of blood. They established there is good sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert HCV Viral Load point-of-care test using blood samples collected by finger-stick in participants attending drug health and homelessness services in Australia. "This test represents a major advance over point of care antibody-based tests, which only indicate previous exposure to the virus but cannot detect whether you are actively infected," said Associate Professor Jason Grebely, lead author of the study from the Kirby Institute. "We really need to scale up testing for active hepatitis C infection in order to enhance diagnosis, get people linked to appropriate care, and provided highly curative treatment with direct-acting antivirals to prevent advanced liver disease and onward transmission of the virus." Importantly, new point of care platforms enable detection of hepatitis C virus and diagnosis of active infection in a single visit, rather than having to come back for a second visit to obtain test results. "Requiring people to come back for a second appointment to receive their results can present significant barriers, especially for people living in remote areas and for vulnerable and marginalised populations like homeless people and people who inject drugs, who are the people we need to reach the most in order to eliminate hepatitis C," said Associate Professor Grebely. The Xpert HCV Viral Load finger-stick test is not yet registered in Australia, but international clinical trials are underway to evaluate this point of care assay as a diagnostic test for the detection of active HCV infection. This study is part of the LiveRLife project - an open observational cohort study evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention integrating non-invasive liver disease screening on HCV assessment and treatment uptake. Funding was provided by The National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia), Cepheid, South Eastern Sydney Local Health District (Australia), and Merck Sharp & Dohme (Australia).
