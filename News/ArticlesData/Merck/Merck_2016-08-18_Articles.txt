George Budwell (TMFGBudwell) Aug 18, 2016 at 11:38AM The cancer drug market is already valued at over $100 billion but is still growing at one of the fastest compound annual growth rates in entire the pharmaceutical industry. The underlying reason for this surge in oncology drug sales is the emergence of breakthrough products like Bristol-Myers Squibb's checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo, along with the seemingly never-ending rise in cancer incidence rates across the globe.   That said, the market hasn't exactly been applying rich premiums to the share prices of most cancer therapy stocks of late, perhaps making some of these stocks great bargains for patient investors. Armed with this insight, here is a deeper look at two cancer stocks that are arguably ridiculously cheap based on the long-term prospects of their respective clinical pipelines. Image source: Getty Images. Big pharma is starting to take interest in this tiny immuno-oncology company Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN) is a tiny cancer immunotherapy company that sports an immense pipeline of checkpoint inhibitors and modulators targeting a rich array of receptors with known anti-tumor properties. As a result, the company has been able to attract partnerships with both Incyte Corp. (NASDAQ:INCY) and Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) to help advance its anti-cancer checkpoint inhibitor platform. The Incyte partnership has already led to the launch of a combined phase 1/2 clinical trial for the anti-GITR checkpoint antibody INCAGN1876 in solid tumors, and the two companies are also reportedly close to initiating another early stage trial for an OX40 agonist antibody sometime in the back half of 2016.  The Merck collaboration is reportedly starting to pick up steam as well. Agenus noted in its second-quarter earnings call, for instance, that Merck has now selected a lead product candidate to advance into preclinical studies, triggering a $2 million milestone payment. The underwhelming part, though, is that Merck hasn't revealed much about the details of this collaboration with Agenus, making it difficult to place a long-term value on this joint effort.  Apart from its collaborations with Incyte and Merck, Agenus is apparently also listening to offers to license out its proprietary CTLA-4 antibody that's currently in a phase 1 stage for advanced solid tumors. While the likelihood of yet another partnership is impossible to handicap at this point, the bigger issue to keep in mind is that the company's checkpoint inhibitor platform has definitely caught of the eye of big pharma at this stage, perhaps leading to even more deals or an outright buyout offer down the line.  Buyout or not, this small-cap biotech is on track to produce a treasure trove of clinical updates starting next year, giving investors ample reasons to dig deeper. The key point is that Agenus' market cap of only $525 million at the moment would seem to make it dirt cheap, given that its checkpoint inhibitor platform has the potential to generate billions in revenues in the not-so-distant future.  Don't sleep on this hidden gem Bellicum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:BLCM) is an up-and-coming player in the hotly contested adoptive cell therapy space. Although Bellicum is trailing the industry leaders Kite Pharma and Juno Therapeutics in the race to bring one of these novel cell therapies to market, the company does sport a potential game changer with its proprietary Chemical Induction of Dimerization (CID) technology that's designed to make adoptive T cell therapies safer and more potent. Kite and Juno, after all, have both run into trouble with their initial product candidates from a safety standpoint, casting doubt on their ability to move into more profitable, earlier lines of treatment.  Image Source: Getty Images In a promising turn of events, Bellicum recently announced that it may even be able to leapfrog Kite and Juno -- at least in Europe. Specifically, the Houston-based drugmaker said that European authorities are open to considering a regulatory filing for the company's lead product candidate, BPX-501, in pediatric patients with leukemias, lymphomas, and rare inherited blood diseases. The somewhat unusual part is that an approval would be based on the dual phase 1/2 study known as the BP-004 trial. In short, European regulators are apparently willing to forgo a large, randomized trial if BPX-501 continues to shine in its ongoing study, presumably due to the complete lack of treatments for these rare but deadly blood disorders.  In addition to BPX-501, Bellicum is also close to launching early stage clinical trials for its high-affinity T cell receptor (BPX-701) and GoCAR-T (BPX-601) product candidates. According to the company, BPX-701 will initially target blood-based disorders such as refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. And BPX-601 is set to enter a phase 1 study as a possible treatment for non-resectable pancreatic cancer. Although Bellicum's cell-based platform has been progressing at breakneck speed lately, the market apparently hasn't taken notice. Bellicum's market cap of around $508 million, after all, is just a small fraction of the multi-billion dollar valuations of its lead competitors Kite and Juno. To be fair, Kite and Juno's far higher market caps are partly the result of major partnering deals with bigger biotechs. But that fact doesn't totally explain Bellicum's comparatively meager valuation, especially since the biotech is pursuing a handful of therapies with blockbuster potential, and its CID platform could become the gold standard for adoptive cell therapies in general.  Time to buy?  Clinical-stage biotechs are always a high-risk investment. That being said, Agenus and Bellicum are both in the process of building out diverse clinical pipelines aimed at treating several high-value conditions. So, while undoubtedly risky, these two biotechs do offer investors some insurance in the event of a clinical or regulatory setback in the near term. And that's perhaps the main reason that these two stocks might be worth buying ahead of their upcoming catalysts. After all, it's not particularly common for small-cap cancer therapy stocks to sport multiple blockbuster product candidates. George Budwell has no position in any stocks mentioned.

You’re supposed to carry one with you everywhere you go. But in recent years, EpiPens have gotten so expensive that some struggle to afford them. CBS News reports that the price of EpiPens has increased by more than 480 percent since 2009, two years after Mylan purchased the device from Merck. A two-pack used to cost pharmacies about $100. It’s now $600, and they have a stated expiration of one year. But health insurance covers that, right? It depends on your plan. If you’re one of the many people with a high-deductible plan, you could be stuck with the bill. Parents of children with severe allergies are told to have devices at home and school, too, which can add up fast. Two packs can set some people back $1,200. Mylan does offer a patient-assistance program and coupon cards, which allow some people to pay nothing out-of-pocket, but for some families, the coupon saves them $100 per pack — they still owe $500. Emergency medical technicians also use EpiPens and some have resorted to syringes filled with epinephrine to save money. Epinephrine itself is very cheap; Mylan is essentially charging for the patented auto-injector, and they have a virtual monopoly on the market. There is a generic version, but the injector is different (another generic is in development) and a rival device was recalled in October. Marketwatch compared the steep increase to the shady practices of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and anti-hero Martin Shkreli’s Turing Pharmaceuticals, which raised the price of a generic cancer and AIDS drug from $13.50 a pill to $750. Mylan told CBS in a statement that EpiPen’s price “has changed over time to better reflect important product features and the value the product provides,” adding, “we’ve made a significant investment to support the device over the past years.” That investment might be little more than marketing. Nielsen figures show that Mylan spent $35.2 million on EpiPen commercials in 2014, up from $4.8 million in 2011. Bloomberg senior medical reporter Robert Langreth told CBS: “This brand name, EpiPen, it’s like Kleenex to allergists. You know, it’s a name they know and trust. It’s what they prescribe.” For better or for worse.

The latest potential acquisition in the space involves disease therapy specialist Medivation Inc (NASDAQ:MDVN), which is now rumored to be attracting takeover interest from at least five big pharma companies. According to a Reuters report, the suitors now include: Merck ($175B market cap), Sanofi ($101B market cap), Pfizer ($214B market cap), Celgene ($87B market cap), and and Gilead Sciences ($109B market cap). Merck was the newest addition to the list, said the source, who couldn’t provide more details because the discussion process is ongoing. The source indicated Medivation is also interested in speaking to even more possible buyers in what’s turning into an auction for the cancer drug maker. As expected, Medivation declined to comment. MDVN shares have risen 38.5% this year. Fellow biotech name Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) is also attracting big takeover interest, and the fetching price could be huge. These and other M&A deals are greatly helping the Biotech ETF in its ongoing recovery from multiyear lows set earlier this year. The IBB was up $1.41 (+0.48%) to $292.31 in morning trading Thursday, and has pared its year-to-date losses down to -13.5%.

Login Register Public Release: 19-Aug-2016 Parents more likely to support HPV vax requirements if states include opt-out provisions Parents more likely to support HPV vaccine requirements for school entry if states include opt-out provisions American Association for Cancer Research Share  Print  E-Mail Bottom Line: Parents are more likely to support laws that would make the human papillomavirus vaccine mandatory for school entry if their state offers opt-out provisions, however, the study's lead author cautioned that such opt-out provisions may weaken the effectiveness of the vaccine requirements. Journal in Which the Study was Published: Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. Author: William A. Calo, PhD, JD, a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the University of North Carolina, Gillings School of Global Public Health, and Noel Brewer, PhD, the study's senior author, who is a professor of health behavior at the University of North Carolina and a member of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. Background: The human papillomavirus (HPV) causes most cases of cervical cancer and a large proportion of vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that boys and girls receive the three-dose HPV vaccination beginning at age 11 or 12. However, as of 2014, only 40 percent of girls and 22 percent of boys ages 13 to 17 had completed the HPV vaccine series, according to CDC statistics. Calo said previous research has shown that school-entry requirements have contributed to high uptake rates for vaccinations such as Hepatitis B, Tdap, and MMR. Since 2006, half of U.S. state legislatures have introduced measures to add HPV to the list of required vaccines, however, most measures were rejected, often due to parental disapproval or ethical, political, or legal concerns, Calo said. Presently, only Virginia, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia require the HPV vaccine for school enrollment, and all allow parents to opt out. How the Study Was Conducted and Results: In order to evaluate parental support for making the HPV vaccine mandatory for school entry, Calo, Brewer, and colleagues conducted a web-based survey of 1,501 parents between November 2014 and January 2015. To be eligible for the survey, parents had to have at least one 11- to 17-year-old child living primarily in their household. The survey stated, "Some states are trying to pass laws that would require all 11- and 12-year-olds to get HPV vaccine before they are allowed to start 6th grade." Parents were then asked whether they agreed with the statement, "I think these laws are a good idea." Overall, 21 percent of parents agreed that such laws are a good idea, and 54 percent disagreed. Twenty-five percent of respondents said they neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement; Calo said this group may benefit from public education about HPV vaccination and, as they learn about the benefits of vaccination, be more likely to support school-entry requirements. Respondents who said they disagreed that the laws are a good idea then received this follow-up statement: "It is okay to have these laws only if parents can opt out when they want to." When the opt-out provision was added, 57 percent of respondents agreed that the school-entry requirements are a good idea, and 21 percent disagreed. The study also identified several factors that influenced approval of HPV vaccine requirements. Nearly one-third (32 percent) of respondents felt that the vaccine was being promoted to make money for drug companies and only 40 percent felt that the vaccine was effective in preventing cervical cancer. Calo said changing some of those perceptions would be beneficial for improving HPV vaccination rates and for legislating school-entry requirements. Author Comment: Calo cautioned that opt-out provisions could weaken the overall effectiveness of vaccination if large numbers of families opted out. "Any process for requesting an opt-out should have an educational component and encourage parents to carefully consider their decision," he said. "HPV vaccination saves lives," Calo said. "We have an unprecedented opportunity to prevent thousands of HPV-associated cancers through vaccination and unfortunately, we are missing that opportunity." Brewer noted the findings suggest that states should consider school-entry requirements for HPV vaccination once states have implemented other approaches that have proven successful in raising vaccination rates, such as centralizing vaccination reminders in state health departments, focusing quality-improvement visits to providers on HPV vaccination, and training physicians to use announcements to introduce vaccination. ### Limitations: The authors noted that a limitation of this study is that it asked about hypothetical school-entry requirements, rather than actual laws, and did not describe the scope of opt-out provisions. The researchers said parents' opinions could differ if they were discussing actual legislation, and may vary depending on whether the opt-out provisions were based on medical, religious, or philosophical reasons. Funding & Disclosures: This study was funded by a grant from the Merck Sharp & Dohme Investigator Studies Program. Brewer has received HPV vaccine-related grants from or been on paid advisory boards for Merck Sharp & Dohme and Pfizer. Brewer is also chair of the National HPV Vaccination Roundtable.

Persistence Market Research News provided by Reportlinker Aug 18, 2016, 16:12 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Aug. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Bone marrow transplant or hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the surgical procedure to replace impaired bone marrow tissue or bone marrow stem cells with healthy ones. Bone marrow transplant procedure is recommended to treat severe stages of leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, multiple myeloma, aplastic and sickle cell anemia, thalassemia etc. As per transplant activity report 2009-2013 from the Center for International Bone and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), of a total of 88,063 bone marrow transplant procedures performed in the U.S., over 57% procedures were autologous bone marrow transplant procedures. The report covers the global bone marrow transplant market performance in terms of volume (procedural count) and revenue contribution. The report includes key trends, drivers, restraints, and opportunities influencing the growth of the global bone marrow transplant market over the forecast period. Impact analysis of key growth drivers and restraints, based on the weighted average model, are included to provide clients with crystal clear decision-making insights. The global bone marrow transplant market growth is mainly driven by factors such as growing prevalence of blood cancers across the globe, expansion of bone marrow transplant registry, growing investment in logistic services, and improvement in survival rate after treatment. Substantially high cost of treatment, lack of reimbursement policies in developing regions, and low availability of bone marrow donors are some factors hampering the growth of the global bone marrow transplant market. Based on procedure type, the bone marrow transplant market is segmented into autologous bone marrow transplant and allogeneic bone marrow transplant segments. By volume, the autologous bone marrow transplant segment accounted for the major proportion of the overall market share in 2014 and is expected to remain the dominant segment in terms of volume during the forecast period. By disease indication, the global bone marrow transplant market is classified as leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, aplastic anemia, solid tumors, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and others. The leukemia segment is expected to dominate the market, accounting for a maximum share of the overall market by 2021 end; whereas, revenue from the thalassemia segment is projected to expand at the highest CAGR of 8.9% during the forecast period. On the basis of the end user, the global bone marrow transplant market is segmented into hospitals, multispecialty clinics, and ambulatory surgical centers (ASC). The hospital end user segment is expected to continue to be dominant, reaching a value of US$ 9,607.4 Mn by 2021 end. In terms of volume, adoption of bone marrow transplant procedures in ambulatory surgical centers is expected to increase by 1.3X globally over the forecast period. By region, the market in Europe is expected to be dominant in the global bone marrow transplant market in terms of volume throughout the forecast period. North America and Latin America markets are expected to gain significant market share over the forecast period, due to increasing ratio of BMT specialists to that of bone marrow transplant seeking patients in these regions. The MEA market is expected to witness sluggish growth during the forecast period partly due to the relatively low presence of bone marrow transplant centers. Key market players covered in this report include Lonza Group Ltd., Merck Millipore Corporation, Sanofi-Aventis LLC, AllCells LLC, STEMCELL Technologies and American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) Inc. Major players in the bone marrow transplant market are focusing on emerging markets instead of mature markets such as North America and Europe. These companies are more focused towards expanding their presence in clinical applications by introducing stem cell therapy products for use in humans. The global bone marrow transplant market is segmented as follows: By Procedure: Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant By Disease Indication: Leukemia Lymphoma Myeloma Myelodysplasia Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Aplastic Anemia Solid tumors Sickle cell Anemia Thalassemia Others By End User: Hospitals Multispecialty Clinics Ambulatory Surgical Centers By Region: North America U.S. Canada Europe Germany Italy France U.K. Spain Rest of Europe Asia Pacific China India Japan Australia & New Zealand Rest of Asia Pacific Latin America Mexico Brazil Argentina Rest of Latin America MEA GCC Countries South Africa Rest of MEA Key features included in this report: Drivers and restraints of the bone marrow transplant market Pipeline analysis and key developments in the market Analysis of business strategies of key players Bone marrow transplant market estimates and forecast Read the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p04039999-summary/view-report.html About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

How can anyone think otherwise following his announcement that he wants to enlist "observers" to man the polls on election day, or Pence's assertion that, yes, "facilities" are required to process non-Muslim immigrants to make sure they aren't "compromised." Thugs? Camps? If you support Trump, I guess that's exactly what you want. Little word from the progressive left about this. They don't get outraged about Trump these days, too busy combusting about Bernie Sanders' summer house. I've seen more than one conspiratorial screed accusing Sanders of being paid off by the Democratic National Committee in the form of a summer house. Conspiracies are fun and exciting, but reality is mundane. The reality is that this was bought from the money the Sanders got from the sale of their Maine summer house, which had been in Jane Sanders' family since 1903 but they had, diabolically, never used much. They want something closer to home, so they sold it and directed that money to the Vermont house. Smoking gun! Conspiratorial progressives aren't getting upset about the "secret ledger" revealing millions of dollars in undisclosed payments to Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort from Ukrainian president and close Putin ally Viktor F. Yanukovych. There are even photos of the ledger in the New York Times. What makes progressive eyes literally pop out of their head are the released emails showing Clinton's advisers working to connect a Clinton Foundation contributor with the State Department. The meeting never happened, but the suggestion did. Is it troubling? Yes. Is it the same kind of troubling as thugs and camps and payoffs from Putin associates? In an ordinary election year, I wouldn't think so. But this is the kind of election year that someone like Jill Stein gets a lot of attention. Not investigative attention, more puff piece attention. Even the criticisms amount to puff criticisms, like the anti-vax allegations. This helps with the saintliness narrative that followers create. That's why you won't hear much about Stein's Federal Election Commission submission, which puts the anti-wealth candidate as being worth $3.9 million, according to the Center For Public Integrity. Does she have a summer house? I have no idea. The FEC papers also reveal the anti-Wall Street candidate owns stocks in Merck pharmaceutical, as well as Johnson & Johnson, Walt Disney, Home Depot. In the real world, this is known as hypocrisy. There's also the problem of her Russian connection. Stein met with Putin at a conference earlier this year — there are photos of them at a banquet table together. Stein took the opportunity criticize human rights in America. Fair enough, but she sadly doesn't lob the policy toward Russia, which is no friend to our LBGTQ friends. Stein has criticized the U.S. military actions in Syria, despite the destruction wrought by President Bashar Assad's forces and the Russians. And her running mate, human rights activist Ajamu Baraka, also has defended Assad vigorously. There are laws against being gay in Syria, subject to prison — if you make it that far alive, that is. Baraka is also associated with Holocaust denier Kevin Barrett, appearing on his radio show and in anthologies he has edited. Baraka is also a well-known 9-11 truther, the gold standard of 21st Century conspiracy theories. Stein is the only presidential candidate who gets as much positive airplay on RT as Trump. RT, a state-run Russian news network, recently ran a piece vigorously "debunking" the criticisms against Stein, which makes you wonder what stake the network has in the election. I'm sure it would love for Stein to take votes away from Clinton, since Trump is so successful at pushing votes away from himself. He needs all the help he can get. Russian media is willing.

The human papillomavirus (HPV) causes most cases of cervical cancer and a large proportion of vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that boys and girls receive the three-dose HPV vaccination beginning at age 11 or 12. However, as of 2014, only 40 percent of girls and 22 percent of boys ages 13 to 17 had completed the HPV vaccine series, according to CDC statistics. Calo said previous research has shown that school-entry requirements have contributed to high uptake rates for vaccinations such as Hepatitis B, Tdap, and MMR. Since 2006, half of U.S. state legislatures have introduced measures to add HPV to the list of required vaccines, however, most measures were rejected, often due to parental disapproval or ethical, political, or legal concerns, Calo said. Presently, only Virginia, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia require the HPV vaccine for school enrollment, and all allow parents to opt out. In order to evaluate parental support for making the HPV vaccine mandatory for school entry, Calo, Brewer, and colleagues conducted a web-based survey of 1,501 parents between November 2014 and January 2015. To be eligible for the survey, parents had to have at least one 11- to 17-year-old child living primarily in their household. The survey stated, "Some states are trying to pass laws that would require all 11- and 12-year-olds to get HPV vaccine before they are allowed to start 6th grade." Parents were then asked whether they agreed with the statement, "I think these laws are a good idea." Overall, 21 percent of parents agreed that such laws are a good idea, and 54 percent disagreed. Twenty-five percent of respondents said they neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement; Calo said this group may benefit from public education about HPV vaccination and, as they learn about the benefits of vaccination, be more likely to support school-entry requirements. Respondents who said they disagreed that the laws are a good idea then received this follow-up statement: "It is okay to have these laws only if parents can opt out when they want to." When the opt-out provision was added, 57 percent of respondents agreed that the school-entry requirements are a good idea, and 21 percent disagreed. The study also identified several factors that influenced approval of HPV vaccine requirements. Nearly one-third (32 percent) of respondents felt that the vaccine was being promoted to make money for drug companies and only 40 percent felt that the vaccine was effective in preventing cervical cancer. Calo said changing some of those perceptions would be beneficial for improving HPV vaccination rates and for legislating school-entry requirements. Calo cautioned that opt-out provisions could weaken the overall effectiveness of vaccination if large numbers of families opted out. "Any process for requesting an opt-out should have an educational component and encourage parents to carefully consider their decision," he said. "HPV vaccination saves lives," Calo said. "We have an unprecedented opportunity to prevent thousands of HPV-associated cancers through vaccination and unfortunately, we are missing that opportunity." Brewer noted the findings suggest that states should consider school-entry requirements for HPV vaccination once states have implemented other approaches that have proven successful in raising vaccination rates, such as centralizing vaccination reminders in state health departments, focusing quality-improvement visits to providers on HPV vaccination, and training physicians to use announcements to introduce vaccination. The authors noted that a limitation of this study is that it asked about hypothetical school-entry requirements, rather than actual laws, and did not describe the scope of opt-out provisions. The researchers said parents' opinions could differ if they were discussing actual legislation, and may vary depending on whether the opt-out provisions were based on medical, religious, or philosophical reasons. This study was funded by a grant from the Merck Sharp & Dohme Investigator Studies Program. Brewer has received HPV vaccine-related grants from or been on paid advisory boards for Merck Sharp & Dohme and Pfizer. Brewer is also chair of the National HPV Vaccination Roundtable.
