News sign-up Merck drives digital progress News, 24 April 2017 Topics Digital media planning & buying NEW YORK: Merck, the pharma group, is pushing ahead into digital marketing despite the challenges of tight regulation and the need to transform long-standing mindsets. Patricia Brown, Executive Director/US Marketing at Merck & Co, discussed this subject at the 2017 ePharma Summit held by KNect365. "First of all, we are seeing a change in digital," she said. (For more details, including further strategic tips for pharma brands, read WARC's exclusive report: Merck dives into digital.) "There are two brand teams at Merck, with high digital IQs, that have significantly increased investment in the last year. And they've significantly decreased what they spend on TV. So, it is happening." As a 128-year-old organisation, Merck fits the definition of a legacy business. But Brown has found huge receptivity to digital inside its four walls. "What we've done in the last 12 to 18 months is to take a very true, real environmental scan to know what was important to our customers in the marketplace," she said. "We then did [an] internal environmental scan to see how far off we were." Their discovery: "An enormous gap. So, we got approval for a digital strategy with key areas of focus. We communicated that broadly. We incorporated [digital] objectives into everyone's personal objectives, which is critical," she continued. "We have alignment of senior leaders, which is also extremely important. And we are starting to shift the way we work across functions." Many companies, in fact, are seeking to adopt a test-and-learn approach to digital marketing, and Brown suggested pharma firms have a natural advantage in this space. "We are trying to work with that – to inspire people to do things differently. And the way we do that is to go back to our roots. All of us are trained in a scientific method. And that is: test and learn," she said. "You do an experiment. And when you learn, you do another experiment. And when you share that with our group, they say, 'Oh yeah, we're doing that across the business. We are just not thinking about it that way'. That seems to be helping when we frame it that way."

With a focus on both improving the quality of care for head and neck cancer patients and decreasing incidences of these cancers, the collaboration between the three organizations aims to highlight the importance of early detection and treatment. The joint initiative encompasses a comprehensive awareness program with a series of educational activities. On 17 April, awareness events were held at HMC’s National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Al Ahli Hospital, Mall of Qatar, and three primary health centers. The events targeted clinical and non-clinical staff, patients and their families, and the general public. Experts report that the most common head and neck cancers form in the nasal cavity, sinus, lips, mouth, salivary glands, throat or larynx. While these cancers are less common than others, they are often complex to treat. According to the National Qatar Cancer Registry at the Ministry of Public Health, in 2015 head and neck cancers accounted for approximately four percent of overall malignant cancers in Qatar. Of these cases, more than 60 percent were diagnosed as late stage cancers. Most cases occurred in individuals aged between 45 and 49 years. Dr. Mohammed Ussama Al Homsi, Senior Consultant in the Oncology Department at NCCCR stated: “We are concerned about the lack of awareness of head and neck                                                                                                                                                 cancers. Symptoms may be as simple as a sore throat that doesn’t go away or a lump or sore that doesn’t heal. I take this opportunity to stress the significance of frequent screening as a preventive measure.” He continued: “A screening for head and neck cancer should be included in one’s annual health checkup. Just like any other cancer,when found early, most cancers in the head and neck can be treated and cured. In other words, the earlier the disease is detected and diagnosed, the more treatment options that are available and the chances of living longer are increased.” Dr. Al Homsi added that people with certain risk factors have an increased susceptibility to head and neck cancers. “While smoking remains the leading risk factor for this type of cancer, the human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is emerging as a possible risk factor for certain types of head and neck cancer.” Other factors that may increase the chance of developing head and neck cancer include, but are not limited to, long-term exposure to sunlight, wood dust, and/or nickel dust. The good news is that many of these risk factors can be completely eliminated, lowering the chances of developing head and neck cancers. Dr. Al Homsi said according to cancer experts, excess weight, poor nutrition, and lack of physical activity increase both the risk of developing cancer and the rate of cancer growth. “Eating healthily is therefore an important step in reducing the risk of developing head and neck cancer and other related diseases,” he said, adding: “Once diagnosed, one’s ability to fight cancer can be improved by undergoing a couple of simple steps, namely maintaining healthy habits and getting regular health checkups. Finding a balance between food intake and physical activity remains a major step towards achieving good health and a cancer-free population.”  Read more: HMC Ambulance Service Medical Communication Center reaccredited by the International Academy of Emergency Dispatch HMC highlights the need for people to be aware of the warning signs and risk factors for stroke HMC improving patient care with new national clinical imaging platform Join Albawaba Business Follow Albawaba Business Rate Article: 2.5 Select ratingPoorOkayGoodGreatAwesome   Tweet comment (0) Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Pinterest Delicious Stumbleupon Digg Reddit EDITOR’S CHOICE 1 - 4 OF 12 ‘My joy is incomplete’ says longest-serving female Palestinian prisoner upon release Turkey starts reconstruction in Syria Tunisia TV channel linked to President: 'Insult, defame' anti-corruption watchdog Egyptian ‘woman with the cart’ gifted new van after inspiring sympathy on social media Holy city of Makkah to house largest gold mine in the Kingdom Activists in Nigeria pressure Israel to lift Gaza siege Afghanistan welcomes tourism to pristine mountains and medieval ruins Bahrain: Lorry driver to be deported after jumping red lights Expats out: Saudi malls to hire nationals only Omani imam won $640,000 in prize money - and turned it down!

Photos Videos Topics Live PAK 201/4 (78.2) - WI 286/10 (95) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Sonu Nigam Vijay Mallya TTV Dinakaran Donald Trump IPL 2017 News Health INSIGHT-NASH: The next untapped pharma market gives investors many options Shares1 Mon, 24 Apr 2017-10:35am , Reuters Large drugmakers with piles of cash are on the hunt for promising medicines being developed by small companies to treat NASH, a progressive fatty liver disease poised to become the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020. The eventual market for the complex disease, formally known as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, is forecast to be $20 billion to $35 billion as populations with fatty diets increasingly fall victim to a condition with no approved treatments. With intense competition and pricing pressure eroding sales of medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other lucrative disease categories, and an already crowded field for developmental cancer drugs, big pharma sees NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making. "We are actively looking on the outside for opportunities... to complement our internal program," Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer for internal medicine for Pfizer, told Reuters. Pfizer currently has three early-stage drugs in the clinic aiming to block or reverse fat accumulation in the liver. "We believe that even though we're a bit behind, we still might come out with the best-in-class molecules," Birnbaum said. Bristol-Myers Squibb also confirmed it is looking for additional assets to enhance its internally-developed NASH drugs. It presented promising data for its lead NASH candidate at the big European liver meeting in Amsterdam that ended on Sunday. "It's early days, but keep your seatbelts fastened," said Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and one of the world's leading liver disease experts. Estimates for the prevalence of NASH in nations with fatty diets range from 5 to 20 percent of the population with up to 15 million potentially affected in the United States alone. Driven by the obesity and diabetes epidemics, the disease guarantees an enormous pool of patients for decades, making it a prime target for deals for promising therapies for NASH and its consequences - advanced fibrosis and liver-destroying cirrhosis. The very early stages of many of the drugs, and the complicated nature of the disease itself, pose risks for drug developers and their investors alike. But the upside potential is still enticing to Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director and senior healthcare analyst at Rodman and Renshaw. He calls NASH one of the hottest spaces in the healthcare sector. "We anticipate that there will be more transactions, more licensing deals from big pharma involving emerging biotechnology companies," he said. GILEAD A PIONEER Just a few years ago, Gilead Sciences was the lone large drugmaker talking about NASH. It was undeterred after its most advanced anti-fibrosis candidate failed, striking deals with two small companies to acquire additional NASH programs. Liver disease experts were impressed last year by Phase II data from a Gilead-developed drug that demonstrated fibrosis regression after just six months. Allergan became a top NASH contender with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics and a deal with private Akarna Therapeutics on the same day last year. Other big drugmakers with licensing deals or options on future deals in the space include Novartis, Merck & Co , Bristol-Myers and Johnson & Johnson. While many of the drugs in development are two-to-five years from reaching the market if they get that far, betting on the feverish deal activity gives investors a chance to profit near term. Many small companies developing drugs with a wide variety of approaches across the disease spectrum do not have partners. They include Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Galectin Therapeutics, Genfit and Galmed Pharmaceuticals, all with a chance to be among the first to market, as well as Enanta Pharmaceuticals , Durect Corp and little-known U.K.-traded Tiziana Life Sciences with assets much earlier in development. Galectin, which expects key data in December, has commenced preliminary partnership discussions, its chief operating officer told Reuters. Len Yaffe, who runs the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund and has long followed the liver disease space, said investors with tolerance for risk could do well to buy shares in several small-cap and micro-cap companies with promising NASH drugs in early development. He said if any one has stellar data, or lands a deal, the payoff could be considerable. When Allergan announced the $1.7 billion deal for Tobira, for example, that company's shares jumped from under $5 to over $30. Yaffe, who had singled out Tobira to investors prior to its acquisition, said the Durect drug "looks incredibly promising as it relates to inflammation and fibrosis." Enanta has the advantage of cash flow from its hepatitis C partnership with AbbVie to fund its NASH program. "You want to bet on companies that can survive even if they don't get a partnership this year or next year," Selvaraju said. Enanta Chief Executive Jay Luly said companies in earlier stages of development may have an advantage over the first wave of experimental treatments as regulators' thinking on clinical trial goals and what makes an approvable product in such a new market evolves. "When we get there, the development pathway could be not only more clearly defined, but more simplified," Luly said. MANY SHOTS ON GOAL Drugmakers are taking a wide range of approaches to treat the complex disease, given multiple health issues among NASH patients that contribute to the liver damage, such as heart disease and diabetes. There are drugs targeting inflammation to prevent or reduce fibrotic scarring. Some address lipid regulation to reduce liver fat, while others attempt to directly halt or reverse fibrosis. And some companies are testing diabetes treatments to assess their ability to also improve NASH. "The big sea change from two years ago - apart from an increased number of players - is a fairly rapid acceptance of the fact that we're going to be seeking combination therapies since it's a disease that involves multiple pathways," said Mt. Sinai's Friedman. "In the end, whatever the mechanism is, it needs to yield decreased fibrosis," he said, noting that progressing fibrosis is what ultimately causes serious health consequences. The knowledge that multiple drugs will be needed for therapeutic combinations to treat NASH, and that most experimental drugs fail, are big drivers for deal activity. Drugmakers are looking to improve chances of success by amassing numerous experimental drugs for their NASH programs. Some experts said drugs that target late-stage fibrosis and cirrhosis, where the risk of cancer and liver failure is highest, are likely to gain earliest acceptance from insurers. That fits the strategy of tiny Conatus Pharmaceuticals , whose shares more than doubled when it signed a $50 million collaboration deal with Novartis. Conatus is targeting end-stage disease with the goal of preventing transplants. But given the millions of potential patients and expense of treating advanced disease, there should be incentive for insurers to embrace medicines that target earlier stage NASH as well. "There's still a major role for drugs that work on the front end," said Dr. Arun Sanyal, a leading liver disease expert whose Virginia Commonwealth University lab discovered the compound being developed by Durect. "One size will not fit all." (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

The US FDA has granted approval to Samsung’s Renflexis, a biosimilar referencing Remicade (infliximab). Akin to generics of chemical drugs, biosimilars refer to cheaper, near-replicas of live cell biologic drugs whose patents have expired. (Samsung Bioepis) Renflexis is the second Remicade-referencing biosimilar to score approval by the US regulator. The agency had approved Korea-based Celltrion’s Inflectra in April last year, paving the way for the firm’s marketing partner Pfizer to start selling the drug in the US from November. “Through relentless process innovation and an uncompromising commitment to quality, we remain committed to advancing one of the industry‘s strongest biosimilar pipelines,” Samsung Bioepis spokesperson Hyun Min-gi said. With the new approval, J&J’s Remicade — the firm’s topselling drug with annual sales of around $5 billion — will now be competing against two cheaper alternative infliximab drugs in the US. Samsung Bioepis’ Renflexis will be sold and marketed in the US via the firm’s local partner Merck & Co, also known as MSD. The firms have yet to announce a price scheme for its new biosimilar. Meanwhile, Pfizer has priced Inflectra 15 percent cheaper than the originator drug in the US, and has been steadily eating into Pfizer’s market share in the country over the past few months. Remicade’s US sales fell 2.4 percent on-year to $1.18 billion in the first quarter of this year, while worldwide sales dropped 6 percent on-year to $1.67 billion during the period, according to J&J’s quarterly earnings report. Renflexis is likely to begin sales from late this year, as companies are required to wait 180 days after approval to begin selling a biosimilar, according to the latest interpretation of local US regulations governing the new biologic drug category. The two Remicade-referencing biosimilars approved in the US have already launched in additional markets including major European countries, Australia, Canada as well as Korea. Celltrion has been selling Inflectra under the name Remsima in Europe since 2014, while Samsung Bioepis began selling Renflexis in the region under the name Flixabi from 2016 via its marketing partner and minority shareholder Biogen. The Korean drugmakers have already introduced or are awaiting regulatory approval for biosimilars referencing other blockbuster drugs sold worldwide. Celltrion’s Rituxan (rituximab) biosimilar, Truxima, has scored approval from the European Medicines Agency and has begun sales in the region. It is seeking the EMA’s approval of its Herceptin (trastuzumab) biosimilar, Herzuma, as well. Samsung Bioepis has also commercialized a biosimilar referencing Amgen’s Enbrel (etanercept) via Biogen in European markets, Australia, Canada and Korea. It is currently awaiting the EMA’s approval of its biosimilars referencing Herceptin as well as Humira (adalimumab). A biosimilar referencing Lantus (insulin glargine), developed by MSD with partial funding from Samsung Bioepis, obtained the EMA’s approval in January this year, and has begun sales in the region under the name Lusduna. Samsung Bioepis is 93.3 percent owned by Kospi-listed Samsung BioLogics, a contract manufacturer of biologic drugs developed by clients including Roche and Bristol-Myers Squibb. The remainder of the shares are held by US-based Biogen. The two Samsung units are at the heart of Samsung Group’s push into biopharmaceuticals as it seeks leadership in new, promising sectors beyond its flagship electronics business. Samsung Bioepis had sought to pursue an initial public offering on the US-based Nasdaq in 2015, yet postponed its plans citing market volatility. The firm has yet to announce a timetable for its IPO.

The eventual market for the complex disease, formally known as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, is forecast to be $20 billion to $35 billion as populations with fatty diets increasingly fall victim to a condition with no approved treatments. With intense competition and pricing pressure eroding sales of medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other lucrative disease categories, and an already crowded field for developmental cancer drugs, big pharma sees NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making. "We are actively looking on the outside for opportunities... to complement our internal program," Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer for internal medicine for Pfizer, told Reuters. Pfizer currently has three early-stage drugs in the clinic aiming to block or reverse fat accumulation in the liver. "We believe that even though we're a bit behind, we still might come out with the best-in-class molecules," Birnbaum said. Bristol-Myers Squibb also confirmed it is looking for additional assets to enhance its internally-developed NASH drugs. It presented promising data for its lead NASH candidate at the big European liver meeting in Amsterdam that ended on Sunday. "It's early days, but keep your seatbelts fastened," said Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and one of the world's leading liver disease experts. Estimates for the prevalence of NASH in nations with fatty diets range from 5 to 20 percent of the population with up to 15 million potentially affected in the United States alone. Driven by the obesity and diabetes epidemics, the disease guarantees an enormous pool of patients for decades, making it a prime target for deals for promising therapies for NASH and its consequences - advanced fibrosis and liver-destroying cirrhosis. The very early stages of many of the drugs, and the complicated nature of the disease itself, pose risks for drug developers and their investors alike. But the upside potential is still enticing to Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director and senior healthcare analyst at Rodman and Renshaw. He calls NASH one of the hottest spaces in the healthcare sector. "We anticipate that there will be more transactions, more licensing deals from big pharma involving emerging biotechnology companies," he said. GILEAD A PIONEER Just a few years ago, Gilead Sciences was the lone large drugmaker talking about NASH. It was undeterred after its most advanced anti-fibrosis candidate failed, striking deals with two small companies to acquire additional NASH programs. Liver disease experts were impressed last year by Phase II data from a Gilead-developed drug that demonstrated fibrosis regression after just six months. Allergan became a top NASH contender with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics and a deal with private Akarna Therapeutics on the same day last year. Other big drugmakers with licensing deals or options on future deals in the space include Novartis, Merck & Co , Bristol-Myers and Johnson & Johnson. While many of the drugs in development are two-to-five years from reaching the market if they get that far, betting on the feverish deal activity gives investors a chance to profit near term. Many small companies developing drugs with a wide variety of approaches across the disease spectrum do not have partners. They include Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Galectin Therapeutics, Genfit and Galmed Pharmaceuticals, all with a chance to be among the first to market, as well as Enanta Pharmaceuticals , Durect Corp and little-known U.K.-traded Tiziana Life Sciences with assets much earlier in development. Galectin, which expects key data in December, has commenced preliminary partnership discussions, its chief operating officer told Reuters. Len Yaffe, who runs the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund and has long followed the liver disease space, said investors with tolerance for risk could do well to buy shares in several small-cap and micro-cap companies with promising NASH drugs in early development. He said if any one has stellar data, or lands a deal, the payoff could be considerable. When Allergan announced the $1.7 billion deal for Tobira, for example, that company's shares jumped from under $5 to over $30. Yaffe, who had singled out Tobira to investors prior to its acquisition, said the Durect drug "looks incredibly promising as it relates to inflammation and fibrosis." Enanta has the advantage of cash flow from its hepatitis C partnership with AbbVie to fund its NASH program. "You want to bet on companies that can survive even if they don't get a partnership this year or next year," Selvaraju said. Enanta Chief Executive Jay Luly said companies in earlier stages of development may have an advantage over the first wave of experimental treatments as regulators' thinking on clinical trial goals and what makes an approvable product in such a new market evolves. "When we get there, the development pathway could be not only more clearly defined, but more simplified," Luly said. MANY SHOTS ON GOAL Drugmakers are taking a wide range of approaches to treat the complex disease, given multiple health issues among NASH patients that contribute to the liver damage, such as heart disease and diabetes. There are drugs targeting inflammation to prevent or reduce fibrotic scarring. Some address lipid regulation to reduce liver fat, while others attempt to directly halt or reverse fibrosis. And some companies are testing diabetes treatments to assess their ability to also improve NASH. "The big sea change from two years ago - apart from an increased number of players - is a fairly rapid acceptance of the fact that we're going to be seeking combination therapies since it's a disease that involves multiple pathways," said Mt. Sinai’s Friedman. "In the end, whatever the mechanism is, it needs to yield decreased fibrosis," he said, noting that progressing fibrosis is what ultimately causes serious health consequences. The knowledge that multiple drugs will be needed for therapeutic combinations to treat NASH, and that most experimental drugs fail, are big drivers for deal activity. Drugmakers are looking to improve chances of success by amassing numerous experimental drugs for their NASH programs. Some experts said drugs that target late-stage fibrosis and cirrhosis, where the risk of cancer and liver failure is highest, are likely to gain earliest acceptance from insurers. That fits the strategy of tiny Conatus Pharmaceuticals , whose shares more than doubled when it signed a $50 million collaboration deal with Novartis. Conatus is targeting end-stage disease with the goal of preventing transplants. But given the millions of potential patients and expense of treating advanced disease, there should be incentive for insurers to embrace medicines that target earlier stage NASH as well. "There's still a major role for drugs that work on the front end," said Dr. Arun Sanyal, a leading liver disease expert whose Virginia Commonwealth University lab discovered the compound being developed by Durect. "One size will not fit all."

Kikuo Johnson Rewriting Life Immunotherapy Pioneer James Allison Has Unfinished Business with Cancer Why do most patients fail to respond to the newest cures? by Adam Piore April 24, 2017 On the day I arrive at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to meet James Allison and his longtime collaborator Padmanee Sharma, they are nowhere to be found. The previous day, one of their colleagues informs me, Allison was summoned up on stage by Willie Nelson, in front of 60,000 people at a rock festival in Austin, to deliver a harmonica solo. They are still on their way back. By now, Allison is almost used to adulation. There are even murmurings that his work in cancer immunotherapy might win him the Nobel Prize. Twenty years ago, he was the first to show it’s possible to turbocharge the body’s response to cancer with a drug that releases the immune system so that it destroys tumors on its own. The drug he identified to do that, called Yervoy, went on sale in 2011 to treat metastatic skin cancer. In lucky patients, it causes otherwise fatal tumors to melt away. By last year, worldwide sales of Yervoy and two newer drugs had reached $6 billion a year, and the medications had been given to more than 100,000 people. This transformative new class of immunotherapy agents, known as checkpoint inhibitors, is acknowledged to be the most important advance against cancer since chemotherapy. Allison, who is 68, is an unimposing man, with a slight Texas drawl and a stringy mane of white hair. He still finds it hard not to cry when he meets cancer survivors saved by his discovery. But I had gone to talk to him about unfinished business. That is because for every miracle cure, for every Jimmy Carter or 22-year-old melanoma patient pulled back from death, there are many more people who, for reasons that no one understands, can’t be saved. Of all patients dying from all types of cancer in America this year, only one in 12 would be expected to benefit from any immunotherapy drug. Some even argue that direct-to-consumer marketing, including a Super Bowl ad, has created dangerous expectations. Patients cashing in their last chance will, more likely than not, find themselves among the large majority for whom drugs like Allison’s don’t yet work. Allison has known about the shortcomings longer than anyone. He says they dampen any sense of triumph and shadow him at award banquets. Sometimes, he stays awake at night. “About 22 percent of melanoma patients that get a single round of treatment with Yervoy are alive 10 years later,” he said after receiving a Lasker Award in 2015, and then added solemnly: “We got to get that up, and we got to do it in more kinds of cancer.” James Allison with his wife and scientific partner, Padmanee Sharma. At MD Anderson I was introduced to what Allison calls the “platform.” It is a large-scale effort to determine why the immune system at times acts like the perfect weapon but in other cases fails to kick into action. Sharma, a Guyanese immigrant and practicing cancer doctor, oversees the collection of tumor samples from 100 of Anderson’s 165 cancer trials that involve immunotherapy. The tissue is then scrutinized by her lab and Allison’s for clues to how the battle is proceeding. “What is the immune response doing that leads to tumor rejection? What is the immune response doing that it stops rejecting the tumor and [it] starts growing again?” Sharma asks. “Those are big questions that we still need to understand.” Recommended for You Google’s New Chip Is a Stepping Stone to Quantum Computing Supremacy With Neuralink, Elon Musk Promises Human-to-Human Telepathy. Don’t Believe It. The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI Big Data Exposes Big Falsehoods Google’s Health Study Seeks 10,000 Volunteers to Give Up Their Medical Secrets The answers can’t come too soon for some. The pharmaceutical industry and research institutions are in the midst of a pell-mell sprint into thousands of clinical trials based on new immunotherapy agents. As of October, by one tally, more than 166,736 patients were being sought to fill slots in studies of drugs involving a single protein, called PD-1. The overall number of immunotherapy trials probably tops 3,000, says Jeff Bluestone, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who also serves as president and CEO of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. But a growing number of researchers fret that the flood of clinical trials is uncoördinated, redundant, and potentially counterproductive. That is because in many cases, the basic science remains little understood. “This is not sustainable,” Ira Mellman, the keynote speaker at the annual meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, told his colleagues when he took the stage last fall. Mellman, a vice president at the biotech behemoth Genentech, put up a byzantine diagram, consisting of concentric circles crammed with small type. The visually overwhelming slide showed trials under way to test immune-boosting therapeutics. His industry, he said, is “[throwing] plates of pasta against the wall, and hoping that something is going to stick.” A Time Line of Cancer Treatment Over 150 years, doctors learned to treat cancer with surgery, x-rays, chemotherapy, and vaccines. Immunotherapy is the latest weapon in the arsenal. Mellman told me that while Allison hadn’t invented immunotherapy, his drug had been the one that clarified its potential. Now, he says, Allison’s is one of the “few serious efforts” to better understand the mechanisms by which the immune system is killing cancers and the reasons why, too often, it is still not seeing them. “We would have a much better shot at doing what’s best for patients, doing best for science, if we understand mechanisms,” he told me. “You can just wildly try different things and hope that something works, or you can go back and try again and understand the basis of all of this. Until we know that, we’re not going to really understand why some respond and some don’t.” Checkpoint discovery Cancer is personal for Allison. At 10, he held the hand of his mother, Constance, in tiny Alice, Texas, and wondered at the burn marks up and down her neck. He had not expected her to die. Only later did he learn that the marks were from radiation, and that cancer had killed her. By the time he was 15, cancer had consumed two of his uncles. When Allison first began to chart a scientific career, he says, he recoiled from cancer. Back then, it seemed, there were few real clues. And immunology, the field he had picked, had a particular reputation for serving up fool’s gold when it came to the disease. “I couldn’t get any purchase on it,” he recalls. “I wasn’t going to go crashing into something until I knew how it worked.” At that time, in the 1970s, T cells—those tiny assassins that allow the body to fight off infections—had only recently been discovered. Allison was fascinated to learn there were molecular-level sentinels that patrolled the human body looking for trouble—that “if they see something wrong, they just deal with it.” He thought: “What could be cooler than that?” In the late 1980s, James Allison began studying the molecular basis of T-cell behavior. The existence of such immune cells did raise an obvious question: if T cells were designed to protect the body by killing infected and diseased cells, how was it that cancer managed to elude them? By then, there were hints that sometimes tumors did in fact succumb. In the 19th century surgeons had inoculated cancer patients with heat-killed bacteria, with inconsistent results. In 1980, a Time magazine cover spotlighted a scientific frenzy around a molecule called interferon, which sends the immune system into overdrive. But the treatment was indiscriminate, as likely to harm a person as heal. “It was crazy, because people were doing things and they didn’t understand how they worked,” -Allison remembers. “People just said: ‘Oh, well. It causes T cells to grow. So we put tons of it into people.”’ 1880–1957 c. 1880: Surgeon William Stewart Halsted argues that the recurrence of cancer after surgery is due to traces that remain. He helps pioneer the radical mastectomy. 1896: Emil Grubbe uses an x-ray tube to perform radiation therapy on Rose Lee, a mother of four with breast cancer. 1949: Mustard gas is approved by the FDA as the first chemotherapy after it is shown to destroy malignant white blood cells in lymphoma patients. 1957: The first bone marrow transplants are performed in Seattle. Although all six patients die within 100 days, the technique is a breakthrough. Allison instead began studying the molecular receptors present on the T cell’s surface. One of his most important findings was to locate a receptor called CD28 that acts like a gas pedal. When it gets engaged, it is one of two key signals—in addition to a receptor that actually locks onto a tumor cell and functions somewhat like an ignition switch—that a T cell needs to initiate an attack. Even when those switches were flipped to the “on” position, however, such attacks were often short-lived and sometimes failed to start up at all. By 1992, Allison thought there might be a third switch. The most likely candidate: CTLA-4, a mysterious receptor sometimes spotted on T cells. But both Allison and Bluestone, the UCSF immunologist, found that this molecule behaved unexpectedly. When proteins bound to it, it didn’t turn a T cell on—it turned it off. These molecular brakes were called checkpoints. Scientists subsequently demonstrated why evolution might have favored checkpoints. When they created mice lacking CTLA-4, their T cells ended up attacking their own bodies after an infection. Without an off switch, the mice “died within a few weeks, of massive autoimmune disease,” Bluestone recalls. Bluestone initially saw the chance to develop new types of immune--suppressing drugs—say, for organ transplant patients. But Allison saw a different possibility. Releasing these brakes might strengthen the immune system’s response against cancer. One of Allison’s graduate students had already developed an antibody able to stick to a T cell’s CTLA-4 receptors, essentially jamming the switch. Allison instructed a postdoc to inject the antibody into mice riddled with tumors. The results, he recalls, “were spectacular.” “The tumors were cured,” Allison says. “I mean, it was 100 percent and zero percent—no statistics necessary.” Miracle drugs The drug, the first of the checkpoint inhibitors, would become known as ipilimumab or Yervoy, and it is now sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Manhattan. Human studies began around 2000 on 14 patients stricken with metastatic melanoma, who were steeling themselves for their finals days in hospice. But after the trial began, three saw their tumors shrink. Allison, who moved to New York City’s Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2004 to be closer to the trials, soon met one of the patients his drug had saved. Sharon Belvin was in her 20s, and had just finished college and gotten married, when metastatic melanomas appeared in her lungs, liver, and brain. She was terminal by the time her physician enrolled her in the first phase II clinical trial. The day Allison met her, she’d been in remission for a year. “She hugged me,” Allison recalls. “Her husband hugged me, and her mother and father were there, and they all hugged me. It was just sobbing, and everybody was really happy. I walked to my office and I had a lot to think about. I cried all the way there.” Allison says by that time he was aware of his drug’s limitations. It didn’t help everyone, and it didn’t work in most cancers. And if he needed a reminder of the stakes, it came in 2005, when Allison’s brother succumbed to prostate cancer after eight years. The same year, doctors found early-stage cancer in Allison’s own prostate. He had surgery rather than chance drug treatment. As soon as cancer researchers learned that Yervoy worked on some previously incurable patients but not on others, many asked the obvious question: was it possible the body had more than one checkpoint? Another molecule, called PD-1, was quickly identified and successfully targeted with checkpoint inhibitors. Allison’s Yervoy was approved in 2011 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for patients with melanoma. Three years later the FDA approved Merck’s PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and a similar drug, also from Bristol-Myers Squibb, called nivolumab (Opdivo). One or both have since been approved to treat some types of lung cancer, kidney cancer, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, creating the most important new class of cancer drugs in a century. Gatling gun The day I arrived at MD Anderson to tour the platform, an Argentinean immunologist, Luis Vence, greeted me in a fluorescent-lit hallway. Our first stop was a lab where he swung open the door of a refrigerator-size machine to reveal 28 black canisters arrayed around a central hub, like the bundled cylinders of a Gatling gun. When cancerous samples come in, they are treated with fluorescent antibodies designed to stick to CTLA-4, PD-1, and other molecules on the surface of immune cells. The machine can then, in a few seconds, use a laser to scan all 10,000 or so cells from a biopsy, count them, and separate them by type. Vence compared it to sifting through multicolored ping-pong balls. In a nearby lab, one of his colleagues, Jorge Blando, directed me to a microscope through which I could see a panorama of a cellular battle under way. The slide contained a slice of bone marrow riddled with tumors. These were recognizable by their larger, fuller-shaped cells. Among them were the tiny immune cells, stained brown, that had infiltrated and begun to attack. Others seemed to hover around the periphery. How many eventually make it in—and how long they survive to keep fighting—determines whether the tumor is defeated. “What you are looking at in cancer is natural selection at a high speed,” Vence says. “When you treat it with chemotherapy, maybe you destroy 99 percent of the tumor. But the 1 percent that is left is resistant to chemotherapy. That’s the one that grows back and basically kills you.” This explains why even the latest targeted drugs—those designed to hit very specific molecules on, say, a breast cancer cell—typically extend patients’ life by only a few months. 1981–2006 1981: A vaccine against hepatitis B, which causes liver cancer, becomes the first cancer vaccine to reach market in the U.S. 1995: James ­Allison rids mice of tumors using a new type of treatment that unleashes the immune system: a checkpoint inhibitor. 1997: The antibody rituximab is approved to treat non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It is the first molecularly targeted cancer drug. 2006: Cancer enters the genome era. Johns Hopkins scientists apply high-speed DNA sequencing to 22 tumors. 2006: Mass vaccinations begin against the human papillomavirus, the cause of cervical cancer. Yet Vence and others believe that the immune system is inherently capable of spotting and countering any move a cancer makes. How else to explain how some advanced melanoma patients, who had tumors in their lungs or brain, are disease-free years after a course of Yervoy infusions? “The beauty of immunotherapy,” Vence says, “is that the immune system can evolve at the same time, along with the tumor. It can keep up much easier.” It was Sharma who had the idea for the platform. When she began it, few volunteers were yet receiving Yervoy, then a relatively new and unproven drug. So Sharma persuaded patients slated to have less serious tumors removed by surgery to take small doses. A biopsy sample was collected before the drug was administered. Then, comparing the initial cancer and the excised tumor, the lab could use state-of-the-art technology to track the immune response and begin to examine why it didn’t always work. Sharma’s first finding came fairly quickly. In tissue from bladder cancers treated with CTLA-4 antibodies, readings from the Gatling gun showed that T cells possessing a molecule called ICOS were “off the charts.” Sharma’s reaction was elation mixed with confusion. T cells with ICOS on them had previously been found only in the tiny sacs in the lymph nodes known as follicles, and they were believed to suppress immune responses, not enhance them. Allison decided to engineer mice whose tumors triggered ICOS. In their tumors, CTLA-4 was four times as effective. ICOS, it turns out, was part of cascade that made T cells attack tumor cells more effectively. At MD Anderson, where James Allison has his laboratory, researchers study why some people don’t benefit from immunotherapy. “I can’t believe we missed this,” Allison remembers telling Sharma. “This is amazing.” He’d been scooped by his collaborator and felt blown away. They’d been spending more and time together, talking on the phone and working on science. Now he blurted out: “I love you!” Sharma recalls plowing forward with the conversation as if nothing had been said. But he had said it. The pair were married in a small ceremony in 2014. With the help of the Boston venture capital firm Third Rock Ventures, they also started a company called Jounce Therapeutics that is developing a drug to increase ICOS levels. Human tests got under way last year, and although it’s too early to know how the drug is working, the idea has already been remunerative. Jounce went public in January, raising $117 million. Now Sharma drives a Tesla with a vanity plate that reads “ICOS.” On Allison’s Porsche, the plate says “CTLA4.” A tidal wave During the same meeting at which -Mellman castigated the industry for spaghetti throwing, I saw Allison huddled over an iPad with another scientist, discussing some of the most recent findings he, Blando, and Sharma have made using their platform. They have been studying prostate cancer, in which no checkpoint drug yet seems to work. “What we found was that prostate cancer is almost a desert immunologically,” Allison says. “It’s a very cold tumor. There’s not much in there.” But Blando’s microscope has revealed that two drugs together might make the difference. Yervoy, he found, is necessary to drive T cells into the tumor, while the addition of a PD-1 drug makes sure they start killing. On the basis of these results and further research, Sharma and Allison convinced Bristol-Myers to combine the drugs in a clinical trial for advanced prostate cancer. Many immunotherapy trials don’t have as much new preclinical research behind them. One reason is that drug companies are still exploiting the original checkpoint discoveries. Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo has been approved for eight different cancer “indications” in two years, which must be a record. “The pace of the clinical applications of the science is much faster than understanding mechanisms in the lab,” says Gregory B. Lesinski, a scientist at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. 2011–2016 2011: Ipilimumab, or Yervoy, is approved to treat advanced melanoma. It is the first checkpoint inhibitor to reach the market. 2015: Former president Jimmy Carter, at 91, has melanoma in his liver and brain. A checkpoint drug leaves him cancer-free. 2016: Recognizing “amazing advances” in immune therapy, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden announce a new “moonshot” to cure cancer. But racing ahead of the science can also incur huge penalties. Last summer, a test of Opdivo as a first-choice treatment for advanced lung cancer led to one of the greatest fiascoes in the company’s history. Bristol had organized a trial that, in seeking the largest market, had essentially taken all comers. Its competitor Merck chose to test its drug in only lung cancer patients whose biomarkers indicated they were most likely to respond. When Merck reported its results in June, they were so good that independent monitors said patients in a control group using chemotherapy could switch to the new drug immediately. Then, in August, Bristol acknowledged that its own test had failed to show a benefit. Shares of the company dropped by 20 percent, and Bristol’s research and development chief eventually stepped down. The revival of immunotherapy now includes cancer-fighting viruses, genetically reprogrammed T cells, and vaccines designed to make tumors more visible to the immune system. Understanding the best way to put it all together is one of the crucial jobs ahead. At times, the explosion of new activity has tended to diminish the importance of Allison’s drug. Although it is still a billion-dollar-a-year blockbuster, Yervoy is now less often prescribed, in part because of side effects. One analyst called it the “iPod of immunotherapy”—a product overshadowed by the revolutionary change in thinking it caused. “Its importance would be hard to overstate in terms of what it has done to crystallize all the other activities,” says Mellman. “In my opinion, the idea that the immune system could target cancer didn’t start with Jim. But the field did.” Read next Spotting Cancer in a Vial of Blood He watched his brother die from a cancer no drug could cure. Now one of the world’s most renowned cancer researchers says it’s time for Plan B. Once a year Allison packs a sold-out venue at the American Society for Cancer Research. There his own band, the Checkpoints, plays to doctors and scientists, nearly all of whom are converts to immunotherapy. Yet Allison still recalls the reviewer who, two decades ago, told a journal to reject his breakthrough paper because “we all know that immunotherapy’s crap. It’s never worked.” Now that immunotherapy looks like the future, how far can it go? As I stood with Allison and Sharma in the MD Anderson parking lot, saying our good-byes, they seemed hopeful. Allison grabbed a piece of paper and sketched a graph. Start with everyone who has cancer, he said. Then, going out to the right, trace the survivors: how many are left after two months, six months, a year. It’s a line that, for most advanced cancers, drops relentlessly to the dust. But immunotherapy is lifting the curve. In melanoma, there are more and more long-term survivors. Allison calls it “raising the tail.” “Ultimately, the goal is to try to get the survival rate as high as we can in as many different kinds of cancers as we can,” he says. Allison has finally gotten purchase on the monster that darkened his childhood. And he is not going to let go.  Adam Piore is the author of The Body Builders: Inside the Science of the Engineered Human. Tech Obsessive?

Maryland Heights, MO, April 23, 2017 –(PR.com)– Psoriasis is a long-lasting autoimmune disease which is characterized by patches of abnormal skin. It is often diagnosed or at least suspected on the basis of its appearance and distribution. There is no cure for psoriasis, however, various treatments can help control the symptoms. Topical treatments such as form of lotions, foams, creams, ointments, gels, and shampoos containing steroids, tar preparations, and calcium- modulating drugs are very useful because they are relatively safe, fairly effective, and can be applied directly to the affected skin. Most oral medications act by targeting portions of the immune system. Phototherapy or light therapy, involves exposing the skin to ultraviolet light on a regular basis and under medical supervision. Biologic drugs are usually prescribed for moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis that has not responded to other treatments. Treatments for more advanced psoriasis include narrow-band ultraviolet B (UVB) light, psoralen with ultraviolet A (UVA) light retinoids (isotretinoin [Accutane, Claravis], acitretin [Soriatane]), methotrexate (particularly for arthritis), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), adalimumab (Humira), apremilast (Otezla), and secukinumab (Cosentyx). Currently, calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus (Prograf) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) are approved only for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Vitamin D analogues such as Calcipotriene (Dovonex) slow down the growth of skin cells.
