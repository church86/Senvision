The label change will lift the contraindication for stable moderate renal failure CKD stage 3. The maximum daily metformin dose will be 2000 mg/day in CKD stage 3a (GFR = 45-59 ml/min) and 1000 mg/day in CKD stage 3b (GFR = 30-44 ml/min), allowing a large additional group of type 2 diabetes patients with reduced kidney function to benefit from the treatment: In a recent analysis in CPRD, a UK medical record database, 32.7% of all diabetic patients had CKD stage 3, with 23.2% in CKD stage 3a and 9.5% in CKD stage 3b[1]. (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160518/369530LOGO ) "We are pleased to know that the EMA review now confirms that metformin can be safely used in patients with moderate renal failure," said Luciano Rossetti MD, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "We are proud of our heritage in the diabetes space that spans nearly 60 years, and began by bringing metformin to market. Since then we, and others, have continued to research on this product, and metformin is now amongst the best investigated oral medications for type 2 diabetes. The lift of the contraindication is, at least in part, also a result of our research, and it further supports the safe and effective use of metformin as first line treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes." Following a routine evaluation of the safety of metformin medicines, it was found that based on scientific evidence and clinical guidelines, patients with moderate renal failure may stand to benefit from treatment with metformin, and that the contraindication may therefore no longer be justified. Furthermore, the contraindication in CKD3a differed in metformin-containing products across Europe, as Merck had been granted a lift of the contraindication in CKD stage 3a recently. Based on this evidence, the EMA issued an Article 31 referral requesting a cumulative review of the benefit and risk in this patient group across all metformin-selling companies in the European Union. Leveraging around 60 years of experience in market as the metformin originator, Merck supported the EMA request by providing a comprehensive analysis of all available clinical data on the efficacy and safety of metformin in patients with CKD stage 3. This was balanced against a cumulative analysis of all case reports Merck has received for lactic acidosis, the very rare risk associated with metformin accumulation due to acute or severe renal failure. The EMA reviewed the data submitted by all companies, and as a result, the CHMP has issued a positive opinion on lifting the contraindication for treatment of type 2 diabetes patients with renal impairment CKD stage 3. Once approved by the European Commission, the Glucophage® product portfolio and Glucovance® will adopt this lift of contraindication for type 2 diabetes patients with moderate renal failure (CKD stage 3) through a label change. Glucophage® is already today on label in patients with CKD stage 3a in Europe and CKD stage 3 in Switzerland. About Glucophage® Glucophage® (metformin hydrochloride) is a prescription-only medicine indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in overweight patients when diet and exercise alone have failed. In adults, Glucophage® may be given alone or with oral antidiabetic agents, or with insulin. In children from 10 years old and adolescents, Glucophage® may be given alone or with insulin. A reduction of diabetic complications has been shown in overweight type 2 diabetic adult patients treated with Glucophage® as first-line therapy after diet failure. The most commonly reported side effects with Glucophage® are gastro-intestinal disturbances that may occur during treatment initiation and resolve spontaneously in most cases. The Glucophage® product portfolio comprises: Glucophage® IR (immediate release) and Glucophage® XR (extended release). In addition, Merck produces Glucovance® a fixed dose combination of metformin and glibenclamide.

The company said it has focused pharmaceutical pipeline and continuously developed it further. The company has also announced plans for growth in the following years. By 2022, Merck wants to generate sales of around 4 billion euros with new products. The company said its pharma pipeline offers new sales potential of around 2 billion euros up to 2022.

In July, it was revealed Ms Iskandar was renting out illegal garage conversions to desperate tenants - many of them beneficiaries - for hundreds of dollars a week. Now, documents released to Newshub show the Ministry for Social Development found Ms Iskandar was not lodging tenants' bonds. 'Predatory' property managers renting out Auckland garages That is illegal, and the MSD's fraud unit is investigating Ms Iskandar over concerns she could be taking advantage of vulnerable people. The MSD began receiving complaints about Ms Iskandar in January. However, it wasn't until after Newshub's story went to air in July that they escalated their action against her. Self-described property agent Ms Iskandar told Newshub's undercover journalist she was renting out an illegally converted garage for $420 a week. It was one of many. Work and Income paid $2000 towards the garage bond. It had no running water, kitchen or bathroom, and was lived in by a mum on a benefit with two young children. "Those are her perfect people - people who are vulnerable. She ain't going out looking for a worker, she is going to go for the Government," says Jacine Greaves, a former tenant of Ms Iskandar. In the past year Ms Iskandar received 364 Work and Income grants for tenants she was housing - but MSD's keeping the dollar value of those payments secret. "She would write you any kind of letter you needed to get more accommodation supplement," says Ms Greaves. Although the intelligence unit did not find any offending against the MSD by Ms Iskandar, officials noted: "often these cases turn out to be a crime against the client". It was decided more investigation was needed. However, despite knowing its clients - beneficiaries - could be at risk, MSD waited two months before handing the problem to its Auckland fraud team. That investigation is ongoing. During Newshub's investigation into Ms Iskandar, Work and Income said it had stopped referring clients to her six months earlier. However, emails show it was still sending single clients her way, where there were no other options available. Case managers clearly worried about the quality of Ms Iskandar's accommodation, the number of families sharing rooms, and rooms costing $280 per week. But they were conflicted about meeting urgent housing needs while reconciling concerns about suitability of the accommodation - in other words, they had few other options. Four months after the first complaints to MSD, case workers wanted to stop using Ms Iskandar but were "unsure whether they could legally do this". "The decent thing to do was to say 'we think this lady is dodgy - don't move into her property', considering they were the ones paying out the money," says Ms Greaves. MSD's intelligence unit concluded Newshub's investigation showed "Iskandar is doing what their assessment found earlier in the year". But it is only now MSD has decided to escalate things - Work and Income has been told not to make any more payments to Ms Iskandar. MSD was approached for an interview but would only agree to it if Newshub provided pre-written questions, which we declined to do. In a statement, national commissioner Penny Rounthwaite said MSD has "acknowledged delays in communication and identified where we had not escalated these concerns quickly enough". Lawyers for Ms Iskandar say they believe the information supplied to Newshub under the Official Information Act was provided in breach of their client's privacy. Newshub.

Joyce Lay; Dr. Joe Simpson; Chairman Senate Committee on Health, Senator Lanre Tejuoso; Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare, Dr. Rasha Kelej; President, African Fertility Society, Prof.Oladapo Ashiru; Intercontinental Region, Merck, Yiannis Viontzos and Commissioner for Health, Ogun State, Dr. Faye Iketubosin, during the ‘Merck More than a Mother' launch in Lagos ...recently Martins Ifijeh Over 250,000 Nigerian couples are currently battling with infertility in the country, Senate Chairman, Committee on Health, Senator LanreTejuosho has said. He said the issue of childlessness was often blamed on the women, even though reports suggest 50 per cent of infertility problems were caused by men. “This perception does not represent the reality, as the causes of infertility are often shared between males and females,” he said. Tejuosho, who spoke during the ‘Merck More than a Mother’ initiative by Merck Pharmaceuticals in Lagos, said one in four Nigerian couples have infertility challenge, adding that this statistics needs some attention. “We need to focus on how we will make the health institutions accessible to them for infertility management.” While decrying stigmatisation of women due to fertility challenges, he called for increased advocacy so that men will also know it is not an exclusive problem of the women. “When men are also very enlightened on this, they will have the courage to come out with their wives to seek treatment, so that treatment efforts can be directed accordingly. Awareness and education can greatly reduce the high number of infertility in the country,” he added. Noting that the federal government was putting all efforts on ground to ensure healthcare centres were strengthened across the country, Tejuosho explained that within the next two years, there would be 10,000 functioning health centres across political wards of the country. He also noted that the legislature will close ranks during health budgeting to make sure health centres have the capacity to attend to infertility issues. Lending his voice, the Chief Social Officer, Merck Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Rasha Kelej, said the main reason for the establishment of Merck was to empower women in Africa and also to create awareness to change the mindset of people against infertility. “We are here in Africa to empower women to create awareness, information, health and change of mindset. It makes me sad listening to stories on stigmatisation, especially when only the women are blamed for infertility. Men do not want to admit the fact that they can be the cause of infertility as well. “We want to change all these. We know changing culture and belief is very difficult, but with integration and cooperation of the media, there can be awareness on infertility, which would also help eliminate stigmatisation. Women are to be respected,” she added. While urging men to boldly cone out and speak of their fertility problem, she urged the society to respect women. “Even if they don’t have children, we should respect and appreciate them and they will become reproductive members of the society as well,” Kelej noted.

CHMP Adopts Positive Opinion of Metformin, Including Merck's Type 2 Diabetes Treatment Portfolio, in Patients with Renal Impairment CHMP Adopts Positive Opinion of Metformin, Including Merck's Type 2 Diabetes Treatment Portfolio, in Patients with Renal Impairment CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 14/10/2016 16:31 DARMSTADT, Germany, October 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Not intended for U.S. and UK-based media  Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued a positive opinion recommending extension of the label for all metformin-containing products, including the Glucophage® product portfolio and Glucovance®, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes patients. The label change will lift the contraindication for stable moderate renal failure CKD stage 3. The maximum daily metformin dose will be 2000 mg/day in CKD stage 3a (GFR = 45-59 ml/min) and 1000 mg/day in CKD stage 3b (GFR = 30-44 ml/min), allowing a large additional group of type 2 diabetes patients with reduced kidney function to benefit from the treatment: In a recent analysis in CPRD, a UK medical record database, 32.7% of all diabetic patients had CKD stage 3, with 23.2% in CKD stage 3a and 9.5% in CKD stage 3b[ 1 ].      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160518/369530LOGO ) "We are pleased to know that the EMA review now confirms that metformin can be safely used in patients with moderate renal failure," said Luciano Rossetti MD, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "We are proud of our heritage in the diabetes space that spans nearly 60 years, and began by bringing metformin to market. Since then we, and others, have continued to research on this product, and metformin is now amongst the best investigated oral medications for type 2 diabetes. The lift of the contraindication is, at least in part, also a result of our research, and it further supports the safe and effective use of metformin as first line treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes." Following a routine evaluation of the safety of metformin medicines, it was found that based on scientific evidence and clinical guidelines, patients with moderate renal failure may stand to benefit from treatment with metformin, and that the contraindication may therefore no longer be justified. Furthermore, the contraindication in CKD3a differed in metformin-containing products across Europe, as Merck had been granted a lift of the contraindication in CKD stage 3a recently. Based on this evidence, the EMA issued an Article 31 referral requesting a cumulative review of the benefit and risk in this patient group across all metformin-selling companies in the European Union. Leveraging around 60 years of experience in market as the metformin originator, Merck supported the EMA request by providing a comprehensive analysis of all available clinical data on the efficacy and safety of metformin in patients with CKD stage 3. This was balanced against a cumulative analysis of all case reports Merck has received for lactic acidosis, the very rare risk associated with metformin accumulation due to acute or severe renal failure. The EMA reviewed the data submitted by all companies, and as a result, the CHMP has issued a positive opinion on lifting the contraindication for treatment of type 2 diabetes patients with renal impairment CKD stage 3. Once approved by the European Commission, the Glucophage® product portfolio and Glucovance® will adopt this lift of contraindication for type 2 diabetes patients with moderate renal failure (CKD stage 3) through a label change. Glucophage® is already today on label in patients with CKD stage 3a in Europe and CKD stage 3 in Switzerland. About Glucophage®   Glucophage® (metformin hydrochloride) is a prescription-only medicine indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in overweight patients when diet and exercise alone have failed. In adults, Glucophage® may be given alone or with oral antidiabetic agents, or with insulin. In children from 10 years old and adolescents, Glucophage® may be given alone or with insulin. A reduction of diabetic complications has been shown in overweight type 2 diabetic adult patients treated with Glucophage® as first-line therapy after diet failure. The most commonly reported side effects with Glucophage® are gastro-intestinal disturbances that may occur during treatment initiation and resolve spontaneously in most cases. The Glucophage® product portfolio comprises: Glucophage® IR (immediate release) and Glucophage® XR (extended release). In addition, Merck produces Glucovance® a fixed dose combination of metformin and glibenclamide.

The New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson will play an active role in the project by assisting the state government in achieving the goal. The MoU was signed when Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao called on top leadership of the company on the second day of his business visit to the US. Rama Rao met Paul Stoffel, Chief Scientific Officer and Chairman of Pharmaceuticals Division, Melinda Richter, Head of JLabs and Jonathan Collard, VP, Government Affairs and Policy, Asia Pacific. Stoffel was very enthusiastic about proposed Hyderabad Pharma City, and will be visiting India and Hyderabad next year, said a statement from the minister's office here on Friday. Richter assured the Telangana delegation that they would explore the possibility of setting up of JLabs unit in Hyderabad. Later, the minister met Sanat Chattopadhyay, Executive VP and President, Merck Manufacturing Division, who mentioned the firm's intent for a social partnership with Telangana Government on arresting infant diarrhoea. Merck also expressed interest in setting up manufacturing base in Telangana in collaboration with local partners. It also evinced interest in setting up "vaccine centre of excellence" in Hyderabad which will also be used for imparting skills, providing training based on the specific requirement of the companies. Nanette Cocero, President for Emerging Markets for Innovative Health business, Pfizer and Jeffery T. Hamilton, Senior Director, Pfizer, during their discussions with Minister explained about Pfizer's ECHO project in the area of breast cancer screening. The minister elaborated on the steps Telangana Government initiated to boost the pharma sector in Hyderabad and invited Pfizer to associate with Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad (RICH). Another MoU was signed with IV2 Alliance, a non-profit corporation and one that works in tandem with US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to promote collaboration within the scientific, research and provider communities to achieve advances in the field of healthcare and wellness. USFDA in a written communication stated that Pharma City near Hyderabad can be the first of the international clusters it seeks to bring together to link scientific and medical advances from across the globe for better healthcare. --IANS ms/vd SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Demonetisation: Modi's surgical strike?

If achieved that would elevate its healthcare sales in 2022 to around €4bn, with its existing portfolio of multiple sclerosis, fertility/hormonal and cancer drugs contributing €2bn. Its Life Science and Performance Materials units are expected to add €1bn in new product sales apiece. On the face of it, the growth claim is a bold one for a company whose pipeline has not been particularly productive in recent years, and it is clear that a hefty chunk of that increase will depend on Pfizer-partnered PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab, which is in phase III trials for several types of cancer. The company said at a strategy update yesterday that it is preparing a regulatory submission for avelumab before the end of the year in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer, and it is expecting follow-up indications in gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer before 2020. Other than avelumab, Merck has just two other candidates in late-stage development, namely oral cladribine for multiple sclerosis (MS) and a biosimilar of AbbVie's TNF inhibitor Humira (adalimumab). Cladribine is closest to market having already been submitted for approval in the EU in June for the second time, having been rejected by the EMA and FDA in 2009, while the biosimilar launch will depend on how well AbbVie defends its intellectual property for the brand. If approved, cladribine will have to compete in the marketplace with established oral MS drugs such as Biogen's Tecfidera (dimethyl glutamate) and Novartis' Gilenya (fingolimod), but will tap into Merck's existing MS expertise with interferon beta product Rebif. "Since October 2015, 20 projects have either advanced into the next phase of clinical development or are about to," said the company in a statement. Among other candidates coming through the pipeline, it highlighted BTK inhibitor M2951 - in phase II for rheumatoid arthritis - and TGF-beta trap for solid tumours in phase I. "We firmly believe that we will meet the objectives we have set for 2018," which will be the company's 350th anniversary, commented Merck's chief executive Stefan Oschmann.

Aetna announced it had signed a value-based deal with Merck for its two diabetes drugs, Janumet and Januvia. The rebates will be based on whether the drugs contribute to Type 2 patients achieving or maintaining their treatment goals.   2. New research expected to be published next week by the National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that co-pay coupons for 23 drugs with generic alternatives resulted in up to $2.7 billion in additional spending over five years. (NYT) 3. An FDA analysis found that the Alere INRatio — a device used to monitor warfarin therapy in patients — did not impact the results of a trial that informed the the FDA submission of Johnson & Johnson's Xarelto. The agency concluded that Xarelto is a safe and effective alternative to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation. 4. Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) proposed new legislation that would create a national board to “stop pharmaceutical companies from charging consumers excessive prices.” The board would collect data on drug prices and take enforcement action against drugmakers that charge excessive prices. The enforcement actions would include “shortening monopoly protections, imposing monetary fines, and recouping previous tax benefits for life saving treatments.” 5. The results of Eli Lilly's large clinical trial for its experimental Alzheimer's drug, solanezumab, are coming down the pike — with interim data expected to be released in the end of November.

This research report also lists several other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. Special regulatory designations will act as a major boost for the global metabolic disorders therapeutics market. These special designations help vendors launch their drugs quickly into the market. Also, in a few cases, governments offer tax incentives for such drugs. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the orphan drug designation for a few already approved drugs such as Elelyso, Zavesca, and Cerezyme. Regulatory bodies, at times, give these designations to pipeline products. For instance, Amicus Therapeutics' migalastat is under regulatory review in the US. However, the drug received orphan designation from the FDA for Fabry disease in June 2016. Competitive vendor landscape Novo Nordisk dominated the global metabolic disorders therapeutics market in 2015, primarily because of the high revenues obtained from the diabetes drugs segment. The dominant drugs of the company are Levemir, NovoRapid/NovoLog, NovoMix/NovoLog Mix, and Victoza, which together accounted for the sales of USD 10.14 billion in 2015. The company focuses mainly on diabetes, obesity, hemophilia, and growth hormone disorders. The sales in diabetes and obesity care products increased by 22% in 2015, when measured in Danish Krone (DKK). "Sanofi holds the second position in the metabolic disorders therapeutics market, particularly the diabetes drugs market owing to the high performance of Lantus, which remains the world's best-selling insulin brand, both in terms of volume and value. The sales of Lantus represented over 17% of the total net sales of the company in 2015," says Barath Palada, a lead cardiovascular and metabolic disorders analyst from Technavio. Merck has captured the third position in the global metabolic disorder therapeutics market owing to its prominent position in diabetes and hypercholesterolemia drugs market. Januvia and Janumet are the leading diabetes drugs offered by the company, the combined sales of which accounted to USD 6.01 billion in 2015. Also, the presence of pipeline products is expected to foster the growth of this segment further.

Top five metabolic disorders therapeutics market vendors Novo Nordisk The company is engaged in research, development, manufacturing and marketing of insulin products, GLP-1 and associated delivery systems, oral antidiabetic products (OAD) and obesity drugs. In FY2015, the revenue increased by 9% compared to that in 2014. The increase was because of the growth in performance of Victoza (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 therapy for type 2 diabetes) and insulin and protein related products (Treshiba, Ryzodeg, and modern insulin). However, it was partially offset by the decrease in sales of oral antidiabetic products (Novonorm, Prandin, and Prandimet). Sanofi The company is engaged in research, development, and marketing of various therapeutic solutions and healthcare products. The revenue generated from the sales of the other products in the diabetes segment amounted to USD 8.41 billion in 2015. The various products included under the diabetes segment are Lantus, Amaryl, Apidra, Insuman, and Lyxumia. The sales in the diabetes segment declined by USD 550.2 billion in 2015. Apart from this, Toujeo was approved by the US FDA in February 2015 and by the EMA in April 2015. Merck Merck offers type 2 diabetes drugs through its pharmaceutical segment. The company has an established presence in the diabetes market with offerings such as Januvia and Janumet. In June 2015, the company presented Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin study results at the 2015 American Diabetes Association meeting. AstraZeneca The company offers a wide range of products for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The key products for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases include Atacand1/Atacand HCT/Atacand Plus, Brilinta/Brilique, Crestor, Plendil, Seloken/Toprol-XL, Tenormin, and Zestril. Eli Lilly Eli Lilly has an established presence in the diabetes market with its range of offerings. It offers diabetes drugs through its endocrinology segment. The key products include Trulicity, Jardiance, Abasaglar (Basaglar), Humalog, Humulin, Trajenta, Jentadueto, and Glyxambi.

português suomeksi svenska Preliminary Results from Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Phase 1b Clinical Study in Select Solid Tumors Presented at ESMO 2016 Study Evaluated Maximum Tolerated Dose News provided by Eisai Inc. Oct 13, 2016, 19:22 ET Share this article WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., Oct. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Eisai Inc. announced today the presentation of preliminary results of a Phase 1b clinical study (Study 111) of its in-house developed multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib (marketed in the U.S. under the brand name Lenvima®) in combination with the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy pembrolizumab (marketed under the brand name Keytruda®, developed by Merck & Co., Inc., known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada) in patients with selected solid tumors at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress. Development of this potential combination regimen, which is not approved by the FDA, is being overseen by a Joint Development Committee formed by both companies. This investigational study is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1b/2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab. In the Phase 1b part of the study, the primary endpoint was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The study comprised 13 patients with selected solid tumors (renal cell carcinoma (n=8), endometrial cancer (n=2), non-small cell lung cancer (n=2) and melanoma (n=1)) who had progressed after treatment with approved therapies or for which there are no standard effective therapies available. Patients received one of three dose levels of lenvatinib (either 24 mg, 20 mg or 14 mg given orally daily) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg given intravenously every three weeks). The Phase 2 part of this study is ongoing. According to the results of the Phase 1b part of the study, there were two dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) at the lenvatinib dose level 1 group (24 mg; 1 grade 3 arthralgia and 1 grade 3 fatigue) and no DLTs were reported in the lenvatinib 20 mg plus pembrolizumab 200 mg group. The maximum tolerated dose was confirmed as 20 mg of lenvatinib per day plus 200 mg of pembrolizumab once every three weeks. All patients reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were observed in 69.2% of patients, and no patients had discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. The most frequently observed adverse events in either the lenvatinib 24 mg plus pembrolizumab 200 mg group or the lenvatinib 20 mg plus pembrolizumab 200 mg group were decreased appetite, diarrhea and fatigue. "Eisai is committed to exploring the potential role that lenvatinib-based combinations may have for patients with difficult to treat cancers," said Alton Kremer, MD, PhD, Chief Clinical Officer and Chief Medical Officer, Oncology Business Group, Eisai. "We are encouraged by these results and look forward to further exploring the combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in the next stage of clinical development." This release discusses an investigational use for FDA-approved products. Lenvima is not approved for use in combination with Keytruda. This release is not intended to convey any conclusions about efficacy or safety of lenvatinib, pembrolizumab or any combination of these two agents. There is no guarantee that any investigational uses of such FDA-approved products will successfully complete clinical development or gain FDA approval. About LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) is a kinase inhibitor that is indicated for: Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC): single agent for patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory DTC. Renal Cell Cancer (RCC): in combination with everolimus for patients with advanced RCC following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. Lenvatinib, discovered and developed by Eisai, is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1-3. Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. Important Safety Information Warnings and Precautions In DTC, hypertension was reported in 73% of patients on LENVIMA vs 16% with placebo (44% vs 4% grade ≥3). In RCC, hypertension was reported in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 10% with everolimus alone (13% vs 2% grade 3). Blood pressure should be controlled prior to treatment and monitored throughout. Withhold dose for grade 3 hypertension despite optimal antihypertensive therapy; resume at reduced dose when controlled at grade ≤2. Discontinue for life-threatening hypertension In DTC, cardiac dysfunction was reported in 7% of patients on LENVIMA vs 2% with placebo (2% vs 0% grade ≥3). In RCC, cardiac dysfunction was reported in 10% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus vs 6% with everolimus alone (3% vs 2% grade 3). Monitor for signs/symptoms of cardiac decompensation.

Bristol-Myers should make a case to get Opdivo paid for by the Cancer Drugs Fund, which covers new therapies while information is collected on how well they work in practice, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, known as NICE, said in an e-mailed statement. The medicine’s potential should be explored in patients with certain levels of a protein involved in immune response to cancer, according to the statement, a draft of recommendations to the state-run National Health Service. “We do not have the full picture yet and we need more evidence to find out the extent of this benefit” in patients whose protein levels indicate the drug will work best, Carole Longson, director of the health technology evaluation center at NICE, said in the statement. Bristol-Myers, based in New York, has lost about a quarter of its market value this year as study results threw into question whether Opdivo can help lung-cancer patients who’ve just been diagnosed. Meanwhile, Merck & Co.’s rival treatment Keytruda reduced the risk of death or cancer progression by 50 percent in a study, giving Merck a head start on all of its competitors in the race for the best new immune therapy against lung tumors. NICE said last week that Keytruda isn’t cost-effective, even with a discount on price, and shouldn’t be covered by the Cancer Drugs Fund. Bristol-Myers also offered an undisclosed discount on Opdivo, whose price is 439 pounds ($536) for a 40-milligram vial, according to NICE. Exact treatment costs depend on a person’s weight and type of lung cancer. Opdivo is given intravenously every two weeks and targets a protein called PD-L1. NICE suggested that coverage through the Cancer Drugs Fund would allow study and access to the drug in patients with PD-L1 levels of 10 percent or more on their cancer cells.

português suomeksi svenska OncoSec Announces Fourth Quarter and Year End Results for Fiscal Year 2016 News provided by OncoSec Medical Incorporated Oct 13, 2016, 16:01 ET Share this article SAN DIEGO, Oct. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- OncoSec Medical Incorporated ("OncoSec") (NASDAQ: ONCS), a company developing DNA-based intratumoral cancer immunotherapies, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. "During the fourth quarter, we continued to advance the development of our lead clinical program, ImmunoPulse® IL-12, focused on the anti-PD1 non-responsive patient population in melanoma. The development of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 in combination with an anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor represents a potential immunotherapy for melanoma patients that are progressing on anti-PD1 therapy," noted Punit Dhillon, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We have enrolled over 20 patients in our Phase II combination clinical study of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 with Merck's KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in melanoma patients that are considered non-responders to anti-PD1, and OncoSec remains on track to announce interim data from approximately 15 of these patients at a three-month follow-up later this quarter.  Subject to these interim results and discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, we expect to submit a registration directed study design for ImmunoPulse® IL-12 by the end of 2016.  We have also continued to expand our research pipeline and broaden our engineering efforts relating to new devices that will be launched with our next clinical candidate. We look forward to discussing research and pre-clinical updates and timing data and clinical development milestones relating to our Melanoma program on our conference call and webcast on October 13th." FINANCIAL RESULTS   For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, OncoSec reported a net loss of $6.6 million and $26.9 million, or $0.39 per share and $1.63 per share, respectively, compared to a net loss of $6.5 million and $21.2 million, or $0.48 per share and $1.67 per share, respectively, for the same period last year. The increase in net loss for the year ended July 31, 2016, compared with the same period in 2015, resulted primarily from (i) the progression of its clinical trials, (ii) consulting services costs to support its device development and clinical activities, (iii) facility costs related to its new corporate headquarters, and (iv) stock-based compensation expense. There were no revenues for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016 or July 31, 2015. Research and development expenses were $3.7 million and $14.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, respectively, compared to $3.8 million and $13.1 million for the same periods in 2015. General and administrative expenses were $2.9 million and $12.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, compared to $2.7 million and $8.1 million for the same period in 2015. At July 31, 2016, OncoSec had $28.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $32.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at July 31, 2015. OncoSec expects these funds to be sufficient to allow it to continue to operate its business for at least the next 12 months.

This could be an ambitious target in a highly competitive market led by multinationals  GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser, and domestic household names like Dabur and Emami. But with Rs 15,000 crore in cash and investments on the books of Piramal Enterprises, competition is watching the moves of Nandini Piramal carefully. Piramal scion is directly responsible for growth of this business. As an executive director, she also oversees the larger health care portfolio of the company, including contract manufacturing and critical care businesses. She has already made six acquisitions for the health care business in the past two years, putting Rs 1,800 crore to work. Three of these were made in the OTC business. This includes baby care products from Little’s, which helped it in getting into a new segment. Besides, it acquired four gastro-intestinal products from Merck to complement its existing portfolio. It also acquired five legacy brands from Pfizer, including Waterbury’s Compound and pain reliever Sloan’s. Nandini could be repeating what father Ajay Piramal did earlier. He bought Nicholas Laboratories in 1988, when it was ranked 48th in the domestic market and turned it into third largest company through a series of acquisitions. In 2010, he sold the domestic formulation part of the business to Abbott for $3.8 billion (Rs 17,500 crore), but retained the OTC, critical care and contract manufacturing businesses. Nandini could not have missed the lessons of value creation her father is known for delivering. Ajay Piramal continues to provide guidance as chairman of the company. “We are ready for acquisitions — big and small,” said Nandini Piramal, saying being in the top three is only a short-term goal. “The OTC market is fragmented. There are big brands in a few categories but we believe there is a lot of room to play.” With an unparalleled war-chest, investment bankers have made a beeline to her office. But, acquisition is not the growth strategy. The company is getting into new product categories as well. It launched an anti-allergy product, StopAllerG, first such in the category. It also launched Quikkool (mouth ulcer cream) or Throatsil (throat pain spray). The company has planned several extensions for each of these brands with the aim to make them among the top two players in their respective categories. The company started its independent OTC business in 2007 and made two acquisitions — contraceptive i-pill in 2011 and skin allergy lotion Caladryl in 2013. Its biggest brand is oral analgesic Saridon, with annual sales of Rs 131 crore. OTC is currently the smallest segment in its pharma portfolio with annual sales of Rs 393 crore in 2015-16. The company’s health care business, spread across three lines reported, Rs 3,558-crore revenue in the period, a compound annual growth rate of 17 per cent for five years. The company operates in the self-care segment of the OTC market, pegged at Rs 12, 000 crore and growing at 12-13 per cent annually. The company says it is seventh biggest in the business. According to India Brand Equity Foundation, OTC is 21 per cent of the $20-billion pharmaceutical industry in India. Nandini might not have an easy ride in this segment, as other heavyweights like Sun Pharmaceutical are also eyeing the OTC market with a greater focus. India’s most valued pharma company has top-selling OTC brands such as health supplement Revital and painkiller Volini. These products became a part of Sun Pharmaceutical’s portfolio after it acquired Ranbaxy two years ago. With the strength of popular brands in its kitty, the company has increased its focus on the segment by introducing new products for this segment. In June, it re-launched  dermatology prescription drug Suncros as a sunscreen product under OTC. Another domestic rival, Cipla, spun off its consumer health business to Cipla Health, a joint venture subsidiary with private equity firm Eight Roads Ventures India. It is now aiming to build five Rs 100-crore brands in five years by tapping into the growing health and wellness consciousness among urban population. “For long, the OTC segment was largely dominated by multinational corporations. But with increasing competition in the branded generics space, Indian companies are also getting aggressive in the OTC space now,” said Sriram Shrinivasan, partner and global leader for generics, EY.

Investor sentiment took a hard hit after the release of the weaker than expected Chinese trade report. The disappointing data sparked concerns among traders over the health of the global economy. Mining stocks were under pressure after the weak Chinese trade report. Financial stocks and automakers were also among the decliners. Technology stocks also extended the weakness of the previous session, after yesterday's warning from Ericsson. China's exports declined more than expected in September reflecting subdued global demand, data from the General Administration of Customs revealed Thursday. Exports dropped notably by 10 percent in September from prior year, much bigger than the expected fall of 3.3 percent. Shipment had declined 2.8 percent in August. At the same time, imports slid 1.9 percent annually, confounding expectations for an increase of 0.9 percent and reversing a 1.5 percent rise in August, which was the first increase in almost two years. As a result, the trade surplus narrowed to $42 billion compared to the expected level of $53 billion. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.88 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks decreased 1.10 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, lost 0.98 percent. The DAX of Germany dropped 1.04 percent and the CAC 40 of France fell 1.06 percent. The FTSE 100 of the U.K. declined 0.66 percent and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.85 percent. In Frankfurt, drug maker Merck KgaA dipped 0.25 percent after it said it firmly believes it will meet the objectives set for 2018. The company said it has focused pharmaceutical pipeline and continuously developed it further. Deutsche Bank surrendered 3.12 percent, after the U.S. SEC announced that the lender has agreed to pay a $9.5 million penalty for failing to properly safeguard material nonpublic information generated by its research analysts. Commerzbank also forfeited 4.20 percent. Volkswagen decreased 1.33 percent and Daimler fell 1.53 percent. BMW also finished lower by 1.56 percent. In Paris, Casino Group reported 2.9 percent sales quarter on an organic basis for its third quarter. Same store sales were up 1.7 percent. The stock dropped 2.11 percent. BNP Paribas dropped 2.90 percent and Credit Agricole weakened by 3.22 percent. Societe Generale also finished down by 3.04 percent. Peugeot fell 2.27 percent and Renault lost 1.89 percent. In London, Unilever declined 3.53 percent after it said its third-quarter total turnover were 13.4 billion euros, down 0.1 percent due to a negative currency impact. Sales increased by 3.4% at constant exchange rates, while underlying sales growth was 3.2 percent. Meanwhile, U.K. supermarket chain Tesco announced that it has pulled dozens of household products supplied by Unilever from its online shopping site over pricing and a weaker pound. Tesco decreased 3.03 percent. Standard Life weakened by 5.07 percent after it was downgraded by Barclays to 'Underweight' from 'Equal weight.' Mining stocks were under pressure due to the weak Chinese trade report. Anglo American dropped 4.80 percent and Rio Tinto fell 4.86 percent. BHP Billiton declined 4.40 percent and Antofagasta lost 3.05 percent. German consumer price inflation accelerated to a 16-month high in September, final data from Destatis showed Thursday. Consumer prices advanced 0.7 percent year-on-year in September, in line with flash estimate and faster than the 0.4 percent increase seen in prior month. The latest inflation figure was the highest since May 2015, when it was at the same level. House prices in the United Kingdom picked up steam in September, the latest survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed on Thursday with an index score of +17. That's up from +13 in August and the three-year low of +5 in July. That reading immediately followed the Brexit vote and capped five straight months of decline. First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits held steady in the week ended October 8th, the Labor Department revealed in a report on Thursday. The Labor Department said initial jobless claims came in at 246,000, unchanged from the previous week's revised level. Economists had expected jobless claims to climb to 254,000 from the 249,000 originally reported for the previous week. Import prices in the U.S. saw a modest uptick in the month of September, according to a report released by the Labor Department on Thursday. The report said import prices inched up by 0.1 percent in September after falling by 0.2 percent in August. The uptick in prices matched economist estimates. The Labor Department also said export prices rose by 0.3 percent in September following a 0.8 percent drop in August. Export prices had been expected to edge up by 0.1 percent.

It’s been the worst performer so far in 2016, and it looks like it will continue to move still lower in the coming weeks. The weakness in the sector is pervasive, hitting all subgroups, but drug stocks seem to be technically poised for a serious decline. I’ve noticed a pattern in some of the biggest drug stocks, specifically Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK), where they trade near their 52-week highs in a tight range or rectangle pattern, break out on news and then fail badly. Pfizer did this in July and has been falling ever since. Merck, on the other hand, broke out and failed just this week, so the jury is still out on that one. A lesser-known drug stock is currently exhibiting the same pattern as Pfizer and Merck, which could result in a nice profit for short sellers. Zoetis Inc (ZTS), which focuses on drugs and vaccines for pets and livestock, was actually spun off from Pfizer in 2013, so there’s not a lot of history for chartists to ponder. But the short-term pattern of range, breakout and failure is quite clear, as is the break below the rising trendline drawn from March of this year. [More from StreetAuthority.com: This Stock Is One Bad Day Away From A Breakdown] Specific news events preceded Pfizer and Merck’s reversals. But while Zoetis does not have a major news event, it has something its larger peers did not: falling cumulative volume ahead of its peak. 10 Stocks That Every Investor Should Own Cumulative or on-balance volume is a measure of volume changing hands on up days versus down days. Theoretically, it tells us whether bulls or bears are more aggressive, and, most of the time, it mirrors price action. When the two diverge, we get a good signal that the trend is about to change. With Zoetis, cumulative volume has been falling while shares have been rising. This tells us the bears are selling, distributing their shares to supposedly weaker hands. Supply goes up, demand goes down, and that typically leads to a decline in price. [More from StreetAuthority.com: Why This Scandalized Bank Is A Contrarian’s Dream] With Tuesday’s big decline, Zoetis has already broken down below its 50-day moving average, ahead of its larger cousins during their patterns. However, ZTS bounced off the bottom of its two-month range, so traders should be aware that there is support at the $50 level. There was unusual options activity at the $50 strike as well. Given the stock’s failure to hold its breakout and the weak overall condition of the healthcare sector, it seems the writing is on the wall here. Conservative traders may want to wait for a break below $50 support to sell given Tuesday’s large drop. However, more aggressive traders can sell shares short now and add to their positions on a break below the $50 level. Apple Inc. (AAPL): The Luckiest D*mn Company on Earth The next important support is around $45.50, which is near the June lows, and that seems to be a compelling downside target. [More from StreetAuthority.com: One Of The First Stocks You Should Sell In A Correction] Recommended Trade Setup: — Sell ZTS short at the market price — Set stop-loss at $52.75 — Set initial price target at $45.50 for a potential 11% gain in eight weeks — Amplify those gains by 5-10 times with this “backdoor” method This article was originally published on ProfitableTrading.com: This Drug Stock’s Pattern Says, ‘Sell Now!’ StreetAuthority’s mission is to help individual investors earn above-average profits by providing a source of independent, unbiased — and most of all, profitable — investing ideas.

X Samsung’s Note 7 recall biggest in history but not the worst Cars, peanuts and medication have done more damage to company reputations Thu, Oct 13, 2016, 12:52 On a 10-point scale measuring financial and reputational damage to a company, Samsung’s Note 7 recall ranks between four and seven, said an expert. Photograph: Brian Green/Reuters         Samsung’s recall of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphone will be one of the biggest recalls ever in the technology industry. The South Korean conglomerate pulled the plug on the entire product line and slashed its third-quarter profit forecast by $2.3 billion (€2.1 billion). On a 10-point scale measuring financial and reputational damage to a company, Samsung’s recall ranks between four and seven, said Srinivas Reddy, director of the Centre for Marketing Excellence at Singapore Management University, who has researched product and brand failures. That’s because the exploding phones – while still “a calamity” for the company – have not killed anyone, Reddy said. “The threat for Samsung is how soon they can get back,” Reddy said. “If they don’t get back soon, it provides a vacuum for others to creep in.” Notorious recalls In a marketplace where everything from cars to cows can have deadly defects, Samsung’s product failure is far from the worst in history. Merck’s 2004 scandal with its drug Vioxx – which studies showed could increase the chance of heart attacks and strokes in some patients – was a “catastrophic disaster,” rating a 10 on Reddy’s scale. Payouts from lawsuits and government investigations tallied more than $8.5 billion. Other notorious recalls include: Some versions of Ford Motor Co’s Pinto compact car first introduced in 1971 came with a fatal design flaw – impacts to the rear of the vehicle could cause fuel leaks and explosions. Ford recalled about 1.5 million Pintos in 1978 amid a US government investigation and criminal charges in the state of Indiana. Ford shut down Pinto production soon thereafter. The largest car-related recall in history is yet to be completed and could result in bankruptcy with billions of dollars in costs. Takata’s airbags were meant to save lives in the event of a crash. Instead, the defective products became deadly cannon that shot shards of materials at passengers – at least 16 people have died in relation to the product. ADVERTISEMENT Food staples such as chicken, beef and peanut butter have been recalled because of mistakes or unhygienic conditions in manufacturing processes. Peanut Corp of America used the nut in more than 800 products that were tainted with salmonella in 2009. The result was nine deaths, more than 700 illnesses and one of the biggest recalls in US history. The company collapsed and the former chief executive officer was sentenced to prison. Even medicines taken to ease pain have proven to be fatal. In 1982, Johnson and Johnson recalled about 31 million bottles of Tylenol after seven people in the Chicago area died from swallowing cyanide-spiked capsules. Some of the highest-profile cases have involved children. Mattel recalled about 21 million Chinese-made toys, including those based on characters from Sesame Street and Dora the Explorer, after they were found to contain more than 180 times the allowable levels of lead paint. If ingested by children, lead can cause brain damage, learning problems and even death.       Topics: Srinivas Reddy Center For Marketing Excellence Singapore Management University Us Government Ford Motor Johnson Merck Peanut Samsung Chicago Indiana United States Read More Irish plane passengers warned not to use Samsung phones Samsung updates Irish customers on Note 7 options Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Agribusiness & Food Noonan heads to the US to drum up some business Work Lucy Kellaway: I don’t want my employers to feel my pain International Ken Early: When the going gets tough, Ireland get going Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa Power up your company's pension plan Designed for life: Helen James on creativity and a life InSync ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Nearly 70% of rural SMEs hobbled by poor internet 06:01 Knock airport summer passenger numbers climb 10% to 360,000 05:59 Lucy Kellaway: I don’t want my employers to feel my pain 05:54 What does Brexit mean for Irish manufacturers’ domestic sales? 05:50 Hotel planning bid lodged for Adelaide Road corner site 05:50 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

The South Korean conglomerate pulled the plug on the entire product line and slashed its third-quarter profit forecast by $2.3 billion. On a 10-point scale measuring financial and reputational damage to a company, Samsung’s recall ranks between 4 and 7, said Srinivas Reddy, director of the Center for Marketing Excellence at Singapore Management University who has researched product and brand failures. That’s because the exploding phones -- while still “a calamity” for the company -- haven’t killed anyone, Reddy said. A damaged Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Photographer: Shawn L. Minter via AP Photo “The threat for Samsung is how soon they can get back,” Reddy said. “If they don’t get back soon, it provides a vacuum for others to creep in.” In a marketplace where everything from cars to cows can have deadly defects, Samsung’s product failure is far from the worst in history. Merck & Co.’s 2004 scandal with its drug Vioxx -- which studies showed could increase the chance of heart attacks and strokes in some patients -- was a “catastrophic disaster,” rating a 10 on Reddy’s scale. Payouts from lawsuits and government investigations tallied more than $8.5 billion. Other notorious recalls include: 1. Some versions of Ford Motor Co.’s Pinto compact car first introduced in 1971 came with a fatal design flaw -- impacts to the rear of the vehicle could cause fuel leaks and explosions. Ford recalled about 1.5 million Pintos in 1978 amid a U.S. government investigation and criminal charges in the state of Indiana. Ford shut down Pinto production soon thereafter. A 1975 Ford Pinto with a warning sign. Photographer: JCH/AP Photo 2. The largest car-related recall in history is yet to be completed and could result in bankruptcy with billions of dollars in costs. Takata Corp.’s air-bags were meant to save lives in the event of a crash. Instead, the defective products became deadly cannons that shot shards of materials at passengers -- at least 16 people have died in relation to the product. 3. Food staples like chicken, beef and peanut butter have been recalled because of mistakes or unhygienic conditions in manufacturing processes. Peanut Corp. of America used the eponymous nut in more than 800 products that were tainted with salmonella in 2009. The result was nine deaths, more than 700 illnesses and one of the biggest recalls in US history. The company collapsed and the former chief executive officer was sentenced to prison. 4. Even medicines taken to ease the pain have proven to be fatal. In 1982, Johnson & Johnson recalled about 31 million bottles of Tylenol after seven people in the Chicago area died from swallowing cyanide-spiked capsules. A Dora the Explorer doll in 2007. Photographer: Marco Flagg/Bloomberg 5. Some of the highest-profile cases have involved children. Mattel Inc. recalled about 21 million Chinese-made toys, including those based on characters from “Sesame Street” and “Dora the Explorer,” after they were found to contain more than 180 times the allowable levels of lead paint. If ingested by children, lead can cause brain damage, learning problems and even death. — With assistance by David Ramli, and Yoolim Lee Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The report forecasts the global metabolic disorders therapeutics market to grow at a CAGR of 4.62% during the period 2016-2020. Strategic collaborations and acquisitions will be a key trend for market growth. M&A are usually intended to enhance a company's product portfolio and increase the acquiring company's market penetration. Established pharmaceutical companies acquire late-stage products from small companies, where the product's efficacy has already been demonstrated, cutting down on initial R&D expenditure. Joint ventures between different companies enable the use of technical expertise from both companies for mutual benefits, allowing the use of regulatory and developmental experience gained by one company to support the pipeline candidates of the other. It also ensures the in-flow of adequate funds for R&D. According to the report, increase in academia-industry collaborations for drug development will be a key driver for market growth. The key players in the global diabetes therapeutics market are increasingly extending their support to academic institutions to facilitate the R&D of innovative products for the treatment of diabetes. Such collaborations enable the amalgamation of research expertise of educational institutions with the marketing intelligence of pharma companies, as well as provides funds for conducting trials. Further, the report states that low compliance and adherence rates will be a challenge for the market. Despite the availability of various treatment options for metabolic disorders, there exist significant unmet medical needs because of the presence of adverse effects with the existing treatment options. Most of the therapies used for metabolic disorders should be continued on a long-term basis. Adverse effects lead to low compliance and adherence rates for these therapies. Also, the availability of alternative treatment options will discourage compliance.

McAdams May 16, 2016 James Hamblin Oct 14, 2016 Health Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size This week the medical-aid organization Doctors Without Borders refused a donation of one million vaccine doses from the pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer. It offered inoculations against a commonly fatal pneumonia—deliverable immediately, to people in need anywhere—and the doctors said no. The decision is the result of a fundamental impasse in modern healthcare. The heart of the refusal—which could well imperil children who would have received those vaccines—is a principled stand against the extremely high cost of many vaccines. Pfizer tells me that their revenue from the vaccine in question last year was $6.245 billion. (That’s the same as the revenue of United Airlines.) The enormous business includes much profit from countries that are willing and able to pay inflated prices for a life-saving vaccine. It necessarily leaves others behind. How has this system come to such a head that humanitarian doctors would refuse a million vaccines on principle? The medical background: The leading cause of death in children is pneumonia. In the lungs, alveoli fill with pus, which blocks the passage of oxygen. A person is essentially suffocated by their own immune response. This happens to 1.4 million kids every year. The process is often the result of one bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae. Decades ago, scientists were able to isolate proteins and carbohydrates from S. pneumoniae and expose children to only those benign molecules, instead of the entire bacteria. The kids’ bodies learned to recognize and destroy S. pneumoniae without having to be exposed to it. Pfizer’s modern iteration of this vaccine is known among doctors as PCV13. It’s recommended to be given to all children by medical authorities worldwide. Since its introduction, cases of severe Strep pneumonia in the U.S. have gone down by 88 percent. Elsewhere, death from pneumonia remains commonplace, especially in subsaharan Africa and southeast Asia. This is where much work is done by Doctors Without Borders—known outside the U.S. as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)—to provide care. So I was initially shocked to hear MSF refused a million PCV13 doses from Pfizer, who seemed shocked themselves. “Pfizer is committed to making vaccines available to as many people as possible,” company spokesperson Sally Beatty told me by email, “particularly those needing emergency humanitarian assistance.” Beatty explained that Pfizer “strongly disagrees” with MSF’s decision, and that “to suggest that donations are not valuable defies logic.” Of course, the doctors do see donations as valuable—simply not worth the costs in this context, which transcends seemingly straightforward philanthropy and medical science. Pfizer sells its PCV13 pneumonia vaccine under the name Prevnar 13. Among the best-selling vaccines on the market, its technology is protected by multiple patents—not just on the final product, but also on the process by which the vaccine is made. This makes it difficult for competitors to produce anything comparable at all. The South Korean company SK Chemicals came close to producing an analogue, but Pfizer sued the company and was supported by the country’s Intellectual Property Tribunal in 2015. MSF has been trying to get their hands on Prevnar 13 since it was introduced in 2009, but the price has been too high. Outside of dire situations—as when the group purchased some Prevnar from pharmacies in Athens a few months ago (for 60 euros per dose)––the group has lacked the resources to purchase it. And this cost is the fundamental issue to Jason Cone, the executive director of Doctors Without Borders in the United States. He explained that donations from pharmaceutical companies are ineffective against a problem of this scale. While the donation would benefit people under the care of Doctors Without Borders immediately, accepting it could mean problems for others, and problems longer-term. Donations, he writes, are “often used as a way to make others ‘pay up.’ By giving the pneumonia vaccine away for free, pharmaceutical corporations can use this as justification for why prices remain high for others, including other humanitarian organizations and developing countries that also can’t afford the vaccine.” Which is to say that for a disease of this scale, isolated donations are inadequate. “I'm not absolutely against donations,” MSF’s vaccine pharmacist Alain Alsahani told me by phone from Paris. In cases of neglected disease where there is little or no market for a product, he explained, “donation becomes a more interesting option for some countries to get access. But in the case of PCV, that's not a solution at all, in any way.” In this case, to accept a donation is to accept the status quo in which health technology is beholden to the priorities and values of multinational monopolies and duopolies whose interests exceed simply finding a solvent path to technological progress and human wellbeing. Last year Pfizer returned $13.1 billion to its shareholders. By every estimate, Prevnar 13 is a “blockbuster” contributor to the company’s profits, though they declined to share specific numbers. Prices paid by patients, insurers, and aid organizations can remain high in part because of this sort of opacity. Last year MSF determined that a single dose of the vaccine—a complete course requires three to four doses over time—runs $63.70 in Morocco and $67.30 in Tunisia, while it’s somehow cheaper in France at $58.40. (In the U.S., the group put the cost at closer to $136.) “The companies really operate on opacity of price data,” explained Kate Elder, the Vaccines Policy Advisor at MSF. People in the dark have no bargaining power. (Not unlike office workers negotiating salaries.) Isn’t there at least some list price for reference, I asked, like the price of a car? “What they try to avoid at all costs—no pun intended—is to avoid governments or other purchasers doing price referencing,” she added. “They won’t even quote us a price. So step one is them being a business and selling us a product.” I asked Pfizer if they would be open to a deal to make the vaccine affordable to humanitarian organizations like MSF. Beatty wrote, “We are actively exploring a number of new options to enable greater access to our pneumococcal vaccine … to aid NGOs facing humanitarian emergency settings.” I asked if that meant changing the price for MSF, and she copied and pasted the same response. One deal that Pfizer will talk about, even unprompted, is that with the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), an organization that purchases vaccines in bulk on behalf of poor countries. In 2009, Pfizer agreed to sell Prevnar to GAVI for $9.15 per course. That price is really what MSF wants, and has been requesting for years. So I put it to Pfizer directly, one final time: Why can’t you give the $9.15 price to NGOs? After all, their patients represent a relatively small part of the multibillion-dollar market for a vaccine that’s supposed to be given to all people. Pfizer’s representative didn’t answer the question directly, but again pasted “we are actively exploring a number of new options to enable greater access to our pneumococcal vaccine to aid NGOS facing humanitarian emergency settings.” Until that active exploration bears fruit, MSF is forced to choose the less imperfect option that will yield the greatest good. In the short term, does MSF’s decision threaten the wellbeing of children who might have received the donated vaccines? “We're taking every step we can to minimize that risk,” Elder said. “But our priority is to vaccinate as many children as possible in the long term.” In medicine, sometimes do no harm is an imperfect principle. It’s only possible to do the least harm. And Pfizer disagrees with MSF about how to do the least harm. In a cold phone call to my cell, Beatty reiterated that the company sees donation as a humanitarian endeavor. “Is policy really more important than the opportunity to vaccinate and protect vulnerable people in emergency settings?” In another email, she reiterated that the donation offer is still on the table, deliverable immediately, and that Pfizer would offer to store the doses prior to distribution, if adequate storage for the entire one million is not available. I felt like somehow I had become the negotiator. I’m still trying to identify the impasse for Pfizer, but I got the impression the standoff would persist. And its resolution could establish a precedent across the industry, because more than this dangerous pneumonia is at stake. Many new vaccines are still made by only one or two manufacturers, and monopolies and duopolies are a real factor in why prices remain high. The HPV vaccine is only made by GSK and Merck. The rotavirus vaccine against diarrhea (the second leading cause of childhood death worldwide) is only made by GSK and Merck. The new malaria vaccine is only made by GSK. If there is a reason for people to be concerned about vaccines, it is a problem with people not having access, and a legal and economic system that keep prices high. The spirit of MSF’s decision highlights the same principle behind herd immunity: Vaccines are not about individuals. They are not even about individual organizations. They’re microcosm of all health: We’re in this together. In an attempt to rectify consumer blindness, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently established a vaccine price and procurement database initiative, where all purchasers can share what they know, but there's still a scarcity of data. And on Wednesday, Elder was in Geneva at a meeting that WHO convened this week on vaccination in emergencies. There they proposed a humanitarian mechanism where manufacturers can participate to sell their vaccines to NGOs and others vaccinating in emergency settings at further reduced cost. Elder reported that GSK was the first to commit, and Pfizer did not, but was represented at the meeting. “So the onus is on them, from MSF and from WHO and UNICEF,” said Elder. “The ball is in their court.” Share Tweet Comments Latest Video The Art of Interviewing Henry Kissinger Jeffrey Goldberg on his conversations with the controversial American statesman Leah Varjacques Nov 11, 2016 About the Author James Hamblin, MD, is a senior editor at The Atlantic.

Most Popular Presented by Carlo Allegri / Reuters The Radical Anti-Conservatism of Stephen Bannon Conor Friedersdorf Donald Trump’s campaign manager wants to destroy the left. And the GOP nominee is just the most recent vessel of convenience in his consequences-be-damned crusade. Stephen Bannon, who recently took over as Donald Trump’s campaign manager, once gave an interview, while promoting his 2010 film, “Fire From the Heartland: the Awakening of the Conservative Woman,” where he argued that Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, and Ann Coulter pose an existential threat to the left. “These women cut to the heart of the progressive narrative,” he explained. “That's one of the unintended consequences of the women's liberation movement––that, in fact, the women that would lead this country would be feminine, they would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children. They wouldn't be a bunch of dykes that came from the 7 Sisters schools." The quote captures a key attribute of the former U.S. Navy officer, whose stints at Georgetown University, Harvard Business School, and Goldman Sachs afforded a foothold at the core of America’s elite, enabling him to launch a film career that began with a Sean Penn collaboration before segueing into polemic right-wing documentaries.

Instead, Hillary Clinton failed to turn out liberal voters who had previously voted for Barack Obama. It’s a tempting narrative for smarting progressives, as it maintains status quo thinking—Clinton’s unlikable!—and removes any culpability on the part of the Democrats for missing a massive shift in the electorate. In other words, it’s Clinton’s fault, not theirs, that Trump won the presidency.

Hillary Clinton hasn’t made any public appearances since her concession speech midday Wednesday, but she can be spotted in the wild. That’s what happened to Margo Gerster, a dispirited Hillary supporter when she was hiking with her daughter to cheer herself up near Chappaqua, New York. Gerster heard a rustling and out of the woods came Hillary and Bill Clinton and their dogs. You may have to count on a chance encounter like this one to spot Clinton. She’s unlikely to be much in the public eye over the next months. And she may need the rest after an exhausting and savage campaign that resulted in a verdict her supporters neither hoped for nor predicted. Although Clinton carried the popular vote on Election Day, the Electoral College delivered a decisive victory to Donald Trump. The so-called Blue Wall states that went for Trump (Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin) exposed embarrassing cracks in the Democrats’ campaign strategy. Add to that the humiliation of having to concede a presidential race for a second time in 8 years. Hillary Clinton is done.

New Zealand’s recent announcement of a plan to eradicate all invasive predators, including feral cats, sparked an immediate response—and not in defense of the stoat, up there with cats among the top 100 on the Global Invasive Species list. “Cat murdering New Zealand[ers] are for the birds,” one commenter vented on The Washington Post’s website. “Removing cats from an area is a futile effort—one that cannot succeed,” another warned. When Australia announced a plan in 2015 to cull 2 million feral cats, the singer Morrissey declared them “2 million smaller versions of Cecil the lion.” The actress Brigitte Bardot called the cull “animal genocide.” Needless to say, no celebrity outrage or online indignation has greeted New Zealand’s or Australia’s expensive and long-standing rat-eradication programs.

McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Author’s note (November 10, 2016): Over the past several months, I’ve interviewed Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, numerous times on the subject of America’s role in the world. Our conversations took place before this week’s election, but were informed by the foreign-policy differences between the candidates. The December 2016 issue of The Atlantic includes my article on these conversations, which you will  find published below. In addition, a full rendering of our several interviews, on subjects including the future of Russia, the rise of China, and the chaos of the Middle East, can be found here. On Wednesday, the day the country, and the world, were just beginning to absorb the shock of Donald Trump’s victory, I spoke with Kissinger by telephone to get his postelection thoughts. He told me that he was expecting other nations, particularly the great powers, to enter a period of intense study, in order to understand how they should respond to a Trump presidency. He also said he expected the Islamic State, or other similarly minded jihadist organizations, to test Trump early by launching attacks, in order to provoke a reaction (or, he suggested, an overreaction). Continue Reading Carlos Barria / Reuters Women Aren't Responsible for Hillary Clinton’s Defeat Clare Foran The media has created a misleading narrative in a rush to assign blame for the outcome of the election. Women failed Hillary Clinton—and none more so than white women. That idea has congealed into conventional wisdom in the aftermath of the election. Vanity Fair published an article titled: “Why Hillary Clinton Couldn’t Win Over Female Voters” while Time ran a story headlined: “Why So Many Women Abandoned Hillary Clinton.” Slate declared: “White Women Sold Out the Sisterhood and the World by Voting for Trump.” Samantha Bee had harsh words for white women, too. “A majority of white women, faced with the historic choice between the first female president, and a vial of weaponized testosterone said, ‘I’ll take Option B. I just don’t like her,’” she said, scathingly, in an episode of Full Frontal. The accusation leveled at women voters is clear: They didn’t just betray the woman who tried to shatter the ultimate glass ceiling, they also failed each other. Continue Reading Joshua Roberts / Reuters The U.S. Media Is Completely Unprepared to Cover a Trump Presidency Adam Serwer Donald Trump and his surrogates have shown an uncanny ability to lie in the face of objective facts. They will now have the power of the federal government to help them. Saddam Hussein was allied with al-Qaeda, and helped finance the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The Hussein regime had sought uranium from Niger. Iraq had obtained aluminum tubes to be used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. All of those assertions turned out to be false. But they echoed throughout the press in the months-long run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and only after the war turned to disaster did the media engage in soul-searching and self-criticism. And even then, many sought to deflect blame. Judith Miller, the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter whose front-page story about the aluminum tubes bolstered the case for war in Iraq explained: “My job isn’t to assess the government’s information and be an independent intelligence analyst myself. My job is to tell readers of The New York Times what the government thought about Iraq's arsenal.” Continue Reading Chris Arnade The Trump Voter’s Quest for Respect Adam Chandler A conversation about the election with Chris Arnade, a former Wall Street trader who now chronicles life in working-class American cities and towns Like so many, Chris Arnade didn’t think Donald Trump’s election-night triumph would happen. But he had a clue it might. Four years ago, Arnade traded in a Wall Street job for a life of semi-transience, photographing addiction and poverty in the South Bronx. After a few years, he decided to take his project national. “I wanted to see if what I saw there was true across the rest of America,” he told me on the phone this week. Over the past two years, Arnade put over 100,000 miles on his car traveling through “overlooked” American towns with names that sound nearly fictional: Kingsport, Tennessee; Natchitoches, Louisiana; Mingo, West Virginia. He photographs and tweets about the people he meets, begetting a mosaic of a divided and frustrated country during the rise of Trump. “It was almost accidental that I got into the Donald Trump thing,” he says with a laugh.

What follows is an extended transcript of several conversations on foreign policy I had with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which formed the basis of a story in the December issue of The Atlantic. That story, along with an interview on Kissinger’s reaction to the surprise electoral victory of Donald Trump, can be found here. The transcript below has been condensed and edited for clarity. On Trump Jeffrey Goldberg: Give me your underlying view of  Donald Trump on foreign policy. Henry Kissinger: In public, he speaks with great assurance, but some of the proposals he has made most emphatically will encounter obstacles to implementation. Neither Congress nor Mexico is likely to fund the construction of his wall. Continue Reading We're Probably Imagining Aliens Wrong Nadine Ajaka Why haven’t we found extraterrestrial life?

The growth of the global market is largely driven by increasing consumption of meat and milk, and increasing zoonotic and food borne diseases. Due to growing health concern of related animals and their increasing number, the healthcare expenses in farms are surging globally. Animal farms are increasing globally, due to growing demand for protein rich foods, such as milk, eggs and meat. Increasing trend of pet adoption is another key factor driving the growth of the global market. The declining research and development productivity and growth of generic and OTC drugs for animal care are the key trend witnessed in the global market. The declining research and development productivity is leading to the maturity of animal pharmaceutical product portfolio. The fewer new chemical entity approvals are limiting the opportunities for key manufacturers to expand their portfolio in animal pharmaceuticals market. The low productivity of research and development increases the competition among the key manufacturers. Explore Report Description with Detailed TOC at: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/animal-pharmaceuticals-market Among the different types of animal pharmaceutical products, the ectoparasiticides generated largest revenue in the global animal pharmaceuticals market in 2015. High prevalence of animals affected with ectoparasites is the key factor driving the growth of the ectoparasiticides market. The bronchodilators market would witness fastest growth during the forecast period. Based on animal type, the largest revenue was generated from the sales of animal pharmaceuticals for companion animals in 2015. Whereas, the animal pharmaceuticals market for production animals would witness faster growth during the forecast period. Increasing awareness regarding the livestock related diseases is the key reason behind the higher growth of the animal pharmaceuticals market for production animals.

The South Korean conglomerate pulled the plug on the entire product line and slashed its third-quarter profit forecast by $2.3 billion. On a 10-point scale measuring financial and reputational damage to a company, Samsung’s recall ranks between 4 and 7, said Srinivas Reddy, director of the Center for Marketing Excellence at Singapore Management University who has researched product and brand failures. That’s because the exploding phones — while still “a calamity” for the company — haven’t killed anyone, Reddy said. “The threat for Samsung is how soon they can get back,” Reddy said. “If they don’t get back soon, it provides a vacuum for others to creep in.” In a marketplace where everything from cars to cows can have deadly defects, Samsung’s product failure is far from the worst in history. Merck & Co.’s 2004 scandal with its drug Vioxx — which studies showed could increase the chance of heart attacks and strokes in some patients — was a “catastrophic disaster,” rating a 10 on Reddy’s scale. Payouts from lawsuits and government investigations tallied more than $8.5 billion. Other notorious recalls include: Some versions of Ford Motor Co.’s Pinto compact car first introduced in 1971 came with a fatal design flaw — impacts to the rear of the vehicle could cause fuel leaks and explosions. Ford recalled about 1.5 million Pintos in 1978 amid a U.S. government investigation and criminal charges in the state of Indiana. Ford shut down Pinto production soon thereafter. The largest car-related recall in history is yet to be completed and could result in bankruptcy with billions of dollars in costs. Takata Corp.’s air-bags were meant to save lives in the event of a crash. Instead, the defective products became deadly cannons that shot shards of materials at passengers — at least 16 people have died in relation to the product. Food staples like chicken, beef and peanut butter have been recalled because of mistakes or unhygienic conditions in manufacturing processes. Peanut Corp. of America used the eponymous nut in more than 800 products that were tainted with salmonella in 2009. The result was nine deaths, more than 700 illnesses and one of the biggest recalls in U.S. history. The company collapsed and the former chief executive officer was sentenced to prison. Even medicines taken to ease the pain have proven to be fatal. In 1982, Johnson & Johnson recalled about 31 million bottles of Tylenol after seven people in the Chicago area died from swallowing cyanide-spiked capsules. Some of the highest-profile cases have involved children. Mattel Inc. recalled about 21 million Chinese-made toys, including those based on characters from “Sesame Street” and “Dora the Explorer,” after they were found to contain more than 180 times the allowable levels of lead paint. If ingested by children, lead can cause brain damage, learning problems and even death.

Disappointing Chinese trade data may weigh on the markets amid renewed concerns about the outlook for global economic growth. Traders also continue to digest the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which suggested that an interest rate hike at the December meeting remains on the table. U.S. stocks moved about in a directionless manner on Wednesday amid pre-announcements, the Fed minutes and a retreat in oil prices. The major averages initially moved lower but saw volatility throughout the morning. The Dow Industrials and the S&P 500 Index stayed mostly afloat thereafter before ending modestly higher, while the Nasdaq Composite continued to show volatility before closing in the red. The Dow Industrials added 15.54 points or 0.09 percent before ending at 18,144 and the S&P 500 Index tacked on 2.45 points or 0.11 percent to 2,139, while the Nasdaq Composite ended down 7.77 points or 0.15 percent at 5,239. Sixteen of the thirty Dow components finished the session higher, while the remaining fourteen stocks declined. McDonald's (MCD), Travelers (TRV) and Nike (NKE) were among the biggest gainers of the session, while Cisco (CSCO) fell sharply. Among the sectors, gold and utility stocks rallied, but biotechnology, networking, and oil service stocks came under selling pressure. On the economic front, the minutes of the September Fed meeting showed that the decision to leave interest rates unchanged was a close call. Several members seem to believe that a rate hike is needed relatively soon. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil is slipping $0.17 to $50.01 a barrel. The November futures ended the previous session down $0.61 at $50.18 a barrel. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,257.40 an ounce, up $3.60 from the previous session's close of $1,253.80 an ounce. On Wednesday, gold fell $2.10. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 103.64 yen compared to the 104.21 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1031 compared to yesterday's $1.1007. Asia Asian stocks sold off as the Fed minutes heightened rate hike fears and Chinese trade data reignited growth worries. The Hong Kong and Indian market led the slide. However, the New Zealand and Chinese markets rose marginally. With the overnight weakness of the yen abating, Japanese stocks ended moderately lower. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher, as the yen had weakened to above the 104-level against the dollar overnight. After staying positive until early afternoon trading, the index retreated amid a let up in the strength of the dollar versus the yen and languished below the unchanged line thereafter. The index ended down 65.76 points or 0.39 percent at 16,774. Food, housing, retail, real estate, paper, export, banking and utility stocks came under selling pressure, while chemical and resource stocks saw mixed sentiment. Australia's All Ordinaries Index languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before ending down 36.90 points or 0.66 percent at a 2-week low of 5,518. Energy, IT, financial and material stocks were among the worst hit. On the other hand, consumer staple, industrial, real estate and utility stocks gained ground. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 375.75 points or 1.61 percent before ending at 23,031, while China's Shanghai Composite Index ended at 3,061, up 2.85 points or 0.09 percent. On the economic front, data released by the Chinese General Administration of Customs showed that exports from China fell 10 percent year-over-year in September compared to the 3.3 percent drop expected by economists. Imports fell 1.9 percent, belying expectations for a 0.9 percent increase. The trade surplus narrowed to $42 billion, smaller than the $53 billion surplus forecast by economists. Among other data, an index compiled by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed that tertiary or service sector activity in Japan fell in August after expanding in each of the previous two months. A Bank of Japan report showed that bank lending in Japan rose 2.2 percent in September, faster than the 2 percent increase in August. The Bank of Korea's monetary policy board voted to keep the nation's benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low 1.25 percent for the fourth straight month. This followed June's surprise rate cut by 25 basis points from 1.50 percent after 10 straight meetings without a move. Europe European stocks opened lower and have seen further downside amid U.S. rate worries and Chinese growth concerns. Some lackluster domestic corporate tidings are also hurting performance. In major corporate news, Unilever (UL) reported third-quarter total turnover of 13.4 billion euros, down 0.1 percent due to a negative currency impact. Sales increased by 3.4% at constant exchange rates, while underlying sales growth was 3.2 percent. Meanwhile, U.K. supermarket chain Tesco announced that it has pulled dozens of household products supplied by Unilever from its online shopping site over pricing and a weaker pound. German drug maker Merck KgaA said it firmly expects to meet the objectives set for 2018. The company said it has focused on its pharmaceutical pipeline and continuously developed it further. France's Casino Group reported 2.9 percent sales growth on an organic basis for its third quarter. Same store sales were up 1.7 percent. Südzucker reported higher first half profits despite a drop in revenues. Fraport reported higher traffic for September, with the year-ago numbers dragged down by a strike. If not for the negative impact, traffic would have been flat. On the economic front, final data released by the German Federal Statistical Office confirmed the acceleration in annual German consumer price inflation to a 16-month high of 0.7 percent in September. This follows a 0.4 percent increase in August. The harmonized index of consumer prices rose 0.5 percent year-over-year, the fastest thus far in the year. House prices in the U.K. picked up steam in September, the latest survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed, with a house price balance score of +17. This was up from +13 in August and the three-year low of +5 in July. U.S. Economic Reports First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits held steady in the week ended October 8th, the Labor Department revealed in a report. The Labor Department said initial jobless claims came in at 246,000, unchanged from the previous week's revised level. Economists had expected jobless claims to climb to 254,000 from the 249,000 originally reported for the previous week. A separate report released by the Labor Department showed a modest increase in import prices in the month of September. The report said import prices inched up by 0.1 percent in September after falling by 0.2 percent in August. The uptick in prices matched economist estimates. The Labor Department also said export prices rose by 0.3 percent in September following a 0.8 percent drop in August. Export prices had been expected to edge up by 0.1 percent. The Energy Information Administration is set to release its weekly petroleum inventory report for the week ended October 7th at 11 am ET. In the week ended September 30th, crude oil stockpiles fell by 3 million barrels to 499.7 million barrels. Nevertheless, stockpiles were still at historically high levels for this time of year. Distillate inventories declined by 2.4 million barrels but were above the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year. However, gasoline inventories increased by 0.2 million barrels last week and were above the upper limit of the average range. Refinery capacity utilization averaged 90.8 percent over the four weeks ended September 30th compared to 92.2 percent for the four weeks ended September 23rd. Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker will speak on the economic outlook to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia at 12:15 pm ET. The speech will be followed by an audience and media Q&A. The Treasury Department will release the results of its auction of 30-year bonds at 1 pm ET. The Treasury is also due to release its monthly budgetary statement for September at 2 pm ET. In August, the budgetary balance was at a deficit of $107.1 billion. At 9 pm ET, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari is scheduled to participate in a town hall about ending too big to fail and the role of the Federal Reserve at the University of Montana in Missoula. Stocks in Focus Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported adjusted third quarter earnings of $1.70 per share, exceeding estimates by five cents a share. However, revenue came in below forecasts. Wells Fargo (WFC) announced its Chairman and CEO John Stumpf is retiring from the company and the board, effective immediately. The company announced the appointment of COO Tim Sloan to the post of CEO and its lead director Stephen Sanger as its non-executive Chairman. Railroad operator CSX (CSX) reported better than expected third quarter results despite both earnings and revenues declining year-over-year. Winnebago (WGO) reported fourth quarter net income of $13.1 million or $0.49 per share on revenues of $263.3 million. Analysts had expected the company to report earnings of $0.47 per share on revenues of $252.52 million. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

Some lackluster domestic corporate tidings are also hurting performance. The major averages in the region are lower for the third straight session and are at their lowest level in over 2 weeks. The CAC 40 Index of France is currently down 1.30 percent at 4,395, the German DAX Index is losing 1.22 percent and is at 10,395 and the U.K.'s FTSE is at 6,975 by virtue of a 0.69 percent drop. The Swiss Market Index is down 0.79 percent at 8,005. The Euro STOXX 50 Index, a compilation of blue chip stocks across the euro area, is down 1.21 percent at 2,972. The weakness is broad based, with financial, automakers, resource and technology stocks being the worst hit. Wednesday, U.S. stocks moved about in a directionless manner amid pre-announcements, Fed minutes and retreat in oil prices before ending lower. Meanwhile, Asian stocks sold off today, as the FOMC minutes heightened rate hike fears and Chinese trade data reignited growth worries, with the Hong Kong and Indian market leading the slide.
