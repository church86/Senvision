Anti IL-17 A/F Nanobody® is an investigational therapy that has completed Phase I development, and is expected to begin Phase II in plaque psoriasis in 2017. Avillion will be responsible for developing anti IL-17 A/F Nanobody® from Phase II through Phase III. Avillion will also finance the clinical programme through to regulatory submission. No financial terms are disclosed. Allison Jeynes-Ellis, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Avillion, said: "We are delighted to embark on this new clinical co-development project with Merck and its innovative nanobody candidate. This agreement is a further endorsement of our innovative business model and follows the success of our Phase III programme with Pfizer for BOSULIF® (bosutinib) in chronic myeloid leukaemia. We are very encouraged that our collaborative approach to advancing the development of clinical candidates and boosting our partners' R&D productivity is gaining such awareness in the biopharma industry." "The collaboration announced today with Avillion will allow us to optimally deliver on the potential of IL-17, a compound which could address several areas of unmet need for patients today," said Belén Garijo, member of the Executive Board of Merck and CEO Healthcare . "In parallel, we have several highly-promising priority clinical assets in our pipeline, all of which we must continue to drive in-house. By partnering appropriately, not only can we maintain the internal focus on our R&D innovation strategy, but also maximize other opportunities that emerge from our pipeline." Anti IL-17 A/F Nanobody® is an investigational bi-specific half-life extended nanobody that is thought to neutralise both IL-17A and IL-17F with the potential to treat inflammatory diseases. Due to the small size and unique structure of Nanobodies®, they could be an ideal building block for a new generation of novel biological drugs. Merck acquired full, exclusive rights to anti IL-17 A/F Nanobody® through a global development and commercialization deal with Ablynx in 2013.  About Avillion  Avillion LLP is a drug development company with an innovative business model focusing on the clinical co-development and regulatory approval of late stage pharmaceutical products.

Disappointments over the company's main growth driver continues to worry investors Jim Crumly (TMFSpeyside) Mar 30, 2017 at 3:26PM A year ago, large-cap drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) was in the extraordinary position of having what many considered the best immuno-oncology franchise in the industry. But in the last few months, some major setbacks for the company's flagship drug, Opdivo, have left investors wondering if the company is becoming an also-ran in the space. The concerns are legitimate, and the questions are far from settled. A promising beginning When Opdivo emerged on the market a few years ago, it was considered a breakthrough in the fight against cancer. The drug works by inhibiting a process that cancer cells use to hide from the body's natural immune system. By blocking the PD-1 receptors on T cells, Opdivo prevents cancer cells from turning off the immune response and therefore energizes the body to attack the tumor. When the drug first won approval for melanoma in late 2014, the market recognized that this mechanism could be used for a wide variety of cancer indications, and the stock climbed. Image source: Getty Images.   Indeed, the company launched trials pitting the drug against non-Hodgkin lymphoma, renal cell carcinoma, advanced liver cancer, and the biggest potential prize of them all, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Other drug companies jumped at the chance to try Opdivo in combination with their own drugs in development. FDA and European approval for Opdivo as a second-line treatment for NSCLC helped accelerate Opdivo sales, which have been the primary source of growth for Bristol-Myers since then. Data source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. Chart by author. A blown trial The optimism around Opdivo took a sudden turn in August 2016 when the drug failed a trial for first-line treatment of lung cancer, causing the stock to crash 16% in a single day. The trial showed that previously untreated NSCLC patients responded no better to Opdivo than to conventional chemotherapy. This was a devastating result, especially considering that four months earlier, Merck had released trial results showing that its similar checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda, was markedly superior to chemotherapy in previously untreated patients who had been screened for tumors that express high levels of the PD-L1 protein. When the FDA approved Keytruda as a first-line treatment for NSCLC in October, Bristol-Myers lost its leadership position in a matter of weeks. Compounding investor disappointment with the situation was the fact that the failure was at least partly self-inflicted due to the strategy that Bristol-Myers took with the trial. Overestimating the drug's efficacy, the company swung for the fences by testing Opdivo against a broad population of patients, whereas Merck increased its chance for success by screening for patients that would theoretically have a greater sensitivity to Keytruda's action. Had the Opdivo trial yielded positive results, Bristol-Myers would have gained a tremendous advantage over Merck, given the foothold its drug already had in the market. But instead, the company whiffed, and Merck won the valuable position as the only provider of a first-line PD-1 drug for NSCLC. Losing the race to first-line treatment of lung cancer would be bad enough, but the growing perception -- perhaps accurate -- is that Keytruda is the superior molecule for this disease, and Bristol-Myers may find that its sales for second-line treatment is at risk as well. More bad signs this year As if the failed trial weren't enough, Bristol-Myers added to concerns about Opdivo in January by abruptly announcing that it had decided not to pursue accelerated approval of its combination therapy of Opdivo and monoclonal antibody Yervoy for first-line treatment of lung cancer "after review of data available at this time." FDA accelerated approval allows a company to win early approval of a drug for a serious disease based on reaching a "surrogate endpoint" in a registrational trial. The surrogate can be a laboratory measurement that is believed to predict a clinical benefit. The only logical conclusion that observers could draw from the change in strategy is that early data on any potential surrogate endpoints in the Opdivo/Yervoy trial are not meeting expectations, and that raises flags not only for the trial, but adds to concerns about Opdivo for lung cancer. The stock dropped 11% on that news, and company officials added to worries by refusing to comment on the move in the quarterly conference call six days later, saying only that they are "committed" to the drug combo but not saying anything else that would clarify the outlook. The market hates uncertainty, and now there is a big cloud of that around Opdivo and Bristol's near-term growth prospects. In early March, the company announced the replacement of its chief scientific officer, the executive who would have had responsibility for setting clinical trial strategy, with board member Dr. Thomas J. Lynch, an oncologist with years of experience in leading research in lung cancer. This indicates that the company felt a change was necessary after two major missteps, and that the market for lung cancer treatments is still a critical priority. Opportunity remains, but the concerns are legit Bristol-Myers is not out of the running for first-line treatments for lung cancer, by any means. Besides the Opdivo/Yervoy combination, there are studies of other combinations in the works, most notably including chemotherapy as part of the regimen. The company is seeing good growth in European sales of Opdivo for its existing indications, and the company is focusing on late-stage trials for new indications, such as first-line treatments for renal cell cancer and liver cancer. And the company has a rich pipeline of other biologics that attack other inhibitory signals given out by cancer cells, potentially opening the door for multiple combination therapies that could produce breakthroughs. But cancer treatments are a very competitive space, and for the near term, Bristol-Myers' main growth engine faces challenges. Merck is expected to receive FDA approval soon for a Keytruda/chemotherapy combination for first-line treatment of NSCLC in a very broad population of patients. Bristol-Myers also lost 10 points of market share in second-line lung cancer to Roche's Tecentriq. The issue in the long term is far from settled, Opdivo concerns are already built into the stock price at this point, and Bristol-Myers has plenty in its pipeline to fuel future growth. But investors have good reason to be concerned about the potential for more bad news in the next few quarters as the battle for lung cancer treatments continues to play out.

Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a ruling (PDF), which vacates summary judgment granted in product liability lawsuits over Fosamax, which alleged that Merck failed to adequately warn consumers and the medical community that the popular osteoporosis drug may increase the risk of femur fractures. Merck previously faced more than 1,100 cases brought throughout the federal court system by individuals who suffered a sudden thigh fracture following long-term use of the medication. While Fosamax is designed to strengthen bones and reduce the risk of fractures associated with osteoporosis, studies have linked the drug to an increased risk of femur fractures, often involving little or no trauma, such as falling from standing height or less. Given the similar questions of fact and law presented in the claims, the Fosamax fracture litigation was consolidated in the federal court system as part of an MDL, or multidistrict litigation, with all cases centralized before U.S. District Judge Joel A. Pisano in the District of New Jersey for discovery and pretrial proceedings. Following several years of litigation, Judge Pisano granted summary judgment after deciding that there was evidence the FDA would have rejected any request by the drug maker to strengthen the Fosamax warning label. However, the appeals court disagreed. The lower court decision was based on an interpretation of the Supreme Court’s decision in Wyeth v. Levine, which found that state law “failure to warn” claims are pre-empted by federal law. However, the appeals court pointed out that pre-emption only applies if the drug manufacturer can establish that there is “clear evidence” the FDA would have rejected a warning label change. In a 78 page opinion, a panel of three judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit explained that plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to determine the FDA would have approved a properly-worded Fosamax fracture warning. “Preemption is an affirmative defense, and Merck has not carried its burden to prove that it is entitled to that defense as a matter of law,” the Third Circuit determined. “The Wyeth ‘clear evidence’ standard is demanding and fact-sensitive. It requires the factfinder to predict a highly probable outcome in a counterfactual world and, therefore, requires a court sitting in summary judgment to anticipate both the range of conclusions that a reasonable juror might reach and the certainty with which the juror would reach them.” Hundreds of cases can now be reinstated, and the issue may go before a jury, unless the manufacturer reaches Fosamax settlement agreements or another resolution for the litigation.

This article appears in the Spring 2017 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here.  Rob Frankil of Sellersville, Pennsylvania, followed his father into the family business after college. “My entire life,” he said, “I’ve been involved with managing and owning independent pharmacies.” He now owns two stores, a traditional community pharmacy and another that caters to long-term care facilities. Like any retail outlet, Frankil purchases inventory from a wholesale distributor and sells it to customers at a small markup. But unlike butchers or hardware store owners, pharmacists have no idea how much money they’ll make on a sale until the moment they sell it. That’s because the customer’s co-pay doesn’t cover the cost of the drug. Instead, a byzantine reimbursement process determines Frankil’s fee. “I get a prescription, type in the data, click send, and I’m told I’m getting a dollar or two,” Frankil says. The system resembles the pull of a slot machine: Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. “Pharmacies sell prescriptions at significant losses,” he adds. “So what do I do? Fill the prescription and lose money, or don’t fill it and lose customers? These decisions happen every single day.” Frankil’s troubles cannot be traced back to insurers or drug companies, the usual suspects that most people deem responsible for raising costs in the health-care system. He blames a collection of powerful corporations known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. If you have drug coverage as part of your health plan, you are likely to carry a card with the name of a PBM on it. These middlemen manage prescription drug benefits for health plans, contracting with drug manufacturers and pharmacies in a multi-sided market. Over the past 30 years, PBMs have evolved from paper-pushers to significant controllers of the drug pricing system, a black box understood by almost no one. Lack of transparency, unjustifiable fees, and massive market consolidations have made PBMs among the most profitable corporations you’ve never heard about. Americans pay the highest health-care prices in the world, including the highest for drugs, medical devices, and other health-care services and products. Our fragmented system produces many opportunities for excessive charges. But one lesser-known reason for those high prices is the stranglehold that a few giant intermediaries have secured over distribution. The antitrust laws are supposed to provide protection against just this kind of concentrated economic power. But in one area after another in today’s economy, federal antitrust authorities and the courts have failed to intervene. In this case, PBMs are sucking money out of the health-care system—and our wallets—with hardly any public awareness of what they are doing. Even some Republicans criticize PBMs for pursuing profit at the public’s expense. “They show no interest in playing fair, no interest in the end user,” says Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, one of the industry’s loudest critics. “They act as monopolistic terrorists on this market.” Collins and a bipartisan group in Congress want to rein in the PBM industry, setting up a titanic battle between competing corporate interests. The question is whether President Donald Trump will join that effort to fulfill his frequent promises to bring down drug prices.   How the PBMs Take Your Money PBMs were formed in the late 1960s, initially to help with claims processing. As insurance plans started to offer prescription drug benefits, PBMs filled out paperwork, making sure reimbursements were passed along to pharmacies. And for a while, they really did provide a service, as one of the first health-care players to fully computerize claims-processing. This made the system more efficient and enhanced the fledgling industry’s credibility. Over time, PBMs presented themselves as a cost-reducer. By aggregating customers of health-plan sponsors—insurance companies, big employers that self-insure, unions, state and federal employee plans, even Medicare and Medicaid—PBMs could form large patient networks, and negotiate discounts from both drug companies and pharmacies, which would have no choice but to contract with them to access the network. The savings would consequently pass through to plans and their patients. It sounded great. Ildar Sagdejev/Creative Commons On Speed: The CVS Caremark merger creates overwheming market power.  This approach can work, when it truly represents what John Kenneth Galbraith termed countervailing power—when one large economic force counteracts another and prevents excessive advantage. But when one source of private power becomes the new monopolist, the idea backfires. A monopolist armed with state power and committed to serving the public interest—such as the VA’s power to negotiate drug prices—is a very different story. In the case of PBMs, their desire for larger patient networks created incentives for their own consolidation, promoting their market dominance as a means to attract customers. Today’s “big three” PBMs—Express Scripts, CVS Caremark, and OptumRx, a division of large insurer UnitedHealth Group—control between 75 percent and 80 percent of the market, which translates into 180 million prescription drug customers. All three companies are listed in the top 22 of the Fortune 500, and as of 2013, a JPMorgan analyst estimated total PBM revenues at more than $250 billion. The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, the industry’s lobbying group, claims that PBMs will save health plans $654 billion over the next decade. But we do know that PBMs haven’t exactly arrested skyrocketing drug prices. According to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, between 1987 and 2014, expenditures on prescription drugs have jumped 1,100 percent. Numerous factors can explain that—increased volume of medications, more usage of brand-name drugs, price-gouging by drug companies. But PBM profit margins have been growing as well. For example, according to one report, Express Scripts’ adjusted profit per prescription has increased 500 percent since 2003, and earnings per adjusted claim for the nation’s largest PBM went from $3.87 in 2012 to $5.16 in 2016. That translates into billions of dollars skimmed into Express Scripts’ coffers, coming not out of the pockets of big drug companies or insurers, but of the remaining independent retail druggists—and consumers. Why haven’t PBMs fulfilled their promise as a cost inhibitor? The biggest reason experts cite is an information advantage in the complex pharmaceutical supply chain. At a hearing last year about the EpiPen, a simple shot to relieve symptoms of food allergies, Heather Bresch, CEO of EpiPen manufacturer Mylan, released a chart claiming that more than half of the list price for the product ($334 out of the $608 for a two-pack) goes to other participants—insurers, wholesalers, retailers, or the PBM. But when asked by Republican Representative Buddy Carter of Georgia, the only pharmacist in Congress, how much the PBM receives, Bresch replied, “I don’t specifically know the breakdown.” Carter nodded his head and said, “Nor do I and I’m the pharmacist. … That’s the problem, nobody knows.” This lack of transparency enables PBMs to enjoy multiple hidden revenue streams from every other player. “It’s OK to have intermediaries, we have Visa,” says David Balto, an antitrust litigator and former top official with the Federal Trade Commission. “But these companies make a fabulous amount of money, even though they’re not buying the drug, not producing the drug, not putting themselves at risk.” The PBM industry is rife with conflicts of interest and kickbacks. For example, PBMs secure rebates from drug companies as a condition of putting their products on the formulary, the list of reimbursable drugs for their network. However, they are under no obligation to disclose those rebates to health plans, or pass them along. Sometimes PBMs call them something other than rebates, using semantics to hold onto the cash. Health plans have no way to obtain drug-by-drug cost information to know if they’re getting the full discount. Controlling the formulary gives PBMs a crucial point of leverage over the system. Express Scripts and CVS Caremark have used it to exclude hundreds of drugs, while preferring other therapeutic treatments. (This can result in patients getting locked out of their medications without an emergency exemption.) And there are indications that PBMs place drugs on their formularies based on how high a rebate they obtain, rather than the lowest cost or what is most effective for the patient. “Let’s say there are two drugs in the same therapeutic category—one for $500 and one for $350,” says Linda Cahn, an attorney and founder of Pharmacy Benefit Consultants, which helps health plans negotiate contracts with PBMs. “Which manufacturer can promise more rebates? Obviously the one with the $500 drug.” And because drug companies establish their own prices, they can use a higher ceiling to give more in rebates to get on PBM formularies. This practice creates incentives for drug manufacturers to raise prices, and if the PBMs keep the rebates, the health plan pays more. Even if the rebates offset the list price, they are used to determine patient co-pays, so the consumer feels the burden from an increase in price that might otherwise never have taken place. Indeed, the very existence of consultants such as Cahn suggests another cost driver. PBMs themselves are intended to save costs. But now, PBM abuses require additional layers of consultants to limit mischief. The Justice Department has fined Medco and Express Scripts for receiving kickbacks from manufacturers to steer patients to higher-cost products, a process known as drug switching. “Look at a drug like [acid reflux medication] Nexium,” says Susan Hayes, an industry consultant with Pharmacy Outcomes Specialists, a firm that audits PBMs and negotiates for health plans. “[PBMs] allowed it to stay as a covered drug, even though there was an over-the-counter pill available. They preferred a brand name over an OTC that was 1/100th the cost.” AstraZeneca admitted in 2015 to giving kickbacks to PBMs to keep Nexium in their formularies, paying the government $7.9 million. Additionally, The Columbus Dispatch explained last October how, in some cases, a consumer’s co-pay costs more than the price of the drug outside the health plan. But the pharmacy is barred from informing the patients because of clauses in their PBM contracts; they can only provide the information when asked. The excess co-pay goes back to the PBM. Game-playing with brand-name drugs pales in comparison to more profitable schemes for generics, which represent the vast majority of filled prescriptions (though they account for only about half of the revenues, since brand-name drugs are so much more expensive). PBMs reimburse pharmacies for generics based on a schedule called the maximum allowable cost (MAC). But the actual number is hidden until the point of sale. “The contracts are written in the form of algorithms,” says Lynn Quincy, director of the Healthcare Value Hub for Consumers Union. “It’s not a list of drugs with a price next to it. Nobody knows what they’re up to.” AP Photo/Toby Talbot, File Pushers: Makers of OxyContin paid PBMs to keep prescriptions flowing.  The MAC list that goes to the pharmacy does not necessarily match the one for the health plan. By charging the plan sponsor more than they pay the pharmacy in a reimbursement, PBMs can make anywhere from $5 to $200 per prescription, without either player in the chain knowing. While some spread pricing can be expected, the opacity of the profit stream masks the allegedly low costs PBMs tout to health plans to get them to sign up. Marketplace conditions frequently change, which can result in large spikes in the prices of generic drugs. But in what can only be described as deliberate laziness, the PBM often does not respond by altering the price on their MAC list, pocketing an even bigger spread. Pharmacies can lose hundreds of dollars on a generic prescription overnight. They can appeal to the PBM for paying a below-cost reimbursement, but pharmacists say those are routinely denied, and almost never retroactively reimbursed. “One of my colleagues said if you went on Shark Tank and proposed this idea they’d laugh at you,” says pharmacist Frankil. “They underpay you and you can’t do anything about it? It’s insane.” PBMs can also charge pharmacies additional fees months after a sale. Direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees were originally conceived as a way for Medicare to discover the true net cost of the drugs Medicare beneficiaries purchased through Part D, by forcing disclosure of all rebates from drug manufacturers. But PBMs secured a key loophole keeping their disclosures to the federal government confidential, while arguing that DIRs also legally apply to pharmacies. In theory, DIR fees deliver higher reimbursement rates to pharmacies that display better performance. But, as Frankil explains, druggists have little control over the outcomes that affect reimbursement. Pharmacies get rated partly on whether their customers stay on their medications. “I can’t stop by your house and say take your pill every day,” Frankil says. “We have strategies, but we’re at the mercy of the customers.” Another rating involves ensuring diabetics take medications to modulate their blood pressure, meaning Frankil has to call doctors to get them to prescribe the drugs. “Can you imagine how that call goes? The doctor says, ‘Are you the doctor?’” Wikimedia Commons In 2015, AstraZeneca to giving kickbacks to PBMs to keep Nexium in their formularies, despite an over-the-counter version being available.  Lower performance ratings result in higher DIR fees, which the PBM takes out of pharmacies’ reimbursement checks every quarter. A recent report from the Community Oncology Alliance estimates that DIR fees can amount to as high as a 9 percent tax on gross revenues, which cuts pharmacy profits by up to 50 percent on a single prescription. Uncertainty over the size of DIR fees means pharmacies cannot assess their profit margins. “It’s impossible to operate a business when you don’t know when the other shoe is going to drop,” says John Norton of the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA), which represents 22,000 independent pharmacies. The PBMs’ use of these fees also harms patients and taxpayers. Consumers pay co-pays or deductibles for drugs based on the list price, without DIR fees or rebates that would lower them. And retroactive DIR fees are routinely not reported to Medicare, as PBMs call them “network variable rates” or “pharmacy performance payments” and keep them for themselves. Obscuring DIR fees makes the net costs of drugs look higher to Medicare than they actually are. As a result, patients hit the “donut hole” coverage gap in Medicare Part D faster, forcing them to pay the full cost of their drugs. And it accelerates high-usage patients into catastrophic coverage faster as well, where Medicare pays 80 percent of all costs. All of this leaves subscribers and Medicare, i.e. the taxpayers, to pay more out of pocket, as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services noted in a January report. The question begging to be asked is why all the players in the market—plan sponsors, drug companies, and pharmacies—put up with a middleman that extracts profits from all of them? And the answer is the failure of federal antitrust policy.   The Abuses that Antitrust Missed The first time PBMs tried to integrate with another part of the drug supply chain, the government took notice. A series of mergers in the 1990s put drug manufacturers Merck, Eli Lilly, and SmithKline Beecham in control of the most powerful PBMs. The drug companies could then view competitors’ pricing information and place their own drugs over their rivals’ on PBM formularies. “That raised eyebrows,” says attorney Linda Cahn. “It’s such a conflict of interest. Obviously, the PBMs were unlikely to negotiate aggressive terms with their manufacturer parent companies.” In 1997, Cahn filed class-action lawsuits against the two largest PBMs in America, Medco (then in the hands of Merck) and PCS Health Systems (part of Eli Lilly), for breaching their fiduciary duty to employee health plans and increasing drug costs. The high-profile cases motivated the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to crack down on the PBM/drug company alliance. After a series of settlements that removed the benefits of the vertical integration by requiring decisions on drug formularies to be delegated to an independent third party, Lilly, SmithKline, and Merck all sold their PBMs. But although the antitrust laws initially worked, PBMs kept consolidating, insisting that gaining market share would produce benefits for consumers. And this time, the FTC kept their hands off. SmithKline sold their PBM, Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, to Express Scripts in 1999. PCS got bought by Advance Paradigm in 2000, and the new company became part of Caremark in 2003. And then, Caremark found a buyer in 2007—CVS, one of the nation’s largest pharmacy chains. The Bush-era FTC barely blinked at this vertical combination of PBM and pharmacy. “That was the first unholy union,” says consultant Susan Hayes. Caremark steered its giant patient network toward CVS stores, through lower co-pays or out-of-network bans. They also got to see all the information in CVS’s other PBM deals, using the data to underprice rivals. CVS prescription revenue from Caremark plans nearly tripled in the seven years after the merger. Other PBMs got the message. They started their own specialty and mail-order pharmacies, mirroring the CVS Caremark model. And they consolidated as well. In 2012, Express Scripts and Medco, two of the three largest PBMs, announced a $29 billion merger. Julie Brill was one of five FTC commissioners at the time. “I said, ‘I need to understand the competitive justification,’” Brill says. “‘My understanding from your papers is you don’t need to get any bigger.’ And they said, ‘That’s right. We’re not making the argument that this merger is necessary to allow us to gain efficiencies of scale.’” But despite the lack of justification for the consolidation, the danger of higher prices, and the unusually large congressional opposition, the FTC approved the merger. Brill was the only dissenting vote. “I thought it was wishful thinking and not smart economic analysis,” she says. Three years later, Optum gobbled up Catamaran, creating the current situation where three firms control 80 percent of the market. Brill adds that the Big Three carve up the market geographically, effectively not competing in certain regions of the country. Amid such concentration, plan sponsors have little ability to select the best PBM on price or quality. “I just sat down with [one of the Big Three PBMs], I had half a billion dollars on the table,” says Susan Hayes. “They said, ‘Where are you going to compromise?’ Really? Where else do I bring half a billion and they say where will you compromise?” With such monopolized control, PBMs offer pharmacies take-it-or-leave-it contracts, with no opportunity to negotiate. These contracts employ punitive terms, including allowing the PBM to audit pharmacies, allegedly to ferret out waste, fraud, and abuse. “Minor technicalities are used to extract money,” says Susan Pilch, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs for the NCPA. “There are examples where you were supposed to initial on the bottom right of prescription, not the bottom left. The PBM recouped all claims on that.” Besides being a business partner, the PBM is also a competitor that can use all the pharmacy’s data against it. PBMs set up “preferred pharmacy networks” that give patients lower co-pays for using particular locations. Last year, 85 percent of all Medicare Part D plans used preferred networks, which often benefit large pharmacy chains that can afford to make deals for network access, like CVS Caremark. Specialty pharmacies report being frozen out by Express Scripts and other PBMs, with customers granted access only to its in-house specialty provider, Accredo. This practice has led to seven specialty pharmacy lawsuits against PBMs in the last year. PBMs also aggressively steer patients to their mail-order pharmacies. Customers get constant solicitations by phone or mail, enticing them to use “Amazon-style home delivery,” offering lower co-pays or larger supplies per order. “They take a customer list and solicit the customers while they’re purchasing a prescription,” says Representative Doug Collins. This persistent poaching has worked; a 2017 report from Drug Channels Institute found that PBM-owned pharmacies represented 46 percent of the industry’s revenue growth last year. Though PBMs challenge pharmacies to maintain customer compliance with prescription drugs, steering customers to mail-order pharmacies where they get no direction or personal contact can produce the opposite result. A 2013 study on patient adherence found that “personal connection with a pharmacy or pharmacy staff” was one of the most important variables for taking medications. AP Photo/Mel Evans, File A series of mergers in the 1990s put drug manufacturers Merck, Eli Lilly, and SmithKline Beecham in control of the most powerful PBMs. In addition, mail-order pharmacies often auto-ship drug shipments before patients run out, and on a chronic prescription, the drugs pile up. The NCPA has documented dozens of examples of pill waste, disposed after a patients’ death or when their doctor discontinues the treatment. People have brought in tens of thousands of dollars in unused meds, which often must be thrown away. That unnecessarily jacks up health-care costs, but the PBM profits on each pill shipped through its pharmacies. Other pharmacies have little recourse to fight back. PBM contracts frequently contain gag orders, preventing them from talking to local elected officials or disclosing the terms of the contract. Pharmacists complain of being threatened for mailing or delivering drugs to local patients, which would compete with PBM mail-order operations. The combined toll makes it difficult for independent pharmacies to stay in business. “This takes away a medical provider patients have used for years,” said Representative Buddy Carter. “I’ve had grandparents come to my store in tears and say ‘I can’t come here anymore.’”   Mergers Beget More Mergers Chain stores have turned to defensive consolidation to stay in the game. In October 2015, Walgreens and Rite Aid, two of the three largest drugstore chains (CVS is the other), announced plans to merge. Walgreens has explicitly said that acquiring a handful of PBMs bundled inside Rite Aid will enable them to better compete with CVS Caremark. “It’s the same story we’ve seen in so many industries, companies justifying their marriage on the basis of another company in the market with lots of power. It’s an arms race,” says Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.  In the wake of the announcement, Walgreens inked lucrative new partnerships with Express Scripts and Optum, CVS Caremark’s biggest rivals. The merger deal remains under review by the FTC. Independent pharmacies don’t have the luxury of using mergers to offset the PBM power imbalance. In fact, when states proposed letting independents form their own pharmacy networks, the FTC argued against it, warning that it would “impair the ability of prescription drug plans to negotiate the best prices with pharmacies.” Fewer independent pharmacies, especially in rural areas without alternatives, not only weakens local economies and prevents skilled professionals from using their talents. It also significantly degrades the health-care safety net. Rural pharmacies are places to consult face-to-face with a health-care professional, to check blood pressure, to get advice. If someone’s only option to get prescriptions filled is 50 miles up the road or by mail, they might not bother to seek the advice. Worst of all, PBMs don’t stop at legal money-making schemes. At his site PBM Watch, attorney David Balto compiled 56 pages’ worth of state and federal litigation against PBMs. Just a handful of these cases yielded $370 million in damages for undisclosed rebates, artificial price inflations, kickbacks, steering, and other deceptive practices. Last year, Anthem sued Express Scripts for $15 billion, claiming the PBM violated their agreement by charging excessive rates for drugs. Federal agents from two states issued subpoenas for Express Scripts last fall, seeking information on the company’s business practices. In January, diabetes patients sued three drug manufacturers for conspiring with PBMs to triple the price of insulin. PBMs may even have contributed to the worst public health crisis in America—the opioid epidemic. An investigation by Stat News found that Purdue Pharma, makers of OxyContin, paid off PBMs to keep prescriptions flowing for their product, over the howls of a state employee health plan in West Virginia. In exchange for rebates, PBMs kept OxyContin on their formulary with low co-pays, and without requiring prior authorization from the health plan to dispense the drug. Overprescribing of OxyContin laid the groundwork for a crisis that killed more than 20,000 Americans in 2015. “They were making a profit on people’s addiction, which is fricking criminal,” says consultant Susan Hayes. “Rubbing their hands with glee that people are becoming addicted to opioids. I can’t believe it.”   An Rx for Drug Pricing? Amid frustration on all sides of the market, some private-sector actors are attempting to break the PBM stranglehold. A group of 20 large employers representing four million patients, including Coca-Cola, Marriott, and Verizon, have formed the Health Transformation Alliance, seeking to break away from the “patchwork of complicated, expensive, and wasteful systems” in modern health care, including the pharmaceutical supply chain. The alliance has expressed interest in a “transparent PBM” model, which takes a flat administrative fee on each prescription, with all rebates and discounts fully disclosed and no hidden spreads. Transparent PBMs only have a sliver of the market, but they can get results: A hospital nonprofit network named Meridian Health Systems claimed to Fortune magazine that a transparent PBM saved it $2 million in the first year, about one-sixth of its total drug costs. But many employers don’t know enough about the system to go outside the Big Three, says Susan Hayes. “They’re trying to manage something they don’t understand. If you put blinders on, and hire one of the Big Three, you won’t get in trouble with the boss.” Another model would empower pharmacies. A 2016 report from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance highlights a quirk of law in North Dakota, which only allows drugstores to operate if owned by pharmacists (similar laws exist in Europe). The law prohibits chain pharmacies from entering the state. Not surprisingly, North Dakota’s independents deliver among the lowest prescription drug prices in the country, along with better health outcomes and more drugstores per capita than any other state. This flies in the face of industry claims that big chains and giant conglomerates save consumers money or improve services. Why can’t this successful model be replicated elsewhere? “The answer is PBMs,” says Stacy Mitchell, the report’s author. “Because in North Dakota, independents are the only game in town, PBMs have to negotiate with them. In other states, they have no leverage.” Unsurprisingly, PBMs and chains want the North Dakota law overturned rather than adopted in other states. For a more immediate impact, we must turn to Washington. And there, solutions often emerge when one large industry starts pointing the finger at another. Under fire for their many drug-pricing scandals, from Martin Shkreli to Valeant, the pharmaceutical industry has tried to deflect blame by citing PBMs. GlaxoSmithKline CEO Andrew Witty said in a February conference call that so much of the list price on the company’s drugs went to “non-innovators in a system which thinks it’s paying high prices for innovation,” a veiled reference to PBMs. An industry-funded report in January asserted that manufacturers took only 63 percent of gross drug revenues, attributing the decline to discounts and rebates paid to PBMs. (Of course, this hasn’t stopped pharmaceutical companies from earning higher profit margins than any other industry.) For their part, PBMs insist that drug prices would be even higher without them, arguing that they deliver broad access to medications and 90 percent customer satisfaction rates. But in an industry-on-industry arms race, the millions of dollars that leading PBMs and their trade groups spend each year on lobbying would be no match for the pharmaceutical industry. That creates opportunities for longtime PBM opponents in Washington, which include several Republicans representing rural districts, where independent pharmacies are getting crushed. Doug Collins, a third-term House member, experienced the PBM issue personally, when his mother couldn’t get her regular medications and her plan had no substitute on the formulary. “I am a free-market person, as conservative as they come,” Collins says. “When dealing with this, it’s not a free market.” Buddy Carter, his colleague, has worked in independent pharmacies since 1980, and sees himself as their voice in Congress. I asked him if he had difficulty explaining the PBM market and its problems to his colleagues. “Heck, it’s difficult for me to understand and I’ve worked in the industry over 35 years!” Carter says. Watch some hearing soundbites from these two and you’d think you’re seeing the second coming of William Jennings Bryan. “Who will my folks in my district of Georgia call, when they need someone at night and their local pharmacist is the one they trust?” Collins asked two PBM representatives in 2015. “They’re going to try and find their local pharmacist, who has been closed because of the anti-competitive nature of this field.” Carter grilled top PBM lobbyist Mark Merritt in 2016: “I notice that the profits of the PBMs have increased enormously over the past few years. In fact, almost doubled. And I find that very disturbing.” These are conservative Republicans! gemphoto/Shutterstock What can Congress do to reform PBMs? More than 20 states have passed laws to require more frequent MAC list updates, so PBMs can’t drag their feet and generate large pricing spreads. But PBMs started to circumvent the laws, in one case by eliminating the term “maximum allowable cost” from contracts. Collins’s bill, the MAC Transparency Act, would take care of this at a federal level, to stop the game-playing. Other bills in the House and Senate would prohibit retroactive DIR fees on Medicare Part D plans, stopping the after-the-fact clawbacks on pharmacy reimbursements. A separate bill would allow any willing pharmacy to participate in a PBM’s preferred pharmacy networks if they agree to the terms, increasing access in communities without chains. All of these bills would add transparency to the system, and reduce the incentives to constantly jack up prices. And they all have bipartisan cosponsors. Outside of the legislative arena, the FTC also has tremendous power to fix the prescription drug market by applying the antitrust laws. “I think it’s up to the regulators looking at the competition issues around PBMs to put their money where their mouth was,” says former FTC Commissioner Brill. “You said everything was going to be fine. Show us if you were right.” If the FTC determined that the PBM market was anti-competitive, they could sever the relationship between PBMs and pharmacies through sanctions or divestiture demands. They could even break up the entire industry to generate competition. And the FTC has the power to demand the very transparency members of Congress and state legislatures believe is the key to ending profiteering. But this would require a radical shift at the FTC, which has often opposed state legislation to regulate PBMs or increase transparency. “The FTC had argued now for over ten years that lack of transparency is necessary because it can drive prices down,” says Brill, citing recent FTC statements. “Prices have not been driven down, and we need to take a different route.” The wild card in all this is Donald Trump. At his one and only pre-inauguration press conference, Trump singled out drug companies for “getting away with murder,” vowing to create “new bidding procedures” for Medicare and earning praise from the likes of Bernie Sanders. But when Trump met with pharmaceutical executives two weeks into his presidency, he focused more on speeding up new drug approvals from the FDA and cutting regulations than on reducing industry profits. This lines up with the perspective of a key aide, Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who wants to overhaul the FDA process. (In fact, the Republican Congress just overhauled the FDA process in one of the last bills signed by Barack Obama.) Trump doesn’t appear to understand the cost excesses in the supply chain. Trump did say in his address to a joint session of Congress that he would “bring down the artificially high price of drugs.” And in his confirmation hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, discussing Trump’s idea for competitive bidding in Medicare, said that “right now the PBMs are doing that negotiation. … I think it is important to have a conversation and look at whether there is a better way to do that.” But where Trump’s team will ultimately land is unknown. “We need to get to a point of clarity about whether the administration is serious,” says the NCPA’s John Norton. Furthermore, any attempt to move forward legislatively on any part of health-care policy will run headlong into the deeply polarized debate over the Affordable Care Act. While a bipartisan alliance appears possible on the PBM issue in isolation, it will be difficult to separate anything health-related from the Obamacare vortex. The PBM industry’s leading trade group isn’t sleeping on the possibility of an attack. Days after Trump met with pharma execs, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association issued an internal memo leaked by Buzzfeed, stressing the need for “building a political firewall” in Congress to stop any legislative action. Frightened about drug manufacturers highlighting a “bloated supply chain,” PCMA CEO Merritt laid out a six-point strategy that included meetings with White House staff and key members of Congress, a digital ad campaign targeting congressional leaders, partnerships with right-wing think tanks like the American Action Forum, and working groups to shape regulatory changes that make PBMs the savior instead of a villain. “We will continue to show how competition—not government intervention—is the way to manage high drug costs,” Merritt wrote, apparently without irony. Merritt even scheduled a meeting with the main health insurance lobby, AHIP, “to make sure the payer community is aligned and coordinated.” With drug companies on one side and PBMs and insurers on the other, both camps will have plenty of resources. In that environment, is bipartisan action possible to break up a powerful monopoly? “My answer would be absolutely,” says Representative Carter. “Everyone is impacted by prescription drug prices.” Correction: An earlier verison of this article included a photo of German pharmaceutical The Merck Group, rather than the American pharmaceutical Merck & Co., Inc. <a href="//americanprospect-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=dd04c2a44a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//americanprospect-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=92678&cs=dd04c2a44a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> About the Author David Dayen is a contributing writer to Salon.com who also writes for The Intercept, The New Republic, and The Fiscal Times.

Crucially for poor countries, the new rotavirus vaccine requires no refrigeration Written by Anuradha Mascarenhas | Updated: March 31, 2017 9:38 am Dr Rebecca Grais (front row, second from left), Director of Research at Epicentre, a Paris-headquartered nonprofit that specialises in epidemiology, training and research in developing countries, led the Rotasiil trial in Niger. A new vaccine manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India has shown 66.7% efficacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis among infants in Niger in West Africa. Results of the Phase III efficacy trial, published on March 23 in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggest the low-cost oral vaccine can be a gamechanger in the global war against the deadly virus that kills, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 600 children a day — a staggering 22% of them in India. Serum Institute of India is the world’s largest vaccinemaker, producing and selling more than 1.3 billion doses globally every year. What is special about Serum Institute’s new rotavirus vaccine? Rotavac, a rotavirus vaccine produced by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, became part of India’s Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) when it was introduced in 4 states in April 2016, and was subsequently extended to 5 more states last month. The key step forward in the manufacture of Serum Institute of India’s new BRV-PV vaccine — to be ultimately called Rotasiil — is that it does not, unlike Rotavac, require refrigeration, and is, therefore, easier to store in low-income countries where rotavirus poses the greatest threat to children. BRV-PV has completed Phase III trials in Niger, and shown good efficacy in heat-challenge conditions. “This trial brings a vaccine which is adapted to African settings to those who need it most,” AFP quoted Sheila Isanaka, assistant professor of nutrition at Harvard University and co-author of the study in the New England Journal of Medicine, as saying. Adar Poonawalla, Chief Executive Officer, Serum Institute of India, said scientists had been working on a rota vaccine for 8 years. The Institute had decided to develop a heat-stable vaccine to overcome the absence of cold chains in many poor countries, he said. GlaxoSmithKline’s Rotarix and Merck’s RotaTeq are, like the indigenous Rotavac, sensitive to high temperatures. What did the Phase III clinical trials of the vaccine show? The trial, funded by Médecins sans Frontières Operational Centre and Kavli Foundation, included 3,508 infants (1,780 in the vaccine group and 1,728 in the placebo group), and was conducted from August 2014 to November 2015. At 28 days after the third dose of vaccine or placebo, severe rotavirus gastroenteritis had been reported in 31 infants in the vaccine group and 87 in the placebo group — a vaccine efficacy of 66.7%. In a previous trial in Ghana, Kenya, and Mali, the efficacy of the RotaTeq vaccine was found to be 39.4, and in a similar trial in South Africa and Malawi, the efficacy of Rotarix was found to be 61.2%. In this trial, against a higher background incidence of severe disease than in the countries in the other two trials, there were 4.30 fewer cases of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis per 100 infant-years among infants who received BRV-PV, than among those who received the placebo. The entire trial was conducted by storing the vaccine at 25 degrees Celsius, and not in a refrigerated condition. The vaccine efficacy results under such overall conditions are unique, said Dr Rajeev Dhere, Executive Director at Serum Institute of India. What challenges does the global immunisation programme face? According to the World Health Organisation, vaccines prevent an estimated 2 million to 3 million deaths every year, but an additional 1.5 million deaths could be prevented if the global immunisation cover improved. In 2015, an estimated 19.4 million infants worldwide did not receive routine immunisation. A special supplement to Vaccine, a peer reviewed medical journal, noted with concern that outdated vaccine supply and distribution systems were delaying and limiting the impact that vaccines have in safeguarding people’s health. According to one study in the Vaccine collection, every year, 1 in 3 countries worldwide experiences a stockout of at least 1 vaccine for a minimum of 1 month, and the problem is most pronounced in sub-Saharan Africa. Many vaccines can lose potency if exposed for too long to temperatures outside the recommended range of 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius. The vaccine ‘cold chain’ strives to maintain proper temperatures for vaccines from manufacturing facilities to storage facilities, health centres, and immunisation clinics. Each year, rotavirus gastroenteritis is responsible for about 37% of deaths from diarrhoea among children younger than 5 years of age worldwide, with sub-Saharan Africa bearing a disproportionate burden. The BRV-PV vaccine has the potential to reduce this burden. When will the vaccine be sold in India, and at what cost? The vaccine is already licensed in India, and is under the WHO pre-qualification process. Once approved, low-income countries will be able to procure the vaccine at an affordable price and make it available to their populations. Serum Institute plans to produce around 60 million doses to begin with, and hopes to roll out the vaccine in August- September this year. The cost is likely to be under $ 2 — between Rs 100 and Rs 120 — per dose.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday granted approval to Roche’s MS therapy Ocrevus after a three month delay due to manufacturing issues. Ocrevus was given the greenlight to treat relapse-remitting MS (RRMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS), which is the rarer form of the neurological disease. The agency made the decision after reviewing data from three phase 3 studies showing that Ocrevus was able to significantly slow disability progression and reduce disease activity in the brain better than placebo for PPMS patients while it also was able to suppress disease activity in the brain and reduce relapse rates by nearly half in patients with RRMS better than a rival product from Merck called Rebif. “The FDA’s approval of OCREVUS is the beginning of a new era for the MS community and represents a significant scientific advance with this first-in-class B-cell targeted therapy”, said Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development Sandra Horning, MD, in a statement. “Until now, no FDA-approved treatment has been available to the primary progressive MS community, and some people with relapsing forms of MS continue to experience disease activity and disability progression despite available therapies. We believe OCREVUS, given every six months, has the potential to change the disease course for people with MS, and we are committed to helping those who can benefit gain access to our medicine,” continued Horning. Ocrevus has the potential to be a formidable blockbuster drug because it is the first U.S. approved medicine for treating PPMS. It could generate $3.2 billion in sales for Roche becoming the primary force responsible for the company’s growth over the next few years, according to a report from business intelligence provider GBI Research. The drug will have an annual list price of $65,000, reported FiercePharma.

ROS LBoard 1 Settlers fail again in civil suit against Felda V Anbalagan Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US New male contraceptive faces hurdle from big drug makers Bloomberg | March 30, 2017 The challenge for biomedical engineer who invented product is to sell it since male contraception is an area Big Pharma has shown little interest in. MUMBAI: Doctors are on the cusp of launching the first new male contraceptive in more than a century. But rather than a Big Pharma lab, the breakthrough is emerging from a university startup in the heart of rural India. Years of human trials on the injectable, sperm-zapping product are coming to an end, and researchers are preparing to submit it for regulatory approval. Results so far show it’s safe, effective and easy to use — but gaining little traction with drug makers, which is frustrating its inventor, who says his technique could play a crucial role in condom-averse populations. A new birth control method for men has the potential to win as much as half the US$10 billion (RM44.2 billion) market for female contraceptives worldwide and cut into the US$3.2 billion of annual condom sales, businesses dominated by pharmaceutical giants Bayer AG, Pfizer Inc and Merck & Co, according to estimates from the last major drug company to explore the area. India’s reversible procedure could cost as little as US$10 in poor countries, and may provide males with years-long fertility control, overcoming compliance problems and avoiding ongoing costs associated with condoms and the female birth-control pill, which is usually taken daily. It could also ease the burden on the 225 million women in developing countries, who the World Health Organisation says have an unmet need for contraception. Yet, so far only a United States non-profit organisation has taken up development of the technology abroad. For Sujoy Guha, the 76-year-old biomedical engineer who invented the product, the challenge is to now find a company who wants to sell it — even though male contraception is an area Big Pharma has so far shown little interest in. “The fact that the big companies are run by white, middle-aged males who have the same feeling —that they would never do it — plays a major role,” said Herjan Coelingh Bennink, a gynaecology professor who helped develop the contraceptives Implanon and Cerazette as head of research and development in women’s health for Organon International from 1987 to 2000. “If those companies were run by women, it would be totally different.” Sujoy’s technique for impairing male fertility relies on a polymer gel that’s injected into the sperm-carrying tubes in the scrotum. The gel, which has the consistency of melted chocolate, carries a positive charge that acts as a buffer on negatively charged sperm, damaging their heads and tails, and rendering them infertile. The treatment, known as reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance, or RISUG, is reversed with a second shot that breaks down the gel, allowing sperm to reach the penis normally. The expected launch of RISUG over the next two years will contribute to the Indian contraceptive market’s 17% growth through 2021, according to a report last year from Pharmaion Consultants, based near New Delhi. The procedure is 98% effective at preventing pregnancy — about the same as condoms if they are used every time — and has no major side effects, according to RS Sharma, head of reproductive biology and maternal health at the Indian Council of Medical Research. About 540 men have received it in India, where it continues to prevent pregnancies in their partners 13 years after treatment, he said. A submission to regulators this year will seek approval for RISUG as a permanent method of birth control. That will be appended with clinical data supporting reversibility, Sharma said. India has more married women with an unmet need for family planning than any other country, and social stigma and a lack of privacy in stores has kept condom use to less than 6%. Globally, men tend to take a back seat in matters of contraception. Almost 60% of women in spousal relationships used the contraceptive pill or some other form of modern contraception worldwide in 2015, according to a United Nations report. In contrast, 8% relied on their male partner using a condom. A new option for male birth control could garner as much as half the female contraceptives market, according to research by Organon in the 1990s, when the Dutch drugmaker partnered with Germany’s Schering AG on the last major effort to develop a male birth control pill. Demand would come from couples in long-term relationships looking to share family-planning responsibilities and single men looking for an alternative to condoms to prevent an unintended pregnancy from casual sex, Coelingh Bennink said. Still, there were questions at Organon about whether it would be worthwhile financially to develop a new entrant in the low-margin contraceptives market, and the project was eventually shelved, he said. Efforts on a hormone-based male contraceptive continued in 2008 in a study co-funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and UN agencies that was published in October. While the injected regimen’s efficacy was “relatively good” compared to other methods, the study was terminated early after a safety review. The authors noted a “relatively high” frequency of mild to moderate mood disorders, sparking a media uproar over perceived double standards in the development of contraceptives because the side effects seemed similar to those women experience on the pill. Bayer, which bought Schering in 2006, stopped all research and development activities around male fertility control about a decade ago, said Astrid Kranz, a company spokeswoman. Although an earlier clinical trial involving the administration of hormones via injection and an implant was “efficient, with a tolerable side effect profile,” Kranz said, the Leverkusen, Germany-based drugmaker wasn’t convinced this “inconvenient” regimen would find sufficient market acceptance. Male contraception isn’t an area of active research for Pfizer and Merck either, representatives said. Both companies sell products for female fertility control. Side-effects aside, it would take about US$100 million and 10 years to bring a hormone-based male birth control pill to market — a low-priority undertaking for pharmaceutical executives, Coelingh Bennink said. “If those companies were run by women, it would be totally different.” That’s now the dilemma Indian inventor Sujoy faces. “In doing anything abroad, quite substantial money is required, and that can only come from the pharmaceutical industry,” Sujoy said, surrounded by dusty stacks of paper, books and prototype inventions that bury every surface in his office at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, about 130km west of Kolkata. In the face of disinterest from the pharmaceutical industry, Sujoy licensed the technology to the Parsemus Foundation, an US-based non-profit, to help establish a market for it outside India, he said. Parsemus is working on its own version, called Vasalgel, that it plans to manufacture and distribute at near cost — or potentially US$10 to US$20 per person in low- and middle-income countries —and US$400 to US$600 per person in wealthier markets, Elaine Lissner, the foundation’s founder said in an email. Sujoy, meantime, has registered a startup in India called IcubedG Ideas Pvt Ltd through which he is pushing ahead with introducing the technology in his home country. He said patents on his invention have long since expired and he won’t see any personal financial gain even if it takes off worldwide. “Why should the burden be borne by the female only?” he said in his office. “There has to be an equal partnership.” Durex turns to jeans to counter condom taboo Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

COTTAGE, New York, March 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Burdening occurrence of dengue fever across the Asia-Pacific region has prompted the demand for effective vaccines and medications to supress this viral malaise. While several pharmaceutical companies are striving to develop a cure for dengue, the fever's incidence rate in Asia-Pacific is rising at an alarming rate. A recent report published by Future Market Insights predicts that in 2017, an estimated 70.3% of global dengue vaccines market will be dominated by Asia-Pacific. Through 2027, the region will continue to be the largest market for dengue vaccines, procuring a majority revenue share and projecting revenue growth at a 17.4% CAGR.      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161020/430874LOGO ) Future Market Insights also observes Latin America as the second-largest market for dengue vaccines, and is expected to rake in US$ 288.7 Mn towards the end of 2027. The report, titled "Dengue Vaccines Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment, 2017-2027," expects that more and more pharmaceutical giants from across the globe will be partaking in the market's growth in the years to come.

Request a sample copy of Dyslipidemia Drugs Market Research Report @ marketsizeforecasters.com/get-sample/18310 Commenting on the report, an analyst team said: One trend in market is increasing use of statins. Statins dominate the global dyslipidemia drugs market. Statins are reported to be the most effective among all dyslipidemia drugs in lowering the risk of heart attacks. The ATP IV guidelines, which are based on data from randomized controlled trials, strongly recommend the use of statins to manage atherosclerotic CVD. The ATP IV guidelines have identified four treatment groups for statins and have recommended treatment based on intensity groups. For instance, it recommends the use of high-intensity statins in individuals with established atherosclerotic CVD. The other two intensity groups include moderate-intensity statin therapy and low-intensity statin therapy. Furthermore, the ATP IV panel found no evidence in support of using non-statin cholesterol-lowering drugs in individuals with statin intolerance or as a component of combination therapy. Moreover, the current ATP guidelines might not support the use of non-statin therapy in statin-tolerant patients. The listed pricing for this Dyslipidemia Drugs Market report starts at $ 3500. Request Discount for Dyslipidemia Drugs Market Research Report @ marketsizeforecasters.com/enquire-for-discount/18310 According to the report, one driver in market is increasing risk of CVDs. Elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood lead to the deposition of cholesterol in the arterial walls, which results in atherosclerosis, hardening and narrowing the arteries. The resultant narrowing of blood vessels decreases the blood flow to the heart muscles, causing a heart attack. High cholesterol levels account for nearly one-third of all ischemic heart diseases and hence, remain a significant cause of ischemic heart diseases and strokes in developed and developing countries such as India and China. Data estimates suggest that among men aged 40 years and over, a 10% decrease in serum cholesterol levels reduces the risk of heart disease by 50% within five years. Hence, cardiovascular risk management guidelines by authorities such as the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association consider reducing blood cholesterol an important factor in reducing cardiovascular risk. As cholesterol disorder is one of the major causes for CVDs, patients try to strictly adhere to cholesterol maintaining drugs to avoid the occurrence of CVD. This preventive approach toward the occurrence of CVDs will further boost the sales of cholesterol controlling agents. Further, the report states that one challenge in market is drawbacks associated with current therapies. Statins are prescribed drugs for lowering LDL-C levels and constitute the first line of therapy for hypercholesterolemia. However, long-term administration and the muscle-related side effects of statins lead to poor patient compliance. Doubling the dose of statins might increase drug toxicity with a negligible increase in LDL-lowering effects. Furthermore, in February 2012, the FDA announced that statins could be associated with side effects such as cognitive effects and hyperglycemia. Bile acid sequestrates lead to side effects related to the gastrointestinal tract. Niacin-based formulations are generally associated with flushing and hepatotoxicity. Fibrates are associated with an increased risk of cholesterol gallstones and side effects related to the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, there is a high demand for lipid-lowering drugs with a good safety profile. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

But rather than a Big Pharma lab, the breakthrough is emerging from a university startup in the heart of rural India. Years of human trials on the injectable, sperm-zapping product are coming to an end, and researchers are preparing to submit it for regulatory approval. Results so far show it’s safe, effective and easy to use — but gaining little traction with drugmakers. That’s frustrating its inventor, who says his technique could play a crucial role in condom-averse populations. A new birth control method for men has the potential to win as much as half the US$10 billion (RM 44.1 billion) market for female contraceptives worldwide and cut into the US$3.2 billion of annual condom sales, businesses dominated by pharmaceutical giants Bayer AG, Pfizer Inc and Merck & Co, according to estimates from the last major drug company to explore the area. India’s reversible procedure could cost as little as US$10 in poor countries, and may provide males with years-long fertility control, overcoming compliance problems and avoiding ongoing costs associated with condoms and the female birth-control pill, which is usually taken daily. It could also ease the burden on the 225 million women in developing countries, who the World Health Organisation says have an unmet need for contraception. Yet, so far only a US non-profit has taken up development of the technology abroad. For Sujoy Guha, the 76-year-old biomedical engineer who invented the product, the challenge is to now find a company who wants to sell it — even though male contraception is an area Big Pharma has so far shown little interest in. “The fact that the big companies are run by white, middle-aged males who have the same feeling — that they would never do it — plays a major role,” said Herjan Coelingh Bennink, a gynecology professor who helped develop the contraceptives Implanon and Cerazette as head of research and development in women’s health for Organon International from 1987 to 2000. “If those companies were run by women, it would be totally different.” Guha’s technique for impairing male fertility relies on a polymer gel that’s injected into the sperm-carrying tubes in the scrotum. The gel, which has the consistency of melted chocolate, carries a positive charge that acts as a buffer on negatively charged sperm, damaging their heads and tails, and rendering them infertile. The treatment, known as reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance, or RISUG, is reversed with a second shot that breaks down the gel, allowing sperm to reach the penis normally. The expected launch of RISUG over the next two years will contribute to the Indian contraceptive market’s 17 per cent growth through 2021, according to a report last year from Pharmaion Consultants, based near New Delhi. The procedure is 98 per cent effective at preventing pregnancy — about the same as condoms if they are used every time — and has no major side effects, according to R. S. Sharma, head of reproductive biology and maternal health at the Indian Council of Medical Research. About 540 men have received it in India, where it continues to prevent pregnancies in their partners 13 years after treatment, he said. A submission to regulators this year will seek approval for RISUG as a permanent method of birth control. That will be appended with clinical data supporting reversibility, Sharma said. India has more married women with an unmet need for family planning than any other country, and social stigma and a lack of privacy in stores has kept condom use to less than 6 per cent. Globally, men tend to take a back seat in matters of contraception. Almost 60 per cent of women in spousal relationships used the contraceptive pill or some other form of modern contraception worldwide in 2015, according to a United Nations report. In contrast, 8 per cent relied on their male partner using a condom. A new option for male birth control could garner as much as half the female contraceptives market, according to research by Organon in the 1990s, when the Dutch drugmaker partnered with Germany’s Schering AG on the last major effort to develop a male birth control pill. Demand would come from couples in long-term relationships looking to share family-planning responsibilities and single men looking for an alternative to condoms to prevent an unintended pregnancy from casual sex, Coelingh Bennink said. Still, there were questions at Organon about whether it would be worthwhile financially to develop a new entrant in the low-margin contraceptives market, and the project was eventually shelved, he said. Efforts on a hormone-based male contraceptive continued in 2008 in a study co-funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and UN agencies that was published in October. While the injected regimen’s efficacy was “relatively good” compared to other methods, the study was terminated early after a safety review. The authors noted a “relatively high” frequency of mild to moderate mood disorders, sparking a media uproar over perceived double standards in the development of contraceptives because the side effects seemed similar to those women experience on the pill. Bayer, which bought Schering in 2006, stopped all research and development activities around male fertility control about a decade ago, said Astrid Kranz, a company spokeswoman. Although an earlier clinical trial involving the administration of hormones via injection and an implant was “efficient, with a tolerable side effect profile,” Kranz said, the Leverkusen, Germany-based drugmaker wasn’t convinced this “inconvenient” regimen would find sufficient market acceptance. Male contraception isn’t an area of active research for Pfizer and Merck either, representatives said. Both companies sell products for female fertility control. Side effects aside, it would take about US$100 million and 10 years to bring a hormone-based male birth control pill to market — a low-priority undertaking for pharmaceutical executives, Coelingh Bennink said. “If those companies were run by women, it would be totally different.” That’s now the dilemma Indian inventor Guha faces. “In doing anything abroad, quite substantial money is required, and that can only come from the pharmaceutical industry,” Guha said, surrounded by dusty stacks of paper, books and prototype inventions that bury every surface in his office at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, about 130 kilometres (80 miles) west of Kolkata. In the face of disinterest from the pharmaceutical industry, Guha licensed the technology to the Parsemus Foundation, a US-based non-profit, to help establish a market for it outside India, he said. Parsemus is working on its own version, called Vasalgel, that it plans to manufacture and distribute at near cost — or potentially US$10 to US$20 per person in low — and middle-income countries — and US$400 to US$600 per person in wealthier markets, Elaine Lissner, the foundation’s founder, said in an email. The foundation, based in Berkeley, California, is seeking donations to fund costly human trials starting next year after a study in 16 rhesus monkeys published last month showed Vasalgel was successful in preventing conception while the primates fraternised with females for 5 to 24 months. Guha meantime has registered a startup in India called IcubedG Ideas Pvt. Ltd through which he is pushing ahead with introducing the technology in his home country. He leased space in a New Delhi industrial zone in January after developing a method of mass production using a government grant. Three couples who participated in the clinical trials gathered in his Kharagpur office in February to attest to the need. Kinkar Ari, a 39-year-old day labourer from a nearby village, said that when he and his wife Aloka decided they didn’t want more children they had a choice between tubal ligation for her or vasectomy for him, but neither could afford the time off to recuperate from the surgery. When a public health worker told the couple about Guha’s promising alternative, Ari decided to enroll in the study. The injection took 15 minutes with some local anesthesia, and after half an hour of observation at the clinic, he said he was able to walk the 2.5 kilometres home. Two days later, he was back at work. Ari was so enthused by the procedure, he convinced two other couples to have it done, he said. Stories like that encourage Guha to persist with the project, he said, even though patents on his invention have long since expired and he won’t see any personal financial gain even if it takes off worldwide. “Why should the burden be borne by the female only?” he said in his office after the three couples had left. “There has to be an equal partnership.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week The internet wants to ‘surrender’ to this pretty Malaysian policewoman Kim Kardashian joins Rembrandt in London selfie exhibit Mysterious ‘Gollum-like’ being caught on tape in Aceh forest (VIDEO) Ghosts of Mosul stalk Iraq’s fleeing children Old Woodlands Town Centre now a shadow of its vibrant past The internet wants to ‘surrender’ to this pretty Malaysian policewoman The jihadi who turned to Jesus Shop, sup, and style up at Merchant & Sisters, KL’s first modern general store Russian man rescues pregnant dog buried alive for two days (VIDEO) How two teens in leggings became a PR mess for United Airlines Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Condom brand Durex turns to jeans for countering India sex taboo Male contraceptive vasalgel passes animal tests Study finds gel alternative to vasectomy works in monkeys For Nigerian mothers, escape from Boko Haram shakes up childbirth customs Seeking halal contraception in Kenya’s Muslim northeast Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

In the U.S., the OTC treatment market is anticipated to register a higher CAGR to address its growth in the insomnia pharmacological treatment sector. The OTC sleep aids market can be classified into valerian roots, melatonin, and antihistamines. An increasing number of patients are convinced to adopt OTC sleep aids because of the infamous side effects caused by prescription drugs and low prices and easy availability of OTC treatments. The U.S. insomnia market is predicted to gain support from the rising consumption of valerian roots and melatonin, owing to their crucial advantages such as decreased stress levels and less side effects. The Americas could be followed by Europe, the Middle East, and Africa on account of the augmenting interest in spreading health awareness through various programs and inflating geriatric population. The insomnia market in Asia Pacific is also looked upon as a decent opportunity for vendors to capitalize on with the elevating disposable income and upsurge in the occurrence of chronic diseases. Global Insomnia Market: Brief Account The world insomnia market is envisaged to recoup promisingly from its drowsy growth in the past with a number of worthwhile and well-timed opportunities to take advantage of. Insomnia drugs could find an application in the treatment of Parkinson and Alzheimer’s disease as sedatives. The younger population can increase the global demand as intensively as the geriatric group with rising stress levels and persisting diseases such as cancer at the forefront. The launch of new products such as E-2006 by Eisai Co. Ltd. and Belsomra by Merck & Co. Inc. is forecasted to stimulate the market growth handsomely. The global insomnia market could be segmented according to over-the-counter (OTC) treatment, non-pharmacological treatments, and pharmacological treatments, where each category is evaluated to contribute their part toward the global growth. The researchers who have authored this report prioritize painstaking primary and secondary research to compile statistical data and other analytics of the global insomnia market. Players in the market can gain a decisive insight into the guidelines required to extend their portfolio in the right direction and achieve a tangible success in the market.

The cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) listed under non-pharmacological treatments extends the ability of physicians to heal patients or understand their health issues in a comprehensive manner. Such treatments including hypnotherapy can be employed by doctors to take multiple approaches during the treatment of their patients. There are other treatments such as aroma music, bright light, biofeedback, acupuncture, and yoga therapies which could contribute to the growth of the non-pharmacological treatments market. Likewise, pharmacological treatments are prognosticated to lay a strong platform for the global insomnia market to find more growth prospects on the back of key segments such as OTC sleep aids and prescription sleep aids. The international insomnia market could go through a downtime period due to inferior diagnosis rate, below par patient compliance, patent erosion, and ascendancy of generic products. Howbeit, the surging incidences of insomnia and unfulfilled medical needs, for instance, the inefficiency of central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are foreseen to compensate for the probable decline in growth.

Caleb, now 14, a Northville resident and a freshman at Catholic Central High School in Novi, has for years been stopping on Detroit street corners and at shelters to ease the lives of homeless people. "If I were in that position, I would want help, too," Caleb said during an event at a Detroit shelter. "I guess I just like to help," he added. "I make a lot of friends here through volunteering. It's a big part of who I am." Related: Nation's annual homeless count reveals some surprises in Detroit Metro Detroit charities see that needs are changing He is founder of the Caleb White Project, a charitable organization with a twofold mission: to aid down-on-their-luck people and to develop leadership skills among young people that will equip them to serve their communities. "They need to eventually step up and pass it on, too," he said. 'True heart of gold' Caleb, with the support of family, friends, classmates and volunteers and donors, plus the backing of corporate heavy hitters like Quicken Loans' Dan Gilbert, offers people in need direct aid in a variety of ways. Among them: • Each year since 2008, he's gone to Detroit at Christmas time to hand out care packages, with essentials like hats, gloves, food, toiletries and, more recently, socks. • Every summer since 2014, he and other volunteers set aside a day to distribute backpacks stuffed with school supplies to Detroit children. The back-to-school event has become a miniature carnival, with food, games and activities, plus free haircuts and manicures.

Young people, the middle-aged and seniors, black and white, enjoy pizza and pop, laugh and talk and play games and work on crafts. • Caleb and volunteers in December threw a Christmas party for about 60 homeless military veterans at another DRM shelter. Sponsors that included Domino's Pizza, Novi's Oak Pointe Church and the Catholic Central wrestling team "adopted" veterans, providing each with a personalized gift package. Caleb and other volunteers had interviewed the men beforehand to find out their needs, wants — and clothing sizes. "Caleb White is dear to our hearts. He is a young man with a true heart of gold," Chad Audi, president of Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, said in an email. "Detroit needs more difference-makers like Caleb White." Empathy started early Caleb's concern started when he was 6. "He saw somebody sleeping outdoors on the way home from the circus and wanted to build him a house," said his mother, Melissa Kennedy. He also asked questions. "I didn't know what homelessness meant," Caleb said. Later that year, before Christmas, Caleb returned to Detroit with about 10 care packages, handing them out to people on the streets. "That's when all of this began," he said. "Every year after that, more people got involved." The effort's reach grew, too; Caleb's most recent gift distribution, in which he got help from CC wrestlers, totaled about 250 gifts. Caleb helps without judgment. He recognizes some are homeless because of poor decisions, others because of circumstances beyond their control and the lack of a support system. "It doesn't matter what choices you made," he said. "We're going to help you either way." He is, in part, motivated by his Catholic faith. "We're called to live like Jesus or called to walk in his footsteps," he said. The work keeps everyone — his mother, father Bryan White and other family members, Caleb White Project board members and fellow Shamrocks and other volunteers — active. "I always joke that Caleb sort of gets us into these projects before I have a chance to think about it," Melissa Kennedy said, adding the projects lead to "crazy busy" times. "It always comes together." Caleb, however, still finds time for CC sports, like track and cross-country, his schoolwork, playing the French horn and, now, driver's ed. Fostering leadership Caleb often speaks to school groups about service — pitching in to make the world a better place. The talks are part of the leadership-building mission; another part is the CWP leadership board, which is made up of young people like himself. "He is passionate about homelessness, but he really just wants young people to understand that they can make a difference and he challenges them to be leaders in something that they care about," his mother said. He is also increasingly sought after by adult audiences. Earlier this month in Miami, Caleb spoke to about 300 executives from the vaccine division of Merck & Co., the pharmaceutical firm, about service. His talk followed a Merck-sponsored event — a game night, with a traditional Cuban dinner — at a Miami shelter the previous day. "He's got a movement going," said Pete Hayek, who works in Merck's vaccine division. Hayek, volunteering at a recent Genesis House II game night, helped book Caleb for the event and for a smaller Merck gathering in Indianapolis last August. "The impression that Caleb made in Miami was long-lasting," Hayek wrote later in an email. "Merck employees left inspired by his talk and by their game-night experience. Our vaccine teams feel a great responsibility to protect our young people and Caleb reminded them why they do what they do." Caleb has won recognition for his work, including the Prudential Spirit of Community Award, the Governor's Youth Volunteer of the Year Award and, most recently, the National Catholic Educational Association's Virtues, Vision and Valor Award.

There are several research facilities and universities identifying unique proteins in oncology for developing diagnostics. Several studies are underway to discover new proteins that play a role in cancer. Currently there are a number of companies and/or their collaborators engaged in developing several protein drugs in cancer. Surgical treatments and radiation therapy, though effective at treating primary tumors, are not found to be successful in detecting metastatic tumor cells and those flowing in the bloodstream, making treatment of these cancer cells very difficult. Cancer is one of the largest causes of death worldwide and finding leads to cure or control the disease is one of the primary goals of governments globally. Global Protein in Oncology Market: Segmentation Obtain Report Details: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/proteins-oncology-mark… The global proteins in oncology market has been segmented based on protein type and geography. Protein types include recombinant non-glycosylated proteins, recombinant glycosylated proteins and recombinant peptides. Geographically, North America and Europe lead the global proteins in oncology market thanks to the very stringent regulatory environment for clearing the products. Asia-Pacific countries such as China and India are estimated to be the fastest-growing markets. South Korea and Brazil are also poised to register high growth in the coming years due to boost in biosimilars market. The services that can be provided in the global proteins in oncology market include contract research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations. Global Protein in Oncology Market: Drivers and Restraints Worldwide increase in the prevalence of cancer and the rising awareness of the therapeutic and commercial opportunities offered by new oncology treatments have provided a major incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to pursue the development of new agents for the treatment of cancer. Proteins or peptide drugs are usually required to be administered only by injection due to their large and labile nature. Peptide drugs are used effectively in monitoring various tumors and related therapies. They selectively are known to bind responsive versus unresponsive tumors. Therefore, this advantage associated with the use of peptides assists their use in assessing tumor response and evaluating its effectiveness in cancer therapy. The main challenge for the newer generation of recombinant drugs seems to be the new route of administration, new formulations and consequently even higher efficiency and safety. Though the parenteral route of administration is the most common, there are advances being made to deliver medicines through the oral route, which is considered to be the most preferred one due to better patient compliance. Recently new research has demonstrated that attaching a cancer killer protein to white blood cells annihilates metastasis. Isolation of a protein named as TRAIL by researchers at Cornell University in the U.S. demonstrated killing of cancer cells on contact. The TRAIL protein is binded with leukocytes (white blood cells) that are present across the bloodstream. The cancer cell is essentially known to kill itself when it comes in contact with TRAIL protein. The mechanism has been surprising and unexpectedly effective as compared to targeting the cancer cells with liposomes. Fill the form for an exclusive sample of this report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Global Protein in Oncology Market: Competitive Landscape Analysis The key players contributing to the global proteins in oncology market include Actavis, Inc., Biocon Ltd., Celltrion, Inc., Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd., Emcure Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Hospira, Inc., Merck, Mylan, Inc., Roche Holding Ltd., Sandoz, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Wockhardt Ltd.

Picture: David Silverman/Getty Images PERRY GOURLEY 11:16 Thursday 30 March 2017 0 Have your say Another day, and another significant announcement from a Scottish life sciences firm. Positive newsflow from Omega Diagnostics and Collagen Solutions yesterday – along with the launch by a Singaporean firm of a new laboratory in Glasgow – made it a particularly busy day for the sector after a raft of other developments involving businesses including Arrayjet and Elasmogen. This is an exciting time for life sciences businesses in Scotland Dave Tudor • READ MORE: Life sciences firm Arrayjet inks ‘major’ US boost The University of Glasgow this week also officially opened its new £32 million Imaging Centre of Excellence, which aims to act as a hub for translating science into economic and patient benefit. That project will bring almost 400 new high-value jobs to the city over a seven year period along with a £88m boost to the local economy. The latest flurry of developments in the Scottish life sciences sector come hot on the heels of the launch last month of an ambitious target for it to nearly double its turnover to £8bn by 2025. • READ MORE: £8bn goal for a life sciences sector in rude health It has already grown by 29 per cent between 2010 and 2014 to more than £4.2bn, with the gross value it adds to the economy rising by 24 per cent to around £2bn. Employee numbers have increased by 13 per cent across the sector’s 700 organisations. As Dave Tudor, co-chair of the Life Sciences Scotland Industry Leadership Group and vice president of primary supply chain at GlaxoSmithKline, said at the strategy’s launch: “This is an exciting time for life sciences businesses in Scotland”. Yesterday’s announcements also served to emphasis the global nature of Scotland’s position in the industry. Glasgow-based biomaterials business Collagen Solutions, which develops and manufactures medical grade collagen, has been granted a patent in Australia for use of its product in heart valve replacement medical devices and other applications. Patent coverage has also been established in New Zealand and USA. Chief executive Jamal Rushdy said the latest patent “will be of significant interest to our existing customer base and value adding to our own medical device development programme”. 200 Voices: find out more about the people who have shaped Scotland In an update from medical diagnostics company Omega, which focuses on allergy, food intolerance and infectious disease, it said that the malaria tests manufactured at its Indian facility had achieved a key certification milestone which means they are available for general sale through business to business channels. Andrew Shepherd, chief executive of the Alva-based company, said the achievement “demonstrates our continuing investment in people and infrastructure is beginning to bear fruit. “Whilst we expect relatively modest sales during the next financial year to 31 March 2018, we anticipate generating significant demand from the subsequent financial year onwards with high quality products at affordable prices which are both crucial for commercial success,” he added. The launch of the Clinnovate Health laboratory yesterday also marked the first ever investment by a Singaporean firm in the Scottish life sciences sector. Clinnovate provides services for the clinical research market in areas of fibrosis and cancer. Linda Hanna, managing director of strategy and sectors at Scottish Enterprise, said the investment underlined the fact that Scotland’s world-class expertise in life sciences is becoming “increasingly acknowledged on the global stage”. “Scotland and Singapore are both regarded as world leading centres for biomedical research and it is great to see growing interest in collaboration between our two countries.” The latest announcements have got the 2025 strategy off to a strong start, although the triggering of the Brexit process yesterday also drew focus to one of the key concerns of industry leaders. There are fears Scotland could be put at a disadvantage against global competitors if Brexit reduces its access to theEuropean staff which currently make up a sizeable proportion of researchers in the sector. At the Beatson Institute cancer centre in Glasgow for example around half of the researchers are EU nationals from outside the UK. The chief executive of Merck Life Sciences, Udit Batra, warned on a visit to its Scottish facilities that Brexit could mean that companies in the sector will face difficulties recruiting staff. Given the sector already employs over 37,000 people, the risks to the Scottish economy of skills shortages in the wake of Brexit could be significant and an issue which will be at the forefront of politician’s minds ahead of detailed Brexit talks. As Scottish business minister Paul Wheelhouse, said at the launch of the strategy: “EU nationals living in Scotland and working in the life sciences sector greatly enrich our culture, strengthen our society and boost our economy. “That is why we are exploring all possible avenues for Scotland to retain the benefits of EU membership,” he stressed.
