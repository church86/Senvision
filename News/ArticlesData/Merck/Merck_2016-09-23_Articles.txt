New ALK inhibitor Zykadia (ceritinib) was given accelerated approval in the US in 2014 as a treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC patients whose disease had progressed despite prior therapy with Pfizer/Merck KGaA's ALK blocker Xalkori (crizotinib), with EU conditional approval coming through last year. Patients taking Xalkori invariably relapse, often within 12 months of starting treatment with the drug, due to the development of resistance in tumour cells. In the phase III trial, Zykadia extended progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with standard chemotherapy - including maintenance - and also increased the overall response rate as well as the duration of response, according to Novartis. The company says it intends to present the data in full at a future medical congress. "Zykadia has proven to be an important treatment option for ALK+ NSCLC patients who have progressed following treatment with crizotinib," said Novartis head of oncology development and medical affairs, Alessandro Riva. "We are pleased to see these topline results show promise in untreated patients with advanced disease, and look forward to sharing these data with regulatory authorities in the coming months." Zykadia has been growing slowly for Novartis with sales of $48m in the first half of the year. A shift into first-line use would increase the number of patients eligible to receive the drug and allow Novartis to compete head-to-head in the market with Pfizer and co-promotion partner Merck. Analysts believe Zykadia will still face a tough challenge in the market however as it goes in pursuit of Xalkori, which brought in $275m for Pfizer in the first six months of 2016. The reason is that a third ALK inhibitor - Roche's recently-launched second-generation rival Alecensa (alectinib) - seems to be gaining considerable traction in the market. Alecensa sales reached $74m in the first half of the year, suggesting it is making faster headway in the market than Novartis' drug - despite launching several months later - although it does come with a higher price tag. Roche's drug looks set to consolidate its position following the release of data from the Japanese arm of the head-to-head ALEX trial at this year's American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) congress, which found a significant PFS improvement for Alecensa over Xalkori. Full data from the entire cohort is due for publication next year, but the Japanese arm is already leading to speculation that Alecensa has a best-in-class profile that could see it mount a strong challenge to Xalkori. There is still a lot of data to come that could alter the picture however. Clinicians are already discussing among themselves the best order in which to use the drugs - or even use in combination - in order to minimise resistance and extend PFS. Meanwhile, the ALK inhibitors are all being tested in combination with other drugs - including new immuno-oncology agents - and the outcome of those studies could change the picture dramatically.

Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 23, 2016 at 8:35 AM, updated September 23, 2016 at 10:08 AM comments Donald Trump accepts Republican nomination WASHINGTON — Merck & Co. and Lockheed Martin, who each gave $250,000 to the host committee helping to stage the Republican National Convention four years ago, kept their corporate checkbooks closed this time around when the party gathered in Cleveland to nominate Donald Trump. The companies were absent from the list of contributors that gave $67.4 million to the Cleveland host committee, according to Federal Election Commission filings.  David Koch, executive vice president of Koch Industries Inc. of Wichita, who with his brother Charles has spent millions on behalf of Republican candidates and causes, didn't help finance the 2016 convention either after contributing $1 million in 2012.  Also absent from the convention were former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush; the last two Republican nominees, Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney; and the host governor, Republican John Kasich of Ohio. How Cleveland convention was different Merck, based in Kenilworth, also contributed $450,000 in 2008. Lockheed, which has a major defense facility in Moorestown, gave $150,000 to the 2008 convention host committee. "We have been and will continue to work closely with people on both sides of the aisle to ensure that important policy issues are raised to make health care sustainable over the long term, and we look forward to working with the new administration and the new Congress next year," Merck spokeswoman Lainie Keller said. Lockheed spokesman Bill Phelps declined comment. Even with some corporate defectors, the Cleveland host committee raised more money than four years ago, when $55.9 million was raised to help stage the Tampa convention. Many other donors stayed the course, including AT&T, which gave $4.3 million; Bank of America, $1 million; and Cisco Systems, $2 million. The National Basketball Association champion Cleveland Cavaliers contributed $1 million. Some of the money was given as goods and services rather than in cash. Casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million to the Tampa committee, made a $1.5 million contribution this time around. Adelson and his wife spent $90 million on behalf of Republicans in 2012, more than anyone, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group. They have not been as generous with their political donations this election season so far. Koch Industries and David Koch, who gave $3.5 million between them, and Adelson, who also contributed $3.5 million, were the biggest contributors to the Republican Governors Association when Gov. Chris Christie served as chairman. Jonathan D. Salant may be reached at jsalant@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @JDSalant. Find NJ.com Politics on Facebook.   Most Read N.J.

Dr Andrew Brooks from the UQ Diamantina Institute was one of three recipients in the Merck Grant for Growth Innovation program for 2016. Dr Brooks said his research sought to develop new treatments for patients with growth disorders and for those who do not respond to appropriate existing drugs. “This $196,000 grant will allow us to build on many years of work to better understand how growth hormone receptors receive signals and transmit them into cells to control how those cells behave,” he said. “Our research in this area has revealed the molecular mechanism of growth hormone signalling and uncovered a new target for therapeutic intervention. “We will use this new information to develop drugs that bypass molecular defects that cause certain types of growth disorders including acromegaly and some growth hormone insensitivity disorders.” Dr Steven Hildemann from Merck’s Biopharma business said it was inspiring to see the high quality and aspiration of the researchers who were awarded grants. “We recognise that despite advances in treatment and management of growth disorders, we still require a better understanding of these diseases to address the high unmet medical need,” Dr Hildemann said. “Identifying and supporting forward thinking researchers in this field of growth follows Merck's scientific strategy of providing a platform that makes innovation possible.” There were 38 applications from 20 countries for this year’s grants, with successful projects chosen by an independent committee of internationally renowned endocrinologists and researchers. The GGI recipients were named during the 55th European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology Meeting in Paris.

Zig-zagging lines come into view, everyday light becomes searingly bright, and vision starts to slip. These are signals that a debilitating migraine is on its way. “It’s like you’re possessed,” said Lorie Novak, who has suffered from chronic migraines since childhood. “I almost feel separate from my body, like it’s just this painful shell around me that’s not me.” Novak, now in her 60s, is one of the roughly 35 million Americans who suffer from migraines. There are few effective treatments, and no new drugs have been developed since the early 1990s. But that could soon change. A handful of drug companies are pressing ahead with novel injectable therapies for migraines, chasing a blockbuster market that Wall Street analysts say could reach $8 billion a year in worldwide sales. The new drugs target a bodily protein called CGRP, which plays a role in the dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Scientists haven’t nailed down just how the protein affects migraines, but they’re sure about two things: CGRP levels rocket up when headaches attack and normalize when they go away. And thus four drug makers — Amgen, Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Alder Biopharmaceuticals — have fashioned antibodies that can bind to CGRP molecules and block their activity. The goal: to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping CGRP in its tracks. So far, it seems to be working. In mid-stage clinical trials, each of the four treatments has eased symptoms for about half of study participants, cutting the number of days they’re afflicted by migraines roughly in half. It’s by no means a cure for migraines, but it should be enough to merit Food and Drug Administration approvals if the companies can replicate those results in larger trials, according to Eric Schmidt, a securities analyst at Cowen and Co. Each treatment is now in late-stage development, targeting the roughly 38 percent of migraine sufferers who, like Novak, have at least four headache days per month. The first therapy could hit the market in 2018, and, if everything works out, all four could available by the end of the decade. So far, the four drugs have performed similarly in clinical trials, and analysts expect the contenders will have to compete on price to grab market share. “There will certainly be hypercompetition,” said William Ratner, Lilly’s senior director of global headache marketing. But the companies’ fortunes are intertwined, he said, and “the class only wins if headache care in America improves.” Aiming to prevent migraines before they start There’s plenty of room for improvement. Existing therapies are plagued by inconsistent efficacy and troublesome side effects, and patients are often left to rely on a repurposed treatment for epilepsy. That medication, Topamax, has been dubbed dubbed “Sleepomax” by doctors and patients because it’s also a heavy sedative. “I’m very enthusiastic, as I think everyone in the field is, about having another treatment option for people with migraines,” said Dr. Elizabeth Loder, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the headache division in the department of neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Targeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea. Researchers picked up on the protein’s scent more than 30 years ago, and drug companies spent years trying to craft pills that might block its activity. Merck got all the way into late-stage trials with an anti-CGRP tablet, spending more than $1 billion only to find in 2011 that the drug had toxic effects on the liver and thus no future. With the “exquisite sensitivity” of an antibody, however, scientists believe they can block CGRP without triggering dangerous side effects, Alder CEO Randy Schatzman said. Because antibodies stay active in the body for weeks, the drug companies see their new products as preventative therapies, injected monthly or quarterly to keep headaches at bay. (Merck’s failed pill, by contrast, was meant as an on-the-spot treatment after the pain started.) “So in some senses, it’s a paradigm shift,” Schatzman said. But there are still hurdles to clear. Only about half of patients seem to respond to CGRP antibodies, and the companies have no way of predicting who they are ahead of time. A genetic test would be “the Holy Grail of personalized medicine,” said Rob Lenz, Amgen’s global development lead for neuroscience, but no one has made one yet. And long-term safety remains a major question mark. To date, none of the companies has reported serious side effects in clinical trials, but they’ve only reported data from 12-week studies on about 1,500 total patients. It will take years to determine just what the new therapies do to the body over time, Loder said. ‘I felt like my life was being stolen from me’ Any advance, even an incremental one, would be a major leap for the field, said Emily Bates, who studies the genetic causes of headaches at the University of Colorado and is not affiliated with any of the companies working on migraine treatment. Bates struggled with chronic migraines in high school and college. Like many patients, she didn’t respond to any of the preventative therapies available. “The pain is more than anything I’ve ever experienced, and I’ve run on broken legs before,” she said. “I felt like my life was being stolen from me.” Collectively, Americans miss about 113 million workdays each year because of migraine. That lost productivity costs society about $13 billion each year, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. Yet scientific progress has been slow, in part because migraine was long considered a psychosomatic condition not worthy of serious research funding, Bates said. It’s a “subjective symptom that predominantly affects women,” said Loder, the Harvard neurologist. “That’s a perfect combination of things that make people feel able to dismiss it.” Novak, a professor of photography at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, spent years trying to hide her migraines because of the stigma attached to the condition. But she decided to change all that in 2009 with a project called Migraine Register. She posts a photo of herself each day she has a migraine. Some years, that’s more than 120 pictures. The idea, in part, was to humanize chronic migraines. But the project also forced Novak to reckon with the toll of the disease, something she had tried to ignore for years. “That for me was like a concrete proof of how it really does affect my life,” Novak said, “of how much time I lose.” This article is reproduced with permission from STAT.

Consumer Confidential With David Lazarus BUSINESS Consumer Confidential Column Recipe for ripoffs: Pricing drugs by their 'value' to sick people The healthcare industry by the numbers How the increasing price of medicine is affecting the healthcare industry How the increasing price of medicine is affecting the healthcare industry David Lazarus Heather Bresch, chief executive of pharmaceutical heavyweight Mylan, testified before lawmakers Wednesday that her company acted ethically and fairly when it jacked up the price of life-saving EpiPens by more than 500%. While saying she was troubled “that the EpiPen product has become a source of controversy,” Bresch told skeptical members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that “price and access exist in a balance, and we believe we have struck that balance.” That’s a bold stance considering that each $300 EpiPen contains about a dollar’s worth of epinephrine and Mylan didn’t even invent the plastic injector that delivers the drug. It purchased rights to manufacture and sell EpiPens in 2007 as part of a $6.6-billion acquisition of Merck’s generic-drug operations. At the time of the merger, people were able to buy EpiPens for about $50 each. Mylan now sells EpiPens in packs of two for more than $600. Sick: The biggest increase in healthcare costs in 32 years David Lazarus Healthcare is very much in the news, but for all the wrong reasons. On the one hand, we had Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump visiting the “Dr. Oz” show last week to reveal some tidbits about his physical condition (he’s fat). On the other, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had a bout... Healthcare is very much in the news, but for all the wrong reasons. On the one hand, we had Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump visiting the “Dr. Oz” show last week to reveal some tidbits about his physical condition (he’s fat). On the other, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had a bout... (David Lazarus) It’s easy to assume that greed is solely to blame for runaway drug prices — and companies like Mylan do nothing to challenge that perception. The reality, however, is more complicated. When Bresch talked about drug prices and access existing “in a balance,” she was referring to what the pharmaceutical industry calls value-based pricing. This is what you get when you price a drug not just commensurate with its research and development, production and marketing, but also reflecting the drug’s importance to patients. And that’s a very slippery concept. What a pharmaceutical company is basically saying with value-based pricing is that a patient’s life would be a whole lot worse without their drug, so that should be worth something, right? Maybe a big something. “There are a lot of moral and ethical issues that come up when you talk about value-based pricing of drugs,” said Robert L. Stein, a professor of pharmacy law and ethics at Claremont’s Keck Graduate Institute. “Most other consumer products are discretionary or there are alternative sources,” he said. “When you talk about pharmaceuticals, especially newer pharmaceuticals, there aren’t a lot of options.” SIGN UP for the free California Inc. business newsletter » The poster child in this regard is Gilead’s hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which carried a list price of about $1,000 a pill when it was introduced in 2014. A second-generation version of the drug, Harvoni, cost more than $1,100 a pill. The latest version, Epclusa, sells for closer to $900 a pill. These are astonishing numbers. But Gilead’s drugs effectively cure patients of hepatitis C, so who’s to say they’re not worth every penny? More than 3 million Americans are estimated to have hepatitis C. “We believe the price of Harvoni reflects the value of the medicine,” Gilead said in a 2014 statement defending its pricing. “Unlike long-term or indefinite treatments for other chronic diseases, Harvoni offers a cure at a price that will significantly reduce hepatitis C treatment costs now and deliver significant health care savings to the health care system over the long term.” That’s one way of looking at it. Another is that Gilead justifies its crazy-high prices by arguing that because it would be more expensive to treat hepatitis on an ongoing basis, they can charge whatever they please as long as it’s less than that amount. This is a problem. “Value is one thing, but another consideration is whether society can afford that value,” said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University. “If you charge more than people can afford, people die.” If you charge more than people can afford, people die. — Gerard Anderson, professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University He compared lifesaving prescription meds to water. “If a water company charged the value of water, they could charge whatever they like, an infinite amount,” Anderson said. “We couldn’t exist without water. That’s why we don’t allow the water company to charge the value of water.” It’s a tricky business. There’s almost no limit to the value of a drug to someone who’s sick. So with value-based pricing, the door is wide open to abusing patients. At the same time, we’re all better off if drug companies are financially motivated to do the costly research and development necessary to innovate and come up with new cures and treatments. Stein at the Keck Graduate Institute said the only way to deal with the problem might be to approach every drug on a case-by-case basis, rather than imposing price caps across the entire industry. “When is a drug price unconscionable?” he said. “It’s like Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart said about pornography: You know it when you see it.” Jason Doctor, director of health informatics at USC’s Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, said Mylan’s Bresch crossed that line when she raised the price of EpiPens more than a dozen times since 2008. Allergan CEO is shocked (shocked!) by insane drug prices » “She operated from an oversimplified model that did not account for the value people place on protecting children from harm,” he said. “This is a treasured societal norm.  When the price she set for EpiPens violated that norm, people got angry, even though the price was legal.” Bresch made nearly $19 million last year. She told lawmakers that this was “in the middle” of what drug-industry CEOs make. On the other hand, most other top-tier pharmaceutical CEOs haven’t been subjected to sitting before lawmakers as their company is pilloried for being "sickening," "disgusting" and showing "blatant disrespect" for the needs of families. Bresch seems decidedly overvalued.

Opinion The best news you don’t know Originally published September 24, 2016 at 3:01 pm Updated September 23, 2016 at 5:49 pm When parents are assured that their children will survive, they choose to have fewer of them. As girls are educated and contraception becomes available, birthrates tumble — just as they did in the West. Share story By Nicholas Kristof Syndicated columnist The world is a mess, with billions of people locked in inescapable cycles of war, famine and poverty, with more children than ever perishing from hunger, disease and violence. That’s about the only thing Americans agree on; we’re polarized about all else. But several polls have found that about 9 out of 10 Americans believe that global poverty has worsened or stayed the same over the last 20 years. Fortunately, the one point Americans agree on is dead wrong. As world leaders gather for the U.N. General Assembly this week, all the evidence suggests that we are at an inflection point for the ages. The number of people living in extreme poverty ($1.90 per person per day) has tumbled by half in two decades, and the number of small children dying has dropped by a similar proportion — 6 million lives a year saved by vaccines, breast-feeding promotion, pneumonia medicine and diarrhea treatments!

Historians may conclude that the most important thing going on in the world in the early 21st century was a stunning decline in suffering. OK, you’re thinking that I’ve finally cracked up after spending too much time in desperate places. So a few data points: • As recently as 1981, when I was finishing college, 44 percent of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. Now the share is believed to be less than 10 percent and falling. “This is the best story in the world today,” says Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank. • For the entire history of the human species until the 1960s, a majority of adults were illiterate. Now 85 percent of adults worldwide are literate and the share is rising. • Although inequality has risen in America, the global trend is more encouraging: Internationally, inequality is on the decline because of gains by the poor in places like China and India. The U.N. aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, and experts believe it is possible to get quite close. In short, on our watch, we have a decent chance of virtually wiping out ills that have plagued humanity for thousands of generations, from illiteracy to the most devastating kind of hand-to-mouth poverty. Yet the public thinks the opposite, that poverty is getting worse. A poll released Thursday by Motivaction, a Dutch firm, finds that only 1 percent of Americans surveyed realized that global extreme poverty had fallen by half over 20 years. I wonder if those of us in journalism and the humanitarian worlds don’t err by focusing so much on human misery that we leave the public with the misperception that everything is always getting worse. I’ve covered massacres in South Sudan, concentration camps in Myanmar and widespread stunting in India, but it’s also important to acknowledge the backdrop of global progress. Otherwise, the public may perceive poverty as hopeless and see no point in carrying on the fight — at just the point when we’re making the most rapid gains ever recorded. When I first made the acquaintance of the developing world, as a backpacking law student in the 1980s — sometimes riding on tops of trains or buses and writing articles to pay my expenses — the most gut-wrenching aspect of poverty I encountered was ubiquitous blind beggars, robbed of dignity and any chance to be productive. This is much less common today, partly because humanitarian aid — despite real shortcomings — has made a profound difference in health. The heroic work of former President Jimmy Carter and pharmaceutical donations from Merck have made river blindness less common. Vitamin A capsules costing 2 cents a dose have reduced blindness as well. Antibiotics have helped curb blinding trachoma. And a simple $25 surgery developed by a Nepali ophthalmologist, Dr. Sanduk Ruit, lets people suffering from cataracts see again. The scenes of blind beggars on every street corner will soon be gone forever. Cynics scoff that if more children’s lives are saved, they will just grow up to have more babies and cause new famines and cycles of poverty. Not so! In fact, when parents are assured that their children will survive, they choose to have fewer of them. As girls are educated and contraception becomes available, birthrates tumble — just as they did in the West. Indian women now average just 2.4 births, Indonesian women 2.5, and Mexican women just 2.2. So in a moment we can return to urgent needs worldwide, from war to climate change to refugees. But first, let’s pause for a nanosecond of silence to acknowledge the greatest gains in human well-being in the history of our species — not to inspire complacency, but rather to spur our efforts to accelerate what may be the most important trend in the world today. © 2016, New York Times News Service Nicholas D.

Without knowing a person's genetic variants up to 60 per cent of prescribed medications don't do what they are supposed to do. Adverse drug reactions are both costly and may be dangerous -- something needs to change. To address this situation Dr. Martin Dawes and his multi-disciplinary team of doctors, pharmacists, and epidemiologists at the University of British Columbia, have developed TreatGx, a unique medication decision support system. Using the highest levels of evidence, TreatGX identifies personalized medication options for multiple common conditions. The options are presented to the doctor in an easy-to-read format with helpful information such as dosing instructions, potential adverse reactions, and medication cost comparison. Over the past year, the team has been working to validate this tool and the results were published today in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. There were a 191 patients recruited for the project by physicians and pharmacists. Genotyping was undertaken for each participant, and resulted in 189 (99%) patients with genetic reports linked to the decision-support program. There was at least one actionable genotype in 96.8% of samples. Over a three-month period, physicians and pharmacists used the medication support system 236 times. The outcome of the paper reported that a clinical decision support system with integrated data from pharmacogenetic tests may enable personalized prescribing within primary care. "TreatGX currently includes 24 common conditions such as hypertension, depression, and diabetes," said Dr. Martin Dawes, Head, Department of Family Practice at UBC. "This is a made in BC software system that allows the physician and patient to select tailored drug options for multiple conditions." "There are over 200,000 severe adverse drug events annually in Canada, costing upwards of $14 billion, which places a significant burden on the Canadian healthcare system," explains Dr. Catalina Lopez-Correa, Chief Scientific Officer and VP, Sector Development at Genome BC. "Even if physicians have the pharmacogenetic information, incorporating it into their system is a significant challenge. We are proud to support research that is helping doctors access and streamline genetic information to further enhance patient outcomes." Valued at over $720,000, this novel project was funded through Genome BC's User Partnership Program. It was also supported by The Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, TELUS Health, the Personalized Medicine Initiative, Roche Canada, AstraZeneca, GSK, Janssen, Merck, Pfizer and Innovative Medicines. For more information on TreatGx visit www.genxys.com/ Glossary of terms: Genotyping: The examination of specific piece of DNA contained in an organism. The genotype, as well as environmental and inherited epigenetic factors, determine the final characteristics. Pharmacogenomics: A branch of pharmacology concerned with using DNA and amino acid sequence data to inform drug development and testing. An important application of pharmacogenomics is correlating individual genetic variation with drug responses.

(EMAILWIRE.COM, September 23, 2016 ) Albumin-based therapies such as Idelvion (CSL654 rIX-FP) by CSL Behring received marketing approval from the US FDA in March 2016 and from the EMA in May 2016. Apart from these, Albutropin (TV-1106) by Teva Pharmaceuticals, Ampion by Ampio Pharmaceuticals, and Albutein by Grifols (for Alzheimer's disease) are expected to enter the market during the forecast period. The demand for albumin is high in APAC in countries like India and China. Still, the uptake of these therapeutics is less due to the lack of awareness about these products and their therapeutic uses. Thus, the awareness programs conducted by organizations such as PPTA, which includes International Plasma Awareness Week, to help increase the awareness about plasma donation and the different plasma protein therapies available, along with their potential uses, is expected to increase the uptake of these therapeutics in treating various conditions. Publisher's analysts forecast the global human albumin market to grow at a CAGR of 4.97% during the period 2016-2020.

That’s about the only thing Americans agree on; we’re polarized about all else. But several polls have found that about 9 out of 10 Americans believe that global poverty has worsened or stayed the same over the last 20 years. Fortunately, the one point Americans agree on is dead wrong. As world leaders gather for the U.N. General Assembly this week, all the evidence suggests that we are at an inflection point for the ages. The number of people living in extreme poverty ($1.90 per person per day) has tumbled by half in two decades, and the number of small children dying has dropped by a similar proportion — that’s 6 million lives a year saved by vaccines, breast-feeding promotion, pneumonia medicine and diarrhea treatments! Historians may conclude that the most important thing going on in the world in the early 21st century was a stunning decline in human suffering. OK, you’re thinking that I’ve finally cracked up after spending too much time in desperate places. So a few data points: As recently as 1981, when I was finishing college, 44 percent of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. Now the share is believed to be less than 10 percent and falling. “This is the best story in the world today,” says Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank. For the entire history of the human species until the 1960s, a majority of adults were illiterate. Now 85 percent of adults worldwide are literate and the share is rising. Although inequality has risen in America, the global trend is more encouraging: Internationally, inequality is on the decline because of gains by the poor in places like China and India. The U.N. aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, and experts believe it is possible to get quite close. In short, on our watch, we have a decent chance of virtually wiping out ills that have plagued humanity for thousands of generations, from illiteracy to the most devastating kind of hand-to-mouth poverty. Yet the public thinks the opposite, that poverty is getting worse. A poll by Motivaction, a Dutch firm, finds that only 1 percent of Americans surveyed realized that global extreme poverty had fallen by half over 20 years. I wonder if those of us in journalism and the humanitarian worlds don’t err by focusing so much on human misery that we leave the public with the misperception that everything is always getting worse. I’ve covered massacres in South Sudan, concentration camps in Myanmar and widespread stunting in India, but it’s also important to acknowledge the backdrop of global progress. Otherwise, the public may perceive poverty as hopeless and see no point in carrying on the fight — at just the point when we’re making the most rapid gains ever recorded. When I first made the acquaintance of the developing world, as a backpacking law student in the 1980s — sometimes on tops of trains or buses and writing articles to pay my expenses — the most gut-wrenching aspect of poverty I encountered was ubiquitous blind beggars, robbed of dignity and any chance to be productive. This is much less common today, partly because humanitarian aid — despite real shortcomings — has made a profound difference in health. The heroic work of former President Jimmy Carter and pharmaceutical donations from Merck have made river blindness less common. Vitamin A capsules costing 2 cents a dose have reduced blindness as well. Antibiotics have helped curb blinding trachoma. And a simple $25 surgery developed by a Nepali ophthalmologist, Dr. Sanduk Ruit, lets people suffering from cataracts see again. The scenes of blind beggars on every street corner will soon be gone forever. Cynics scoff that if more children’s lives are saved, they will just grow up to have more babies and cause new famines and poverty. Not so! When parents are assured that their children will survive, they choose to have fewer of them. As girls are educated and contraception becomes available, birthrates tumble — just as they did in the West. Indian women now average just 2.4 births, Indonesian women 2.5, and Mexican women just 2.2. So in a moment we can return to urgent needs worldwide, from war to climate change to refugees. But first, let’s pause for a nanosecond of silence to acknowledge the greatest gains in human well-being in the history of our species — not to inspire complacency, but rather to spur our efforts to accelerate what may be the most important trend in the world today.
