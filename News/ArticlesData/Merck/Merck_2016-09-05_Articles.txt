Argentina to Present Immensely Lucrative Options for Players  Based on product type, the LATAM pharmaceutical products market is led by the finished dosage form segment, accounting for a share of just under 86% in 2015. This segment is projected to amount to US$244.4 bn by 2024, retaining its lead throughout the forecast period. "The API and ingredients segment, on the other hand, has been witnessing strong growth in Latin America and is projected to register a 9.8% CAGR during the forecast period," the analyst predicts.

The open business environment has attracted multinational pharmaceutical companies and encouraged drug makers to invest in LATAM. Swift drug approvals and a traditional inclination toward free trade has worked in the favor of the healthcare sector in most LATAM countries and this has driven the pharmaceutical products market in the region. The CMO market in Latin America is primarily driven by the fact that a number of blockbuster drugs are going off patent in the next few years. "Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry has taken a hit owing to rising R&D cuts by federal banks and a decline in the productive outcomes of R&D," the analyst states. "This, combined with patent expirations, have compelled large companies to seek synergies with CMOs through mergers and acquisitions."

Hit With HCV Patent Suit Yet Again: A Serious Blow? The lawsuit comes at a crucial time for the biotech as it already faces declining growth of its HCV franchise By Nida Ahmed on Sep 6, 2016 at 7:50 am EST Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), the once undisputed leader in the fast expanding market of HCV drugs, is hit with a blow to its highest yielding HCV drugs franchise yet again. The biotech’s key compound of all its three HCV drugs, sofosbuvir, has been targeted with another patent challenge, this time by the University of Minnesota. It is yet to be seen if this patent suit results in a major blow to Gilead’s HCV sales. The biotech’s stock has been declining since August 29, 2016 when the patent suit was first put forward. GLD stock has lost 3.61% in the last five trading sessions, only further adding to its gloomy performance. Gilead’s shares have fallen 24.73% so far this year, significantly underperforming the market; the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (IBB) lost 17.67% during the same period. The recent lawsuit against Gilead’s key HCV compound puts blame on biotech for intentionally infringing upon a patent held by the school. The university states that sofosbuvir was originally discovered by Dr. Carston Wagner, who currently works at the university affiliated with its College of Pharmacy as the endowed chair in medicinal chemistry. The school claims that Mr. Wagner first won the patent, ‘830, on his work on nucleotide prodrugs in 2014 after which the patent rights were transferred to the institution. Since sofosbuvir is the main element in all of Gilead’s three main HCV drugs, Harvoni, Sovaldi, and recently-approved Epclusa, the latest lawsuit claims that all these drugs prove to infringe upon ‘830 patent. The school has clearly stated that it had first approached Gilead, informing it of the suspected infringement last year in July and also discussed the matter in detail in August 2015; the company failed to accept any blame. If this lawsuit holds true, it can translate into a serious dent to Gilead’s future growth since its HCV drugs franchise has been the main reason for propelling the biotech amongst the top players of the industry. Since Sovaldi’s entry into the market in 2013—Gilead’s first ever HCV drug—the three drugs have shored up a hefty $40 billion in worldwide sales, contributing to striking growth over a period of less than three years. The lawsuit stated: "Gilead has infringed, and continues to infringe, the University’s intellectual property rights by, among other things, selling medicines containing the drug sofosbuvir, including brand name drugs Sovaldi, Harvoni, and Epclusa." However, this is not the first time that Gilead has encountered such a lawsuit against its top selling products. It has faced a number of such lawsuits, but most of them did not prove to be much of a threat. The most recent one which gained much interest from investors was that from pharmaceutical giant, Merck. It was sued for infringing upon its HCV patents, claiming not only damages but also royalties on future sales of Gilead’s HCV drugs. Merck surprisingly won the lawsuit winning $200 million in damages; however, the decision from federal jury was later overturned when it was revealed that Merck’s attorney had lied in the court. Gilead stood victorious in protecting patent on its top selling cash cows. Considering the past events, Jefferies recently released a research note on this issue holding the stance that “the lawsuit clearly holds a low probability of success." However, until the suit’s first proceeding is held, it remains uncertain whether the matter will hit the company’s stock and gain any attention in the market. The lawsuit Adds to Gilead’s Troubles The lawsuit comes at a crucial time for the biotech, which is already facing troubles at the hands of declining growth in its leading HCV drugs portfolio. The company’s HCV drugs franchise consists of two top blockbusters that have been reaping surprising growth since their launch. Sovaldi turned out to be a major breakthrough and proved to shorten the treatment duration by a considerable amount compared to standard HCV treatments. The other HCV drug, Harvoni, was advanced version of Sovaldi and won the final nod from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October, 2014. These two drugs yielded $12.4 billion for fiscal year 2014 (FY14) in combined sales, which went on to hit $19.1 billion in FY15. Aforementioned records from the blockbuster drugs were not a piece of cake for Gilead as it faced numerous lawsuits to defend their patents. In addition to that, the company has been severely criticized for hefty price tags on these two HCV drugs; Solvaldi costs $84,000 for a 12-week treatment, while Harvoni carries an even higher price of $94,500 for 12-week treatment. The biotech firm was pressurized by insurers and various public health officials to offer discounts on its blockbuster drugs, so as to increase their affordability for a large HCV population. These hefty discounts further explain the dent received by the company’s total HCV revenue. In addition to discounts, these drugs shorten the HCV treatment duration, and it leaves a smaller share of untreated population with more patients successfully treated; Gilead’s strength has thus resulted in its own blow too. The aforementioned reported their first ever sales decline in the first quarter (1Q) of fiscal 2016 this year; Sovaldi sales fell 17.5% on a quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) basis to $1.28 billion while that of Harvoni’s stood at $3.02 billion, with a 9.8% decline QoQ. Since Gilead’s HCV franchise generates more than 60% of the company’s total revenue, the decline was meant to hit the company hard. For the 1Q, Gilead’s revenue stood at $7.79 billion, an 8.46% decrease QoQ. However, the sales decline is expected to face a turnaround soon on the back of Gilead’s new HCV molecule, Epclusa; the drug received FDA approval in June this year as the first ever pan-genotype HCV drug meant for treating all genotypes of the debilitating liver disease. Epclusa can be the new generation HCV drug in the market, bringing a much needed turnaround to revenue decline of the leading biotech.

View exclusive Global strategic Business report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/latin-america-pharmaceutical-products-cmo-market.html Rising R&D Cuts to Encourage CMO Activities  "Several LATAM countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Colombia have been undergoing an improvement in their regulatory frameworks and a more streamlined manner of processes," the author of the study has observed. The open business environment has attracted multinational pharmaceutical companies and encouraged drug makers to invest in LATAM. Swift drug approvals and a traditional inclination toward free trade has worked in the favor of the healthcare sector in most LATAM countries and this has driven the pharmaceutical products market in the region. The CMO market in Latin America is primarily driven by the fact that a number of blockbuster drugs are going off patent in the next few years. "Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry has taken a hit owing to rising R&D cuts by federal banks and a decline in the productive outcomes of R&D," the analyst states. "This, combined with patent expirations, have compelled large companies to seek synergies with CMOs through mergers and acquisitions."

Technology company Merck waved their naming rights for this season, allowing the club to rename their home ground  the Jonathan-Heimes-Stadion-am-Böllenfalltor for the duration of the 2016/17 season. Heimes was a tennis star as a child, but was later diagnosed with cancer at the age of 14. He raised millions of euros in charity, setting up a childrens cancer charity with tennis star Andrea Petkovic, before succumbing to the disease on March 8, 2016, aged 26. The much loved fan was an ever-present source of motivation as Darmstadt rose through the ranks of German football, earning promotion to the Bundesliga in the 2014/15 season. The occasion was a joyous one, when the club celebrated with Heimes on stage in the city centre, including captain Aytac Sulu. The Darmstadt skipper was pleased with the decision, saying “We’re playing in Johnny’s living room now, which is a motivation in itself.” “We want to stay up again this season and this connection will spur us on even more. Every Darmstadt fan who identifies with us identifies with Johnny too.” The Merck group, who hold the naming rights, ought to be lauded for the gesture, with board member Kai Beckmann noting the company was ‘ready and willing’ and ‘delighted to do so in agreement with all parties.” DUMUSSTKÄMPFEN Translated to ‘You must fight on’, the Dumustkampfen foundation initated by Heimes and Petkovic lives on in spirit, with the deceased youngster’s father, Martin Heimes, applauding the decision, saying “It’s tremendous that Merck have named the stadium after our son Johnny, who loved and supported this club so much. This also helps ensure that the initiative ‘DUMUSSTKÄMPFEN’ goes on.” The goodwill continued, with Darmstadt’s main sponsor, tech giants Software AG announcing that on March 8, 2017, the anniversary of Jonny Heimes’ death, the club witll play in a special edition kit featuring DUMUSSTKÄMPFEN’s logo instead of theirs, with kit sales going into the foundation’s coffers, alongwith a special edition wristband. The city have also moved to pay tribute to Heimes, with one of the public trams to feature the words ‘Thank You Johnny!” set against the backdrop of the club’s colours. Darmstadt will play in their newly renamed stadium against Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Fetching more content... Latest Sports News Cricket Football Pro-Wrestling and more..

(Getty Images) Previous Next Show Grid Previous Next Hide Grid Image 1/ Video Audio Darmstadt have changed the name of their stadium in honour of fan Jonathan Heimes, who died in March after a battle with cancer. Source: Omnisport 5 Sep 2016 - 11:28 PM  UPDATED 5 Sep 2016 - 11:28 PM Tweet An agreement with ground sponsors Merck will see their name dropped from that of the venues, which will instead become the Jonathan-Heimes-Stadion am Bollenfalltor for the remainder of the season. Heimes struggled with the illness throughout his teenage years before losing the battle aged 26 last march. Muller double gives Germany winning start in Norway Germany made a winning start to the defence of their 2018 FIFA World Cup crown, cruising to a dominant 3-0 qualifying victory over Norway with the help of a Thomas Muller brace. The move is also designed to support the non-profit organisation 'Du Musst Kampfen' which serves children suffering with cancer. Heimes' father, Martin, said: "It is a great gesture that Merck has enabled the stadium where the club he loved and supported so much to be named after our son. This way the 'Du Musst Kampfen' initiative is better known." Darmstadt captain Aytac Sulu believes the change will provide a boost in the club's bid to avoid relegation. "It's a motivational tool for us, we want to remain in the league again and this connection with Johnny will give us an additional push," Sulu said "Every Darmstadt fan who identifies with us, identifies with Jonathan." Merck has also invested in a new tram to run through the city from Tuesday adorned with the message: 'Thank you, Johnny'. Darmstadt's shirt sponsor Software AG agreed to have its name replaced by 'Du Musst Kampfen' for one match.

português suomeksi svenska China Animal Vaccine Industry Report, 2016-2020 News provided by ReportBuyer Sep 06, 2016, 17:00 ET Share this article LONDON, Sept. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Animal vaccine is a kind of biological agent that enables inoculated animals to produce active immunity for disease prevention. In recent years, European and American animal vaccine markets have seen slower growth due to quality safety, high maturity and other factors, while the animal vaccine markets in emerging countries including China have developed rapidly. The Chinese animal vaccine market size grew from RMB1.4 billion in 2004 to RMB14.0 billion in 2014 at a high rate of 25.9%, and is expected to hit around RMB16.9 billion in 2015, a year-on-year increase of 20.7%. In China, animal vaccines fall into two categories: 1. Epidemic disease vaccines subject to national compulsory immunization programme (compulsory immunization vaccines include highly pathogenic avian influenza vaccine, foot-and-mouth disease vaccine, highly pathogenic PRRS vaccine, swine fever vaccine, and PPR vaccine in Xinjiang and Tibet); 2. Epidemic disease vaccines beyond national compulsory immunization programme (non-compulsory immunization vaccines). As the problems like low price and low quality caused by the system of purchasing by invitation to bid have greatly impacted the development of livestock and poultry breeding in China, the government has been piloting reform of the tendering system in multiple regions, planning to advance the marketization of vaccines through direct subsidies to farmers. Large breeding companies, out of overall consideration based on economic benefits, are increasingly inclined to buy high-quality market-oriented vaccines which are 5-15 times as expensive as vaccines purchased under policy. Hence, the Chinese animal vaccine market size is expected to grow significantly in the future, reaching RMB41.2 billion in 2020. Despite a large number of animal vaccine companies (about 100) in China, the industry is less concentrated. In 2015, China Animal Husbandry Industry Co., Ltd. (CAHIC) held the largest share (7.4%) of the Chinese animal vaccine market in 2015, followed by Jinyu Bio-technology (7.2%), Qingdao Yebio Biological Engineering (5.0%), Xinjiang Tecon Animal Husbandry Bio-Technology (4.6%), Pulike Biological Engineering (2.8%), and Tianjin Ringpu Bio-technology (2.8%). Although the Chinese animal vaccine market is primarily controlled by domestic companies with a share of 90% or so, the high-end vaccine market, such as pet vaccines, is occupied by foreign brands including Zoetis (formerly Pfizer's animal health division), Fort Dodge, Intervet, Merial, and BoehringerIngelheim. These foreign players not only directly sell vaccines in China but also have been increasing their investment in the country. In 2014, the animal vaccine manufacturing base, with total investment of EUR55.5 million and jointly founded by BoehringerIngelheim and Taizhou China Medical City, started construction. Some pig vaccines will be first commercialized in the China Medical City after the manufacturing base is completed in 2016. Intervet Holding BV and CAHIC signed a cooperation agreement in 2015, planning to jointly explore domestic and foreign markets and enhance competitiveness. However, Chinese local animal vaccine companies are also scaling up efforts for research and development, making their presence in high-end vaccines and expanding varieties of vaccines. There were 25 kinds of registered animal vaccines in China in 2015, a year-on-year growth of 78.6%, including 10 kinds of pig vaccines, 10 kinds of poultry vaccines, and 5 kinds of other animal vaccines like Mink Hemorrhagic Pneumonia Bivalent Vaccine, Inactivated (Serotype G, Stain WD005 + Serotype B, Stain DL007) and Turbot EdwardsiellatardaVaccine, Live (Strain EIBAV1). Moreover, great progress has been made in pet vaccines. Rabies vaccines, inactivated produced by Pulike Biological Engineering, Tianjin Ringpu Bio-technology, and Shanghai Hile Bio-Technology are expected to be approved and go on the market at the end of 2016 or in 2017.

The arena will carry the name "Jonathan-Heimes-Stadion am Boellenfalltor" after technology company Merck gave up its naming rights for this season. Heimes died in March at 26. The idea came from Heimes' father, a Merck employee. Darmstadt mayor Jochen Partsch called it a "unique action that we can only support." FILE - In this March 3, 2016 file picture Darmstadt fans Hold banners reading : "We miss you, but your values remain, We fight on," during a German Bundesliga soccer match between SV Darmstadt 98 and FC Augsburg in the stadium in Darmstadt, Germany, At top a photo and a banner reading "Johnny", to remember Darmstadt supporter Jonathan 'Johnny' Heimes who died of cancer. Bundesliga club Darmstadt had added the name of a fan who died of cancer to the official name of its stadium for one season. The arena will carry the name "Jonathan-Heimes-Stadion am Boellenfalltor" after the company Merck gave up its naming rights for this season. Heimes died in March at 26. (Frank Rumpenhorst/dpa via AP,file) Darmstadt captain Aytac Sulu says the move is extra motivation for the team, which is seeking to remain in the top flight for the second straight season. Sulu says the "link to Johnny will give us an extra push." Darmstadt surprised last season by avoiding relegation despite limited means.

The immediate purpose of the collaboration is to support health equity by reducing adult immunization disparities. The collaboration also seeks to support minority-serving practices in meeting the requirements of value-based payment reforms. Adult immunization disparities offer an immediate opportunity to improve an essential healthcare process. Approximately 11.6 percent and 14.6 percent of African-Americans and Hispanics respectively receive herpes zoster vaccination compared with 32 percent of non-Hispanic Whites. Less than half of African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian/Pacific Islanders receive the pneumococcal vaccine compared with 65 percent of non-Hispanic Whites. "Seventy percent of our nation's African-American and Hispanic or Latino populations reside in 6,000 of the 38,000 residential zip codes in the United States," said Gary A. Puckrein, PhD, president and CEO of the National Minority Quality Forum.  "This collaborative program will build on the Forum's powerful data analytic capabilities which can pinpoint zip codes where African-Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics are the majority of the population." ACP is working with The Forum to identify its members who serve patients in these zip codes, distinguishing those who are leading the effort to provide this crucial preventive service. The goal is to understand their strategies for successful vaccination and to share that information and direct support with all ACP members working with racially and ethnically diverse populations. "Given that African Americans, Latinos, and other minorities experience a large and growing disparity in adult immunization rates, this program will help physicians and their health care teams bridge the gap in preventing disease and death among our most vulnerable citizens," said Wayne J. Riley, MD, MPH, MBA, MACP, ACP's Immediate Past President and Clinical Professor of Medicine and Adjunct Professor of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, who will serve as chair of the project's national advisory council. "Furthermore, these physicians and health care teams often have the least resources to be successful in the value-based payment environment." QHC brings to the program health quality expertise and a commitment to patient education and engagement, with a significant focus on health literacy. "It will be critical to provide health care teams with culturally relevant, health literate information and resources so they can effectively convey the importance of vaccination," said Bernard Rosof, MD, MACP, QHC's CEO. The initiative is being launched in September 2016 and is an extension of ACP's I Raise the Rates program, which works with primary care practices in several states supporting education and quality improvement activities to increase practice-based immunizations. Major support for this project is provided through an educational grant from Merck. Additional support comes from Pfizer, Inc., and Sanofi Pasteur. About the National Minority Quality ForumThe National Minority Quality Forum (The Forum) is a Washington, DC-based not-for-profit, non‘partisan, independent research and education organization dedicated to improving the quality of healthcare that is available for and provided to all populations. The Forum develops user-friendly, web-based disease indices that provide a unique two-dimensional view of the prevalence and impact of diseases by zip code, including diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease and HIV/AIDS.

XiaoZhi Lim1 06 September 2016 Corrected: 16 September 2016 Article tools PDF Rights & Permissions Jasiek Krzysztofiak/Nature In her 1794 book, An Essay on Combustion, Scottish chemist Elizabeth Fulhame noted a peculiar fact: substances such as coal and charcoal burned better when they were damp. After many experiments to understand why, she concluded that the water briefly split into hydrogen and oxygen, which interacted with the other compounds in a way that made the combustion go faster. Yet at the end, Fulhame wrote, the process “forms a new quantity of water equal to that decomposed”. Many historians consider this to be the first scientific account of a catalyst: a material that speeds reactions by making or breaking chemical bonds, without being consumed. It was hardly the last: modern chemistry would be almost inconceivable without catalysts. “They not only make transformations accessible, but also direct them in new ways,” says Susannah Scott, a chemist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “That's very powerful.” Catalysts are used in some 90% of processes in the chemical industry, and are essential for the production of fuels, plastics, drugs and fertilizers. At least 15 Nobel prizes have been awarded for work on catalysis. And thousands of chemists around the world are continually improving the catalysts they have and striving to invent new ones. That work is partly driven by an interest in sustainability. The aim of catalysis is to direct reactions along precisely defined pathways so that chemists can skip reaction steps, reduce waste, minimize energy use and do more with less. And with growing concerns about climate change and the environment, sustainability has become increasingly important. Catalysis is a key principle of 'green chemistry': an industry-wide effort to prevent pollution before it happens. Catalysts are also seen as the key to unlocking energy sources that are much more inert and difficult to use than coal, oil or gas, but much cleaner. Catalysis can make it more economically feasible to split water into oxygen and hydrogen fuel, or can open up new ways to use raw materials such as biomass or carbon dioxide. “These are feedstocks that are ripe for advances in catalysis,” says Melanie Sanford, a chemist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. These challenges have led to an explosion in catalyst innovation, with the annual number of publications on the subject tripling in the past decade. Many groups are coming up with new small-molecule complexes or are chemically tailoring biological enzymes in search of radically new catalytic activity. Others are pursuing advances in nanotechnology, which allow them to engineer the action of solid catalysts at the atomic scale. Still others are experimenting with catalysts that are activated by light, or that incorporate the DNA double helix. And everyone in the field is trying to streamline the search for better catalysts with modern computational modelling tools. The pace of innovation is such that even the experts are struggling to keep up, says Scott, who leads the US Department of Energy's efforts to develop benchmarks for the new catalysts' performance1. “We need to make sure we are advancing the science that's most efficient,” she says. And the scope of catalysis is increasing rapidly. “Twenty years ago,” says John Hartwig, a chemist at the University of California, Berkeley, “catalysis to make molecules that were complex did not exist.” Anyone who wanted to modify a large complicated structure would have to tear it down and build it back up, says Sanford. But now, chemists can often edit parts of a molecule precisely. “It's incredibly enabling,” she says. Cut-price catalysts Using a catalyst is like bulldozing a shortcut between reactants A and product B, bypassing convoluted chemical pathways that might otherwise take forever. Using a really good catalyst is like building a multilane superhighway. And some of the best are the 'homogeneous' catalysts: free-floating molecules that are mixed in with the reactants. Industrial catalysts in this category most often consist of a metal ion that does the hard work of making or breaking chemical bonds, surrounded by 'ligands': connected groups, often carbon-based, that control the reactants' access to the ion. Much of the research in this field comes down to tailoring these ligands to produce a catalyst that performs only a desired reaction. Unfortunately, many of the successes so far have come through the use of scarce and expensive metals such as palladium, platinum, ruthenium and iridium. Today, chemists are increasingly striving to build catalysts around cheaper, 'Earth-abundant' elements such as iron, nickel or copper — or to do without metals altogether. “Chemists are striving to build catalysts around cheaper, 'Earth-abundant' elements such as iron, nickel or copper.” Nickel is a particularly attractive candidate for mimicking the chemistry of palladium and platinum because it sits directly above them in the periodic table, and therefore has similar properties. At the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, for example, synthetic chemist Xile Hu and his group are working with a remarkably versatile nickel complex2 that they first reported in 2008. The complex consists of a nickel ion surrounded by a single, large ligand that binds to it in three places, leaving a fourth binding spot available for catalysing reactions. A similar ligand is already used in certain palladium catalysts. But the radius of a nickel ion is almost 20% smaller than that of a palladium ion, so Hu had to shrink the ligand to fit it more closely around the nickel. To do so, he replaced phosphorus atoms in the ligand with smaller nitrogen ones. The result is a rigid ligand that stabilizes the nickel ion as it performs a wide array of reactions3, 4, 5. The original nickel catalyst is already available commercially, and Hu is systematically modifying the ligand to make a whole family of catalysts. In 2008, chemists discovered that certain standard catalysts could be made more powerful by combining them with a technique known as photoredox catalysis. When photoredox catalysts absorb light, an electron leaps from the metal ion to the ligand and becomes stuck there, leaving the molecule in an unstable state. “The catalyst becomes desperate to fill the hole in the metal and get rid of the electron in the ligand,” explains David MacMillan, a chemist at Princeton University in New Jersey who first reported6 the idea in collaboration with chemist David Nicewicz from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But the only way the photoredox system can accomplish this is to trade electrons with the standard catalyst, supercharging it and triggering chemical transformations that were previously impossible. As a bonus, the photoredox catalysis drives the process with energy that it absorbed from light, reducing the heat required to keep the reaction going. Nicewicz and MacMillan have independently used photoredox catalysis to make major improvements to the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction, which is frequently used to bond carbon with nitrogen when making drugs. Typically, the reaction requires the use of palladium salts, expensive, phosphorus-based ligands and difficult-to-make reactants. But in 2015, Nicewicz's group announced7 that it had not only made a carbon–nitrogen bond using a completely metal-free catalyst, but had done so starting from cheaper and more accessible reactants; it is already being used by pharmaceutical companies, says Nicewicz. In June, MacMillan's group and its collaborators at Merck Research Laboratories in Rahway, New Jersey, reported8 making the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction work with minute amounts of an iridium light absorber and a nickel salt, eliminating the need for ligands. A specific challenge for many researchers is to find better ways of creating the carbon–fluorine bonds at the heart of fluorinated compounds that are widely used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and medical imaging. Currently, the bonds are made using expensive specialized reagents or the highly corrosive gas hydrogen fluoride. In 2013, a team of researchers led by Sanford showed9 how to make such bonds with a safer potassium fluoride salt using a copper catalyst. First, the catalyst is exposed to a compound that strips away three of its electrons. This leaves the catalyst so hungry for electrons that it can pull some from a nearby fluoride ion, which holds them in a notoriously tight grip. The fluoride is then so desperate for a replacement electron that it will readily bind with a carbon atom to get it. Pebbles in a stream Despite their versatility, many homogeneous catalysts are fragile. Their internal bonds weaken after prolonged exposure to heat and collisions with reactant molecules, and their ligands start disintegrating. “They die after a while,” says Sanford. That is a big reason why large-scale industry tends to use 'heterogeneous' catalysts: solid materials that are fixed in place while the reactants stream past. A classic example is the mix of powdered platinum and other metals found in the catalytic converters that clean vehicle exhaust gases. In the past, chemists had a tough time designing heterogeneous catalysts with atomic precision because it was difficult to make and study the active sites, where catalysis occurs, in a solid material. Mostly they had to optimize the catalysts through trial and error. But what's changing, says Scott, “is the synthetic control that we can exert over the materials”. In particular, rapid advances in nanotechnology are allowing chemists to work towards systems with the robustness of solid catalysts and the high performance of homogeneous ones. At the Chinese Academy of Sciences' State Key Laboratory of Catalysis in Dalian, director Can Li has used platinum and cobalt oxide nanoparticles to create a catalyst for splitting water with sunlight10 (see 'Light splitter'). He starts by sticking the nanoparticles to crystals of a semiconductor called bismuth vanadium oxide, with each type of particle carefully isolated on a specific face of each crystal. Then, when he immerses the crystals in water and exposes them to light, photons strike the semiconductor and loosen electrons. The result is a flow of current that the nanoparticles use to break water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Oxygen gas comes bubbling off the cobalt oxide sites, while positively charged hydrogen ions migrate to the platinum particles. “We separated the active sites to block the reverse reaction,” says Li — that is, a dangerously explosive conversion of hydrogen and oxygen back into water. (To simplify the experimental set-up, the hydrogen ions are currently captured by a separate compound rather than turned into gas.) The process is not yet efficient enough to be economically viable, says Li. But his team is testing combinations of semiconductors and metal catalysts to refine the design. Nik Spencer/Nature Audrey Moores, a chemist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, is tackling a bothersome issue in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food industries, which often use heavy-metal-ion catalysts. Ions of palladium, ruthenium and platinum are toxic, so products made with them cannot be sold until they have been through a series of meticulous and expensive cleansing steps. Moores is working on alternative catalysts based on iron, which is much safer. In 2014, her research group prepared a series of hollow, magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for making benzaldehyde11: a molecule that smells like almonds and is widely used in flavourings. It is typically manufactured by reacting certain electron-hungry compounds with styrene: a sweet-smelling but hazardous liquid that is better known as a raw material for plastics. The process tends to generate a relatively small amount of benzaldehyde mixed with other molecules. But Moores' iron nanoparticles catalyse a more controllable reaction between styrene and oxygen, yielding almost pure benzaldehyde. And as an added advantage, iron is magnetic, so at the end of the reaction the iron nanoparticles can be extracted for reuse with a magnet. Even-handedness When making large, complex molecules such as steroids, antibiotics or hormones, a major challenge involves chirality, or the 'handedness' of a carbon atom. Such an atom carrying four different groups can have two configurations that are mirror images of each other, like human hands. A complex molecule may contain many such carbon atoms — and if even one of them has the wrong configuration, the compound can end up interacting badly with the human body. One notorious example is thalidomide, a drug developed in the 1950s for treating morning sickness in pregnant women. One chiral configuration seems to have been effective and safe for that purpose. But many chemists believe that its mirror image, which was present in the over-the-counter drug, is what caused babies to be born with severe limb deformations. Molecules from biomass feedstocks contain a wide variety of chiral carbon atoms in a chain, and it is almost impossible to distinguish one from another. “A small-molecule catalyst wouldn't recognize it,” says Hartwig. Instead, chemists are turning to biological enzymes, which can be large enough to recognize the overall shape of the target molecule and home in on the bond where the reaction should occur. Enzymes also have the advantage of using water as a solvent and working at body temperatures, which makes them more environmentally friendly than processes that require toxic solvents and large amounts of heat. Naturally occurring enzymes don't always catalyse the reactions that chemists want, however — which is why one frontier of catalysis research is to rework these proteins so that they do. Hartwig has been looking at the haem enzyme, which is similar to the compounds that carry oxygen in red blood cells, and has developed12 an artificial enzyme that substitutes an iridium complex for the haem's iron centre. Although this runs contrary to the goal of replacing precious metals with Earth-abundant ones, says Hartwig, iridium can work with strong bonds such as those between carbon and hydrogen, which iron cannot. His team is using crystallographic data to study the enzyme's structures near the iridium site and is systematically modifying them so that they can precisely transform a carbon–hydrogen bond into a carbon–carbon bond with the desired chiral configuration — a formidable challenge. The chemists can prepare hundreds or even thousands of new enzymes in this way, limited only by the time it takes to test them and analyse their activity. Still, enzymes are very specific to their target, and although they yield a product with a single chiral configuration, it is often the configuration that isn't wanted. “If you're interested in the other, you're in trouble,” says Stellios Arseniyadis, a synthetic chemist at Queen Mary University of London. To address that problem, Arseniyadis is collaborating with Michael Smietana of the University of Montpellier in France to make catalysts from DNA. Although most natural DNA spirals in only one direction, it is possible to make an artificial version that twists in the opposite direction. The two researchers and their teams make their catalysts by choosing a natural or non-natural helix of DNA and then attaching a metal ion inside it. The spiral grooves align the reactants so that they fuse with the desired chiral configuration. In 2015, Arseniyadis and Smietana reported a recyclable DNA–copper catalyst13 that created the correct chiral products as reactants flowed past. With endless combinations of base pairs and metal ions, “there's a plethora of parameters that you can fine-tune”, says Arseniyadis. Chemists are continuing to push the boundaries of catalysis research. Li, for example, is experimenting with housing enzymes inside nanoparticles14 to help them last longer. Others are synthesizing completely artificial enzymes15 using techniques from synthetic biology. And earlier this year, an international team of researchers reported16 using an electric field to catalyse the formation of ring-shaped carbon compounds. These ideas are starting to constitute entire new research fields in which conventionally distinct disciplines overlap — for example, combining chemical synthesis and DNA. That, says Arseniyadis, leaves “a lot of room for serendipity”.

Both have experienced mental health issues. Photo: Vanessa Sellick and Getty. Share Tweet Whatsapp Email Share Mum launches petition to warn parents about asthma medication after son tried to commit suicide - Yahoo7 Pinterest Tumblr A Melbourne mother has called for new warning labels on a common asthma medication, after her young son tried to commit suicide and experienced severe mental health issues while taking it. WARNING, DISTRESSING CONTENT. Vanessa Sellick, 40, told Yahoo7 her two sons Harrison and Austin had been prescribed the medication Singulair (Montelukast) at two-years-old. Vanessa Sellick and her two sons Harrison and Austin. Photo: Vanessa Sellick. Singulair is prescribed to children aged between two and 14, who experience frequent intermittent, mild persistent or exercise-induced asthma. The drug is a chewable tablet that is easy to give to children and considered ‘less traumatic’ than other asthma treatments. The medication has since been linked to psychotic episodes in children. Ms Sellick said Harrison, who is now ten, started to experience behavioural problems and suicidal thoughts while taking the medication. Harrison took the medication for about three years and has been off it for almost six, however Ms Harrison claims her son still experiences side effects. Harrison and Austin had both taken the medication Singulair since they were two years old. Both had experienced mental health issues since being prescribed the medication. Photo: Vanessa Sellick. Singulair is prescribed to young children as it is considered 'less tramatic' than other asthma medications. Photo: Getty. “When my son first went on Singulair the side effects weren’t actually acknowledged. When they were made known they weren’t communicated to us,” Ms Sellick told Yahoo7. “If you could see the horror that my son and so many others have endured, it’s really heartbreaking,” Ms Sellick said. She said Harrison would beg her to "let him die" after he started experiencing suicidal thoughts at only four-years-old. “It gradually got worse, he did have a suicide attempt,” she said. “I don’t know whether he fully understood it. Vanessa Sellick said her son's mental health had dramatically improved since ceasing use of the drug Singulair. Photo: Vanessa Sellick. “He would say ‘I’m going to run out on the road and get hit by a car’ or ‘I’m going to jump off the balcony and go splat on the concrete’… that was a common one.” Ms Sellick said she had sought countless mental health and medical assistance for her son including regular psychologist appointments. Harrison had also been tested for Asperger’s syndrome a number of times but she said the tests always came back negative. She also undertook a psychology degree to try and learn ways she could help her son. Since stopping the medication Ms Sellick said Harrison has still experienced depressive episodes, but his mental health had improved dramatically. “All his teachers at school have been supportive, they have seen a huge change in him,” she said. In 2013, a safety alert on the drug was issued by the Australia's Therapeutic Goods Association. By this stage Harrison had already stopped taking the medication. However, his younger brother Austin was still using it as a treatment for asthma. Ms Sellick said when she saw the TGA alert she immediately took Austin off the medication. “We didn’t make the link prior,” she said. “Because you put the child on it at two, you put it down to the terrible twos … but I knew deep down it wasn’t normal.” Between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2013 the TGA received reports of neuropsychiatric adverse events in 58 children who had been prescribed (Singulair) Montelukast. Neuropsychiatric reactions reported to the TGA included nightmares, altered mood and insomnia. On Monday night Ms Sellick has started a Change.Org petition demanding warning labels be added to the Singulair’s packaging to warn parents of the serious side effects. “Children that take this medication are often unable to communicate the horror they are experiencing so they rely on their parents to identify the side effects,” she wrote in the petition. “A list of the potential side effects is buried deep in the product information which is not often provided with the prescription. “We ask that a fluorescent warning label be placed on the outside of the Singulair (Montelukast) packaging in order to educate parents and adult users of these severe side effects.” Ms Sellick said she took her son Austin off the medication after finding the TGA report, Harrison was no longer using it. Photo: Vanessa Sellick. Singulair (Montelukast) was first made available in Australia in 1998. Ms Sellick was concerned that many children had suffered long-term side effects after taking the drug. The drug's producer, Merck, Sharp and Dohme has claimed millions use the drug safely worldwide. “The health and safety of patients who use our medicines is our highest priority. We take any report received about our medicines very seriously,” a spokesman told Daily Mail. The spokesman said it was a GP’s responsibility to keep up to date with side effects of medications and inform patients appropriately. Ms Sellick’s petition has sparked other mothers to also come forward about their experiences with the drug. Leanne Mackey wrote her son had been taking the medication for nine months as a four-year-old. “He became over time, violent, moody, despondent, he talked of wanting the world to go black,” she wrote. “He had the sensation of pins and needles in his arms and legs for long periods of time, became forgetful, and started certain ocd behaviors (sic).” She claimed within a week of stopping the medication, her son started to “come out of the fog”. “He's now 11 and happy, while still suffering with asthma, but NEVER again would I allow him on Singulair. I tell everyone i know about the dangers of Singulair. (sic)” Yahoo7 have also approached MSD for comment as to whether they feel the warnings on the drug Singulair were adequate.

Jonathan “Johnny” Heimes, a former German tennis prodigy who was diagnosed with cancer at 14 and died in March at the age of 26, served as an inspiration behind the Lillies’ remarkable ascent from Germany’s third division to the Bundesliga. With his motto “You must fight on, nothing is yet lost,” Heimes launched an initiative that raised hundreds of thousands of euros for other cancer-stricken children during his lengthy battle with the disease. Darmstadt’s players had worn armbands featuring his motto for the past couple years, and when the club won promotion to the German top flight in 2015, Heimes was an integral part of the celebrations. Schönes Gefährt! Diese Straßenbahn wird ab morgen im regulären Fahrplan durch #Darmstadt fahren 💙 #sv98 pic.twitter.com/mLDyPKaFCE— SV Darmstadt 98 (@sv98) September 5, 2016 Now, six months after his passing, Darmstadt’s premium sponsor Merck have agreed to forgo their naming rights to the club’s home ground for one year to honor Heimes. “We’re playing in Johnny’s living room now, which is a motivation in itself,” said Darmstadt captain Aytac Sulu. “We want to stay up again this season and this connection will spur us on even more. Every Darmstadt fan who identifies with us identifies with Johnny too.” One of Darmstadt’s city trolleys will also pay tribute to Heimes, and the club’s kit sponsor, Software AG, pledged to make way for the logo of Heimes’ “You must fight on” initiative for one matchday in March on the anniversary of his death. Darmstadt’s first game at their newly named stadium is Saturday’s Bundesliga match against Eintracht Frankfurt.

Vanessa Sellick said her son Harrison was prescribed asthma medication when he was two years old but started experiencing behavioural problems and suicidal thoughts. The drug, which is called Montelukast or Singulair, is usually prescribed to children with asthma between two to 14 years of age.  Harrison Sellick tried to kill himself when he was five years old when he was taking a brand of asthma medication that has been linked to psychotic episodes in children Harrison, who is now 10, took the medication for three years.  'He started having really long meltdowns that would last for an hour and a half. There was general comments about death and self-loathing,' Ms Sellick told Daily Mail Australia.   Ms Sellick said her son tried to kill himself when he was just five. 'It was a deliberate attempt - he was in severe psychological pain,' she said. Ms Sellick said doctors were unable to explain his psychological issues and said she made the link to his medication after Australia's Therapeutic Goods Association put out a safety alert about the drug in 2013. Harrison had already stopped taking the medication by this time.  Harrison, who is now 10, took the medication for three years. His mother Vanessa said he experienced severe behavioural problems during this time The drug, which is called Montelukast or Singulair, is usually prescribed to children with asthma between two to 14 years of age Harrison, pictured as a baby, was prescribed asthma medication when he was two years old In the update it said between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2013 the TGA had received reports of neuropsychiatric adverse events in 58 children and adolescents being treated with Montelukast. Among these adverse events were five reports of suicidal thoughts, five reports of depression and eight reports of agitation. Other neuropsychiatric reactions reported to the TGA included nightmares, altered mood and insomnia and in many cases, patients had experienced multiple neuropsychiatric reactions. The company who produces the drug, Merck, Sharp and Dohme, said it had been used safely by millions of people around the world and was first made available in Australia in 1998. 'The health and safety of patients who use our medicines is our highest priority. We take any report received about our medicines very seriously,' a spokesman said. 'The decision to prescribe or to discontinue treatment is taken jointly by the doctor and their individual patient, as only they can weigh-up the potential benefits against any potential risks in a given individual case. 'The doctor has a responsibility to keep themselves up-to-date with the effects of that medicine.'  Harrison, pictured with his younger brother Austin, started having really long meltdowns when he was about three.

FOXSPORTS Bundesliga club Darmstadt rename stadium in honor of cancer victim What a wonderful gesture from the team and its sponsors. By Thomas Hautmann Sep 5, 2016 at 3:54p ET 0 Shares Bundesliga club SV Darmstadt 98 have renamed their stadium the “Jonathan-Heimes-Stadion am Böllenfalltor” for this season to honor one of the club’s most loyal and prominent supporters. Jonathan “Johnny” Heimes, a former German tennis prodigy who was diagnosed with cancer at 14 and died in March at the age of 26, served as an inspiration behind the Lillies’ remarkable ascent from Germany’s third division to the Bundesliga. With his motto “You must fight on, nothing is yet lost,” Heimes launched an initiative that raised hundreds of thousands of euros for other cancer-stricken children during his lengthy battle with the disease. Darmstadt’s players had worn armbands featuring his motto for the past couple years, and when the club won promotion to the German top flight in 2015, Heimes was an integral part of the celebrations. Now, six months after his passing, Darmstadt’s premium sponsor Merck have agreed to forgo their naming rights to the club’s home ground for one year to honor Heimes. true Subscribe to FOX Sports “We’re playing in Johnny’s living room now, which is a motivation in itself,” said Darmstadt captain Aytac Sulu. “We want to stay up again this season and this connection will spur us on even more. Every Darmstadt fan who identifies with us identifies with Johnny too.” One of Darmstadt’s city trolleys will also pay tribute to Heimes, and the club’s kit sponsor, Software AG, pledged to make way for the logo of Heimes’ “You must fight on” initiative for one matchday in March on the anniversary of his death. true Schönes Gefährt!

Authorities received almost 90 reports of psychiatric events in children and adolescents treated with the medication. (Credit: ABC)  Video: Parents want better warnings on common asthma medication Parents are calling for new warning labels on a common asthma tablet that has been linked to cases of suicidal thoughts and depression in children as young as four. (Credit: ABC)  The drug, called Montelukast or Singulair, is prescribed for children aged two to 14 with frequent intermittent, mild persistent or exercise-induced asthma. Melanie (who does not want her surname used) said her six-year-old son Harrison suffered what his doctors called "a psychotic breakdown" after being on Singulair. Melanie said her usually friendly, affectionate child began flying into uncontrollable rages, upending furniture and gnashing his teeth with his face contorted with rage. "He would say I want to go to Heaven and I don't want to be here anymore," she said. "I was incredibly shocked when I realised that a little chewable tablet to control his asthma symptoms could possibly be linked to such severe psychological symptoms." The drug is used by thousands of Australian children with asthma. But figures obtained by the ABC show between January 2000 and March 2016, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) received almost 90 reports of psychiatric events in children and adolescents treated with the medication. Among the adverse events were eight reports of suicidal thoughts and eight reports of depression. 'He wanted to end the pain' Vanessa Sellick's son, also named Harrison, had been taking the drug since he was two years old. She said it changed his behaviour and the problems became worse as he got older. "Harrison was four years old when he started making comments about wanting to die, wishing that he was dead, that he was a piece of garbage – he had terrible self-loathing," Ms Sellick said. His doctors believe he suffered a reaction to the medication. One day he acted on his suicidal thoughts. "It was just devastating at the time," Ms Sellick said. "There's no doubt in my mind that he actually wanted to end it, he wanted to end the pain. I think he was just a little boy in terrible emotional stress." Some patients suffered nightmares, tantrums, sadness Paediatric respiratory physician Adam Jaffe from Sydney Children's Hospital said there was no way of knowing which children might suffer a reaction to the medication. He has taken some of his own patients off the drug because they experienced serious side effects. "Some of my patients complained of nightmares, tantrums, being angry or sad, and the challenge for me and the parents is to figure out whether it's the medication or the child's behaviour," he said. He stressed the majority of patients could take it safely but said some children would suffer the psychiatric side effects. "Obviously it's devastating if you are that one child and that family, so it's very important to highlight that and certainly that's my practice," he said. Professor Jaffe said he suspected some Australian doctors had become complacent about the risks of the drug and needed to be reminded. US authorities take action after death American health authorities have been investigating the safety of Montelukast since 2008. After Cody Miller, 15, took his life after taking the drug for just 17 days, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required manufacturers to put warnings about psychiatric side effects in medical information. In April 2013, Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) published a Medicine Safety Update article on Montelukast to alert health professionals to the risks and the need to warn patients and carers. But both mothers Vanessa Sellick and Melanie said they were not given any warnings by their doctors. "We were very, very surprised to hear that there was research out there to say that Singulair could cause such severe psychological disturbances," Melanie said. Vanessa Sellick added: "The doctor felt that there were no side effects with Singulair and it would be a safer option for us to use." They said parents should not take their children off the drug before consulting their doctor and acknowledged it could be very effective for some asthmatics. However, they want clear warning labels put on boxes of Montelukast so other parents are aware what they might be getting into if their children take the medication. Drug used safely by tens of millions, company says The company behind Singulair, Merck, Sharp and Dohme, told the ABC the drug has been used safely by tens of millions of people around the world. "Consumer medicine information is made available to patients via the TGA website or the MSD website," it said. The company spokesman said pharmacists had a "duty of care to offer and provide consumer medication information to patients". Australian health authorities said prescription medicines did not generally have warning statements on the box or cartons because warnings were detailed in the product information. "There is an expectation that the prescriber explains the risks and benefits to the patient," a TGA spokesperson said. But after being alerted to parents' concerns by the ABC, the TGA is considering publishing a reminder about about the issue on its website and ensuring the information is widely distributed to health professionals. "We continue to monitor this class of medicine, as well as international regulatory activities, to see if updates are needed," the spokesman said. The Asthma Council said patients should not stop taking their medication without consulting their doctor.

She said he began to make comments about having terrible self-loathing, eventually acting on his suicidal thoughts, which Ms Sellick said was 'devastating' at the time.  Paediatric respiratory physician Adam Jaffe from Sydney Children's Hospital said he had taken some patients off the drug after they had side effects.  The drug is reportedly prescribed and used by thousands of children in Australia who have asthma, and has produced side effects including suicidal thoughts, depression and psychotic episodes 'Some of my patients complained of nightmares, tantrums, being angry or sad, and the challenge for me and the parents is to figure out whether it's the medication or the child's behaviour,' he said.    The company who produces the drug, Merck, Sharp and Dohme, said it had been used safely by millions of people around the world and was first made available in Australia in 1998.  'The health and safety of patients who use our medicines is our highest priority. We take any report received about our medicines very seriously,' a spokesman said. 'The decision to prescribe or to discontinue treatment is taken jointly by the doctor and their individual patient, as only they can weigh-up the potential benefits against any potential risks in a given individual case.  'The doctor has a responsibility to keep themselves up-to-date with the effects of that medicine.'  The TGA is now looking at publishing a reminder about the issue on its website and distributing the information to health professionals.  FULL STATEMENT FROM MERCK, SHARP AND DOHME  The health and safety of patients who use our medicines is our highest priority. We take any report received about our medicines very seriously. MSD is confident in the efficacy and safety of SINGULAIR (montelukast). It is a medicine that has been prescribed to tens of millions of patients worldwide with asthma and allergic rhinitis and was first made available in Australia in 1998. The decision to prescribe or to discontinue treatment is taken jointly by the doctor and their individual patient, as only they can weigh-up the potential benefits against any potential risks in a given individual case. The doctor has a responsibility to keep themselves up-to-date with the effects of that medicine. The Product Information (PI) leaflet for doctors and the Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) leaflet for patients are prepared in accordance with TGA regulation. The content is agreed to by MSD and the TGA. Both documents are updated as and when there’s important new information to add. A number of psychiatric disorders were added to the Adverse Effects section in 2007. The CMI is made available to patients via the TGA website or the MSD website. In addition, Pharmacists have a duty of care to offer and to provide a copy of the CMI to patients. Patients and/or their carers can also access the CMIs directly via a weblink which is printed on each medicine box, including that of SINGULAIR (image of box attached). CMIs are updated frequently and making them available via a weblink ensures patients are accessing the most up-to-date version in contrast to an inserted CMI which could be an older version. In Australia, the labeling of a box is regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Order which does not include warning information to be printed on the pack, but instead the warning information is included in the PI and the CMI. MSD is continually monitoring the side-effect profile of our medicines. MSD complies with regulatory requirements and our public duty of care by updating the PI and CMIs accordingly. Please be assured that MSD takes safety very seriously, and the communication of information to prescribers is of paramount importance to us and is highly regulated. We constantly update the information we provide to all healthcare professionals involved in patient care, including hospital doctors, nurses and GPs so they can keep across any changes.

Photograph: Christopher Lee/Uefa via Getty Images Barry Glendenning @bglendenning Monday 5 September 2016 10.54 EDT Last modified on Monday 5 September 2016 10.55 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close PLAY IT, SAM With the rubble of their summer despair behind them, Sunday night marked that point in The Cycle when the obligatory mourning period following England’s most recent calamitous tournament exit ends and the comically misguided hope before the next one flickers into life. Tentative at first, it will gradually reach full throttle as England sweep all before them in qualifying and then … well, y’know. With Mr Roy having been jettisoned and possibly still sitting in a Chantilly media room not really knowing what he’s doing there, Sam Allardyce took charge and introduced swingeing changes by starting only eight of the players who ran around looking so confused against Iceland, when England took their first steps down the road to redemption in Trnava. Having huffed and puffed for more than 90 minutes in much the same fashion as they had against exactly the same opposition a couple of months ago, they finally blew Slovakia’s house down courtesy of the lucky coin a young child had given Sam earlier that day, though Adam Lallana may beg to differ. Sam Allardyce bats away questions over Wayne Rooney’s role in England victory | Dominic Fifield Read more A cursory look at Sam’s CV is enough to tell you he’s no miracle worker so he was always unlikely to transform England’s fortunes in just one game, but it was his post-match comments regarding the apparently undroppable Wayne Rooney that suggested the new boss may not be entirely dissimilar to the old boss, or indeed any of the bosses that have remained so in awe of the once-brilliant player’s fading superpowers. Having been appointed with the brief of telling England’s under-performing players exactly what to do, Sam admitted afterwards that he is in no position to tell England’s underperforming players what to do. “I think [Rooney] holds a lot more experience at international football than I do as an international manager,” he said. “So, when he’s using his experience and playing as a team member, it’s not for me to say where he’s going to play.” Ho and indeed hum. Having assured the ladies and gentlemen of the Fourth Estate in the buildup to the game that Rooney would not be playing in midfield against Slovakia, Sam was at least occasionally vindicated when Rooney dropped from his deep-lying midfield role to play as central defender or sweeper. Furthermore, it is hardly unfair to say that the Big Finger O’ Blame for much of England’s ponderous play could be pointed towards their captain, whose signposted passing towards the flanks did little to inject any of the urgency Sam felt was missing under the old regime. “This is the most decorated outfield player in England,” blabbered Sam, when quizzed on Rooney’s role. “He’s won everything at Manchester United, at [Big Cup] and domestic level.” Of course, so have Davids Beckham and May but nobody’s clamouring for their inclusion. “We aren’t going to make a big deal about it are we?” enquired Sam eventually, suggesting that, unlike Rooney, he still has an awful lot to learn.

QUOTE OF THE DAY “Being a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties. It was something small that I could do and something that I plan to keep doing in the future and hopefully spark some meaningful conversation around it. It’s important to have white people stand in support of people of colour on this. We don’t need to be the leading voice, of course, but standing in support of them is something that’s really powerful” – Megan Rapinoe on kneeling during the national anthem before Seattle Reign’s NWSL game against Chicago Red Stars. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Join AC Jimbo and co for our aural autopsy of the latest action, in Football Weekly. INTERNATIONAL BREAK FIVER LETTER “The optimist in me won’t succumb to cynicism and despair. To someone of a less rosy outlook, ‘the great Premier League loan-player stockpile’ (Friday’s Still Want More?) wherein one team, Chelsea, doles out greater than three entire sides’ worth of players, to teams of their choosing, might sound as much like efforts to use cold hard cash to prevent talent reaching specific teams than hiding individual buys for any other reason. It’s kinda like if a Las Vegas poker dealer allows the player with the most cash to choose their own cards and 38 more cards and then allows them to redeal those cards to players and tables solely of their choosing. It is strange. Someone of a more cynical disposition might even go so far as to aver that with such motives behind the system, there is really no way the loaned out players could possibly be expected (exceptional instances like Romelu Lukaku notwithstanding) to develop properly. But, then again, the optimist in me doesn’t read The Fiver” – Petr Swedock. • Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you’ve nothing better to do you can also tweet The Fiver.

BITS AND BOBS Wee Gordon Strachan is feeling pumped after Scotland overcame nine-man Malta 5-1 in their opening World Cup 2018 qualifier. “After being 1-0 up and playing well and losing a goal, that becomes a big moment,” he tooted. “At that point we see many teams having to deal with the stress of the headlines tomorrow, the pressure of the fans – you see it all in front of you. Can you deal with it? They dealt with it.” Norn Iron 1-0 got off to a decent start, too, drawing 0-0 in the Czech Republic, but only after Filip Novak’s shambolic second-half miss. “We’ve not been beaten,” cheered boss Michael O’Neill. Kosovo’s first-ever World Cup qualifying campaign has been given a lift after Fifa ruled that five key players are eligible to face Finland on Monday evening. “[I] went outside and cried … the relief came out of me,” sighed Samir Ujkani, hours before kick-off. Manchester United will continue to honour Sir Matt Busby’s memory in the Old Trafford directors’ box despite his family being moved out. “The club continues to provide tickets and hospitality for the descendants of Sir Matt but with the passing of his children that hospitality will continue in the Warwick Suite,” read a club statement. The head of refs’ union, Prospect, says he doesn’t know of any officials being asked to lie in post-match reports to the FA, following Mark Halsey’s claims he’d been put under pressure from the PGMOL to falsely say he hadn’t seen controversial incidents. “I cannot recall any official approaching me on [that] basis,” said Alan Leighton. And Bundesliga club Darmstadt have added the name of a fan who died from cancer to their stadium’s official title for this year. The arena will carry the name Jonathan-Heimes-Stadion am Boellenfalltor after technology company Merck gave up its naming rights for the season. “[It is a] unique action that we can only support,” said Darmstadt mayor Jochen Partsch.

(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160902/403790LOGO ) "At the international fairs that we have visited recently we have perceived that there is greater interest from international investors and clusters of companies in coming to find out about projects in Spain and bringing companies  here from abroad, mainly from the US, Europe and Latin America," commented Jordi Martí, president of ASEBIO. Recently has been announced operations involving large pharmaceuticals and specialised international investment funds reflect that Spanish biotechs are matching their international counterparts in terms of scientific developments. As of today, 20 countries have confirmed their presence at Biospain 2016. The organisers also expect the commercial fair to be 40% bigger this year. Biospain is today the 5th largest partnering in biotechnology in the world, with 3.327 one-to-one meetings, +320% more meetings than the first time the partneringONE(R) system (EBD Group) was introduced in 2008. The Biospain Investment Forum aims to attract both national and international investors. The collaboration will be focused around organising a specific parallel programme and social events for the investment community.   Some of the most stand-out subject areas include: a patient forum on rare diseases, multiple sclerosis and the increasingly bigger role played by patient organisations; new diagnostics methods; vaccines; Alzheimer's; food and health; public policies for open innovation; nanobiotechnology; big data; new oncology therapies, and bioeconomy. BioSpain is made up of a commercial fair, a partnering event, an investment forum, a training and employment forum, conferences on a range of issues (with parallel sessions) attended by national and international speakers and a scientific conference which is organised by scientific societies. The event has now become the biggest country-based fair in Europe and the fifth biggest in the world in terms of the number of business development meetings. The last edition, Biospain 2014, hosted 200 exhibitors, more than 850 companies and institutions and over 1.850 delegates from 37 countries. One-to-one business meetings rose to 3.327 (+20%).
