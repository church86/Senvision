Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 March 2017 by Military News What’s in Store for Immune Design (IMDZ) in Q4 Earnings? Shutterstock photo Immune Design Corp IMDZ is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2016 results after the market closes on Mar 7. In the last reported quarter, Immune Design posted a positive surprise of 15.5%. The company reported a wider-than-expected loss in two of the four trailing quarters and a narrower-than-expected loss on the two other occasions, bringing the positive average surprise to 1.0%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Immune Design’s shares have underperformed the Medical-Drugs industry in the past one year. The stock crashed 54.9% during this period, compared to the industry’s gain of 6.4%. Factors in Play Being a development-stage biopharmaceutical company, Immune Design has not generated any product revenues yet. The company earns revenues from collaboration and licensing agreements and product sales. Investors remain focussed on the company’s progress with its pipeline candidates. Immune Design is developing multiple candidates using its two discovery platforms – ZVex and GLAAS – for the treatment of various types of cancers. Key pipeline candidates include CMB305 (solid tumor) and G100 (merkel cell carcinoma). CMB305 is currently undergoing an expansion study as a single agent in patients diagnosed with cancers expressing the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen. In addition, a randomized phase II study on CMB305, in combination with Roche Holding’s RHHBY Tecentriq in comparison with Tecentriq alone, for locally advanced, relapsed or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma is currently underway. Enrollment in this study is ongoing and the data is expected in 2017. The company completed enrollment in a phase I single agent trial on LV305 in 24 patients with advanced or metastatic sarcoma expressing NY-ESO-1.  Meanwhile, an additional division of this trial has been designed to evaluate the use of LV305 with Merck’s MRK anti-PD-1 agent, Keytruda in patients with melanoma who have an inadequate response to anti-PD1 therapy. The company has also completed enrollment in its phase I trial on G100, in combination with radiation, in patients with merkel cell carcinoma.  The FDA recently granted orphan drug designation to G100, for the treatment of follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Meanwhile, Immune Design is also evaluating G100 in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 agent Keytruda, for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The safety and efficacy of G100 in combination with low-dose local radiation and Keytruda, in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is being evaluated in a randomized phase II study with the ongoing enrollment. Data is expected later in 2017. Due to numerous ongoing trials, operating expenses are expected to remain high in the quarter. We expect the company to shed light on its progress with these trials during the earnings call. What Our Model Indicates Our proven model does not conclusively show that Immune Design is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below. Zacks ESP : The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 57 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter . Zacks Rank : Although Immune’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Immune Design Corp. Price and EPS Surprise Immune Design Corp. Price and EPS Surprise | Immune Design Corp. Quote Stocks to Consider Here is one healthcare company that you may consider instead, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter. Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. SPPI has an Earnings ESP of 15.4% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to release results on Mar 8.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 March 2017 by Military News Merck continues to empower Kenyan women through ‘Merck More than a Mother’ and ‘Merck STEM for Women and Girls’ programs Merck continues to empower Kenyan women through ‘Merck More than a Mother’ and ‘Merck STEM for Women and Girls’ programs Merck will inaugurate their initiative at OLYMYPIC School where they equipped their library with a Computer Lab to encourage young girls to study science and technology as part of their ‘STEM for Girls and Women’ program in Africa NAIROBI, Kenya, March 3, 2017/APO/ — ‘Merck More than a Mother’ supports infertile women through access to information, health and change of mindset. ‘Merck STEM Program for Women and Girls’ starts today in Kenya. Merck inaugurates ‘OLYMPIC School’ where they equipped the library with a computer lab as part of their program ‘STEM for Women and Girls’ in Africa. Merck (www.MerckGroup.com), a leading science and technology company, today announces their commitment to empower Kenyan women through their ‘Merck More than a Mother’ and the start of ‘Merck STEM for Women and Girls’ programs. Speaking at the event in Nairobi, Belén Garijo, Member of Executive Board and CEO of Merck Healthcare emphasized: “I believe in women empowerment and especially childless women – they are mistreated and discriminated in many cultures for being unable to have children and start a family. Empowering these women through access to information, health, and change of mind set to remove the stigma of infertility is needed. Through ‘Merck More than a Mother’ we are supporting this strong message together with our partners and we will continue our commitment to improve access to regulated and effective fertility care in Africa.” The day’s program also included a courtesy visit to Kenya’s First Lady H.E. Margaret Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi by the Merck delegation to brief her on the two programs and to explore possible areas of collaboration. The delegation consisted of H.E. Madame Brigitte Touadera, First Lady, Central African Republic; Belen Garijo, CEO, Merck Healthcare; Virginie Baiokua, Minister of Social Affairs and National Reconciliation, Central African Republic; Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare; Leonard Saika, Director – Regional Head of Social Responsibility & Market Development – Africa, Merck and Lina Ekomo, Central African Republic. Madame Brigitte Touadera, the First Lady of the Central African Republic (CAR) emphasized: “I am very happy to participate in today’s event of ‘Merck More than a Mother’ in Kenya as it follows the one we had for the Central African Republic (CAR) last month. As the champion for the initiative in CAR and for Francophone Africa, I acknowledge the role that ‘Merck More than a Mother’ is playing to break the stigma around infertile women and to raise awareness about infertility prevention, male infertility and the necessity of a team approach to family building among couples which is very critical for Africa.” “It is very important to empower infertile women through improving access to awareness and fertility care so they can bear children as part of their human rights. In case they can no longer be treated, ‘Empowering Berna’ project will contribute towards empowering and training them to establish their own small business so that they can be independent and re-build their lives – a woman is more than a mother, ‘Empowering Berna’ initiative will prove this every day,” Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer  Merck  emphasized. In 2016, over 1,000 infertile women in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Liberia, Ghana, Central African Republic and Cote d’Ivoire who can no longer be treated have been empowered socially and economically to lead independent and happier lives through the ‘Empowering Berna’ project. Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Health, Cleopa Mailu stated: “As a ministry we are happy with the strategic partnership we have with Merck in Kenya through its Merck Capacity Advancement Program initiatives which are boosting our healthcare capacity with special focus on diabetes, cancer and infertility which contribute to the country’s economic progression”. “In recognition of the important role women can play in the economic and social development of Africa, Merck is empowering them o participate in STEM where they are currently under-represented, through the ‘Merck STEM Program’ which we are launching today,” Garijo said. Merck will inaugurate their initiative at OLYMYPIC School where they equipped their library with a Computer Lab to encourage young girls to study science and technology as part of their ‘STEM for Girls and Women’ program in Africa. Furthermore, the winners of UNESCO-MARS awards will act as ambassadors in their respective countries. The Governor of Nairobi County, Evans Kidero announced during his keynote speech: “We are happy to partner with reputable and innovative companies such as Merck. We believe that the only way to effectively tackle the health and research related challenges we are facing can only be through establishing Public Private Partnership models in implementing successful programs. The size and complexity of the task is so large that no single organization or institution can manage on its own, so integration of efforts is necessary to achieve the health gains that our nation deserves”. “The Merck STEM Program will encourage our young women and girls to undertake science and technology related courses and make active contribution to the social and economic development of our country”, Kidero added. “Through this program Merck is targeting to empower over 7,000 girls and 60 women researchers across Africa in 2017 through various initiatives which include setting up computer libraries in schools similar to the one we are launching today for the first time in Kenya at Olympic School in Kibera, Nairobi, and appointing the UNESCO-MARS research award winners as ambassadors for the ‘Merck STEM Program’ ” Rasha Kelej added. About ‘Merck STEM for Girls and Women’: “The program started UNESCO-Merck Africa Research Summit (UNESCO-MARS) as its first initiative that has been held annually since 2015. UNESCO-MARS aims to build research capacity and empower young African researchers with special focus on empowering women in the fields of  research and healthcare to raise the level of scientific research in Africa and improve access to health solutions in the continent,” explained Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare. During the 2016 UNESCO-MARS, the ‘Best African Women Researchers Awards’ were launched for the first time with the aim of promoting women in STEM that saw five women researchers from across Africa recognized for the quality of their research. The first award went to Beatrice Nyagol from Kenya Medical Research Institute, who was also celebrated during the event in Nairobi. During the event, a high level panel discussion by fertility experts and policy makers called for action to break the stigma around infertile women; raising awareness about infertility prevention and management; defining policies to regulate ART; improving access to cost effective fertility care by integrating it into public reproductive health services and building fertility care capacity and providing training to African embryologists. The high level panel included: Sarah Opendi, Minister of State of Health, Uganda;  Zuliatu Cooper, Deputy Minister of Health and Sanitation, Sierra Leone; Virginie Baikoua, Minister of Social Affairs and National Reconciliation, CAR; Joyce Lay, Member of Parliament, Kenya; Oladapo Ashiru, President of Africa Fertility Society; Joe Simpson, Past President, International Federation of Fertility Societies; Paul Le Roux, President of Southern African Society of Reproductive Medicine and Gynaecological Endoscopy; Kamini Rao, Chair International Institute for Training & Research in Reproductive Health, India; Mohamed Kamal, President of Future Assured Foundation, Nigeria and Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare.  In addition to Kenya, ‘Merck More than a Mother’ is already being implemented in Uganda, Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia, Tanzania, Nigeria, Cote D’Ivoire and CAR. During the event Merck also highlighted other CAP initiatives in Kenya: ‘Merck Cancer Access Program’ which aims to increase the number of qualified oncologists through ‘Merck Africa Oncology Fellowship Program’ in partnership with the University of Nairobi, Kenya and Tata Memorial Hospital in India. Furthermore, Merck aims to support women cancer survivors to establish their own small business so that they can lead an independent and productive life through ‘Merck More than a Patient’ initiative. ‘Merck Diabetes and Hypertension Awards’ with the aim to building a platform of diabetes and hypertension experts across the globe through a one year online diabetes and cardiovascular medicine diploma at University of South Wales, United Kingdom.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Editorials Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Editorials Mon, Mar 06, 2017 - Page 7　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Drugmakers abandon caution in search for Alzheimer’s therapy Drugmakers are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into lengthy clinical tests in a bid to find a cure and tap a market worth US$30 billion in the US alone By Naomi Kresge and Doni Bloomfield  /  Bloomberg Alzheimer’s disease is upending the rules of drug discovery, with a handful of companies abandoning caution to keep pursuing an elusive hypothesis because the potential payoff is so great. Even the merely forgetful, whose lives have yet to be derailed by the disease, have become candidates for clinical tests. Scanning the brain for telltale signs of Alzheimer’s earlier — and ratcheting up drug dosage — might help turn failures into breakthroughs, AC Immune SA chief executive officer Andrea Pfeifer said. The Swiss company’s partner on its experimental drug, pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG, last week said it would embark on a second advanced test, undeterred by a failed intermediate trial. Pfeifer’s optimism is a case study of the industry’s unusually high risk tolerance on Alzheimer’s, where more than 100 experimental drugs have already failed — with two recent setbacks from Merck & Co and Eli Lilly & Co. Like Roche and its partner, Biogen Inc is chipping away at the same target that has eluded rivals. Merck and Lilly have opted to keep testing their medicines in patients showing only hints of the degenerative disease. Each advanced trial can cost hundreds of millions of US dollars, according to Lilly. “It’s always a question — are you throwing good money after bad?” Zurich-based Rahn & Bodmer Co fund manager Birgit Kulhoff said. “If you were to be successful, it would be an extremely big market.” Drugs that halt the progress of Alzheimer’s disease could be a market worth as much as US$30 billion in the US alone, Sanford C Bernstein & Co analysts estimate. Cancer is the only other disease for which companies are this willing to look deep into a failed study for a positive trend to chase, Kulhoff said, adding that Alzheimer’s tests are probably more expensive because researchers follow patients for longer and monitor them closely. The drugmakers would not disclose how much they have spent on clinical tests. A final-stage trial in Alzheimer’s disease can cost more than US$200 million, Cowen & Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. Such a study in a cancer like melanoma would tend to be much smaller and could cost about US$50 million to US$100 million, he said. Just arranging and administering the brain scans needed to make sure people have signs of the disease cost about US$15,000 to US$20,000 per person in a small test, AC Immune said. Roche made its cost-benefit calculation two-and-a-half years ago. Crenezumab, the medicine it is working on with AC Immune, had failed to help patients think more clearly or retrieve memories in a mid-stage trial, a hurdle potential drugs usually must clear before they go into the last, largest and most expensive stage of clinical studies. Instead of abandoning the compound, Roche looked at a trend toward benefit in the least sick patients and spent the next two years figuring out how high it could safely ratchet up the dose. Then last year, it started another 750-patient study, with results expected in 2021. Now it is embarking on a separate trial, also with 750 patients with a very mild form of the disease. It is unclear how that test is to differ from the first one. It is also trying a higher dose for another Alzheimer’s compound, gantenerumab, after a late-stage trial failure. Both Roche drugs are aimed at protein pieces called beta amyloid that clump together in the brain and are thought to play a role in triggering the disease. Trouble is, so did the Lilly medicine that failed a test in patients last year. Last month’s unsuccessful trial from Merck also centered on beta amyloid as a target, although the type of medicine was thought to prevent the substance from forming.

Now an executive says the company can’t cut the product’s price because middlemen who manage drug benefits would refuse to cover it. “If we just lowered the cost of Sovaldi from $85,000 to $50,000, every payer would rip up our contract,” said Jim Meyers, executive vice president of worldwide commercial operations, in an interview with Bloomberg News.  Pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts Holding Co. and CVS Health Corp. negotiate drug reimbursement, often in secrecy, for employers and health plans. While PBMs say they deliver lower prices for customers and patients, drugmakers have begun aggressively implicating the middlemen in high medication costs that have become a frequent target of Washington lawmakers and President Donald Trump.  One of the functions of PBMs is to help insurers decide which drugs to cover for their customers, and how much to reimburse manufacturers. Manufacturers use rebates to ensure they get on PBMs’ lists of covered drugs, called formularies, and the middlemen often take a cut of those rebates, often about 10 percent, for themselves before passing the rest of the savings to the insurers. Now, pharmaceutical companies are charging that PBMs prefer higher list prices, because the middlemen want to sustain their own revenues. “I have never met, in this entire experience, a PBM or a payer outside of the Medicaid segment that preferred a price of $50,000 over $75,000 and a rebate back to them,” Meyers said in the interview. Declining Share Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said PBMs are needed “because employers and health plans want to have some way to push back against drugmakers who continually raise their prices." Drugmakers sponsored a study released in January finding manufacturers of branded drugs are getting a declining share of total U.S. spending on their products, in part because of an increase in secret rebates paid to middlemen including PBMs. Gilead’s Sovaldi shocked the health-care system after it was approved in December 2013. Priced at $84,000 for a three-month regimen, or $1,000 a pill, it was slammed by payers, politicians and the public. At the time, the Foster City, California-based company hunkered down and tried to deflect the scrutiny. Now it’s time for the PBMs to get their turn in the spotlight, Meyers said. “We have a system that’s incentivized upon rebate revenue,” he said, adding that Merck & Co.’s experience with its Zepatier, a rival drug to Sovaldi and Gilead’s successor drug Harvoni, that entered the market in 2016 at a lower list price, highlights the PBMs’ economic incentives. “You would have predicted there would be tremendous uptake, but their share has been capped” because PBMs were not satisfied with the amount of rebate they received, he said. What Raises Prices? Robert McMahon, Merck’s president of the U.S. market, said the list price of Zepatier “affords Merck the opportunity to compete across all patient segments and potentially broadens access for underserved patient populations” and that the company was pleased with the drug’s progress. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Hepatitis C drug prices came down because of Express Scripts’ efforts, Henry said. Gilead offered minimal rebates on Sovaldi when it first came out and had little competition, he said. Its discounts only increased markedly after Express Scripts refused to cover its Harvoni drug at one point in favor of a competitor. Merck’s lower traction was more likely because it was the third to market, Henry said. “Rebates don’t raise drug prices, drugmakers raise drug prices,” he said in an email. CVS spokeswoman Christine Cramer echoed his statement, saying, “Pharmaceutical companies alone are responsible for the high prices they set in the marketplace, which have increased many multiples above inflation in recent years.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Be aware that steroids may have been prescribed preferentially to healthier individuals, which may not have been fully accounted for in the statistical adjustments. Low-dose glucocorticoids appear to be safe over the long term for early active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), French researchers reported in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases. However, the products should be used with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and for the shortest duration at the lowest possible amounts. A 7-year analysis of a cohort from the French Etude et Suivi des Polyarthrites Indifferenciees Recentes (ESPOIR) showed no significant difference in major safety events between early RA patients with and without low-dose glucocorticoid treatment. About 10% of patients were affected in each group. These results support the good safety profile of low-dose glucocorticoid therapy for early RA, wrote Bernard Combe, MD, PhD, Director of the Research Center in the Department of Rheumatology of Montpellier University, and colleagues. "To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study specifically designed to assess (among other data) glucocorticoid adverse effects and to report the long-term tolerability profile of glucocorticoid use in early RA." Although glucocorticoid therapy is widely used in early RA, the risk-benefit balance has had little evidence base to date, with most data coming from observational studies and scant evidence from randomized clinical trials, the team noted. In a 2016 systematic review of recent literature published in Arthritis Care & Research, researchers at Charite University Hospital in Berlin noted that there was a general consensus about the usefulness of glucocorticoids in the short term, but insufficient evidence to provide guidance about their safety in the long term. The ESPOIR cohort offered an unusual opportunity to examine the long-term tolerability of glucocorticoid in very early RA in real-life scenarios. The study included patients with early arthritis from 14 French rheumatology centers enrolled in ESPOIR from 2002 to 2005, with the database locked in 2013 at the 7-year point. Patients had inflammatory arthritis in at least two swollen joints lasting from 6 weeks to 6 months with the potential to develop into RA, and had not received either DMARDs or glucocorticoid therapy. The researchers classified the 602 patients with early RA (79% women, mean age of 48±12) into two groups: those who received glucocorticoid treatment at least once after recruitment (n=386), and those who did not (n=216). Both groups were followed for an average of 5.98±1.84 years. Most of the patients (68.1%) in the glucocorticoid group started treatment during the first 6 months. The group received mainly low-dose prednisone at a mean dose of 3.1±2.9 mg/day, median of 2.4 mg/day (IQR 0.7-5) during follow-up. Active disease was greater in this group, with significantly higher DAS28 CRP levels and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores. Because of this, these patients also used more DMARDs, biological agents, and NSAIDs than the non-treatment group. The treatment group included patients who had received systemic glucocorticoids orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously. The mean duration of total glucocorticoid treatment was 1,057±876 days, median 803 days (IQR 267-1829). The non-treatment group included patients who received no steroid treatment or only non-systemic therapy such as intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids or inhaled glucocorticoids. Excluded in the study were patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, severe infection, or fracture, since they were thought to be less likely to receive glucocorticoid prescriptions and more likely to be at risk for glucocorticoids' side effects. The primary outcome was a composite of new-onset events, including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, angina pectoris, stroke, and heart failure), severe infection that required hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics, and fracture. Among 65 events that were reported in both groups (7 deaths, 14 cardiovascular diseases, 19 severe infections, and 25 fractures), 44 (11.4%) occurred in patients with glucocorticoids and 21 (9.7%) occurred in patients without the treatment. Deaths were caused by cancer or malignant blood diseases in four patients, salmonellosis and ruptured aortic aneurysm in one patient each, and an unknown cause in another. Infections were more frequent in patients who received glucocorticoids, but not significantly more frequently. Using weighted Cox proportional-hazards analysis and propensity score to reduce bias, the researchers found that the composite outcome for patients did not differ with or without glucocorticoids (HR 0.889, 95% CI 0.620-1.273, P=0.520). "These data support the good safety profile of very low-dose glucocorticoid therapy in early RA," Combe and colleagues wrote. "Although our findings need further confirmation, they strongly support the current recommendations that glucocorticoids should be used for early RA, with DMARDs, for the shortest period and at the lowest possible dose." Because the study used an observational cohort, the limitations included possible unknown confounders and the potential bias inherent in self-reported data, the researchers said. By using a composite endpoint, they might have emphasized each patient's first outcome. The relatively small number of adverse events also might have limited the study's power, the team noted. Funding for the study was provided by the French Society of Rheumatology. The ESPOIR (Etude et Suivi des Polyarthrites Indifferenciees Recentes) cohort was supported by a grant from Merck Sharp and Dohme for the first 5 years and also received funds from the French Society of Rheumatology, AbbVie, Pfizer, and Roche Chugai. Part of the biological database was supported by additional grants from INSERM (Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale). The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.
