FACEBOOKEMAILDRUCKEN Kommentare Kommentar schreiben Top Themen Heute Tesla - ein Übernahmekandidat? Diese Unternehmen könnten Interesse habenAnleger aufgepasst! Was Fonds-Anteilen nach Silvester drohtWarum die Apple-Aktie besonders unter Präsident Trump leidet Der überraschende Sieg von Donald Trump bei der Wahl zum US-Präsidenten hatte zur Wochenmitte wie zu vermuten zunächst zu einer extremen “Risk-off”-Bewegung an den globalen Finanzmärkten geführt. Doch stellte sich die anfängliche Panikreaktion als erstaunlich kurzlebig heraus. Der deutsche Aktienmarkt konnte sich nach einer deutlichen Abwärtslücke zur Eröffnung dynamisch erholen und beendete den Handelstag dann sogar mit deutlichen Zugewinnen. Der DAX schloss 1,56 Prozent höher bei 10.646 Punkten. Das Tief hatte der Leitindex bei 10.175 Punkten markiert. MDAX und TecDAX verbesserten sich um 0,23 beziehungsweise 1,18 Prozent. Unter den 110 größten Aktien gab es 75 Gewinner und 35 Verlierer. Das Aufwärtsvolumen lag bei 67 Prozent. Das Gesamtvolumen war extrem hoch. Im DAX wurden 173,8 Millionen Aktien im Wert von 6,47 Milliarden EUR (5-Tages-Durchschnitt: 2,92) umgesetzt. Am deutlichsten stiegen die Aktien aus den Bereichen Pharma + Healthcare sowie Bauwerte. Versorger und Immobilienwerte wurden hingegen gemieden. Als stärkster DAX-Wert haussierte Fresenius SE um 7,10 Prozent. Bayer verteuerte sich um 5,16 Prozent. Merck schloss 4,86 Prozent fester. Volkswagen büßte am Indexende 2,06 Prozent ein. Beiersdorf und Vonovia verloren 1,36 beziehungsweise 1,30 Prozent. An der Wall Street legte der Dow Jones Industrial um 1,40 Prozent auf 18.590 Punkte zu. Der von Technologiewerten geprägte Nasdaq 100 verbesserte sich um 0,42 Prozent auf 4.825 Punkte. 54 Prozent der Werte an der NYSE verzeichneten Zugewinne. 202 neue 52-Wochen-Hochs standen 119 neuen Tiefs gegenüber. Mit Blick auf die Sektorenperformance lagen Finanzwerte und Werte aus dem Gesundheitsbereich ganz vorne. Die größten Verlierer waren Versorger und Immobilienwerte. Um 7,69 Prozent sprang die Aktie von Caterpillar und setzte sich damit die Dow-Spitze. Dahinter folgten Pfizer (+7,06%) und Merck (+6,06%). Am anderen Indexende verloren die multinational agierenden Konzerne Procter & Gamble und Coca-Cola 1,74 respektive 1,42 Prozent. Auch am Währungsmarkt folgte einer anfänglichen Flucht in die sicheren Häfen eine beeindruckende Umkehrbewegung hin zu mehr Risikofreude. Der Dollar-Index notierte gegen Ende des New Yorker Handels mit 0,53 Prozent im Plus bei 98,48 Punkten. Im asiatischen Handel war er auf ein 5-Wochen-Tief bei 95,88 Punkten eingebrochen. Der Euro wertete gegenüber allen anderen Hauptwährungen mit Ausnahme des Austral-Dollars ab. EUR/USD fiel um 0,77 Prozent auf ein 2-Wochen-Tief bei 1,0941 USD. In der Spitze hatte das Währungspaar ein 2-Monats-Hoch bei 1,1300 USD markiert. Mit Blick auf die anderen Majors fielen das Pfund Sterling mit Stärke und der Austral-Dollar mit Schwäche auf. Trotz des am Ende des Tages festeren US-Dollars verteuerten sich die meisten Rohstoffe. Der S&P GSCI für 24 Spotpreise schloss 0,55 Prozent höher bei 356,58 Punkten. Ein etwas stärker als erwarteter Aufbau der Rohöllagerbestände in den USA belastete am Nachmittag nur kurzzeitig. Brent-Öl notierte gegen Ende des New Yorker Handels 0,93 Prozent höher bei 46,47 USD. Die US-Sorte WTI stieg um 0,67 Prozent auf 45,28 USD. Beide Sorten hatten am Morgen mit der allgemeinen “Risk-off”-Bewegung an den Märkten noch deutliche Abschläge gezeigt und neue Korrektur-Tiefs markiert. Der Preis für US-Erdgas stieg um 2,92 Prozent auf 2,71 USD. Kupfer haussierte an der Comex um 3,53 Prozent auf ein 14-Monats-Hoch bei 2,46 USD und bestätigte damit das Ausbruchssignal des Vortages. Gold war am Morgen als sicherer Hafen noch um rund 5 Prozent über 1.330 USD nach oben gesprungen, notierte jedoch am Abend knapp im Minus bei 1.273 USD (1.171 EUR). Platin verlor 0,75 Prozent. Silber und Palladium konnten um 0,10 beziehungsweise 1,98 Prozent zulegen. Auch am Rentenmarkt kam es zu extremen Kursausschlägen in beide Richtungen. Die Umlaufrendite stieg um zwei Basispunkte auf 0,00 Prozent. Die Rendite zehnjähriger Bundesanleihen war am Morgen auf ein Tief bei 0,09 Prozent gefallen. Die anschließende Rückkehr der Risikofreude beförderte sie am Ende um zwei Basispunkte nach oben auf 0,21 Prozent. Dies war der höchste Tagesschluss in 6 Monaten. Der Euro-Bund-Future schloss 0,53 Prozent niedriger bei 160,94 Punkten, einem neuen Kontrakt-Tief. Am Morgen war er noch mit der Flucht in die sicheren Häfen auf ein 2-Wochen-Hoch bei 163,19 Punkten geklettert. Die Rendite zehnjähriger US-Treasury Notes stieg um 19 Basispunkte beziehungsweise 10 Prozent auf ein 10-Monats-Hoch bei 2,07 Prozent. Die asiatischen Aktienmärkte tendierten heute früh auf breiter Front kräftig nordwärts. Der MSCI Asia Pacific Index sprang um 3,17 Prozent auf 137,67 Punkte. Für den Nikkei 225 ging es als regionalen Spitzenreiter um rund 6,6 Prozent nach oben. Schwache japanische Core-Machinery-Orders im September (-3,3%) wirkten sich nicht auf das Kursgeschehen aus. Heute richtet sich der Blick auf eine Flut an Quartalszahlen. Es berichten unter anderem Deutsche Telekom, Siemens, Continental, Unicredit, Enel, Engie, Astrazeneca, Generali, K+S, TAG Immobilien, Aareal Bank, Lanxess, Hannover Rück, Bilfinger, Evotec, SMA Solar, Stada, Salzgitter, Nordex, Puma, Zalando, Hamborner Reit, Ströer, GFT Technologies, Jenoptik, RTL Group, Cancom, Dürr, SGL Carbon, Hamburger Hafen und Logistik, SLM Solutions Group, Wacker Neuson, König & Bauer und Ferratum Oyi.

These top vendors, namely Zoetis, Inc., Merck & Co., Sanofi-Aventis, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Eli Lilly and Company hold commanding positions owing to their wide geographic presence and a strong financial backing allowing increased focus on research and development activities. Top companies in the market aim to strengthen their positions with strategies such as targeted in-licensing, acquisition, and innovative marketing. Use of the digital medium to reach out to an extended consumer base and serve the consumer more effectively has also started becoming a popular strategy. An instance is the recent update made to Bayer's BCS cowdition smartphone application in July 2016. The enhanced application is expected to help veterinarians to track the current and future hurdles regarding cattle health, which will help minimize the impact of metabolic diseases on dairy cows. Download PDF Brochure of Research Report - http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=16682 Transparency Market Research estimates that the global clostridium vaccines market will exhibit a healthy 4.9% CAGR over the period between 2016 and 2024. Rising at this rate, the market, which valued at US$418.0 mn in 2015, is expected to reach US$643.5 mn by 2024. In terms of animal species, the swine segment presently leads but is expected to be outpaced by the growth of the ovine segment. In terms of geography, the global market is dominated by North America, which accounted for over 37% of the global market in 2015. Rising Intervention by Government Bodies to Play Key Role in Market Development  Government initiatives play a key role the development of animal health care markets. For instance, the China market for veterinary healthcare is chiefly driven by compulsory immunization policy, several animal health awareness programs, the easy availability of affordable veterinary vaccines, and fund for research and development in the field. In several other developed as well as developing economies, funds invested by government bodies for the research and development of veterinary vaccines and medications play a key role in boosting the demand for clostridium vaccines. Along with this, the rising global demand for animal products such as cattle milk, meat, and eggs is also a key factor driving the global market for clostridium vaccines. Animal products such as milk, pork, beef, and chicken collectively account for nearly 40% of global agricultural GDP and generated revenues valuing nearly US$600 bn in 2015. The market for these products in developing countries is growing rapidly due to the rising population and increased disposable incomes. The resultant rise in awareness regarding the need for maintaining the excellent health of animals is expected to further drive the clostridium vaccines market in the near future. Get Discounts on Report Purchase: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=D&rep_id=16682     High Consumer Dependence on Government Distribution Channels to Hamper Growth  In emerging economies, especially, government bodies play the central role in the distribution of vaccines. The Government of India, for instance, buys clostridium vaccines in bulk from manufacturers and supply them in different regions of the country. Bulk purchase of clostridium vaccines results in reduced prices, resulting in the low profitability of the market thus hampering its overall rate of development. Moreover, the market's growth is also restrained to vast extent owing to the short exclusivity span of clostridium vaccines. Product exclusivity period in the animal health care industry is mostly only about three years to five years. Shorter exclusivity periods lead to a vast rise in competition from generics and over-the-counter (OTC) products. The increase in generic competition lowers product sales and significantly affects the profitability of the market. This review of the market is based on a recent market research report published by Transparency Market Research, titled "Clostridium Vaccine (Animal Health) Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2016 - 2024."

2016 /PRNewswire/ -- With more than five million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and more than 10 million caring for someone with Alzheimer's, nearly everyone knows someone affected by this irreversible, heartbreaking disease. During National Alzheimer's Awareness Month and National Family Caregivers Month, Dr. Juebin Huang, MD, PhD and Assistant Professor of Neurology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, provides guidance for those caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease on MerckManuals.com. Some of the insights Dr. Huang outlined in his article include: Understand the difference between dementia and Alzheimer's Distinguishing Alzheimer's disease from the varied effects of aging and related conditions remains challenging for patients and their families. Dementia is not a specific disease. Dementia is a term used to describe any slow, progressive decline in mental function, like memory or language, which is significant enough to disrupt an individual's daily activities. Although Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, there are many other causes of dementia that a physician will consider. Be mindful of warning signs In older adults, it's not always easy to figure out which changes in memory and personality are parts of the natural aging process and which are signs of a more serious issue. While family members most commonly point to signs of forgetfulness in aging loved ones, doctors considering an Alzheimer's diagnosis will also look for other warning signs, including: A decline in carrying out daily functions like balancing a checkbook A lack of interest in hobbies Reluctance to leave the house Difficulty keeping up with conversations. Monitor progression Caregivers are often the first to notice warning signs and may be the ones to push for the first doctor visit. However, these issues typically develop very slowly and are very subtle at first. It's common for individuals to not remember exactly when they started experiencing symptoms. It can be years before a person seeks medical treatment, which makes establishing a timeline and predicting the progression difficult for doctors. Once treatment has begun, caregivers can be more accurate and objective in describing symptoms to doctors. Help loved ones maintain their normal daily functions Caregivers play a crucial role in helping patients maintain their day-to-day lives. Maintaining household chores, social interactions, and physical activities are especially important.  In the relatively early stages of Alzheimer's disease, caregivers should encourage their loved ones to continue regular activities, while also monitoring to ensure these activities don't become dangerous to the affected person or to others. Make sure you're cared for There may come a time when an Alzheimer's patient begins to challenge the caregiver and stops following instructions. As the person's behavior changes, caregivers must constantly shift their strategies and expectations. This is no easy feat. When a person with Alzheimer's disease is especially upset or confused, often the best approach is to relent enough to let the person calm down, then redirect the behavior later. It's important to remember that the person's condition is clouding their true intentions. The physical and emotional impact of caring for a loved one who is struggling with Alzheimer's disease can be overwhelming. Many doctors' offices have social workers available to talk to caregivers and direct them to additional resources and support. Resources are also available online, like the services offered by the Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's Disease International and Alzheimer's Foundation of America.

About the Author Milad Nourmohammadi is an associate data analyst for Morningstar. Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 started the morning in the green and are on track for their best week of the year, though increased volatility in prices may change their direction throughout the day. The Dow surged to a new all-time intraday record soon after the markets opened, while the S&P has made strides of its own and looks to close in on its record with financials and bank stocks leading the way. Copper prices are also making leaps, as investors are now expecting a sharp increase in infrastructure projects under Trump. Thursday marked the strongest gain for copper in more than a year. Industrial metals will continue to jump in price under market expectations that there will be an imminent advance in infrastructure improvement within the country.   Stocks on the Move Pharmaceutical companies have experienced gains since Trump's election.  Pfizer  , along with its rival  Merck  , opened Thursday in the green again. While drugmakers would have likely stumbled under a Hillary Clinton administration, Trump has made it clear that his healthcare policy will lead to less regulations on drug prices.   Despite missing third-quarter analysts' projections,  Macy's  shares are up on Thursday. After an initial drop in premarket trading, shares of the company are trading in the green as the department store chain reaffirmed investors of its full-year earnings per share guidance and expects to see an increase in sales on owned and licensed items. Macy's appears to be continuing its plan of selling stores in an effort to drive more profitable growth--a factor likely to drive the company's shares even higher. Foreign Markets Asian shares rose higher on Thursday, as investors overseas had some time to digest a Trump presidency. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose sharply and finished Thursday up 6.72%, its biggest single-day gain since Feb. 15.    Japanese stocks leaped in part because of Trump's planned initiatives on infrastructure spending, which could benefit local infrastructure and industrial companies. China also saw its major indexes rise as the Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index finished Thursday's trading session up 1.37% and 1.89%, respectively. European share markets are following in similar fashion with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index looking to close out Thursday in the green for a fourth-straight session. The newfound opinions and assessments of Trump from global investors are certainly changing market outlooks. The German DAX 30 Index leaped on Thursday and is on pace for its highest close since December 2015.

The biggest problem is that he has not fleshed out the slogans, threats and vague promises made during his campaign. Winners The pharmaceutical industry should be happy Hillary Clinton is not heading for the White House given that she had promised to crack down on what she called “excessive price increases”. The shares of firms like Pfizer and Merck rallied in relief. Tech firms like Apple, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet have kept billions of dollars of profits out of the US rather than pay the current 39 percent corporation tax. Trump has proposed a one-off 10 percent rate for repatriated cash. Fossil fuel firms could benefit given the president elect has said global warming is “a hoax”. So might mining companies, steel manufacturers and builders from his infrastructure spending promises. Losers The likely losers include renewable energy companies as the Trump victory threatens to reverse US energy and environmental priorities. He has also pledged to pull the US out of the Paris agreement to cut emissions and fight climate changes. Share of Danish firm Vestas, the world’s second-largest wind turbine producer, fell along with those of Spain’s Gamesa and Germany company Siemens. US carmakers who have plants in Mexico to take advantage of lower labour costs would lose out from Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on vehicles shipped north. Toyota, Nissan and Volkswagen would also be hit as they too have factories south of the border. Oil drillers. Gas pipelines. Coal. The defense industry. These are the likely winners of a Trump administration. https://t.co/Zd7lay5sYX— nzherald Business (@nzheraldbiz) November 10, 2016 Read my FX op-ed FX Winners & Losers after a Trump victory on CNBC https://t.co/CbNJz5rHNb .CNBC</a> .<a href="https://twitter.com/business">business GlobalFX</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fx?src=hash">#fx</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fxtrading?src=hash">#fxtrading</a></p>&mdash; Keith Underwood (Underwood_FX) November 9, 2016 Share this article: More about: Business Google Donald Trump Elections USA presidential elections 2016 All views Get a different perspective Every story can be told in many ways: see the perspectives from Euronews journalists in our other language teams.

Keris Alison Lahiff Nov 10, 2016 11:52 AM EST Wall Street ran at two speeds with the Dow Jones Industrial Average setting a record high earlier in the day while the Nasdaq plummeted into the red. Markets continued to trade erratically following Tuesday's election results. Pharmaceutical stocks including Merck  ( MRK) and Pfizer  ( PFE) were in rally mode after Democrats failed to secure the presidency and Republicans maintained control of the House and Senate. Democrats would likely have reined in rampant price gouging from pharmaceutical companies. Mylan  ( MYL) joined in on health care gains despite falling short of third-quarter earnings and sales estimates. The drugmaker swung to a loss in its recent quarter, largely tied to a multi-million dollar settlement with the DoJ. Shake Shack ( SHAK) jumped after lifting its full-year sales outlook. The burger chain also reported a more-than 40% increase in third-quarter revenue and nearly 3% increase in same-store sales. TheStreet's Keris Lahiff reports from Wall Street.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ben Guarino November 10 Follow @bbguari After Donald Trump's many shifting comments about women's health and reproductive rights, some women are worried about what will happen under the new administration. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) As protesters burned a giant papier-mâché Trump head outside City Hall in Los Angeles and their East Coast counterparts torched an American flag in front of the Trump Tower in New York, America’s social media feeds lit up, too. Among those concerned were women who, worried about what the next four years could bode for reproductive health, pondered a lasting prophylactic measure. In the months before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, some advocates answered, consider long-term intrauterine devices or implanted contraceptive rods. It was a concern echoed in headlines of Elle, Glamour, Jezebel, Vogue, New York magazine and others. Writer Sophia Benoit told the Intercept that some two dozen women took her up on a Twitter offer, posted just before midnight Nov. 8, to discuss intrauterine devices. “I recommend the IUD right now especially because it’s long term, which with 20 million+ Americans potentially losing their health insurance and potentially right to an abortion, is important,” Benoit said. An IUD procedure consists of a doctor implanting the small, T-shaped device in a woman’s uterus. The devices kill sperm before they can fertilize an egg, and the contraceptives do so with high rates of success. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that hormonal implants fail at a rate of just 0.2 percent when properly used, and copper implants have a 0.8 percent failure rate. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommended IUDs to prevent teen pregnancies as “first line” contraceptives in 2014. Effective for 10 years, ParaGard, a copper-based IUD, could outlast two terms of a Trump administration. “It’s too early to tell if we’ll see an uptick in requests for IUDs as a result of the election,” Planned Parenthood’s Raegan McDonald-Mosley said in a statement to the Huffington Post. “While we truly hope that birth control methods will be available, accessible, and affordable to all women under the Trump administration, we understand people’s real concerns about losing access to birth control, which is basic health care for women.” Trump has not called for a ban on birth control. But he has promised to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood, which offers a variety of birth control measures, including IUDs, in a pledge to antiabortion groups in the fall. Mark Harrington, director of antiabortion group Created Equal, told The Washington Post on Wednesday that the organization was calling on Trump to make good on his stance. [Trump victory inflates antiabortion movement] “We’re not going to allow, and we’re not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood,” Trump said in March, just moments after complimenting the organization. “We understand that, and I’ve said it loud and clear.” A model holds Merck’s Nexplanon hormonal implant for birth control. (Merck via AP) On Wednesday, Planned Parenthood issued a response to Trump’s election. “Health care should not be political,” Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said in a statement. “Every morning, Planned Parenthood health center staff across the country wake up and open their doors, as they have this morning, to care for anyone who needs them, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, income, or country of origin.” Celebrities such as comedian Chelsea Handler came out to publicly defend women’s health organizations, too. “If you feel paralyzed today,” Handler tweeted, “Planned Parenthood and other groups are doing good work & need your support.” If you feel paralyzed today, Planned Parenthood @PPact and other groups are doing good work & need your support: https://t.co/34KHZXVNLN — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) November 9, 2016 The Association of Reproductive Health Professionals notes that patients who choose IUDs report some of the highest rates of satisfaction among women who use birth control. But IUDs are not perfect, with side effects that include possible irregular bleeding, and a chance of increased menstrual bleeding in the case of the copper IUD. They vary in duration and cost, as high as $1,000 in out-of-pocket expenses for those who are uninsured. The Affordable Care Act — which Trump vowed to repeal — requires coverage of some forms of birth control, including intrauterine devices, by nearly all health insurance plans. Although Trump does not have a governing or voting record, his public statements in support of defunding Planned Parenthood are in line with what Vice President-elect Mike Pence supported during his time in Congress and tenure as governor of Indiana. Pence championed tight restrictions on abortion, including an Indiana law that declared “miscarried or aborted fetus must be interred or cremated.” In response, Indiana women created a group called “Periods for Pence” to inform the governor’s office whenever they were menstruating, on the chance their periods could potentially be miscarriages. Trump said during the presidential campaign that if abortion were made illegal, women who got the procedure should be punished for doing so — then he backtracked almost immediately and said only the doctor or any other person performing the illegal procedure should be punished.

Revenue growth is measured as organic growth in local currencies. Revenue from ALK's base business is defined as total revenue excluding income from the SLIT-tablet partnerships in North America and International markets). ALK continued to record double-digit sales growth in Europe in Q3. European sales and order intake exceeded expectations, driven by strong double-digit growth for SLIT-tablets and SLIT-drops. Overall margins softened following an expected decline of DKK 108 million in one-off milestone payments. -- Q3 total revenue, including partner income, amounted to DKK 630 million (667). Revenue in Q3 2015 included a DKK 112 million one-off milestone payment. -- Q3 revenue in the base business grew organically by 17% to DKK 614 million (534). -- ALK's base business saw strong sales growth for SLIT-tablets and SLIT-drops, while SCIT sales declined due to upgrade work on SCIT production in Europe, which has temporarily reduced SCIT production capacity. -- To meet demand during the forthcoming peak season, ALK will hire additional employees, primarily at the SLIT-drops production site in France. At the same time, ALK is expanding its North American organisation in support of the ongoing repatriation of the SLIT-tablets from MSD (known as Merck in the USA and Canada). -- ACARIZAX® is performing well during its introductory phase, consolidating its position in Denmark and Germany as the most prescribed product for new AIT initiations in adult patients with house dust mite allergy. ACARIZAX® was also recently launched in Slovakia, Sweden and Finland. -- Q3 operating profit (EBITDA) was DKK 121 million before special items (171). The EBITDA margin was 19% before special items (26%) as improved underlying profitability was offset by lower milestone payments. -- 9M total revenue was DKK 2,251 million (1,882) reflecting 30% growth in the base business. EBITDA before special items was DKK 584 million (329) and free cash flow was an inflow of DKK 198 million (an outflow of 149). Updated 2016 financial guidance ALK is updating its full-year guidance to reflect continued high orders in France which, from a revenue perspective, outweigh the impact of the upgrade work on SCIT production. -- Total full-year revenue is still projected to exceed DKK 2.9 billion including income from partnerships. -- Full-year revenue in the base business is now expected to grow organically by more than 20% versus previous guidance of ~20% growth. -- The new revenue guidance assumes that growth in the base business will be constrained by the ongoing upgrade of SCIT production which is estimated to reduce revenue by DKK 100-125 million, impacting the last four months of the year. Hence, the new guidance assumes low organic growth in the base business in Q4 2016 and a minor contribution from partnerships. Comparison with Q4 2015 is further affected by last year's significant sales growth resulting from a competitor's supply issues. -- Full-year EBITDA is now expected to exceed DKK 650 million before special items.

Dow Jones futures fell more than 4 percent after the real-estate mogul's victory was confirmed in the wee hours of Wednesday, yet the Dow Jones industrial average was up about 0.5 percent at 11:20 am. Pharmaceutical stocks were up sharply, with Pfizer up nearly 7 percent and Merck around 5.6 percent higher. Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar and financial services giant JPMorgan Chase also saw strong gains before midday, up 6.1 percent and 4 percent, respectively, while investment bank Goldman Sachs was up nearly 3 percent, consumer goods manufacturer Johnson & Johnson climbed 2.4 percent and financial services corporation American Express was 1.1 percent higher. By contrast, insurance company Travelers, down 1.63 percent; consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, off 1.9 percent; and Coca-Cola, which had fallen 1.9 percent, were among a group of stocks that lost ground in morning trading. The S&P 500 was up around 0.3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite was up 0.15 percent.   Print   Email   Share   Comments Recommend Tweet Share This Article View Article Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Health-care shares and lenders surged as investors unwound bets that a win by Hillary Clinton would bring stronger regulatory scrutiny. The SPDR S&P Biotech exchange-traded fund rose the most since 2008, while Pfizer Inc. and Merck & Co. jumped at least 6 per cent. JPMorgan Chase & Co. rose 4.6 per cent to a record, and Goldman Sachs had its best one-day gain in 4 1/2 years. The S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to 2,163.11 at 4 p.m. in New York, extending its advance after rising above its average prices during the past 50 and 100 days. The Dow rallied 1.4 per cent, to a two-month high. “Our base case is we’re more likely to see a more moderate president than we saw as a candidate and the market’s agreeing with that,” said Lowell Yura, head of multi-asset solutions for BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago, which oversees US$238 billion. “We don’t see a huge impact to short-term earnings and short-term economic growth.” A knee-jerk selloff in global stocks and a rally in haven assets reversed on wagers that Trump would increase fiscal spending to spur economic growth, and as he struck a more conciliatory tone in his first speech as president-elect. A Trump victory had been portrayed by analysts as having the potential to unhinge markets banking on a continuation of policies that coincided with the second-longest bull market in S&P 500 history. While Republican control of both houses of Congress may enable the party to enact sweeping legislation that would be considered pro-business, concern persists over the impact from Trump’s pledges to clamp down on immigration to the US and renegotiate free-trade agreements with countries including Mexico. “People focus on the fact that his acceptance speech kind of changed the direction of the market,” said Krishna Memani, New York-based chief investment officer at Oppenheimer Funds Inc., which oversees $223 billion. “It was far more conciliatory and far more fiscal-focused than these acceptances typically are -- that made a world of difference.” Election over, Donald Trump must now change his tune A basket of stocks identified by Morgan Stanley that are most likely to benefit from a Trump win surged 6.4 per cent. The group includes 53 companies ranging from drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals to construction-materials producer Martin Marietta Materials Inc. Among other shares boosted by the Republican’s win, prison operators soared on speculation the new administration will rescind a government contract phase-out. Corrections Corp. and Geo Group Inc. jumped more than 21 per cent. Companies gaining on Trump’s plans to boost infrastructure spending included equipment provider United Rentals Inc., capped its steepest advance in almost eight years, while Caterpillar Inc. added 7.7 per cent, the most since 2011. Vulcan Materials Co. climbed to an all-time high. Along with the potential for a lighter regulatory burden, banks were also boosted by soaring bond yields as investors’ inflation expectations climbed on speculation a Trump administration and Republican Congress will ramp up spending to lift growth. Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of America Corp. gained more than 5 per cent, with Wells Fargo jumping the most since 2012. As the initial turbulence eased, odds for a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike in December climbed back to levels seen before Trump’s victory, after plunging below 50 per cent as the outcome unfolded. The market-implied chance of a move next month is 86 per cent, the same as the probability on Tuesday afternoon. “The US that Trump inherits is doing pretty well economically,” said Nandini Ramakrishnan, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in London. “From an investment perspective, this is not something that we would say is entirely negative as the market may see just this morning. There may be potential opportunities with some of these selloffs.” In the 22 elections going back to 1928, the S&P 500 has fallen 15 times the day after polls close, for an average loss of 1.8 per cent. Stocks reversed course and moved higher over the next 12 months in nine of those instances, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Hillary Clinton is pretty much a slam dunk to become the next US President 2 Protectionist policies laid out by the Trump campaign point to hard times ahead for Hong Kong and China 3 President Trump: How did the polls get U.S. election so wrong? 4 Hillary Clinton: the world’s best investor or an out-and-out crook? 5 Brace for Singles’ Day as Chinese consumers click and swipe to shop Shared 1 Hillary Clinton is pretty much a slam dunk to become the next US President 2 Protectionist policies laid out by the Trump campaign point to hard times ahead for Hong Kong and China 3 President Trump: How did the polls get U.S. election so wrong? 4 Brace for Singles’ Day as Chinese consumers click and swipe to shop 5 This one predictable trend will emerge from Donald Trump’s shock election victory Commented 1 First two, now 15 Hong Kong lawmakers face prospect of being expelled from Legislative Council 2 Legco meeting suspended as Hong Kong lawmaker asks for debate on Beijing’s Basic Law ruling 3 Defying pundits and pollsters, Donald Trump is the next US president.

No pesky price regulation over drugs like EpiPen! No pesky safety regulation over blood thinning drugs like drug Xarelto, linked to 500 deaths. No speed bumps when Pfizer et al seeks to dodge U.S. taxes by incorporating overseas--the same taxes that fund their drugs in Medicare, TRICARE and other U.S. programs. Pharma is gleeful about a Trump presidency by Martha Rosenberg Of course, Pharma did not need a Trump presidency. Its profit party began in earnest with the nomination and confirmation earlier this year of Robert Califf as FDA Commissioner despite financial links to 23 Pharma companies including Johnson & Johnson, Lilly, Merck, Schering Plough and GSK according to a statement on the website of Duke Clinical Research Institute which he directed. In disclosure information for an article in Circulation, Califf also lists financial links to Gambro, Regeneron, Gilead, AstraZeneca, Roche and other companies and equity positions in four medical companies. Califf "served as a director, officer, partner, employee, advisor, consultant or trustee for Genentech," said the Medscape website. This is an FDA Commissioner? In the past, someone so heavily funded by industry would not be considered for a government position regulating that very industry. Yet on PBS, Califf saw no problem with doctors and researchers receiving Pharma money and actually thought it desirable. "Many of us consult with the pharmaceutical industry, which I think is a very good thing," he told host Susan Dentzer. Two government institutes are also happily feeding the Pharma beast. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), says the institute is looking to Pharma to find a "vaccine" for drug addiction. What? Shouldn't Volkow know, as head of the Institute, there is no "cure" or vaccine for addiction--that it is widely viewed as a physical, psychological and spiritual disease? Especially as opioid addiction-related deaths number in the thousands each year? Has she ever talked to Michael Botticelli, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy who, as an addict himself, advocates non-drug, non-Pharma, peer treatment for addiction? And shouldn't NIDA replace the very dated term "drug abuse" with the non-judgmental term "addiction"?) Animal lovers will be appalled at what Volkow has done to primates in the lab only to conclude that maternal drug use affects offspring. No sh*t, Volkow. - Advertisement - Under the leadership of industry-friendly Thomas Insel, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has also been feeding the Pharma beast. Non-drug research is no longer even fundable, lamented a recent New York Times editorial. Insel, an early proponent of SSRI antidepressants which he said worked better and faster than non-drug psychotherapy, left government to work at a billion dollar, semi-secret private venture between Google and Pharma last year that few are even aware of. The CEO of the new Google life sciences venture is former Genentech chairman Art Levinson. Insel, while NIMH director, said that not enough toddlers were on stimulants for ADHD even as the nation was aghast at how many children are dosed. As Trump moves toward the Oval Office, many feel his election does not represent popular sentiment--the same disconnect seen with Pharma. Public anger at Pharma and its outrageous prices is at a peak but regulatory firewalls are evaporating and alarming conflicts of interest tolerated. In February a smirking Martin Shkreli, founder of Turing Pharmaceuticals, refused to explain or defend his price hike of the antiparasitic drug Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 on the Hill, a price hike that could put the life-saving drug out of reach for some. With clear derision for regulators and the public itself, he tweeted that lawmakers were "imbeciles" after he testified. Then Mylan jacked the price of its EpiPen, an emergency allergy treatment that saves lives, to $600 up from the $100 almost overnight this summer. After public uproar, Mylan offered EpiPen cost breaks to low-income people--a common Pharma ruse that simply shifts costs to others while letting Pharma keep its prices. Meanwhile hepatitis C drugs that cost $84,000 a course of treatment are looting our Medicaid tax dollars in strapped states. No, Pharma did not need a Trump presidency for a profit party--but the rejoicing will be merrier.

Rising at this rate, the market, which valued at US$418.0 mn in 2015, is expected to reach US$643.5 mn by 2024. In terms of animal species, the swine segment presently leads but is expected to be outpaced by the growth of the ovine segment. In terms of geography, the global market is dominated by North America, which accounted for over 37% of the global market in 2015. Rising Intervention by Government Bodies to Play Key Role in Market Development  Government initiatives play a key role the development of animal health care markets. For instance, the China market for veterinary healthcare is chiefly driven by compulsory immunization policy, several animal health awareness programs, the easy availability of affordable veterinary vaccines, and fund for research and development in the field. In several other developed as well as developing economies, funds invested by government bodies for the research and development of veterinary vaccines and medications play a key role in boosting the demand for clostridium vaccines. Along with this, the rising global demand for animal products such as cattle milk, meat, and eggs is also a key factor driving the global market for clostridium vaccines. Animal products such as milk, pork, beef, and chicken collectively account for nearly 40% of global agricultural GDP and generated revenues valuing nearly US$600 bn in 2015. The market for these products in developing countries is growing rapidly due to the rising population and increased disposable incomes. The resultant rise in awareness regarding the need for maintaining the excellent health of animals is expected to further drive the clostridium vaccines market in the near future.

Who We Are Healthcare Article Comments Your Email Recipient's Email Message (Optional) Send Cancel Patients Play Growing Role in Developing Treatments for Rare Diseases Lilo H. Stainton | November 9, 2016 Pharmaceutical companies say advocates and families are changing how they work State Trooper Wayne Blanchard (left), Assemblywoman Annette Quijano, Ciara, and her father, Trooper Brian Kerrigan. Hours had passed and the hearing room had nearly emptied by the time New Jersey State Trooper Brian Kerrigan finally got his chance to tell state lawmakers about the devastating impact Prader-Willi disease has on his daughter, Ciara, and their family. But Kerrigan patiently described the challenges of raising a child with a complex genetic disorder that impacts growth and development and calmly urged the panel to support a resolution designed to build awareness of the condition, which affects fewer than 15,000 people nationwide, including many children. “Without awareness, there is no funding; without funding, there is no research; without research, there is no cure; without a cure, there is no hope,” he testified. “We need to work together to make sure there is always hope.” While it may be a lonely journey, patients, family members, and other advocates are having a growing impact on the work of pharmaceutical companies, especially those pursuing treatments and cures for rare diseases. Collaborations between those who speak for the suffering and companies pursuing cures can help connect patients with greater options for care, while enabling drug companies to better target their resources, according to those involved. On Friday, BioNJ, an organization that represents more than 400 life-science companies in the Garden State, hosted its first patient advocacy conference at Celgene Corp. in Summit. The event featured representatives from a number of New Jersey’s pharma giants, including Merck and Pfizer; advocacy experts from the Hyacinth Foundation, which represents those with AIDS; patients working to raise awareness about their own conditions; and state lawmakers, including Assemblyman Herb Conaway, (D-Gloucester), who chairs the health committee. “It was a highly interactive day where industry and patient advocates of all types were able to network and discuss the need for patient input throughout the drug development process,” said Debbie Hart, the president and CEO of BioNJ. Jayne Gershkowitz, chief patient advocate for Amicus Therapeutics, who moderated the morning session, said the summit was the latest development in an ongoing movement to better involve patients in drug creation, testing, and marketing. In 2012, BioNJ launched a series of discussions on this topic, held a webinar, and drafted a white paper that outlined the growing role of patient advocacy. Some companies, like Amicus — whose CEO John Crowley’s quest to find a cure for his two children, who suffer from Pompe Disease, inspired the 2009 movie “Extraordinary Measures” — have long focused on patient needs, Gershkowitz said. The Cranbury-based company is working primarily on treatments for a trio of rare diseases: Fabry Disease, Pompe Disease, and Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). “We place the patient and caregivers at the center of our model,” Gershkowitz said. Patient advocates — including sick individuals, their loved ones, and the organization they have come together to found in hopes of finding better treatment options — have for years played a critical role in finding solutions to rare or “orphan” diseases, Gershkowitz added. In the early 1980s, when HIV and AIDs were largely unknown outside the gay community, the passionate personal stories of those affected were critical to securing attention and funding for research, she said. “Patient advocacy has really come from the rare disease space,” she said. According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, or NORD, a rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. With more than 7,000 conditions that fall into this category, one in 10 Americans, some 30 million, face a lifelong health challenge as a result. Patients are frequently undiagnosed or misdiagnosed and only 5 percent of these rare diseases have identified treatments, NORD reports. That dynamic is starting to change, in part due to patient advocacy. In recent years, one-third of all new drugs approved by the Federal Drug Administration have targeted rare conditions, according to NORD. Pharmaceutical companies pursuing treatments for more common maladies are also seeking greater patient participation, experts said. In its 2012 white paper, BioNJ noted that a survey of 75 of its members found more than three-fourths had established a patient advocacy program or were considering such an effort. But not all these pharma companies had followed through on this concept; fewer than one in five had dedicated staffing to the cause, and two in five spent less than $50,000 on the program. While patients gain access to new therapies and other resources, pharma companies also benefit from collaborating with patients on the development, trial, and launch of new products, experts noted. Patients can help companies identify unmet healthcare needs — especially when these relate to rare conditions focus their investment, define clinical trials, and encourage participation. And regardless of the disease, patients can inspire scientists with their personal stories, help the company manage patient expectations, and create a network for future feedback. As the life-science industry continues to advance the discovery and development of new therapies and cures, research-based companies are faced with tackling even more complex and difficult-to-treat diseases. As part of their efforts, companies are beginning to recognize the value of bringing together researchers, patients, caregivers, and advocacy groups in a unified and comprehensive way to meet a common goal,” wrote BioNJ president Hart and board chairman Dr. Francois Nader in the white paper’s introduction. “Developing these relationships among all these parties is vital for advancing drug discovery and development — because patients can’t wait.” There is no cure yet for Prader-Willi, and treatment largely involves behavior modification and constant supervision, Kerrigan told the Assembly health committee in September. The condition, which leaves patients feeling chronically hungry, can impact growth, metabolism, and cognitive function, and often leads to severe obesity. It is usually caused by a little-understood genetic error that occurs equally in both sexes and all races. But in New Jersey, support is building for a resolution to designate May as Prader-Willi Awareness Month. The Assembly panel passed the measure (AJR-111), sponsored by Assemblyman Jay Webber (R-Morris) and Annette Quijano (D-Union), with unanimous support; a Senate version was introduced by Sen. Joseph Vitale (D-Middlesex). “This disorder is often misdiagnosed because the medical community is unfamiliar with the syndrome,” Webber said after the vote. “That’s why this resolution is important. Delaying early diagnosis and treatment may increase the number of challenges children experience, so increasing the public’s awareness about PWS is critical.” Prader-Willi is not alone. NORD maintains a database of thousands of rare diseases, dozens of which have been recognized with their own month or day. And February 28 is Rare Disease Day, designed to raise awareness about the need for treatments for the tens of millions of patients and families impacted by these less well-known conditions.

As the global population grows and ages, the highest toll will be among women in poor and middle-income countries, it said, and much of it from cancers which are largely preventable. "Most of the deaths occur in young- and middle-aged adults,", placing a heavy burden on families and national economies, said Sally Cowal, senior vice president of global health at the American Cancer Society, which compiled the report with pharmaceutical company Merck. The review "highlights the large geographic inequality in availability of resources and preventive measures and treatment to combat the growing burden of cancer," she told AFP. Cancer is already killing one in seven women around the world, said the report -- the second highest cause of death after cardiovascular disease. All four of the deadliest cancers -- breast, colorectal, lung and cervical cancer -- are mostly preventable or can be detected early, when treatment is more successful. In poorer countries, a much smaller proportion of cancer cases are diagnosed and treated than in rich ones, while a much bigger group dies. The relative burden is growing for developing countries as people live longer due to better basic healthcare. Women in these countries are also increasingly exposed to known cancer risk factors "associated with rapid economic transition," said Cowal, "such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors" such as postponing motherhood. "Due to these changes, cancers that were once common only in high-income countries are becoming more prevalent," said the report entitled "The Global Burden of Cancer in Women." It was presented Tuesday at the World Cancer Congress in Paris. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 6.7 million new cancer cases and 3.5 million deaths among women worldwide in 2012. Of these, 56 percent of cases and 64 percent of deaths were in less developed countries. "These numbers are expected to increase to 9.9 million cases and 5.5 million deaths among females annually by 2030 as a result of the growth and ageing of the population," said the new report. Regional differences  The biggest concentration is in eastern Asia, with 1.7 million cases and a million deaths in 2012, mainly in China. The report said the highest ratio of cancer cases per population group are still reported in high-income countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia, but this was partly due to better access to screening and detection. Deaths, however, were proportionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries with reduced access to diagnosis and treatment. The countries with the highest death rate were Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Mongolia and Papua New Guinea. Breast and lung cancer are the two most common types in both rich and poor nations, with colorectal cancer the number three killer in developed countries, and cervical cancer in less developed ones. Cervical cancer can be staved off by vaccination against the cancer-causing Human papillomavirus (HPV), and can be easily detected through regular Papanicolaou (pap) test screens. "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in 140 countries worldwide and cervical cancer is the most common in 39 countries, all of which are LMICs (low- and medium-income countries)," said the report. It said the global economic burden of cancer for both genders was about $286 billion (261 billion euros) in 2009, including costs for treatment and care, and loss of workforce productivity.

Washington, D.C. (November 4, 2016) – The fifth annual BIO Patient and Health Advocacy Summit concluded today, bringing together 300 attendees representing over 200 organizations from patient advocacy, health care providers, academia, government, think tanks, professional societies and the biotechnology industry. The event provides a forum for lively discussions on timely health policy issues and best practices. Organized by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), the event’s educational programming was designed to encourage thought-provoking discussion and to advance partnerships among stakeholders in the healthcare space. “This BIO patient advocacy summit has grown to include vastly diverse patient advocacy organizations on an international level. Patients’ perspectives are integral in the research and development of new treatment options,” said Paul Hastings, Chairman and CEO of OncoMed Pharmaceuticals and Chair of BIO’s Patient Advocacy Committee. “We look to continually engage with patient groups with strict adherence to BIO’s Guidelines for Patient Engagement to find innovative ways to incorporate all patients’ voices into the development of life-saving treatments. For the past five years, the Summit has provided an open forum for building invaluable partnerships among all stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem.” The Summit’s opening keynote luncheon began with remarks from Hastings and was followed by a town hall-style discussion that explored the potential implications of the upcoming Presidential and congressional races for health care delivery and access. Other deliberations throughout the conference centered on the patient’s voice in the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA VI), patient perspectives in the development of value assessment frameworks, collaborations to incorporate patient perspectives throughout the life cycle of drug development and best practices around engagement with the provider and payor communities.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Merck Manuals Shares Advice and Resources for Alzheimer's Caregivers KENILWORTH, N.J., Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — With more than five million Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease and more than 10 million caring for someone with Alzheimer’s, nearly everyone knows someone affected by this irreversible, heartbreaking disease. During National Alzheimer’s Awareness Month and National Family Caregivers Month, Dr. Juebin Huang, MD, PhD and Assistant Professor of Neurology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, provides guidance for those caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease on MerckManuals.com. Some of the insights Dr. Huang outlined in his article include: Understand the difference between dementia and Alzheimer’s Distinguishing Alzheimer’s disease from the varied effects of aging and related conditions remains challenging for patients and their families. Dementia is not a specific disease. Dementia is a term used to describe any slow, progressive decline in mental function, like memory or language, which is significant enough to disrupt an individual’s daily activities. Although Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, there are many other causes of dementia that a physician will consider. Be mindful of warning signs In older adults, it’s not always easy to figure out which changes in memory and personality are parts of the natural aging process and which are signs of a more serious issue. While family members most commonly point to signs of forgetfulness in aging loved ones, doctors considering an Alzheimer’s diagnosis will also look for other warning signs, including: A decline in carrying out daily functions like balancing a checkbook A lack of interest in hobbies Reluctance to leave the house Difficulty keeping up with conversations. Monitor progression Caregivers are often the first to notice warning signs and may be the ones to push for the first doctor visit. However, these issues typically develop very slowly and are very subtle at first. It’s common for individuals to not remember exactly when they started experiencing symptoms. It can be years before a person seeks medical treatment, which makes establishing a timeline and predicting the progression difficult for doctors. Once treatment has begun, caregivers can be more accurate and objective in describing symptoms to doctors. Help loved ones maintain their normal daily functions Caregivers play a crucial role in helping patients maintain their day-to-day lives. Maintaining household chores, social interactions, and physical activities are especially important.  In the relatively early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, caregivers should encourage their loved ones to continue regular activities, while also monitoring to ensure these activities don’t become dangerous to the affected person or to others. Make sure you’re cared for There may come a time when an Alzheimer’s patient begins to challenge the caregiver and stops following instructions. As the person’s behavior changes, caregivers must constantly shift their strategies and expectations. This is no easy feat. When a person with Alzheimer’s disease is especially upset or confused, often the best approach is to relent enough to let the person calm down, then redirect the behavior later. It’s important to remember that the person’s condition is clouding their true intentions. The physical and emotional impact of caring for a loved one who is struggling with Alzheimer’s disease can be overwhelming. Many doctors’ offices have social workers available to talk to caregivers and direct them to additional resources and support. Resources are also available online, like the services offered by the Alzheimer’s Association, Alzheimer’s Disease International and Alzheimer’s Foundation of America. About The Merck Manuals First published in 1899 as a small reference book for physicians and pharmacists, The Merck Manual grew in size and scope to become one of the world’s most widely used comprehensive medical resources for professionals and consumers. As The Manual evolved, it continually expanded the reach and depth of its offerings to reflect the mission of providing the best medical information to a wide cross-section of users, including medical professionals and students, veterinarians and veterinary students, and consumers. In 2015, The Merck Manual kicked off Global Medical Knowledge 2020, a program to make the best current medical information accessible by up to three billion professionals and patients around the world by 2020.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Donald Trump’s unlikely rise to power is providing a shot in the arm for global financial markets, with stocks and metals rallying on optimism that his fiscal-stimulus plans will boost the economy. Bonds tumbled. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to a record high and the MSCI All Country World Index erased its monthly decline and  Copper posted its biggest back-to-back surge in three years, gaining alongside lead, zinc, tin and aluminum. The dollar rose against most major peers, while government bonds extended their selloff as Trump’s win bolstered bets on faster inflation. Latin American equities, debt and currencies plunged on speculation that higher U.S. interest rates would damp the appeal of riskier emerging-market securities. Traders are betting Trump will lower taxes, ease corporate regulation and ramp up spending to spur the world’s largest economy. He’s pledged to at least double the $275 billion five-year building plans of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, while saying infrastructure will become “second to none” with millions working on projects. A statement posted on the president elect’s official transition website said the new administration will replace the Dodd-Frank Act financial-sector law with pro-growth policies. “People are going through the possibilities about what Washington looks like today and what Washington can do or not do for them,” said John Manley, who helps oversee about $233 billion as chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. “Corporations feel there’s a less restrictive hand. People may take that as a positive.” Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart John Williams stressed the importance of the central bank’s independence from political influence. Questions remain, however, over Trump’s attitude toward Chair Janet Yellen, whom he accused of holding rates low to aid Democratic President Barack Obama. Traders see an 84 percent chance of rate hike next month, according to federal funds futures pricing. “I am not seeing enough volatility here to change my basic projection for the economy,” Bullard said Thursday. “I think we are basically on track, the same way we were before the election. Our view has called for a single rate increase and I think December would be a reasonable time to implement that increase.” Stocks MSCI’s global gauge rose 0.2 percent at 4 p.m. in New York. The S&P 500 added 0.2 percent to 2,167.61, and the Dow Average jumped 219 points. Some of the biggest technology companies from Apple Inc. to Microsoft Corp. sent the Nasdaq Composite Index down. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index extended a five-day rally to 8.2 percent. Banks and health-care shares surged on bets a Trump administration will roll back regulatory scrutiny of the industries. Industrial shares rallied as the Republican plans to boost infrastructure spending. Utility and real-estate stocks tumbled as a rout in bonds pushed yields higher, damping demand for the shares’ relatively high dividend payouts. “Yields are moving their way higher, that’s good for banks,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist and director of research for Wunderlich Securities in Boston. “If there’s going to be a friendlier regulatory environment that’s going to be good for banks. That’s the tailwind behind financials we haven’t seen for a long time.” Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index erased gains as a slide in utility and real-estate shares outweighed a rally in financial companies. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropped to the lowest since August, with benchmarks in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil slumping at least 3.2 percent. Russian shares rallied for a third day on speculation that a new U.S. government will mend its ties with Moscow. Bonds Benchmark 10-year note yields rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 2.14 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They were on course for the highest level since January. The yield on 30-year bonds increased 10 basis points to 2.95 percent, after jumping the most since October 2011 Wednesday. Treasury’s $15 billion 30-year debt auction Thursday again showed waning investor appetite for U.S. debt as Trump is seen ramping up spending to boost the economy, potentially widening the budget deficit and stoking inflation. Investors from Pacific Investment Management Co. to TIAA Global Asset Management see the surge in long-term U.S. Treasury yields as a sign inflation will in fact be on the rise. That means the long-dormant part of the Fed’s dual mandate could force policy makers to act more swiftly to raise borrowing costs than they have in 2016. “We see a higher and more balanced inflation forecast and more rapid normalization of policy,” Scott Mather, chief investment officer for core strategies at Pimco, wrote in a note. “This means the Fed will move faster on rate increases than the market had been pricing for in the year ahead,” he said, adding that he expects “two to three rate hikes before the end of 2017.” In Europe, Italian 10-year yields climbed to their highest in almost 14 months, coming under particular pressure amid concern December’s constitutional referendum may be the next vehicle for a growing anti-establishment mood. In France, where elections are due in 2017, yields also surged. Latin America was the highlight among emerging markets, with the cost to hedge against losses in bonds from Argentina and Brazil rising the most among major economies. Currencies The dollar surged to the strongest level since March as Trump’s proposals are seen by economists as inflationary and leading to higher U.S. interest rates. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index advanced 0.6 percent. The greenback rose 1 percent to 106.68 yen, touching the highest since July, and added 0.1 percent to $1.0900 per euro. “The dollar will do very well” on a broad trade-weighted basis in the next 12 months, Bilal Hafeez, global head of foreign-exchange research at Nomura Holdings Inc. in London, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “The Fed will be increasing interest rates, the U.S. will be engaging in fiscal stimulus of some kind, which is much-needed by economies around the world, so we’ll have faster growth and more inflationary pressures.” Meanwhile, Latin American currencies tumbled on concern that Trump’s administration could usher in a host of protectionist measures after he campaigned on a pledge to protect American workers and companies from unfair trade deals. A trade war would be a blow to economies such as Mexico, which gets 80 percent of its overseas sales from the U.S., and others in the region that depend on exports. Brazil’s real plunged the most in five years, while Colombia’s and Mexico’s currencies each fell more than 3.7 percent. Commodities Most industrial metals rallied on speculation that commodities used to build everything from airports to bridges will benefit under Trump’s presidency. “The clearest message delivered by Donald Trump in his election victory speech was a focus on greater infrastructure spending in the U.S.,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie said in a Nov. 9 report. “Without specific details it is hard to quantify the impact on commodity demand, however such policies would support steel, iron ore, zinc, nickel, diesel and cement.” Copper for delivery in three months jumped 3.5 percent to $5,601 a metric ton ($2.54 a pound) on the London Metal Exchange, after hitting a 16-month high. That’s pushed up the relative strength index to 90, the highest since data began in 1986. A reading over 70 suggests an asset is overbought. As optimism mounts that Trump’s plans will boost global growth, investors are unwinding options that give holders the right to buy December gold futures at higher prices, with the most-active call slumping for a fourth straight day. Contracts for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to settle at $1,266.40 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Oil fell after the International Energy Agency said prices may retreat amid “relentless global supply growth” unless OPEC enacts significant output cuts. West Texas Intermediate for December delivery fell 1.4 percent to $44.66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent for January settlement slipped 1.1 percent to $45.84 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.   © 2016 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.

However, Tuesday was also a landmark day for the marijuana legalization movement. Marijuana scored medical and/or recreational victories in eight of the nine states that voted on the issue, tremendous news for the industry. Pharma, Weed Policies And Trump To compound the good for pharma stocks working on cannabinoid drugs, Trump’s election provided a major boost to the drug industry as well. One of the central issues of Hillary Clinton’s campaign was drug pricing, but it doesn’t seem to be a priority for Trump. Publicly Traded Pot Stocks Go High Marijuana drug companies GW Pharmaceuticals PLC – ADR (NASDAQ: GWPH) and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: ZYNE) gained 6.0 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively, on Wednesday. Both stocks appeared poised to open Thursday’s session slightly higher as well. These pharma stocks traded mostly in line with non-marijuana pharma stocks like Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), which gained 6.5 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively, on Trump's election. While the election results were good news for marijuana drug stocks, other marijuana traders took the opportunity to cash in on huge 2016 gains. The MJIC U.S. Reporting Marijuana Index closed Wednesday’s session mostly flat but near 52-week highs. When asked about the situation, 420 Investor Alan Brochstein told Benzinga, "Biotech rally, though there has been some speculation that the new President, with control of Congress, could be negative for state-legal cannabis." Over-The-Counter Cannabis Stocks Sell Off Red hot marijuana stocks such as Kush Bottles Inc (OTC: KSHB), Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc (OTC: CNBX) and Cannabis Sativa Inc (OTC: CBDS) weighed heavily on the index, each selling off more than 10 percent on Wednesday as traders locked in massive 2016 gains.

Investors' initial fears were eased by Trump's inclusive victory speech and some of his policy plans, such as increased infrastructure and military spending as well as repealing landmark health care and financial reform laws, boosted stocks in several key sectors. Credit markets reflected more nervousness. Yield on many bonds, including U.S. Treasury securities, rose amid concerns that budget deficits might increase, and push up borrowing costs, if Trump pursues some spending programs and tax cuts he discussed during the campaign. The Dow Jones industrial shot up 256.95 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 18,589.69, near August's record high after a relatively calm open. The rally came after an 800-point plunge in overnight futures as Trump's victory became apparent early Wednesday, after investors somewhat duplicated the initial market turmoil and quick recovery that followed the stunning vote in Britain in June to leave the European Union. The Nasdaq and the Standard & Poor's 500 rose about 1.1 percent after similar steep futures declines. "Markets tend to assume the worst and react immediately," Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients before the opening bell Wednesday. "Expect an immediate market pullback on fear, and then a pause." As with the surprise "Brexit" vote, when Britain voted in June to leave the European Union, part of the market's turmoil reflected money managers having guessed incorrectly on the outcome of the election. "Markets tend to have knee-jerk reactions to these kind of situations" and in this case investors also "had all but priced-in a (Hillary) Clinton victory," Nigel Green, chief executive of the financial advisory firm DeVere Group in London, said in a statement. Major stock indexes had fallen around the globe as world markets digested Trump's victory. Japan's Nikkei index fell more than 5 percent overnight but major European indexes turned positive later Wednesday recovering from sharper declines earlier in the day. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, said Trump's inclusive victory speech helped calm markets -- for now. "It's a knee-jerk reaction in both cases, first to the shocking election outcome second to the very tempered speech that President-elect Trump had given in acceptance," McBride said. "In neither case are the multitude of questions outstanding answered," he said, adding that Trump was "deliberately vague" on specific policy positions during the campaign. "So in the face of unanswered questions, I would expect very choppy waters in financial markets over the coming weeks and months," McBride said. There was confusion in the credit markets, too. Prices of many U.S. Treasury securities -- typically one of the safe havens that investors seek in volatile times -- fell in early trading Wednesday, driving their yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, jumped to 2.06 percent -- the highest since January -- from 1.85 percent on Tuesday. "I don't think the bond markets have a good handle on the implications of the events of last night, so they're pricing in the potential for greater risk," said Guy LeBas, head of fixed-income strategy at the investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott. "If you look at the proto-policies that Trump has referenced, including possibly renegotiating the U.S. debt and running a massive deficit, while those outcomes are by no means certain that enhances the risk of Treasury securities," LeBas said. McBride said short-term bond prices fell because investors believe Federal Reserve policymakers are less likely to nudge up interest rates next month in the wake of Trump's victory. Long-term bond yields were up because Trump used his speech in part to tout plans for more infrastructure spending, "which portends bigger deficits and debt," McBride said. Stocks in certain sectors rallied on speculation that Trump's proposals eventually would boost the companies' growth. Big bank stocks surged with the expectation of less financial regulation and construction and heavy equipment companies rallied on Trump's expected push for more federal spending on roads, airports and other infrastructure. "We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals," Trump said in his early morning victory speech. "We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it." There is bipartisan backing for increased infrastructure spending. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also wanted more such spending and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Wednesday that "we can work together to pass a robust infrastructure jobs bill." Consequently, Caterpillar Inc. stock was up about 7.7 percent Wednesday. And shares of Vulcan Materials Co., which produces asphalt and concrete mixes, shot up more than 10 percent. Aerospace and defense stocks also rose in response to Trump's promise to build up the U.S. military. Raytheon Co. surged about 8 percent in morning trading, Northrop Grumman Corp. jumped about 5.8 percent and Boeing Co. gained 2 percent. Drug stocks also shot higher with Trump vowing to repeal Obamacare and replace it with another national health care plan. Pfizer Inc. and Amgen Inc. both rose 6 percent and Merck & Co. was up 5.5 percent. But Trump's exact plans are still unclear, so investors should wait for more details, said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. "I think this is a very short-term bump," he said. (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) The Mexican peso was down about 8 percent against the dollar after plunging earlier Wednesday by more than 13 percent to a record low amid concerns about a Trump presidency. Trump has promised to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to halt undocumented immigration. He also promised during the campaign to rewrite or scrap the 2-decade-old North American Free Trade Agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Investors also were concerned about the effect of Trump's victory on global trade. Trump has been highly critical of U.S. trade deals and adamantly opposes the proposed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership pact with Asian nations. Those positions have raised fears among investors of a global trade war and a U.S. recession after Trump takes office. "Trump has proposed economic and trade policies which, if enacted, would represent a sharp departure from the status quo," HSBC Global Research said. "These include sharp cuts in income and business taxes, renegotiation of trade agreements and potential tariffs on goods imported from China and Mexico, and the large-scale deportation of illegal immigrants." Fitch Ratings said Trump's victory "does not have immediate near-term implications" for the federal government's AAA bond rating. But "Trump's economic and fiscal policies would be negative for U.S. sovereign creditworthiness if they were implemented in full," Fitch said.       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/15/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Thursday, November 10, 2016 Election results in Montgomery County update 3 Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Republicans take Legislature Wednesday, November 09, 2016 State news in brief Friday, November 11, 2016 WWII vet shares memories Friday, November 11, 2016 Mary Lou Abele Starace Wednesday, November 09, 2016 3 arrested for prostitution in Amsterdam Monday, November 14, 2016 Deborah L.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen The Dow Jones industrial average hit a record high on Thursday as investors bet that president-elect Donald Trump would lead a shift away from austerity policies. Investors are seeing Trump’s policies such higher defense and infrastructure spending, tax cuts and deregulation of banks and as being more business-friendly than Democrat Hillary Clinton’s position of maintaining status quo. Story continues below “The markets are adjusting to a new reality and are giving Trump the benefit of doubt,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of Sarhan Capital. “He does have some problems with immigration and with social issues, but his economic policies, at least in the short-term, are perceived to be stimulative and net good for the economy and that’s why stocks are rallying.” READ MORE: U.S. election uncertainty taking a ‘toll’ on global markets The U.S. dollar jumped to a more than two-week high of 98.92, while gold turned flat as investors returned to riskier assets such as stocks. The Mexican peso continued its downward momentum against the dollar as Trump’s policies are considered deeply negative for the country. At 9:43 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was up 161.69 points, or 0.87 per cent, at 18,751.38. The S&P 500 was up 17.11 points, or 0.79 per cent, at 2,180.37. The index is less than 20 points shy of its record intraday high. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 45.40 points, or 0.86 per cent, at 5,296.47. Financial and healthcare stocks rose, continuing to hold their positions as the top performers among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors in the post-Trump victory rally. Consumer staples, utilities and real-estate – the defensive parts of the market – remained the big losers. As investors decipher what a Trump presidency would mean to the financial markets, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard repeated his call that a single interest rate increase would be adequate for the foreseeable future.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search US Election: How best to invest following Donald Trumps victory November 9, 2016 20:56 IST By IBTimes UK Close Embed <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.in/tv/embed/42051" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Following the surprising win of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential election, investors are today scratching their heads and trying to figure out what this means for the economy and for stock markets for the next four years. President-elect Trump has zero political experience, and thus his economic policies are more difficult to predict than with previous presidents-elect. Given the resounding majorities won by the Republican Party in both the US Senate and House of Representatives, the road is clear for the Republicans under Trump to pass new legislation for at least the next two years, when the US mid-term elections will be held. Greater government spending: Building and Infrastructure President Trump is likely to spend on infrastructure projects across America, including maintenance of road networks, improving airports and oil and gas pipelines. The most powerful economy in the world has surprisingly poor infrastructure, evident when you take a taxi out of Manhattan to New Yorks LaGuardia airport and experience the numerous potholes in the road. This infrastructure spending will benefit construction-related companies such as building company CRH (UK code: CRH), and equipment rental company Ashtead (code: AHT), both of which have huge exposure to the US. Greater government spending: Defence and Security Defence and security is a second area where President Trump is likely to spend more money, as this is a typical Republican policy priority. Homeland security is a very high priority if Trump is to deliver on many of his pledges to his voters. This higher defence and security spending should benefit suppliers to the US government such as BAe Systems (code: BA.). Good news for Health care The US and European healthcare sectors have suffered in the lead-up to this election on the basis that the favourite, Hillary Clinton, was likely to enact heavy price regulation on pharmaceutical companies in the US, limiting their profit-making ability. Over the year to date, US healthcare companies like Pfizer and Merck underperformed the benchmark S and P 500 index by 10% in the run-up to this election. Since Trumps victory, healthcare stocks have bounced by more than the market, starting to claw back some of this lost ground, as Trump is seen as being much more business-friendly to this industry than Hillary Clinton would have been. In the UK, Shire plc (code SHP) is a key member of the FTSE 100 index that has huge exposure to the US pharmaceutical market, made even greater through its recent acquisition of US company Baxalta. Policy uncertainty is probably not good news for government bonds With Donald Trump likely to increase government spending in order to make good on some of his populist promises to the US electorate, this extra spending is likely to result in more borrowing via bonds by the US government. The expectation of higher borrowing is already resulting in higher bond yields, and thus lower bond prices, not only for US Treasury bonds but also for UK gilts. So investors are likely to do better in the near-term focusing on healthcare, construction and defence/security stocks, and staying away from the gilt market until bond yields stabilise at higher levels.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 1/2 left right Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., November 10, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 2/2 By Noel Randewich U.S. banking sector shares on Thursday surged to levels not seen since the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, pushing the Dow to an all-time high, while technology shares sank as Wall Street rearranged its bets to benefit from Donald Trump's presidency. The S&P 500 financial sector .SPSY surged 3.70 percent to its highest since the 2008 financial crisis, bringing its gain since Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election to 7.9 percent, its biggest two-day gain since 2011. Shares of Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) jumped 7.58 percent to their highest since January, and have now erased all of the losses incurred in the wake of a scandal over fake accounts opened by its employees. Bank of America (BAC.N) surged 4.40 percent and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) rallied 4.64 percent to a record high. Trump has sided with leading conservatives in calling for the repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act largely opposed by banks. "The Trump campaign did say it would repeal Dodd-Frank. Rates are higher and the yield curve is steeper. Those are all good things for the banks," said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. Apple (AAPL.O) dropped 2.79 percent while Amazon.com (AMZN.O) fell 3.82 percent and the S&P 500 technology index .SPLRCT fell 1.59 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI jumped 1.17 percent to end at 18,807.88, smashing through its previous record high set in August by almost 1 percent. The S&P 500 .SPX rose 0.2 percent to 2,167.48 while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.81 percent to 5,208.80, hurt by losses in tech shares. With Thursday's gain, the Dow is up 8 percent in 2016 and the S&P 500 is up 6 percent. High-dividend sectors utilities .SPLRCU, telecom services .SPLRCL and consumer staples .SPLRCS sold off by more than 2 percent as bond yields rose due to expectations of higher interest rates. The market got a lift after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the Republican sweep of the White House and Congress could break the current gridlock over national policy in a potential boon to the U.S. economy. Industrials .SPLRCI trailed the financials with a 2.05 percent advance. Macy's (M.N) rose 5.6 percent after the department store operator raised its full-year sales forecast and announced a partnership to monetize some of its real-estate assets. After the bell, Nordstrom (JWN.N) reported quarterly results that sent its shares 5 percent higher while Walt Disney's (DIS.N) quarterly report pushed its stock down 2.6 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.15-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 84 new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 336 new highs and 48 new lows. About 12.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, far above the 7.3 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Allergic Rhinitis Market: Increasing Prevalence Rate of Allergy is Anticipated to Drive Global Market by 2026 2016-11-10 Print Tweet   In allergic rhinitis, the immune system identifies harmful substances known as allergens as an intruder. It is an Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated disease. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE According to American college of allergy, asthma and immunology allergic rhinitis mostly affect 40 million to 60 million Americans. Australian society of clinical immunology and allergy reported that allergic rhinitis affects 1 in 5 people in Australia and New Zealand. The increasing prevalence rate of allergy in both adult and children is anticipated to drive the global allergic rhinitis market. Consumers are also moving forward towards the use over-the-counter (OTC) products which are a trend in the global allergic rhinitis market. Based on the therapy, drugs are considered as the first line of therapy. With the help of immunotherapy, the body builds resistance to allergen and helps in the improvement of symptoms. Allergic rhinitis is the fifth most common chronic disease in the U.S. According to American Academy of Otolaryngology, allergic rhinitis affects 1 in every 6 Americans and generates about US$ 2 Bn to US$ 5 Bn in direct health expenditures annually. In 2014, National Health interview Survey (NHIS) demonstrated that 8.4% of children in U.S. under 18 years of age suffered hay fever. American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology mentioned that allergic rhinitis affects between 10% and 30% of the population. On the basis of regional presence, global allergic rhinitis market is segmented into five key regions viz. North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is expected to lead the allergic rhinitis market, as U.S. has the highest incidence of allergy. Asia Pacific market is anticipated to grow at the fastest growth rate during the forecast period, owing to factors such as increasing pollution especially in countries such as China, Japan, and India. Some of the major players in allergic rhinitis market are AstraZeneca, MEDA Pharmaceuticals Inc., Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc, Merck & Co., Inc., Sunovion pharmaceuticals Inc., UCB S.A., Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd, and Stallergenes Greer.

Bristol-Myers' deepens focus on fibrosis with Nitto deal Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Thursday it agreed to pay Japan's Nitto Denko Corp $100 million up front for the right to its early-stage drug for liver fibrosis due to fatty liver disease NASH or hepatitis C. Fibrotic diseases are characterized by inflammation and subsequent formation of excess collagen in an organ or tissue, compromising function, and culminating in organ failure. Pfizer wins EU's approval for Ibrance as Novartis readies rival drug U.S. drugmaker Pfizer said on Wednesday it had won approval from the European Union for its best-selling breast cancer drug Ibrance, making it the first medicine of its kind to reach the European market. The decision, which had been expected following a positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency in September, comes as Novartis readies a rival treatment called ribociclib. J&J vaccine plus Gilead immune booster shows promise as HIV fighter An experimental HIV vaccine from Johnson & Johnson combined with an immune system booster from Gilead Sciences Inc showed promise at keeping the virus at bay in monkeys even after treatments had stopped, marking yet another step toward the development of a so-called functional cure for HIV. Both companies are currently testing the products separately in early-stage trials in people with HIV. Bristol-Myers' Opdivo succeeds in key stomach cancer study Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Thursday its blockbuster immunotherapy Opdivo helped patients with advanced stomach cancer live longer in a late-stage study, becoming the first drug of its kind to show a survival benefit in these patients. Opdivo met the main study goal of overall survival in patients who failed to respond to or are intolerant of standard chemotherapy, the company said. Scientists develop new type of HIV test on a USB stick Scientists in Britain have developed a type of HIV test using a USB stick that can give a fast and highly accurate reading of how much virus is in a patient's blood. The device, created by scientists at Imperial College London and the privately-held U.S. firm DNA Electronics, uses a drop of blood to detect HIV, then creates an electrical signal that can be read by a computer, laptop or handheld device.

Preclinical data for IPI-549 - which is currently in phase I trials as a monotherapy - has suggested that the drug candidate may not only enhance the effects of checkpoint inhibitors like Opdivo, but also reverse tumour resistance. Designed to target immune cells, IPI-549 alters the immune-suppressive microenvironment that fosters tumour growth and promotes an anti-tumour immune response. Dr Fouad Namouni, head of oncology development at BMS, said: “Targeting the tumour microenvironment is an important part of our immuno-oncology strategy as we continue to advance research for cancers with limited treatment options. “Our agreement with Infinity builds on our continued focus to bring forward potential novel combination treatment options for patients with cancer.” With a view to treating all patients with advanced forms of solid tumours, the study will begin with trials in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), which account for 17% of all new cancer cases in the US each year. BMS will be looking to the combination therapy to give its PD-1 inhibitor an advantage in the hyper-competitive immuno-oncology market, particularly after Opdivo failed to outperform Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in a first-line NSCLC study earlier this year. In that study Merck's Keytruda proved to better both progression-free and overall survival in NSCLC patients compared to standard chemotherapy and it was followed by an accelerated approval by the FDA last month. Meanwhile, Roche's own PD-1 inhibitor Tecentriq (atezolizumab) has also been approved in NSCLC albeit as a second-line therapy and is currently undergoing a phase III trial for first-line use.

By Edmund Shing November 10, 2016 11:12 GMT Close Embed Feed US Election: How best to invest following Donald Trump's victory IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/21526" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Following the surprising win of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential election, investors are today scratching their heads and trying to figure out what this means for the economy and for stock markets for the next four years. President-elect Trump has zero political experience, and thus his economic policies are more difficult to predict than with previous presidents-elect. Given the resounding majorities won by the Republican Party in both the US Senate and House of Representatives, the road is clear for the Republicans under Trump to pass new legislation for at least the next two years, when the US mid-term elections will be held. Greater government spending: Building and Infrastructure Chart 1: Ashtead breaking out post US electionSource: Bloomberg.com President Trump is likely to spend on infrastructure projects across America, including maintenance of road networks, improving airports and oil and gas pipelines. The most powerful economy in the world has surprisingly poor infrastructure, evident when you take a taxi out of Manhattan to New York's LaGuardia airport and experience the numerous potholes in the road. This infrastructure spending will benefit construction-related companies such as building company CRH (UK code: CRH), and equipment rental company Ashtead (code: AHT), both of which have huge exposure to the US. Greater government spending: Defence and Security Defence and security is a second area where President Trump is likely to spend more money, as this is a typical Republican policy priority. Chart 2: BAe Systems enjoys Trump bumpSource: Bloomberg.com Homeland security is a very high priority if Trump is to deliver on many of his pledges to his voters. This higher defence and security spending should benefit suppliers to the US government such as BAe Systems (code: BA.). Good news for Health care The US and European healthcare sectors have suffered in the lead-up to this election on the basis that the favourite, Hillary Clinton, was likely to enact heavy price regulation on pharmaceutical companies in the US, limiting their profit-making ability. Over the year to date, US healthcare companies like Pfizer and Merck underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index by 10% in the run-up to this election. Chart 3: US health care stocks have suffered from a fear of ClintonSource: Bloomberg.com Since Trump's victory, healthcare stocks have bounced by more than the market, starting to claw back some of this lost ground, as Trump is seen as being much more business-friendly to this industry than Hillary Clinton would have been. In the UK, Shire plc (code SHP) is a key member of the FTSE 100 index that has huge exposure to the US pharmaceutical market, made even greater through its recent acquisition of US company Baxalta. Chart 4: Shire continues to rebound strongly from start of 2016 lowsSource: Bloomberg.com Policy uncertainty is probably not good news for government bonds With Donald Trump likely to increase government spending in order to make good on some of his populist promises to the US electorate, this extra spending is likely to result in more borrowing via bonds by the US government. The expectation of higher borrowing is already resulting in higher bond yields, and thus lower bond prices, not only for US Treasury bonds but also for UK gilts. So investors are likely to do better in the near-term focusing on healthcare, construction and defence/security stocks, and staying away from the gilt market until bond yields stabilise at higher levels.

The blue chip index DJIA, -0.17%  gained 218.19 points, or 1.2%, to finish at 18,807.88 after hitting an all-time high of 18,873.66 earlier. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.21%  rose 4.22 points, or 0.2% to end at 2,167.48. “Trump made rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure a centerpiece of his campaign. As such, the market is expecting an emphasis on fiscal spending initiatives to jump-start the economy,” said Michael Reilly, chief investment officer for equities at TCW. Read: Trump stock rally signals new era of fiscal stimulus The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.57%  trimmed losses but fell 42.28 points, or 0.8%, to close at 5,208.80. It was down more than 100 points at one point during the session. “We are witnessing the unwind of the ‘presidential trade,’” said Ian Winer, director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, referring to the decline in tech shares. Investors had largely positioned themselves for a win by Hillary Clinton but were forced to adjust portfolios quickly in the wake of the stunning Trump upset, he said. The Nasdaq is heavily weighted toward technology names, which were among the weakest sectors of the day, off about 2.2%. Among the top decliners of the space, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +0.76%  fell 2.3% while Broadcom Ltd. AVGO, +1.58%  lost 3.2% and Facebook Inc. FB, +1.34%  dropped 1.9%. “If I am a portfolio manager and need to move my exposures quickly, I sell big cap techs to raise money,” Winer said. “The number of investors who have called me asking me about this trade and the clear pain out there tells me that we are in the seventh inning of this unwind.” The volatility isn’t surprising since investors were expected to continue digesting Trump’s historic victory and the impact it could have on economic policy, strategists said. Although some feared a win for the Republican candidate would spark severe market volatility, stocks shook off their initial jitters and closed higher in Europe and the U.S. on Wednesday. “There was an initial reaction to speculation on issues like fiscal stimulation, for example, but as we get into the coming days and weeks, we’ll need to rethink a lot of our initial reactions,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “There are a lot of things we don’t know, and while it’s tempting to speculate, we need more evidence before we know whether we should zig or zag.” Trump’s presidency is seen as potentially providing a boost to financial and industrial stocks, partly because of his plan to increase fiscal spending to fund infrastructure projects. If instituted, that will benefit construction companies, as well as help banks because bond yields are expected to rise. A possible move toward lighter regulation is also seen helping financial firms. Shares in those sectors were the biggest advancers on Wednesday, and they continued higher on Thursday. Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.55%  rose 2.5%, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -0.12%  and Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.79%  both advanced more than 4%. Pharmaceutical stocks also gained on the prospect that a Trump administration will be less restrictive on drug pricing than Clinton might have been. Shares of Pfizer Inc. PFE, -1.05%  shares rallied 4.3% and Merck & Co. MRK, -0.31%  shares advanced 1.2%. Macy’s Inc. M, -0.79%  reported third-quarter earnings that fell from the prior year and missed expectations. Still, shares of the company jumped 5.6%. Among other markets, Asian stocks also rebounded sharply. The Nikkei 225 index NIK, -0.03%  closed 6.7% higher for its biggest gain since February while European stocks were mostly lower. The ICE Dollar Index DXY, +0.21%  rose 0.3%, recovering from a 0.2% loss on Wednesday, and the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.68%  fell further with the yield rising 8.22 basis points to 2.137% after a dramatic jump in the previous session.

The report forecasts the global animal antibacterial and antibiotics market to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% during the period 2016-2020. Increase in investments is one of the popular trends of this market. The market is witnessing an increase in investments by various government and non-government organizations such as animal welfare associations. For instance, in 2012, the Animal Health Institute member companies invested $747 million in the R&D of new medicines for animals and the maintenance of existing products. Increased investments, especially in the underdeveloped markets of Asia and Africa, are expected to double the growth rate of the market in these regions. According to the report, demand for protein-rich diet will drive growth in the market. Globally, animal products such as milk, eggs, and meat serve a large proportion of the human population. The increase in population is fueling the growth in the demand for food, including animal-based food. Further, the rise in urbanization has created a shift in consumption patterns. Demand for nutrient-dense foods such as animal-based meat and related food items such as milk, egg, and dairy products is on a rise. Further, the report states that stringent regulatory guidelines for obtaining market approvals of animal drugs are a major hindrance to market growth. In the EU, distinct product supply rules for animal products and language barriers among member states affect the efficient and timely distribution of these drugs. For instance, in Italy, the regulations for the animal healthcare sector are more stringent than for the human healthcare sector, which hinders the regulatory approval process.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Trump win boosts stocks, greenback Margreet Dietz Thursday November 10, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on Wall Street rose, bolstered by pharmaceutical stocks, after an upset victory for Republican candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential election. Republicans won the White House as well as both houses of Congress. "The markets were also not pricing in a Republican sweep, but now the victory makes you think maybe something can get done and the Republicans historically are against governments meddling in businesses and that's what you seeing played out today," New York-based JP Morgan Private Bank US equity strategist Nadia Lovell told Reuters. The US dollar also gained, rebounding from an overnight slide. About 85% of 62 respondents in a Reuters survey taken on Wednesday said they expected the Federal Reserve was on track to raise its key interest rate next month, its first hike in a year. At the Wall Street close,, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 256.95 points, or 1.4%, to 18,589.69. The Nasdaq Composite Index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index both rose 1.1% to 5251.07 and 2163.26 respectively. Investors focus on benefits Investors chose to focus on the benefits from a Trump presidency, some analysts said. "At this point it is almost a Rorschach picture. If you want to be positive you can say at face value his policies are reflationary and less regulatory," David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York, told Reuters. "The sectors that benefit from that would be in terms of reflation, it is going to be financials, and less regulation it is going to be healthcare and financials." Rallies in Pfizer and Merck shares, up 7.4% and 7% respectively, led the Dow higher. Pharmaceutical stocks posted a relief rally. The election outcome "substantially diminishes the likelihood of significant pricing reform emanating from Washington," JP Morgan analysts said. Shares of Caterpillar also surged, up 7%. Meanwhile, US Treasurys dropped amid expectations that a Trump presidency will boost spending and inflation. Yields on the 10-year note jumped 15 basis points to 2% at noon in New York. "The long end of the curve is under significant pressure for what the market believes to be the Trump platform: protectionism, retaliatory tariffs and fiscal stimulus, all of which are inflationary and bad for the dollar," Ian Lyngen, the New York-based head of US rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, told Bloomberg. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 1.5% advance from the previous close, underpinned by gains in shares of drugmakers. Germany's DAX Index rose 1.6%, France's CAC 40 Index increased 1.5%, while the UK's FTSE 100 Index gained 1%. (BusinessDesk)   Got a question about this story? Leave it in Comments & Questions below.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 10 November 2016 | MYT 2:48 AM US stocks up 1% after shock Trump election triumph (Update 1) At midday (Wednesday), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.0%, or 185 points, at 18,518.50. The Reuters photo shows an electoral poster of Donald Trump being displayed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange the morning after the US presidential election. NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks move solidly higher by midday Wednesday, to shrug off early losses in the wake of Republican Donald Trump’s stunning victory in the US presidential election. Markets turned positive after hesitant selling following the opening, as hopes of a pro-business agenda partially blunted the higher uncertainty. At midday (1700 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.0%, or 185 points, at 18,518.50.  The broad-based S & P 500 rose 0.7% to 2,155.48, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6% at 5,226.00. It was a stark picture from the panic that struck futures trading just after the election results were known overnight and before the US markets opened, when Dow futures fell more than 700 points. ”The market feels the uncertainty is now over, even though many people are not happy with who won,” said Sam Stovall of CFRA. ”That ends up representing a good buying opportunity, as a lot of people have been recommending buying the dip, and when that happens, you just don’t get any dip.” Shares in sectors threatened by more regulation from a Democratic administration, like drugmakers, soared. Pfizer jumped 7.8%, Merck 6.4%, and Novartis 3.7%. Bank shares also jumped for the same reason, with JPMorgan Chase surging 4.9%, Goldman Sachs 3.4%, and Wells Fargo 5.0%. Also at the top of blue chip gainers was heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, which rocketed 7.4%, likely on hopes it would benefit from a Trump administration’s plans to sharply increase spending on US infrastructure development. Trump is also expected to offer more supportive policies to the energy industry, but oil share gains were modest, in part because oil prices remain depressed on global oversupply. Exxon Mobil rose 0.5% and Chevron gained 0.2%. ”Energy is doing better than the market but is not skyrocketing, mainly because it’s a demand issue and not a political issue that kept oil prices down,” said Stovall. Analysts remained cautious about what a Trump administration would deliver after taking office in late January. ”What people promise on the campaign trail and what actually happens are two different things,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ”So we’re still speculating until he actually takes office and the new Congress comes.” - AFP * See also Stock market 'Trump slump' turns into rally Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Wall Street Related Stories S&P, Nasdaq higher as tech stocks recover; Dow pauses Trump rally falters as investors seek more clarity Post-election rally halts as energy, health stocks drag (Update 1) Losses in health, energy stocks weigh on Wall Street Nasdaq loses ground as heavyweights slump (Update 1) You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Klopp has given Liverpool winning mentality - Coutinho Dept: Need further studies on Malacca relics MRT fare starts at RM1 Property Related advertisement Latest News Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites S&P, Nasdaq higher as tech stocks recover; Dow pauses SP Setia’s sales spike to RM943mil in Q3 HSBC: China-led RCEP in focus as TPP fades MP Evans rejects KL Kepong’s sweetened takeover offer (Update) Most Viewed in Business MRT fare starts at RM1 Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Malaysia Airlines mulls purchase of 25 widebody jets next year EPF, Eco World in JV to develop township, business park in Selangor HSBC: China-led RCEP in focus as TPP fades MP Evans rejects KL Kepong’s sweetened takeover offer (Update) Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites SP Setia’s sales spike to RM943mil in Q3 TM signs RM916mil service deal with MYTV Broadcasting B10 biodiesel mandate deferred to avoid burdening the public advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

While you were sleeping: Stocks, greenback climb Nov. 10 (BusinessDesk) – Wall Street rose, bolstered by pharmaceutical stocks, after an upset victory for Republican candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential election. Republicans won the White House as well as both chambers of Congress. “The markets were also not pricing in a Republican sweep, but now the victory makes you think maybe something can get done and the Republicans historically are against governments meddling in businesses, and that’s what you seeing played out today,” Nadia Lovell, US Equity Strategist at JP Morgan Private Bank in New York, told Reuters. The US dollar also gained, rebounding from an overnight slide. About 85 percent of 62 respondents in a Reuters survey taken on Wednesday they expect the Federal Reserve is on track to raise its key interest rate next month, its first hike in a year. In 1.11pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.7 percent. In 12.56pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.8 percent. Investors chose to focus on the benefits from a Trump presidency, some analysts said. “At this point it is almost a Rorschach picture. If you want to be positive you can say at face value his policies are reflationary and less regulation,” David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York, told Reuters. “The sectors that benefit from that would be in terms of reflation, it is going to be financials, and less regulation it is going to be healthcare and financials,” Lefkowitz noted. Rallies in shares of Pfizer and those of Merck, up 7.4 percent and 7 percent respectively, led the the Dow higher. Pharmaceutical stocks posted a relief rally. The election outcome “substantially diminishes the likelihood of significant pricing reform emanating from Washington,” JP Morgan analysts said in a research note, according to the Wall Street Journal. Shares of Caterpillar also surged, up 7 percent. Meanwhile, US Treasuries dropped amid expectations that a Trump presidency will boost spending and inflation. Yields on the 10-year note jumped 15 basis points to 2 percent as of noon in New York. “The long end of the curve is under significant pressure for what the market believes to be the Trump platform: protectionism, retaliatory tariffs and fiscal stimulus, all of which are inflationary and bad for the dollar,” Ian Lyngen, the New York-based head of US rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, a primary dealer, told Bloomberg. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 1.5 percent advance from the previous close, underpinned by gains in shares of drugmakers. Germany’s DAX Index rose 1.6 percent, France’s CAC 40 Index increased 1.5 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index gained 1 percent.

Posted 10 Nov 2016 00:17 Updated 10 Nov 2016 01:36 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) the morning after Donald Trump won a major upset in the US presidential election. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks move solidly higher by midday on Wednesday (Nov 9), to shrug off early losses in the wake of Republican Donald Trump's stunning victory in the US presidential election. Markets turned positive after hesitant selling following the opening, as hopes of a pro-business agenda partially blunted the higher uncertainty. At midday (1700 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.0 per cent, or 185 points, at 18,518.50. The broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to 2,155.48, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6 per cent at 5,226.00. It was a stark picture from the panic that struck futures trading just after the election results were known overnight and before the US markets opened, when Dow futures fell more than 700 points.

And while Silicon Valley may be concerned about forthcoming national tech policy, there is at least some good news within a mixed bag of results at the local level. In Florida, voters rejected an amendment that would have limited rooftop solar expansion. The proposed tweak to the state’s constitution sought to stop blanket charging for grid upkeep relating to solar installations, which could have meant that anyone with domestic solar had to pay more, or even forfeit payments for electricity fed back into the grid. The vote’s result will help ensure that solar continues to pervade in the state. Meanwhile in Nevada, voters chose to deregulate the state’s electrical market. Currently, both domestic and commercial energy supplies are provided by a single utility, NV Energy. The vote to deregulate could ultimately break its monopoly, though a second vote in 2018 is required to enact the policy. The impact of some issues that were on the ballot remains unclear. Voters in Monroe County, Florida, for example, appear to be torn over a decision on whether to approve the release of genetically modified mosquitoes to fight Zika. Initial results show that 65 percent of voters in Key Haven, the town in Monroe where the trial would take place, rejected the idea, while a countywide vote tallied 58 percent in favor of it. The vote is non-binding, so the Florida Keys Mosquito Control Board will now ultimately decide whether to proceed. Early indications also suggest that Seattle looks likely to approve its Sound Transit 3 plan. The $54 billion scheme is an ambitious proposal to reform the city’s transport systems, laying 62 new miles of new light rail network and building 37 new train stations in order to cut congestion and pollution. But some critics have argued that the plan may turn out to be obsolete before it even gets started if autonomous cars deliver on their promise of transforming city traffic problems. And then, of course, some states have voted against measures that may have created a positive impact. While the final results aren’t yet in, predictions suggest that California appears to have defied expectations and voted against a policy intended to cut drug prices. The state’s Proposition 61 was meant to stop health plans from paying any more than the discounted prices that are offered to the Department of Veterans Affairs by pharmaceutical companies. (A $109 million campaign funded by Merck, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson probably helped as well.) Perhaps most disappointing, though, is the news that Washington State voters chose to reject the country’s first carbon tax. The levy, the likes of which has already been approved in Canada, would have started at $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, steadily rising to $100 in the coming years. But the policy proved controversial. In fact, even environmentalists had chosen to oppose the measure, partly over concerns that it didn’t go far enough in raising money for renewable energy schemes. A mixed result for innovation policy among the states, then. Now we just need to see what happens at the federal level.

(Reuters/Carlo Allegri) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession 2016 November 09, 2016 Investors are sending a signal about Donald Trump’s campaign promises: We believe. Markets have steadied from an overnight tumble that kicked off when the Republican nominee began to morph into the president-elect of the United States. But drama is gripping some very particular sectors: pharma, guns, steel and coal. Coal and steel producers surged. Trump pushed aggressively into US coal country, which he handedly won and has complained about cheap foreign steel and aluminum undercutting US producers, despite questions about supplies used to build Trump-branded hotels. US Steel shares jumped more than 14%. Coal producer Alliance Resource Partners rose 12%. Aluminium producer Alcoa rose nearly 5%. Trump has also promised to spend big on infrastructure, sending shares of construction companies and equipment makers higher. For example, Caterpillar shares rose more than 6%. Drugmakers also surged. Shares of pharmaceutical companies had plunged last year following comments from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on price gouging in the sector. Pfizer rose 7% and Merck gained 3.4%. But gun shares tumbled as Trump’s victory all but scraps the chances for significant curbs on sales. Smith & Wesson shares shed nearly 12% by mid-morning trade; Sturm, Ruger fell close to 13%. These stocks often rise on the heels of mass shootings, such as the Orlando nightclub shooting in June, since such acts of violence drum up worries of stricter rules governing gun control, a shift that could cause consumers to stockpile weapons. One of Trump’s biggest supporters has been the National Rifle Association. Gun sales surged, to two million a month (paywall), following Barack Obama’s re-election and the Sandy Hook massacre. Do keep in mind: the day after the election is a day for knee-jerk reactions. Without a highly-detailed plan on how Trump will follow through on these promises, these sectors could easily turn.

Ogg November 9, 2016 8:40 am EST Print Email Tweet The world is more than surprised that Donald Trump has scored an upset victory over rival Hillary Clinton. Many brokerage firms and economists said that a Trump victory would be awful for stocks, with an immediate correction, but the initial 700-point Dow Jones Industrial Average selling in overnight futures was last seen down only 290 points. UPDATE: This post was edited for closing bell prices as many prices changed for even stronger gains. 24/7 Wall St. has identified several immediate winners from a Donald Trump presidency. These are all surging higher, but there are other winners as well. Trump is deemed to be positive for gold over uncertainty and positive for defense stocks based on the promise to rebuild America’s military. Then there are the infrastructure stocks, and the metals stocks that will theoretically win if they are treated fairly inside and outside of America. Pharmaceuticals may do well selectively also, if the ability for a Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton attack over pricing is off the table. Coal and Energy were not moving as much as some investors might have expected. There are of course other companies that should be viewed positively, but there are probably too many to count in the wee hours of the morning. There will also be the list of big losers that would have surged under a Clinton victory. Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARIA) saw its shares slide after Bernie Sanders went after it for price hikes. While many drug or pharmaceutical stocks will be up, Sanders had effectively gone after Ariad over greed when the reality is that it is still losing money. Ariad also has about $1.4 billion worth of negative retained earnings. The stock has a 52-week trading range of $4.37 to $14.34, with a consensus analyst price target of $13.05. Update for close: closed up 23% at $11.43 on 19.5 million shares. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) was the first and most obvious winner of our prior Trump-Clinton infrastructure winners. Caterpillar shares were last seen up 2.5% at $86.85, after having risen 1.1% the prior day. Caterpillar has a consensus price target of $80.70 and a 52-week range of $56.36 to $89.87. Update for close: Caterpillar closed up 7.7% at $91.20 on 18.7 million shares. Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) was last seen up 4% at $248.75 after Trump’s win as he has said numerous times that he wants to rebuild America’s military. With recent plane contracts in a take it or leave it mode, there are hopes or assumptions the JSF contract will be more favorable now. Lockheed Martin has a consensus price target of $267.76. The 52-week range is $200.47 to $266.93. Update for close: Lockheed Martin closed up 5.9% at $253.36 on almost 4 million shares. Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE) was another obvious winner due to steel and infrastructure. Nucor is also considered an advanced metals company, and the company should be prepared to win if tariffs and other protections are afforded to U.S. companies over foreign companies. Nucor has a 52-week range of $33.90 to $57.08. The consensus price target is $52.25. Update for close: Nucor closed up 12.1% at $57.60 on over 8.7 million shares.

By CiaraLinnane Corporate news editor EmmaCourt Reporter Early-morning election results upended health care stocks in Wednesday morning trade, lifting drug manufacturers and sending health insurers down in a reversal of trends and Wall Street expectations prior to the election. President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act, though his specific replacement plan remains unclear, fomenting uncertainty for health insurers. The president-elect’s position on regulating drug prices similarly remains uncertain. Still, Trump’s victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton — who has been very critical of drug companies and was expected to pursue sector regulation — along with the Republican party’s Congressional sweep were a boon for pharmaceutical and biotech companies’ stocks early Wednesday. Biotech investors had previously been cautious about the sector, fearing a Democratic sweep on election day, according to a Leerink Partners report. The Republican Party’s triple win means “the worst possible outcome for [health care] stocks is a reality,” said Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, since eliminating the ACA would have tremendous implications across “virtually every sub-sector“ and “we have no idea what will replace it.” “The unthinkable has happened,” said Leerink analyst Ana Gupte. An ACA repeal would also leave 20 million people without health insurance, and end popular provisions such as free birth control and young adults’ coverage on their parents’ health insurance plans through age 26. Despite some hints during the campaign, the effects of a Trump presidency on health care are ultimately anyone’s guess, many Wednesday reports concluded. “Trump’s candidacy raised more questions about his healthcare proposals than it provided answers,” said a PwC report. “These economic uncertainties place significant cost pressures on industry stakeholders.” Republican political control does not necessarily mean “that the healthcare regulatory landscape will return to a 2008-like reality,” said a Height Securities report Wednesday. “The burden of governance means that Republicans must replace the ACA with something as it is political suicide to kick 20 million Americans...to the proverbial curb.” Mylan CEO: EpiPen $608 Price Was 'Fair'(3:04) Mylan CEO Heather Bresch responds to questions from the House Oversight Committee regarding costs of the EpiPen. The company raised the list price of the allergy medication 548% over the last nine years, reigniting public outrage over drug prices.

See: Donald Trump’s ‘Access Hollywood’ tape may have cost biotech investors $50 billion Trump has also said that he would allow health insurers to compete across state lines, which he said would keep costs down and allow Americans with pre-existing conditions — who have gained coverage thanks to the ACA — to continue to have health insurance. Health experts have disagreed with his assessment. Legalizing interstate competition would have far-reaching implications for the sector, said Mickey Levy, chief economist for the Americas and Asia at Berenberg. Read more: Donald Trump had the answer to that debate question about Obamacare... on his website Though health care and other sectors are “poised for a sell-off,” Leerink’s Gupte recommended buying “on weakness” stocks such as Humana HUM, +0.09% UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, +0.02% Cigna CI, +0.34%  and Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, +0.64% Anthem Inc. ANTM, +1.20% Centene Corp. CNC, +6.57%  and Molina Healthcare Inc. MOH, +2.38%  should “face uncertainty and policy headwinds...in the years ahead,” Gupte said. Among Dow Jones Industrial Average components, Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.74% was the biggest gainer, rallying 8.0%, Merck & Co. Inc. MRK, -0.24%  jumped 4.4% and Johnson & JNJ, -0.51%  gained 4.2%. The health care subsector of the S&P 500 rose 2.9% , and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF XLV, -0.09%  was up 2.9%. Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare THC, +0.27% which operates acute care hospitals, plummeted 23.7%. Acute care facilities, which “already face multiple headwinds under the current policy and political environment, will now become further disadvantaged as ObamaCare unravels,” Leerink’s Gupte said. UnitedHealth, the nation’s biggest health insurer, tumbled as much as 4% pre-market, subsequently evening out to a 0.7% decline in morning trade. UnitedHealth said earlier this year it would retreat from most ACA marketplaces next year. Away from the Dow, Mylan N.V. MYL, -0.44% the maker of the EpiPen that has been under heavy fire for hiking the price of that lifesaving allergic-reaction treatment, rallied 5.7%. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. VRX, +4.16% jumped as much as 4.8% pre-market, and was up 1.3% in morning trade. By comparison, S&P SPX, +0.33%  futures were down 1.2%.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Non-Insulin Therapies for Diabetes: GLP-1 Agonists, DPP4 Inhibitors and SGLT2 Inhibitors, 2016 – 2026 LONDON, Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — INTRODUCTION Diabetes, considered to be the most common metabolic disorder in humans, is ranked among the top ten fatal diseases in the US. The increasing incidence, growing prevalence and the progressive nature of the disease has spurred several pharmaceutical companies to develop novel approaches / therapies to provide better treatment options for diabetic patients worldwide. While insulin supplements and insulin based therapies represent a major portion of the anti-diabetic drugs market, non-insulin therapies are first line therapies designed especially for patients suffering from type II diabetes. Sulfonylureas, biguanides, glinides, TZDs and alpha- glucosidase inhibitors were the first classes of non-insulin therapies to hit the market. Subsequently, incretin based therapies, such as GLP-1 agonists and DPP4 inhibitors, emerged as the standard of care for the treatment of type II diabetes. More recently, SGLT2 inhibitors have also been identified as an effective treatment solution for the same patient population. These three classes have captured a significant portion of the overall anti-diabetes market in a relatively short time span. GLP-1 agonists and DPP4 inhibitors were introduced in the market over a decade ago while the first SGLT2 inhibitor was approved only in 2012. A number of drugs have emerged as blockbusters; examples include VICTOZA® (GLP-1 agonist), JANUVIA® / JANUMET® (DPP4 inhibitor) and INVOKANA® / INVOKAMET® (SGLT2 inhibitor). Several companies, including both big pharmaceutical players and small to mid-sized companies, are active in this area. Companies engaged in developing anti-diabetic drug classes have actively entered into collaborations with other stakeholders to either acquire / develop / commercialize candidate therapies or for technology licensing. For instance, Tobira acquired the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize evogliptin from Dong-A ST in April 2016; Eli Lilly and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma entered into a sales collaboration agreement for Trulicity® in July 2015; Novo Nordisk in-licensed Zosano’s technology to develop a transdermal patch formulation of Novo’s GLP-1 analogs, including semaglutide in February 2014; Takeda and Sanofi signed a co-promotion agreement for alogliptin in China in April 2013. Recently issued FDA warnings specifically for DPP4 and SGLT2 inhibitors are likely to impact their adoption. However, new advances in drug development and the introduction of novel technologies are expected to help stakeholders operate within a proper framework and work towards eliminating the current gaps.

With a current total / combined share of more than 70% in the overall non-insulin market, GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors represent the three most prominent anti-diabetic drug classes. In terms of size, currently, the market of GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors is worth over USD 4 billion, USD 10 billion and USD 2 billion respectively. Overall, the market is highly fragmented and well distributed across different regions. 2. Combined, the three drug classes have over 20 approved drugs (accounting around 40 different formulations / fixed-dose combinations) for the treatment of type II diabetes. In addition, the clinical / preclinical pipeline is rich and has over 70 molecules in different stages of development. Of the three classes, DPP4 inhibitors currently has the maximum number of marketed drugs (over 10, excluding fixed-dose combinations). On the other hand, GLP-1 agonists represent the most active class of drugs with over 40 molecules under development. SGLT2 inhibitors are also emerging at a rapid pace and already have six marketed drugs across different regions. Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk), ITCA 650 (Intarcia Therapeutics), sotagliflozin (Sanofi / Lexicon Pharmaceuticals), ertugliflozin (Merck / Pfizer), retagliptin (Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine) and gosogliptin (SatRx / Pfizer) are examples of late stage drugs that are likely to receive approval in the near future. 3. Overall we came across over 80 pharmaceutical companies actively engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of non-insulin therapies. Established pharmaceutical players have captured a major share of the non-insulin anti-diabetic drugs market. In fact, AstraZeneca, BMS, Eli Lilly and Sanofi are developing non-insulin therapies across all the three drug classes. Several other companies such as Daiichi Sankyo, Janssen, Merck, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Sanofi, Takeda and Zealand Pharma have invested heavily in the development of multiple molecules belonging to these drug classes. A number of start-ups / small companies such as (in alphabetical order) Alteogen, Amunix, ArisGen, C4XD, Diartis Pharmaceuticals, Oramed Pharmaceutical, PegBio, Poxel, Rani Therapeutics, Receptos, SatRx, Sirona Biochem and Spitfire Pharma have entered this space and are also competing to gain a significant share in the overall non-insulin therapies market. 4. In addition to increased competition of such therapies in the major geographies such as the US and EU, some stakeholders have focused on tapping a localized opportunity. Drugs such as teneligliptin (Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma), trelagliptin (Takeda), ipragliflozin (Astellas Pharma/ Kotobuki Pharmaceutical) and luseogliflozin (Taisho Pharmaceutical) have been approved only in Japan. Similarly, retagliptin (Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine) and Uni-E4 (Uni-Bio Science Group) are in Phase III clinical development in China only. 5. With a vision to increase patient compliance, several pharmaceutical companies have introduced fixed-dose formulations of different drugs. Prominent examples include Eucreas® / Galvumet® / Galvus Met® / Icandra® / Zomarist® (vildagliptin + metformin) (Novartis), INVOKAMET® / VOKANAMET® (canagliflozin + metformin) (Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies / Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma / Daiichi Sankyo), JANUMET® / Velmetia® (sitagliptin + metformin) (Merck), Xigdua® (dapagliflozin + metformin) (Astra Zeneca / BMS) and Xultophy® / IDegLira (liraglutide + insulin degludec) (Novo Nordisk). 6. Technological advancements are amongst the key future growth drivers. Drug developers are investigating new routes of administration using several innovative technology platforms, such as Axcess™ (Diabetology), Eligen® (Emisphere Technologies), PharmFilm® Technology (MonoSol Rx) and the Protein Oral Delivery (POD™) technology (Oramed Pharmaceuticals), to facilitate the oral administration of GLP-1 agonists. Other innovative technologies such as the Intravail® drug delivery platform are attempting to facilitate nasal administration. Companies such as ScinoPharm and Panacea Biotech are developing oral capsule formulations of DPP4 inhibitors. Their molecules, DBPR108 and PBL 1427, respectively, are still in the early stages of clinical development. SGLT2 inhibitors, primarily used to treat type II diabetes, are also being developed for the treatment of type I diabetes. Examples include sotagliflozin (Theracos) and remogliflozin (BHV Pharma). 7. Dual agonist drugs are also being developed to provide more effective treatment options. Examples of molecules that target both the GLP-1 receptor and glucagon receptor include MK-8521 (Merck), TTP401 / LY2944876 (Transition Therapeutics / Eli Lilly), MEDI0382 (AstraZeneca), SAR425899 (Sanofi) and MOD-6030 / MOD-6031 (OPKO Biologics). On the other hand, NN9709 (Novo Nordisk) and SAR438335 (Sanofi) are being developed to act on both GLP-1 and GIP receptors. 8. Several research institutes, companies and organization have made significant contribution to the discovery and overall development of these therapies. During the study, we identified over 400 key opinion leaders who have played critical role in the development of GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors. In addition, we identified over 50 articles, published during the 12 months beginning January 2015, which focused on these three drug classes. The design of these studies primarily focussed on evaluating the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs. 9. Extensive efforts are being made by pharmaceutical companies to explore new and innovative therapeutic strategies and agents that are safer and more effective than the already available options. Many novel non-insulin therapies are under clinical development. Examples of these new anti-diabetic drug classes include glucokinase activators, GPR119 agonists, GCGR antagonists, 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors, glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors and PTP-1B antagonists. 10. It is important to highlight that nearing patent expiries of currently available drugs and the potential health hazards associated with the use of some of these inhibitors are going to negatively impact the market growth. However, our overall outlook is highly promising. We believe that SGLT2 inhibitors are likely to grow at an annualized growth rate of ~17%, followed by GLP-1 agonists (expected growth rate of ~13.4%).

The increasing incidence, growing prevalence and the progressive nature of the disease has spurred several pharmaceutical companies to develop novel approaches / therapies to provide better treatment options for diabetic patients worldwide. While insulin supplements and insulin based therapies represent a major portion of the anti-diabetic drugs market, non-insulin therapies are first line therapies designed especially for patients suffering from type II diabetes. Sulfonylureas, biguanides, glinides, TZDs and alpha- glucosidase inhibitors were the first classes of non-insulin therapies to hit the market. Subsequently, incretin based therapies, such as GLP-1 agonists and DPP4 inhibitors, emerged as the standard of care for the treatment of type II diabetes. More recently, SGLT2 inhibitors have also been identified as an effective treatment solution for the same patient population. These three classes have captured a significant portion of the overall anti-diabetes market in a relatively short time span. GLP-1 agonists and DPP4 inhibitors were introduced in the market over a decade ago while the first SGLT2 inhibitor was approved only in 2012.

Several other companies such as Daiichi Sankyo, Janssen, Merck, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Sanofi, Takeda and Zealand Pharma have invested heavily in the development of multiple molecules belonging to these drug classes. A number of start-ups / small companies such as (in alphabetical order) Alteogen, Amunix, ArisGen, C4XD, Diartis Pharmaceuticals, Oramed Pharmaceutical, PegBio, Poxel, Rani Therapeutics, Receptos, SatRx, Sirona Biochem and Spitfire Pharma have entered this space and are also competing to gain a significant share in the overall non-insulin therapies market. 4. In addition to increased competition of such therapies in the major geographies such as the US and EU, some stakeholders have focused on tapping a localized opportunity. Drugs such as teneligliptin (Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma), trelagliptin (Takeda), ipragliflozin (Astellas Pharma/ Kotobuki Pharmaceutical) and luseogliflozin (Taisho Pharmaceutical) have been approved only in Japan. Similarly, retagliptin (Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine) and Uni-E4 (Uni-Bio Science Group) are in Phase III clinical development in China only. 5. With a vision to increase patient compliance, several pharmaceutical companies have introduced fixed-dose formulations of different drugs. Prominent examples include Eucreas® / Galvumet® / Galvus Met® / Icandra® / Zomarist® (vildagliptin + metformin) (Novartis), INVOKAMET® / VOKANAMET® (canagliflozin + metformin) (Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies / Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma / Daiichi Sankyo), JANUMET® / Velmetia® (sitagliptin + metformin) (Merck), Xigdua® (dapagliflozin + metformin) (Astra Zeneca / BMS) and Xultophy® / IDegLira (liraglutide + insulin degludec) (Novo Nordisk). 6. Technological advancements are amongst the key future growth drivers. Drug developers are investigating new routes of administration using several innovative technology platforms, such as Axcess™ (Diabetology), Eligen® (Emisphere Technologies), PharmFilm® Technology (MonoSol Rx) and the Protein Oral Delivery (POD™) technology (Oramed Pharmaceuticals), to facilitate the oral administration of GLP-1 agonists. Other innovative technologies such as the Intravail® drug delivery platform are attempting to facilitate nasal administration. Companies such as ScinoPharm and Panacea Biotech are developing oral capsule formulations of DPP4 inhibitors. Their molecules, DBPR108 and PBL 1427, respectively, are still in the early stages of clinical development. SGLT2 inhibitors, primarily used to treat type II diabetes, are also being developed for the treatment of type I diabetes. Examples include sotagliflozin (Theracos) and remogliflozin (BHV Pharma). 7. Dual agonist drugs are also being developed to provide more effective treatment options. Examples of molecules that target both the GLP-1 receptor and glucagon receptor include MK-8521 (Merck), TTP401 / LY2944876 (Transition Therapeutics / Eli Lilly), MEDI0382 (AstraZeneca), SAR425899 (Sanofi) and MOD-6030 / MOD-6031 (OPKO Biologics). On the other hand, NN9709 (Novo Nordisk) and SAR438335 (Sanofi) are being developed to act on both GLP-1 and GIP receptors. 8. Several research institutes, companies and organization have made significant contribution to the discovery and overall development of these therapies. During the study, we identified over 400 key opinion leaders who have played critical role in the development of GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors. In addition, we identified over 50 articles, published during the 12 months beginning January 2015, which focused on these three drug classes. The design of these studies primarily focussed on evaluating the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs. 9. Extensive efforts are being made by pharmaceutical companies to explore new and innovative therapeutic strategies and agents that are safer and more effective than the already available options. Many novel non-insulin therapies are under clinical development. Examples of these new anti-diabetic drug classes include glucokinase activators, GPR119 agonists, GCGR antagonists, 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors, glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors and PTP-1B antagonists. 10. It is important to highlight that nearing patent expiries of currently available drugs and the potential health hazards associated with the use of some of these inhibitors are going to negatively impact the market growth. However, our overall outlook is highly promising. We believe that SGLT2 inhibitors are likely to grow at an annualized growth rate of ~17%, followed by GLP-1 agonists (expected growth rate of ~13.4%).

If readers look at the above chart, "Health Care Distributors" looks to be the trouble spot, with companies in that category reporting just 25% of those company's reporting better-than-consensus revenue. 75% of thise companies missed their revenue estimates. The real issue is what happens to Health Care in 2017: here is a quick table of the Health Care sectors "expected" 2017 earnings growth: 11/4/16: +8.8% 10/28/16: +9.5% 10/21/16: +10% 10/14/16: +10.1% 10/7/16: +10.2% 9/30/16: +10.2% 9/23/16: +10.3% While there is some downward pressure as long as the numbers stay above "mid-single-digits" HealthCare should be ok. CVS's guide-down this morning was a shocker. Although the stock is found in Consumer Staples, CVS is tied to the Health Care sector, and the warning around the retail drug segment for 2017 wasn't good. I expected the PBM to be under pressure, not the retail drug segment, Clients are currently "underweight" Health care with the largest position being Pfizer (PFE). Clients do own a little IBB, and some IHE, and PPH, but the positions are small right now. How Prop 61 does tonight in California and the composition of the Senate, will matter. It is price controls that is the biggest risk over the next year. Bristol-Meyers (BMY) has gotten crushed, Pfizer is down from $38 to $31, and testing its uptrend line, Merck is acting very well, I do think there is value in the old-school large-cap pharma stocks.
