Merck will make an initial payment of $625 million to Bristol and Japan's Ono. The company will also pay a 6.5 percent royalty rate on Keytruda sales from January 2017 to December 2023, and a 2.5 percent rate for the subsequent three years. Bristol will get 75 percent of the royalties and Ono will get the rest. Bristol and Ono, which co-developed the first PD-1 antibody called Opdivo, filed the suit against Merck in September 2014, alleging that its sale of Keytruda, also a PD-1 antibody, infringed their patents in markets including the United States, parts of Europe, Australia and Japan. Merck said the $625 million payment will be recorded in the company’s fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results. The settlement comes a day after Bristol-Myers said it wouldn't seek faster approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer, further solidifying Merck's leading position in the burgeoning immuno-oncolgy field. Bristol's shares closed down 11 percent on Friday, but rose marginally in extended trading after the settlement agreement. Merck's shares, which closed up 3.6 percent, were unchanged after the bell.

Lung cancer is by far the biggest oncology market and a handful of companies have been battling to become dominant in initial, or first-line, treatment, and to provide much-needed combination therapies. Merck shares rose 3.6 percent to $62.53, while Bristol fell to $49.23. Bristol-Myers earlier this month suggested it would seek a path to swift approval of an Opdivo/Yervoy combination in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) only to reverse course after reviewing available data. The company did not say whether the data was disappointing or merely insufficient to seek accelerated approval. Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala downgraded his rating on Bristol shares to "market perform" from "outperform" and lowered his price target on the stock to $65 from $85. The quickly changing lung cancer market dynamics could hurt Bristol's earnings per share, Scala said. The news followed Merck's surprise announcement last week that it had filed for a speedy U.S. approval of its Opdivo rival, Keytruda, in combination with chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer, and had received a May 10 regulatory decision date. The Opdivo/Yervoy news "certainly kills any potential for commercial sales in front-line lung cancer for 2017" and could leave Bristol-Myers as the third or fourth entry instead of being first or a close second, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said. But it is by no means a death knell for Opdivo or the combination if the data is ultimately positive. "This is lung cancer," Divan said. "If the combo ends up showing clearly superior efficacy in terms of overall survival, then doctors will switch to that." Opdivo is approved for lung cancer in previously treated patients, as well as advanced melanoma, kidney and head and neck cancers and Hodgkin lymphoma. Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris lowered his estimates for Opdivo sales in 2021 to $8.5 billion from $9.7 billion. REVERSAL OF PECKING ORDER Merck will not only likely be first with a first-line lung combination, but said it will be less expensive due to the lower cost of chemotherapy versus rivals' pairings of newer immuno-oncology drugs. Bristol, which was first to market with potentially game-changing drugs that spur the immune system to fight cancer, was long perceived as the industry leader in immuno-oncology, with Merck hot on its heels and AstraZeneca Plc and Roche Holding AG playing catch-up. That changed in August, when Bristol's Opdivo failed as a monotherapy against first-line lung cancer, where Merck's Keytruda succeeded, resetting the immuno-oncology pecking order. Some analysts said the latest Opdivo setback was good news for AstraZeneca and Roche, allowing them to close the gap on Bristol-Myers. However, Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson noted that Astra's combination includes a CTLA4 drug similar to Bristol's Yervoy. "This could have negative implications for AstraZeneca, who similarly has CTLA4 combination at the heart of its IO platform," he wrote. AstraZeneca shares fell 3.4 percent.

The objective of the CoE is to provide fertility professionals with a strong understanding of the concepts, processes and techniques that are undertaken in high quality clinics in order to help address the unmet needs in assisted reproductive treatment (ART). The centre aims to help optimize procedures to improve treatment outcomes for couples that want to conceive. As a joint venture between Merck and Genea, a developer of innovative fertility technologies, the CoE demonstrates the two partners' commitment to support high standards of education within ART. "The Centre of Excellence is an international training hub addressing the global unmet needs within fertility clinics by promoting standardization of processes for consistently high treatment outcomes," said Dorothea Wenzel, Head of the Global Business Franchise Fertility at the biopharma business of Merck. "Its unique concept is a reflection of the best practice standard in ART clinics that Merck and Genea have developed." The CoE is a state-of-the-art facility for high quality training of healthcare professionals, such as physicians and embryologists, to improve clinical practices, protocols and clinic outcome. Jan Kirsten, Global Head of Fertility Technologies, further explained: "The participants are given the opportunity to experience first-hand how leading science and technologies work in a real clinical environment. Thus, the concept allows Merck to offer practical hands-on training through a training lab and the adjacent Genea clinic, alongside theoretical education." The centre is located in Bangkok, Thailand, and with this central location in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region aims to attract participants from all over the world with focus on APAC and China. The CoE was officially opened with a ceremony held on 16 January 2017. The centre is another collaboration between Merck and Genea, also supported by the partners of the Global Fertility Alliance (GFA), which was founded in 2015. The GFA is driving standardization in ART clinics for improved treatment outcomes. Therefore, the CoE also represents the innovative technologies from the GFA partners including Illumina, a leader in developing and commercializing systems for analysis of genetic variation and function, ZEISS, an internationally leading technology enterprise operating in the optics as well as optoelectronics industries and the associated partner Chart MVE BioMedical, the world's leading manufacturer of cryogenic freezer systems, as well as the latest technology in laser systems from Hamilton Thorne, Inc.

Cory Renauer (TMFang4apples) Jan 20, 2017 at 12:51PM Image source: Getty Images. What happened Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY), a big pharma company trying to pivot toward oncology, have fallen about 9.8% as of 11:50 a.m. EST Friday. An announcement that it won't seek accelerated approval for a combination lung cancer therapy comprised of two key drugs isn't sitting well with the market in light of Merck & Co.'s (NYSE:MRK) recent push into the same arena. So what  Lung cancer might not be the most common malignancy, but it is the deadliest. That is why Merck and Bristol-Myers have been fighting tooth and nail to get their PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, Keytruda and Opdivo, to the front of the line in the treatment order. Both drugs prevent a variety of tumors from shutting down an immune system attack, and they're currently approved in the U.S. for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. An approval to treat newly diagnosed, untreated NSCLC patients is expected to add billions annually to either company's total annual revenue. Bristol's recent announcement that it wouldn't seek accelerated approval for the combination of Opdivo with another of its well established immunotherapies, Yervoy, is troubling. Last summer, Bristol's stock slid after Opdivo monotherapy failed to provide a progression-free survival benefit over standard chemotherapy among first-line NSCLC patients. The failure was especially pungent because Merck's drug of the same class, Keytruda, hit the mark Opdivo missed in September, albeit among patients with a higher expression of the therapies' target protein. Now what The FDA granted Keytruda a speedy approval as a first-line NSCLC monotherapy in October, and recently accepted an application that could cement its position at the front of the line before Bristol-Myers has a chance to compete. The Agency recently accepted a submission for Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for all advanced stage first-line NSCLC patients, not only those with high expression of the immunotherapy's target protein. The FDA is expected to announce a decision in May, although I wouldn't be surprised by another early approval given the unmet need for such a serious disease. Without an application ready for Opdivo as a first-line treatment, it seems like Bristol-Myers chances of gaining a much larger share of the NSCLC space are slimmer than ever.

 Bristol-Myers shares are sliding after some bad news on its lung cancer drug Lydia Ramsey and Reuters Jan. 20, 2017, 11:06 AM 1,179 facebook linkedin twitter email print Markets Insider The competition over a new class of cancer drugs is heating up. On Thursday, drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb said that it wouldn't go for an accelerated US approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer — helping its rival, Merck pull ahead. Shares of BMS were down 9% Friday morning on the news, while Merck was up 3.6%.  BMS cited "a review of data available at this time" for the decision to hold off on filing for Food and Drug Administration approval of the combination of its cancer drugs Opdivo and Yervoy. Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said in a research note that he still expects the BMS immunotherapy combination to be approved in the second half of 2018 and sees "no real change to valuation or estimates as a result of this update." But the move helps secure Merck's current lead in the development of combination lung cancer treatments.  Merck last week said U.S. regulators had agreed to an accelerated review of its application to combine immune system-boosting drug Keytruda with chemotherapy as an initial therapy for advanced lung cancer. Merck said the FDA would decide by May 10 whether to approve its combination treatment. Why the combination cancer treatment is key Lung cancer is the second most common type of cancer, after breast cancer, and it's one of the deadliest. Keytruda and Opdivo, which both block a protein called PD-1 to boost the ability of the body's own immune system to kill cancer cells, are already approved to treat a range of cancers, but their biggest market would be first-line lung cancer. Yervoy targets a different protein called CTLA-4. Immunotherapy is revolutionizing some areas of cancer care but giving it on its own only seems to work better than chemotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients who have high levels of a protein called PD-L1. Merck's Keytruda is already approved for such patients. But not everybody responds to the PD-1 drugs. Just a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have tumors with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1. That leaves about 70% of the market still up for grabs for combinations that could include chemotherapy or other forms of immunotherapy. Jefferies' Holford said he still expects the front line, or initial, treatment of NSCLC patients to evolve toward combinations of immunotherapy drugs without chemotherapy, where BMS and AstraZeneca have super positions.

In a statement, Bristol Myers said it had made the decision about Opdivo/Yervoy after assessing the data available. The news was set to knock US$6bn off the pharma giant’s market value when trading got underway, while giving a major boost to rival Merck that has a competing drug. Merck’s treatment for first line lung cancer, Keytruda, received regulatory approval last December. Checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo is big earner for Bristol Myers, but a failure of its trial as a single therapy for non-small cell lung cancer wiped US$24bn from the company’s value in August due to the size and importance of this market. After that result, analysts said the best hope in this indication was a combination therapy where four trials are currently underway. A filing for approval will not now likely go ahead under 2018 and that depends on results from the trials. As well as Merck, the UK’s AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) and Swiss firm Roche also have lung cancer drugs in development.

The objective of the CoE is to provide fertility professionals with a strong understanding of the concepts, processes and techniques that are undertaken in high quality clinics in order to help address the unmet needs in assisted reproductive treatment (ART). The centre aims to help optimize procedures to improve treatment outcomes for couples that want to conceive. As a joint venture between Merck and Genea, a developer of innovative fertility technologies, the CoE demonstrates the two partners' commitment to support high standards of education within ART. "The Centre of Excellence is an international training hub addressing the global unmet needs within fertility clinics by promoting standardization of processes for consistently high treatment outcomes," said Dorothea Wenzel, Head of the Global Business Franchise Fertility at the biopharma business of Merck. "Its unique concept is a reflection of the best practice standard in ART clinics that Merck and Genea have developed." The CoE is a state-of-the-art facility for high quality training of healthcare professionals, such as physicians and embryologists, to improve clinical practices, protocols and clinic outcome. Jan Kirsten, Global Head of Fertility Technologies, further explained: "The participants are given the opportunity to experience first-hand how leading science and technologies work in a real clinical environment.

The centre aims to help optimize procedures to improve treatment outcomes for couples that want to conceive. As a joint venture between Merck and Genea, a developer of innovative fertility technologies, the CoE demonstrates the two partners' commitment to support high standards of education within ART. "The Centre of Excellence is an international training hub addressing the global unmet needs within fertility clinics by promoting standardization of processes for consistently high treatment outcomes," said Dorothea Wenzel, Head of the Global Business Franchise Fertility at the biopharma business of Merck. "Its unique concept is a reflection of the best practice standard in ART clinics that Merck and Genea have developed." The CoE is a state-of-the-art facility for high quality training of healthcare professionals, such as physicians and embryologists, to improve clinical practices, protocols and clinic outcome. Jan Kirsten, Global Head of Fertility Technologies, further explained: "The participants are given the opportunity to experience first-hand how leading science and technologies work in a real clinical environment. Thus, the concept allows Merck to offer practical hands-on training through a training lab and the adjacent Genea clinic, alongside theoretical education." The centre is located in Bangkok, Thailand, and with this central location in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region aims to attract participants from all over the world with focus on APAC and China. The CoE was officially opened with a ceremony held on 16 January 2017. The centre is another collaboration between Merck and Genea, also supported by the partners of the Global Fertility Alliance (GFA), which was founded in 2015. The GFA is driving standardization in ART clinics for improved treatment outcomes. Therefore, the CoE also represents the innovative technologies from the GFA partners including Illumina, a leader in developing and commercializing systems for analysis of genetic variation and function, ZEISS, an internationally leading technology enterprise operating in the optics as well as optoelectronics industries and the associated partner Chart MVE BioMedical, the world's leading manufacturer of cryogenic freezer systems, as well as the latest technology in laser systems from Hamilton Thorne, Inc.

The pharma company has said it no longer intends to file for accelerated approval for the combination of PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) and CTLA4 inhibitor Yervoy in that indication, giving arch-rival Merck & Co further time to consolidate its lead in previously untreated NSCLC patients. BMS said that after reviewing data on the combination it had decided to hold off for the moment, but "in order to protect the integrity of ongoing registrational studies … will not be providing additional details". Analysts at Jefferies said that the delay to approval did not change forecasts for BMS' immuno-oncology portfolio, but they now expect a later approval for the Opdivo/Yervoy combination in the second half of 2018. BMS' hopes of muscling into first-line NSCLC rest on the combination of Opdivo with Yervoy after Opdivo alone failed to meet its targets in the phase III CheckMate-026 trial, performing worse than chemotherapy. The setback allowed Merck's PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) to become the first - and so far unchallenged - immuno-oncology drug for front-line NSCLC treatment, albeit only for patients whose tumours express the PD-L1 biomarker. That lead could be further consolidated if Merck gets approval for the combination of Keytruda with chemotherapy, which has just been granted an accelerated review by the US FDA. On their own, checkpoint inhibitors like Keytruda can generally only be used in up to a third of new NSCLC patients, so combination therapies are seen as the key to unlocking a much larger patient population. Merck is seeking approval for 'all-comer' patients in its chemotherapy combination application, and other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor developers - including AstraZeneca and Roche - are taking a similarly inclusive approach.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Deena Beasley Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on Thursday said it has decided not to seek accelerated U.S. approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer. Shares of Bristol, which closed at $55.49 on the New York Stock Exchange, were down 6.2 percent at $52.08 after hours. The pharmaceutical company cited "a review of data available at this time" for the decision to hold off on filing for Food and Drug Administration approval of the combination of its cancer drugs Opdivo and Yervoy. Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said in a research note that he still expects the Bristol immunotherapy combination to be approved in the second half of 2018 and sees "no real change to valuation or estimates as a result of this update." But the move helps secure Merck & Co Inc's current lead in the development of combination lung cancer treatments. Merck last week said U.S. regulators had agreed to an accelerated review of its application to combine immune system-boosting drug Keytruda with chemotherapy as an initial therapy for advanced lung cancer. Merck said the FDA would decide by May 10 whether to approve its combination treatment. Keytruda and Opdivo, which both block a protein called PD-1 to boost the ability of the body's own immune system to kill cancer cells, are already approved to treat a range of cancers, but their biggest market would be first-line lung cancer. Yervoy targets a different protein called CTLA-4. Immunotherapy is revolutionizing some areas of cancer care but giving it on its own only seems to work better than chemotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients who have high levels of a protein called PD-L1. Merck's Keytruda is already approved for such patients. Since just a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have tumors with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1, around 70 percent of the market is still up for grabs for successful combination products. Jefferies' Holford said he still expects the front line, or initial, treatment of NSCLC patients to evolve toward combinations of immunotherapy drugs without chemotherapy, where Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca Plc have super positions.

Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical Company Enter Settlement and License Agreement with Merck to Resolve PD-1 Antibody Patent Litigation Merck to pay Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ono royalties on global sales of Keytruda through 2026, and lump-sum payment of $625 million Ends all global patent-infringement litigation against Merck’s sale of Keytruda Recognizes validity of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ono’s PD-1 antibody patents January 20, 2017 04:01 PM Eastern Standard Time NEW YORK & OSAKA, Japan--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and Ono Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd. today announced the companies have signed a global patent license agreement with Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) to settle all patent-infringement litigation related to Merck’s PD-1 antibody Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The agreement will result in the dismissal with prejudice of all patent litigation between the companies pertaining to Keytruda. Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ono, who discovered and developed the PD-1 antibody Opdivo (nivolumab), had asserted in litigation that Merck’s sale of Keytruda infringed the companies’ patents relating to the use of PD-1 antibodies to treat cancer in the U.S., Europe (United Kingdom, Netherlands, France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and Switzerland), Australia, and Japan. As part of the agreement, Merck will make an initial payment of $625 million to Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ono. Merck is also obligated to pay ongoing royalties on global sales of Keytruda of 6.5% from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2023, and 2.5% from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026. Under the agreement, the companies have also granted certain rights to each other under their respective patent portfolios pertaining to PD-1. The royalties will be shared between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ono in a 75/25 percent allocation, respectively. “Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ono’s agreement with Merck protects our scientific discoveries and validates the strong intellectual property rights we secured as the early innovators in the science of PD-1, a key mechanism in Immuno-Oncology that has proven to have transformational impact in cancer care,” says Giovanni Caforio, M.D., chief executive officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb. “Today’s agreement is also a good decision for patients as it supports the continuation of ongoing research and maintains access to anti-PD-1 therapies for cancer patients around the world.” Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the body’s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response. By harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, Opdivo has become an important treatment option across multiple cancers. Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world in July 2014, and currently has regulatory approval in 60 countries including the United States, Japan, and in the European Union.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune-mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of YERVOY. Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests (LFTs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests at baseline and before each dose. Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and for symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or more severe pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 and withhold until resolution for Grade 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, fatal cases of immune-mediated pneumonitis have occurred. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 6% (25/407) of patients. In Checkmate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 4.9% (13/263) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (9/263) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2 (n=8). Immune-Mediated Colitis OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 (of more than 5 days duration), 3, or 4 colitis. Withhold OPDIVO monotherapy for Grade 2 or 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 or recurrent colitis upon re-initiation of OPDIVO. When administered with YERVOY, withhold OPDIVO and YERVOY for Grade 2 and permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent colitis.

In a separate Phase 3 study of YERVOY 3 mg/kg, severe, life-threatening, or fatal (diarrhea of ≥7 stools above baseline, fever, ileus, peritoneal signs; Grade 3-5) immune-mediated enterocolitis occurred in 34 (7%) patients. Across all YERVOY-treated patients in that study (n=511), 5 (1%) developed intestinal perforation, 4 (0.8%) died as a result of complications, and 26 (5%) were hospitalized for severe enterocolitis. Immune-Mediated Hepatitis OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater transaminase elevations. Withhold for Grade 2 and permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated hepatitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.8% (35/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 13% (51/407) of patients. In a separate Phase 3 study of YERVOY 3 mg/kg, severe, life-threatening, or fatal hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT elevations >5x the ULN or total bilirubin elevations >3x the ULN; Grade 3-5) occurred in 8 (2%) patients, with fatal hepatic failure in 0.2% and hospitalization in 0.4%. Immune-Mediated Neuropathies In a separate Phase 3 study of YERVOY 3 mg/kg, 1 case of fatal Guillain-Barré syndrome and 1 case of severe (Grade 3) peripheral motor neuropathy were reported. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis, immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency, autoimmune thyroid disorders, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis, signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, thyroid function prior to and periodically during treatment, and hyperglycemia. Administer hormone replacement as clinically indicated and corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hypophysitis. Withhold for Grade 2 or 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 hypophysitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 3 or 4 adrenal insufficiency. Withhold for Grade 2 and permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 adrenal insufficiency. Administer hormone-replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Initiate medical management for control of hyperthyroidism. Withhold OPDIVO for Grade 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 hyperglycemia. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (12/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, hypophysitis occurred in 9% (36/407) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1% (20/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 5% (21/407) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, hypothyroidism or thyroiditis resulting in hypothyroidism occurred in 9% (171/1994) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 2.7% (54/1994) of patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy. In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, hypothyroidism or thyroiditis resulting in hypothyroidism occurred in 22% (89/407) of patients.

In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, diabetes occurred in 1.5% (6/407) of patients. In a separate Phase 3 study of YERVOY 3 mg/kg, severe to life-threatening immune-mediated endocrinopathies (requiring hospitalization, urgent medical intervention, or interfering with activities of daily living; Grade 3-4) occurred in 9 (1.8%) patients. All 9 patients had hypopituitarism, and some had additional concomitant endocrinopathies such as adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism. 6 of the 9 patients were hospitalized for severe endocrinopathies. Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Monitor patients for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids for Grades 2-4 increased serum creatinine. Withhold OPDIVO for Grade 2 or 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 increased serum creatinine. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction occurred in 1.2% (23/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction occurred in 2.2% (9/407) of patients. Immune-Mediated Skin Adverse Reactions and Dermatitis OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some cases with fatal outcome. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 3 or 4 rash. Withhold for Grade 3 and permanently discontinue for Grade 4 rash. For symptoms or signs of SJS or TEN, withhold OPDIVO and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment; if confirmed, permanently discontinue. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, immune-mediated rash occurred in 9% (171/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, immune-mediated rash occurred in 22.6% (92/407) of patients. In a separate Phase 3 study of YERVOY 3 mg/kg, severe, life-threatening, or fatal immune-mediated dermatitis (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or rash complicated by full thickness dermal ulceration, or necrotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations; Grade 3-5) occurred in 13 (2.5%) patients. 1 (0.2%) patient died as a result of toxic epidermal necrolysis. 1 additional patient required hospitalization for severe dermatitis. Immune-Mediated Encephalitis OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated encephalitis. Evaluation of patients with neurologic symptoms may include, but not be limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture. Withhold OPDIVO in patients with new-onset moderate to severe neurologic signs or symptoms and evaluate to rule out other causes. If other etiologies are ruled out, administer corticosteroids and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for immune-mediated encephalitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, encephalitis occurred in 0.2% (3/1994) of patients. Fatal limbic encephalitis occurred in one patient after 7.2 months of exposure despite discontinuation of OPDIVO and administration of corticosteroids. Encephalitis occurred in one patient receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY (0.2%) after 1.7 months of exposure. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions Based on the severity of adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold treatment, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in <1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), myositis, myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, motor dysfunction, vasculitis, and myasthenic syndrome. Infusion Reactions OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in <1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO Complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who received allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO. Outcomes were evaluated in 17 patients from Checkmate 205 and 039, who underwent allogeneic HSCT after discontinuing OPDIVO (15 with reduced-intensity conditioning, 2 with myeloablative conditioning). Thirty-five percent (6/17) of patients died from complications of allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO. Five deaths occurred in the setting of severe or refractory GVHD. Grade 3 or higher acute GVHD was reported in 29% (5/17) of patients. Hyperacute GVHD was reported in 20% (n=2) of patients. A steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, without an identified infectious cause, was reported in 35% (n=6) of patients. Two cases of encephalitis were reported: Grade 3 (n=1) lymphocytic encephalitis without an identified infectious cause, and Grade 3 (n=1) suspected viral encephalitis. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) occurred in one patient, who received reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT and died of GVHD and multi-organ failure. Other cases of hepatic VOD after reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD have also been reported. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO. Lactation It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue nursing during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.

(MRK) Stock Is Higher Today Jan 20, 2017, 1:09 pm EST  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer     Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stock is surging Friday as a major competitor fell a step behind the pharmaceutical company. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) said it would not seek accelerated approval for a combination of two new approved drugs designed to tread lung cancer. Opdivo and Yervoy are designed for lung cancer patients who were recently diagnosed. The company opted not to seek accelerated approval as such a move would add risk to the sales of Opdivo. Bristol-Myers noted that competitors may be moving quickly due to the company’s decision not to do so. Last week, Merck & Co’s Keytruda cancer drug received a swift review from U.S. regulators. The medication is designed to be used along with chemotherapy in order to treat lung cancer, and it is believed that the medication now has great potential to be the preeminent drug to treat the condition. Additionally, Keytruda use in combination therapy could be quite effective as it is cheaper than some rival approaches. By May 10, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will decide whether or not this combination therapy is an effective and safe one for advanced lung cancer. Lung cancer is the most profitable and largest segment of cancer in the market. Merck & Co. could quickly be eons ahead of rival companies in the treatment of the affliction thanks to Keytruda. MRK stock popped 3.6% Friday. BMY shares slumped 10.8%.

Cory Renauer (TMFang4apples) Jan 20, 2017 at 12:51PM Image source: Getty Images. What happened Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY), a big pharma company trying to pivot toward oncology, have fallen about 9.8% as of 11:50 a.m. EST Friday. An announcement that it won't seek accelerated approval for a combination lung cancer therapy comprised of two key drugs isn't sitting well with the market in light of Merck & Co.'s (NYSE:MRK) recent push into the same arena. So what  Lung cancer might not be the most common malignancy, but it is the deadliest. That is why Merck and Bristol-Myers have been fighting tooth and nail to get their PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, Keytruda and Opdivo, to the front of the line in the treatment order. Both drugs prevent a variety of tumors from shutting down an immune system attack, and they're currently approved in the U.S. for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. An approval to treat newly diagnosed, untreated NSCLC patients is expected to add billions annually to either company's total annual revenue. Bristol's recent announcement that it wouldn't seek accelerated approval for the combination of Opdivo with another of its well established immunotherapies, Yervoy, is troubling. Last summer, Bristol's stock slid after Opdivo monotherapy failed to provide a progression-free survival benefit over standard chemotherapy among first-line NSCLC patients. The failure was especially pungent because Merck's drug of the same class, Keytruda, hit the mark Opdivo missed in September, albeit among patients with a higher expression of the therapies' target protein. Now what The FDA granted Keytruda a speedy approval as a first-line NSCLC monotherapy in October, and recently accepted an application that could cement its position at the front of the line before Bristol-Myers has a chance to compete. The Agency recently accepted a submission for Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for all advanced stage first-line NSCLC patients, not only those with high expression of the immunotherapy's target protein. The FDA is expected to announce a decision in May, although I wouldn't be surprised by another early approval given the unmet need for such a serious disease. Without an application ready for Opdivo as a first-line treatment, it seems like Bristol-Myers chances of gaining a much larger share of the NSCLC space are slimmer than ever.

Robert Willett rwillett@newsobserver.com Aimee Morgan, left and April Comstock collaborate at The Pink Ceiling, a business incubator, consulting firm at N. Hills, founded by Cindy Whitehead on Wednesday, January 18, 2017 in Raleigh, N.C. Robert Willett rwillett@newsobserver.com 1 of 2 i By Madison Iszler miszler@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story RALEIGH When Cindy Whitehead marched into meetings to pitch Addyi, the first-ever prescription libido pill for women, none of the investors or venture capitalists in the audience were female. Beyond investors, leadership in the healthcare field lacked gender diversity, the former Sprout Pharmaceuticals CEO observed. “Women control the majority of healthcare decisions for their households, but so few women actually run healthcare companies,” she said. “There’s a disconnect in that, and there are so few mentoring opportunities for women.” Whitehead’s latest business venture, The Pink Ceiling, aims to fix those problems. The company, which launched in April and has offices in Raleigh and Miramar Beach, Fla., partners with startups focused on products or services that help women and provides mentoring, seed investing and consulting services. Less than a year later, Whitehead and her all-women team are adding another facet of The Pink Ceiling: the Pinkubator, a membership service that begins Feb. 1. The Triangle area is home to many business incubators and co-working spaces, such as American Underground and HQ Raleigh, but the Pinkubator is the first women-focused one. Seven companies have signed up for on-site memberships, which cost $500 per month and include monthly meetings with the Pink Ceiling team, brainstorming sessions and access to the company’s office in North Hills. Located in a suite at 4350 Lassiter at North Hills Ave, the workspace includes meeting rooms, printing and WiFi along with rosé on tap, snacks and pink everything – lockers, chairs, a phone booth. I don’t think the next billion-dollar idea is coming out of Silicon Valley. It’s coming out of a place like Raleigh. Cindy Whitehead, who started Pink Ceiling Virtual members pay $99 per month for a smaller array of services, including a bi-weekly phone call with the Pink Ceiling team, free admission to events and investment possibilities. About 50 women have signed up. Though she won’t release the names yet, Whitehead said the women who have joined the Pinkubator are in various stages of business development, ranging from millions of dollars in funding to a basic idea. “It’s an interesting mix, and that’s going to be what makes it great,” she said. Diverse background Whitehead’s own background is a diverse mix of experiences. She was born in upstate New York and her family moved around frequently, with Whitehead attending a different school every year from fourth through 12th grade. While studying at Marymount University in Virginia, she decided she wanted to work for Merck, one of the world’s largest drug companies – not because she loved pharmaceuticals, but because of Merck’s reputation as one of the best Fortune 500 companies to work for. Eight months after she graduated in 1994, Merck hired her. Several years later, she followed the advice of her brother, who told her to leave the corporate world and work for a smaller company, and joined San Diego-based Dura Pharmaceuticals. After Irish drug company Elan Corporation bought Dura, Whitehead decided she needed “a new challenge” and joined advertising agency McCann Erickson, where she worked on skincare products. Next, she headed to QVC, where she helped women’s brands connect with the popular shopping channel. In 2005, Whitehead and her former husband, Bob Whitehead, moved to Raleigh and started Slate Pharmaceuticals. At Slate, the couple produced Testopel, a testosterone pellet, but ran afoul of the Food and Drug Administration for misleading marketing claims in 2010. ‘Pink pill’ The following year, they sold Slate and launched Sprout Pharmaceuticals, the birthplace of Addyi (pronounced “addie”). For four years, Whitehead fought for FDA approval for the “little pink pill,” the first prescription drug to boost women’s sex drive. After two failed attempts, Addyi was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015. Shortly after the approval, Valeant Pharmaceuticals bought Sprout for $1 billion and cut the Addyi salesforce. Valeant was in the midst of a drug-pricing scandal, and Whitehead stepped down as CEO. The following year, she started The Pink Ceiling, and for now she’s staying in Raleigh. “There’s a workforce, get-it-done mentality here that is very different than ‘I need to be the next unicorn,’ and I think that’s refreshing,” she said. “I don’t think the next billion-dollar idea is coming out of Silicon Valley. It’s coming out of a place like Raleigh.” Madison Iszler: 919-836-4952; @madisoniszler Related content Entrepreneur Cindy Whitehead and her latest venture: Pink Ceiling LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:32 New McClatchy CEO discusses journalism and the digital age Pause 1:47 INC Research to bring 550 jobs to Morrisville 1:27 Sara Glines named publisher of The News and Observer 9:31 Berger frustrated after failure to repeal HB2 3:38 Under the Dome: First day of the legislative session 1:19 Pitmaster Ed Mitchell explains his passion for barbecue 2:03 Duke's Jeff Capel cites play of State's Dennis Smith, Jr. as the Wolfpack upsets the Blue Devils 84-82. 4:18 NC State's Abu on Duke: 'That game's over' 2:29 Mexico president Pena Nieto rejects U.S. decision to build wall 1:40 Hundreds gather in Durham to support refugees and protest Trump policy Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email a day ago New McClatchy CEO discusses journalism and the digital age 1:39 a day ago New McClatchy CEO discusses journalism and the digital age 1:34 4 days ago Trump pledges huge tax cuts for business 0:41 8 days ago New hotel nears completion in downtown Raleigh View more video Today's Market Nasdaq Powered by Barchart Business NC Revenue Department tax proposal draws ire of business, taxpayer groups Americans: Not so fast with dismantling Obamacare, poll finds Trump's choice for labor secretary outsourced jobs Double drive-through dilemma: Who goes first?

Merck and Genea Open Centre of Excellence for Fertility Merck and Genea Open Centre of Excellence for Fertility CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 20/01/2017 11:43 DARMSTADT, Germany, January 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Not intended for U.S. based media   Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced the opening of its first Centre of Excellence (CoE) for fertility. The objective of the CoE is to provide fertility professionals with a strong understanding of the concepts, processes and techniques that are undertaken in high quality clinics in order to help address the unmet needs in assisted reproductive treatment (ART). The centre aims to help optimize procedures to improve treatment outcomes for couples that want to conceive. As a joint venture between Merck and Genea, a developer of innovative fertility technologies, the CoE demonstrates the two partners' commitment to support high standards of education within ART. "The Centre of Excellence is an international training hub addressing the global unmet needs within fertility clinics by promoting standardization of processes for consistently high treatment outcomes," said Dorothea Wenzel, Head of the Global Business Franchise Fertility at the biopharma business of Merck. "Its unique concept is a reflection of the best practice standard in ART clinics that Merck and Genea have developed." The CoE is a state-of-the-art facility for high quality training of healthcare professionals, such as physicians and embryologists, to improve clinical practices, protocols and clinic outcome. Jan Kirsten, Global Head of Fertility Technologies, further explained: "The participants are given the opportunity to experience first-hand how leading science and technologies work in a real clinical environment. Thus, the concept allows Merck to offer practical hands-on training through a training lab and the adjacent Genea clinic, alongside theoretical education." The centre is located in Bangkok, Thailand, and with this central location in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region aims to attract participants from all over the world with focus on APAC and China. The CoE was officially opened with a ceremony held on 16 January 2017. The centre is another collaboration between Merck and Genea, also supported by the partners of the Global Fertility Alliance (GFA), which was founded in 2015. The GFA is driving standardization in ART clinics for improved treatment outcomes. Therefore, the CoE also represents the innovative technologies from the GFA partners including Illumina, a leader in developing and commercializing systems for analysis of genetic variation and function, ZEISS, an internationally leading technology enterprise operating in the optics as well as optoelectronics industries and the associated partner Chart MVE BioMedical, the world's leading manufacturer of cryogenic freezer systems, as well as the latest technology in laser systems from Hamilton Thorne, Inc.

Equities traded higher in the morning and dipped beginning in the early afternoon, but the three major indexes have stayed in the green all day with about half an hour to go before the closing bell. WTI crude oil for February delivery settled at $52.42 a barrel, up about 2% on the day for a weekly gain of 0.1%. February gold added 0.3% on the day to settle at $1,204.90. Equities were headed for a higher close close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded up 0.41% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.23%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.15%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Friday was Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) which traded up 3.90% at $62.68. The stock’s 52-week range is $47.97 to $65.46. Volume was about 70% higher than the daily average of around 11.2 million shares. The company had no specific news Friday, but rival Bristol-Myers said this morning that it would not see accelerated approval for its lung cancer drug and that leaves Merck in the driver’s seat. The Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) traded up 3.24% at $87.44. The stock’s 52-week range is $76.55 to $90.33. Volume was about double the daily average of around 9.3 million shares. The company reported good second-quarter sales growth and raised its fiscal year forecast. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) traded up 1.97% at $170.10. The stock’s 52-week range is $116.90 to $170.62, a new 52-week high posted today. Volume was nearly 3 times the daily average of around 3.5 million shares. The company had no specific news. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) traded up about 1.23% at $85.77. The stock’s 52-week range is $73.55 to $95.55. Volume was about 15% above the daily average of around 11.1 million shares. The company had no specific news Friday. Of the Dow 30 stocks, 18 are on track to close higher Friday and 12 are set to close lower.

He previously wrote about management and corporate strategy for Quartz and Business Insider. Follow @MaxNisen Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Jan 20, 2017 2:01 PM EST MERCK & CO. INC. +0.55 At Closing, Jan 27th 61.75 USD BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB CO +0.92 At Closing, Jan 27th 47.74 USD Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. started 2016 as the acknowledged king of immune-boosting cancer drugs. That position has never looked shakier.  Thursday evening, Bristol announced it won't seek accelerated FDA approval for a combination of its leading cancer drug Opdivo and another immune-oncology (IO) drug called Yervoy in treating newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients. This decision reinforces something I've noted before: After a series of shocking setbacks for Bristol, Merck & Co. Inc. and its competing drug Keytruda have taken a possibly insurmountable lung-cancer lead with a different and likely safer approach. Bristol shares were down 9 percent on Friday.  It also highlights the risks of Bristol's decision to hang too much of its hopes for growth on Opdivo. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, Bristol has 41 trials of the Opdivo-Yervoy combo ongoing, 12 of them in late stages. An estimated 24 percent of the company's sales came from those two drugs in 2016. Bristol's R&D spending is also narrowly focused on expanding Opdivo's opportunity. The company only has two new drugs in Phase 3 trials, and neither are expected to be blockbusters or to have much impact on sales growth through 2020. Beyond its growing blood-thinner Eliquis, which is expected to add more than $2 billion in sales through 2020, Bristol doesn't have much going for it, other than a set of relatively early-stage projects.  Bristol's singular focus on Opdivo looked fine when the drug was growing at a breakneck pace with a seemingly unassailable lead; I argued as much a year ago. And Opdivo still has its lead, with analysts estimating it outsold Keytruda by more than $2 billion in 2016. But now Bristol's lack of balance is a liability.  To The Victor Go The Spoils The race for dominance in the multi-billion-dollar immune-oncology market has caused multi-billion-dollar swings in the market caps of two leading competitors Source: Bloomberg Lung cancer is a huge market, and it causes more deaths than any other kind of cancer. A substantial portion of Opdivo's estimated $3.5 billion in 2016 revenue came from treating lung-cancer patients that had failed other therapies, a market in which Bristol recently claimed 60 to 70 percent share. Treating newly diagnosed patients would have vastly expanded the drug's reach. But Bristol's setbacks have limited that opportunity and shaved more than $4 billion from analyst estimates of the drug's 2020 sales. It was once unthinkable that Keytruda would exceed Opdivo in total sales. Now it may be inevitable.  The Higher You Go... The harder you fall. Buoyed by a rapid series of approvals, Opdivo's sales potential looked limitless until it hit a wall in lung cancer Source: Bloomberg Bristol's pain is partly due to its own aggressive approach; it sought overly broad FDA approval for Opdivo as a stand-alone treatment in a trial that failed in August. And its chose to focus on a combo of its own IO drugs, while Merck mixed its drug with another company's older, relatively safer chemotherapy.  Lung cancer may just be the start of Bristol's problems. IO drugs are also used or are being tested in a variety of other cancers, including Hodgkins Lymphoma and gastric cancer. Opdivo still has a leading position in some of these areas, and its combination with Yervoy in treating some patients with melanoma was the first IO duo to make it to market. Opdivo may have better luck in treating other cancers. But if Bristol doesn't make up the ground it loses in lung cancer, then sales estimates may have to come down even more.  Shaky Ground Opdivo and Yervoy are expected to account for an ever greater proportion of Bristol-Myers' revenue in the years to come Source: Bloomberg It's critical that Bristol try to keep a lead -- Opdivo is estimated to have outsold Keytruda by more than $2 billion in 2016  -- in the broader IO race. But it can't afford to tie up all of its resources there. It's time for Bristol to stop doubling down and start diversifying.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Yes, I know you remember Kim, a Kentucky county clerk and a longtime Democrat who switched to be a Republican because she felt abandoned by the Democrats in her fight against same-sex marriage. She was honored at the Values Voter Summit by the Family Research Council. The Los Angeles County Supervisors recently passed an ordinance in the unincorporated areas to spay or neuter and microchip their cats. In 2014 the county Department of Animal Care and Control impounded 28, 911 cats and 21,055 were euthanized. Enforcement of the new mandate will be based on complaints, and pet owners will be given a warning and a chance to comply before being penalized with a fine. Patients with advanced lung cancer who took Merck and Co.’s immune-boosting drug Keytruda as their first treatment lived longer on average than those who received chemotherapy in a new study that could herald a significant shift in treatment of the deadliest cancer. The rumor is true – the Asia-Pacific region has changed in recent years; U.S. Marines in Japan will soon begin training alongside the Vietnamese military. Vietnam is not the only country eager to train with Marines in the Pacific. South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Cambodia will also take part in amphibious exercises. The Army on September 14, 2016 broke ground on the site of the National Museum of the United States Army. The museum will sit on about 80 acres at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, that is very near Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington, and is scheduled to be completed in 2019. Its 186,000 square feet of space will feature about 30,000 artifacts, documents and images and more than 15,000 pieces of artwork. The museum is expected to attract 500,000 to 700,000 visitors a year. Can you believe it (because I can’t), 20 veterans commit suicide each day, and that’s one every 72 minutes? It was just a little bit more than 40 years ago (September 17, 1976) the Episcopalian church in the United States okayed the ordination of female priests and bishops. Boston, Chicago and New York City have all reached deep into their arsenal to get rid of the rat problem. The plan is to drop chunks of dry ice into burrows and seal up the tunnels. The dirty pests suffocate as the dry ice sublimates from a solid to a gas. The asphyxiated dead rats then decompose in place and out of sight. Chicago claims a 60 percent reduction of the rat population where used. Ho, ho, ho! In its race toward a data-driven future the NFL has embedded wireless tracking sensors into every player’s shoulder pads to get details like speed and acceleration. The data is fed into a special command center at Zebra Technologies in San Jose. Zebra has also attached two chips under the collars of all referees’ shirts. and for preseason games the official game ball will have a chip just under the laces. Do you also subscribe to Nature Communications? Then you probably read about the recent discovery made by those great minds at MIT and Georgia Tech. Hard to believe they invented a way to read a book that isn’t even open. I’m not surprised since the post office can read a letter in a still sealed envelope. Hormone-blocking drugs for prostate cancer may increase men’s chances of developing dementia, a large study suggests, but researchers say the results aren’t conclusive enough to avoid the potentially life-saving treatment. Cancer patients who used the drugs faced about double the chances of being diagnosed with dementia over five years, compared with non-users. The researchers analyzed 20 years of electronic health records for almost 9,300 prostate cancer patients treated at Stanford University’s health system. After five years of follow-up about eight percent of men on hormone blockers were diagnosed with dementia versus almost four percent of non-users. Here is another fiasco a la Wells Fargo. The FCC has fined Comcast $2.3 million for billing subscribers for services and equipment they didn’t order. I just wonder, how many pumpkin pies can one make if the pumpkin weighed 2,624.6 lbs.? You guessed correctly, the giant pumpkin that set a new world’s record was grown in Belgium. Are you a lady who wants to give birth to a baby, but don’t have a uterus? Well, help is here with a groundbreaking series of experimental surgeries. In late September 2016, four American women received womb transplants from living donors at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. It takes hours to remove a donor’s uterus and transplant it into a recipient. The estimated cost of a uterus transplant in the United States is $150,000 to $500,000. The procedure is not yet covered by health insurance.

By EmmaCourt Reporter Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s disappointing and tight-lipped announcement that it would not try for accelerated approval for a first-line lung cancer drug sent shares plummeting nearly 10% in morning trade. All Bristol-Myers BMY, +1.96%  offered in the way of explanation was that it had used the data that was available to make the decision. The company wouldn’t say more “to protect the integrity of ongoing registrational studies,” it said, with four clinical trials currently under way. The news buoyed rival Merck & Co. MRK, +0.90%  shares by 3.9%, with the drugmaker obtaining approval in the same disease area last fall. Shares of AstraZeneca AZN, +1.24% which is also hoping to be a major player in lung cancer, dropped 3.5%. With little to go on, Wall Street analysts couldn’t help but question the long-term success of the two-drug combination, which Bristol-Myers has invested heavily in. There’s “room only for negative speculation” about clinical trials that are close to releasing data, said Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez. The decision must have been based in some way on the company’s CheckMate 256 study, expected to finish up this month, said Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan. Trump: Health-Law Replacement Plan Coming Soon(1:18) President-elect Donald Trump says repeal and replacement of President Obama's health-care law will be done "essentially simultaneously" –- after his health secretary gets confirmed. Photo: Getty Friday’s news was only the latest setback for Bristol-Myers in the last half-year, which has held plenty of trial disappointments for the Opdivo cancer drug in other types of lung cancer. See: Why Bristol-Myers lung-cancer drug could still succeed despite stunning trial failure and How a Merck cancer breakthrough caused Bristol-Myers’ stock to plunge Most analysts noted that the Opdivo + Yervoy combination could still be approved at a normal timeline, though it may require data from another study — CM-227 — that is expected to release data in the first half of next year. CM-227 is fully enrolled but Bristol-Myers has not provided guidance on when interim data could come out, according to SunTrust analyst John Boris. “Given how leveraged BMY is to the combo working, however, we do not feel the risk/reward is attractive,” said Divan, maintaining a neutral rating and noting an outperform rating on Merck. Read: Big pharma won’t stop raising prices in 2017 — it’ll just do it smarter Bristol-Myers’ short-term loss also called its long-term strategy into question for SunTrust’s Boris. CM-227 may call into question the company’s strategy of using two immuno-oncology drugs, he said, reiterating a hold rating and lowering Bristol’s price target by 8% to $57. Related: Bristol-Myers Squibb planning revamp Though new data could well emerge this year, including early data on the newly-critical CM-227, Merck’s Keytruda will probably be the only immuno-oncology treatment for first-line lung cancer, Divan noted. An approval for Merck’s Keytruda + Alumenta combination could gain approval for another type of first-line lung cancer in the second quarter, Boris said, expanding its access from a quarter of the first-line non small cell lung cancer market to more than 70%. Bristol-Myers shares have fallen 21% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.09%  has gained 22%.

(IMDZ) Cut to “Hold” at Zacks Investment Research January 20th, 2017 - 0 comments - Filed Under - by Jeff Wilder Filed Under: Analyst Articles - US - Finance Tweet Zacks Investment Research cut shares of Immune Design Corp. (NASDAQ:IMDZ) from a strong-buy rating to a hold rating in a research report report published on Tuesday. According to Zacks, “Immune Design’s primary candidates, CMB305 and G100, are being evaluated for solid tumor, and merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and sarcoma, respectively. We are positive on its strategic agreements with companies like Sanofi, Roche, Merck and AstraZeneca, which not only validate its GLAAS platform, but also provide the company with funds in the form of collaboration and license revenues. However, the company is highly dependent on its collaboration partners for top-line growth. Although such collaborations boost the company’s pipeline development, dependence on other companies for revenue growth increases its vulnerability. Moreover, the company’s shares have underperformed the Medical-Drugs industry in the past one year. Loss estimates are stable ahead the company's Q4 release.” A number of other equities research analysts have also issued reports on the stock.

Bristol-Myers fell 9.4 percent to $51.50 at 9:45 a.m. in New York, its biggest intraday loss since October, while Merck & Co. gained 4.3 percent to $62.92. The U.K.’s AstraZeneca Plc, which is also testing lung-cancer treatments, slumped 3.4 percent in London. Bristol-Myers, which has been testing Opdivo and Yervoy together as first-line therapy for lung cancer patients, said Thursday in a statement that it won’t “pursue an accelerated regulatory pathway” in the U.S. for the combination. Studies of the combined drugs will continue, the New York-based company said.  Cowen and Co. analyst Steven Scala cut his rating on Bristol-Myers to market perform from outperform, saying that the decision adds risk to sales of Opdivo, the company’s top drug.  While Bristol-Myers had been seeking to move the treatment to market quickly “an early filing is now off the table,” Scala said in a note to clients. “In tandem, the regulatory hurdle might be getting higher as competitors move forward.” Merck and Bristol-Myers have been battling for dominance in the field of cancer immunotherapy, in which medicines are designed to boost the body’s own defenses against cancer. So far, Bristol-Myers’ data has disappointed in the setting of lung cancer, while Merck has pulled ahead with its drug Keytruda, which was approved in December for first-line treatment in one form of lung cancer.

Bristol cited "a review of data available at this time" for the decision to hold off on filing for approval of the combination of its cancer drugs Opdivo and Yervoy. The move helps secure Merck & Co Inc's lead in the development of combination lung cancer treatments. Merck last week said U.S. regulators had agreed to an accelerated review of its application to combine immune system-boosting drug Keytruda with chemotherapy as an initial therapy for advanced lung cancer.

BUSINESS Stock market steadies as Trump gets down to business Stocks Richard Drew / Associated Press Stocks rose in choppy trading on the first day of Donald Trump's presidency. Stocks rose in choppy trading on the first day of Donald Trump's presidency. (Richard Drew / Associated Press) James F. PeltzContact Reporter When Donald Trump took the presidential oath Friday, the stock market was trading modestly higher with the Dow Jones industrial average up 97 points. Prices then moved in choppy fashion as traders kept glancing at televised views of Trump’s inauguration in Washington. “It certainly was an all-eyes-on event,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. By the closing bell, the Dow had gained 94.85 points to 19,827.25, and that was enough to snap the Dow’s string of five consecutive losing sessions as Wall Street headed into the weekend holding its collective breath over what President Trump will do next. “Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families,” Trump said in his inaugural speech, which also included his oft-repeated pledge that his policies would be governed by “buy American and hire American.” Stocks soared to record highs in the six weeks after Trump’s election Nov. 8, with the Dow trading less than one point from the 20,000-point milestone on Jan. 6. But the “Trump rally” then ran out of steam as initial elation over his blueprint for business-friendly policies began fading, and investors took profits on their post-election gains. “The euphoria got ahead of itself,” said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust. Even so, stocks remain near record levels. And now that Trump is in the White House, the stock market is at a crossroads as investors mainly focus on three things: early concrete steps Trump takes on taxes, trade, fiscal stimulus and other economic matters; the trend of inflation and interest rates; and the level of quarterly profits being reported by corporate America. “Earnings are the key to the 2017 stock market outlook,” Burt White, chief investment officer of LPL Financial, said in a recent note to clients. Analysts’ earnings estimates bode well for stocks to further extend last year’s solid gains as well as the overall bull market in share prices that’s now lasted for several years. “We expect earnings growth in the mid- to high-single digits in 2017, well above the flat earnings of 2016,” White forecast. The Dow Jones industrials surged 13.4% last year in large part because the famed average of 30 blue-chip stocks jumped 7.8% between Trump’s election and New Year’s Day. The Dow’s record high close of 19,974.62 was set Dec. 20. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 9.5% last year and set a record high of 2,276.98 on Jan. 6. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 7.5% last year and reached an all-time record 5,574.12 on Jan. 13. Leading the Dow industrials Friday were drugmaker Merck & Co. and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co., both of which gained more than 3%. International Business Machines Corp. rose 2.2%. The S&P 500 gained 7.62 to 2,271.31 on Friday, while the Nasdaq composite rose 15.25 to 5,555.33. Trump’s call during his campaign for corporate and individual tax cuts, less regulation, more infrastructure building and a tougher U.S. stance on trade were key reasons why the market rallied after the election. His call for the repatriation of billions of dollars of profits that U.S.-based firms hold overseas also was seen as a bullish prospect for stocks. Sectors enjoying big gains after Trump’s election included banks and other financial services firms thought to benefit from less regulation, along with industrial and materials companies that could benefit from more federal infrastructure spending. But it still unclear how — and how soon — those efforts will play out. “We’re all keeping an eye on the first 100 days” of Trump’s presidency, Hogan said. Even if Trump takes action relatively soon, it could take time for those moves to find their way to corporate coffers, analysts said. “The potential economic impact of reduced regulations, higher infrastructure spending and tax reform seems unlikely to be felt until 2018,” Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said in a research report this week. In the meantime, Trump has shown he can still quickly move markets. His complaints on Twitter about certain automakers, defense firms and others have sent their stocks briefly lower. After he called the U.S. dollar “too strong” last week, the dollar fell against other major currencies. The bond market is speculating that the fiscal stimulus, and a stronger economy, could mean more inflation and higher interest rates. That’s a key reason why the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has jumped to 2.46% as of Friday from 1.85% when Trump was elected. The Federal Reserve Board lifted its benchmark short-term interest rate a quarter point last month, to a range between 0.50% and 0.75%, and the central bank is expected to lift rates further this year if the economy appears robust enough. But even as investors grapple with questions about Trump’s actions and the fallout, they still might be in the mood to bid stock prices higher based on how the companies currently are performing, Braakman said. “Good companies with good earnings are still going to do well,” he said. “The politicians don’t control everything.” West Texas intermediate, used as a benchmark to price U.S. crude, gained $1.05, or 2%, to $52.42 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose $1.33, or 2.5%, to $55.49 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline increased 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon, heating oil gained 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon and natural gas slipped 16 cents to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar fell to 114.31 yen from 114.80 yen on Thursday. The euro increased to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound rose to $1.2378 from $1.2337. Gold declined $3.40 to $1,204.90 an ounce, silver slid 3 cents to $17.03 an ounce, and copper dropped a penny to $2.63 a pound.  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss So-called sanctuary cities were once places of refuge. A surge in media mergers is expected under Trump’s pro-business agenda. Chinese New Year begins tomorrow. Grocery store tomatoes are often tasteless but researchers at the University of Florida have discovered a game-changer.

"From this day forward it is going to be only America first," Trump said after being sworn in, adding that the U.S. policy will be to buy American and hire American. Trump's campaign promises of tax and regulatory reforms and higher infrastructure spending had driven Wall Street to new highs in a post-election rally. However, the Trump trade had been unraveling in recent weeks as investors waited for more clarity on his plans to boost the economy. "Having listened to Trump's speech, there is a concern about what his trade policies will be," said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Colonial Heights, Richmond, Virginia. "That's probably the No.1 area where Trump will have to tone down his rhetoric because we do have to work with other nations," said Cox, who was at the inauguration. The S&P 500 has fallen by a median 2.7 percent in the month after each new president has taken the keys to the White House since Herbert Hoover did so in January 1929, according to a Reuters analysis. The dollar index weakened as Trump spoke, while gold , which was trading lower ahead of the inauguration, moved into positive territory. At 12:33 a.m. ET (1733 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 31.96 points, or 0.16 percent, at 19,764.36. The S&P 500 was up 1.85 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,265.54 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.50 points, or 0.06 percent, at 5,543.59. Eight of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, with technology giving the biggest bump to the broader index. Industrials, utilities health stocks were the outliers. Among stocks, Procter & Gamble was the top stock on the S&P and the Dow, rising 3.6 percent after the consumer products maker reported quarterly sales and profit above expectations. Merck rose 3.8 percent to $62.60 after Bristol-Myers said it would not seek accelerated U.S. approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer, giving Merck an advantage in the lucrative market. Bristol-Myers' stock was down 9.2 percent. Walgreens dropped 2.5 percent after Bloomberg reported that the FTC was not satisfied with its plan to divest stores to win antitrust clearance for its acquisition of Rite Aid. Shares of Rite Aid lost nearly 12 percent on the news. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,787 to 1,021. On the Nasdaq, 1,693 issues rose and 1,044 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 19 new 52-week highs and five new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 67 new highs and 26 new lows.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 20 January 2017 | MYT 11:34 PM Wall St gains across sectors ahead of Trump inauguration At 9:36am ET (Friday), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 109.18 points, or 0.55%, at 19,841.58. The Reuters photo shows a view of the floor at the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: US stocks rose amid gains across sectors on Friday as investors counted down to Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 45th president of the United States. Trump, a New York businessman and former reality TV star, is scheduled to be sworn in around midday by US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in Washington. Investors will focus on Trump’s inaugural speech to get more insight into his economic policies. “All eyes will be on the content and style of Trump’s inauguration speech,” Morgan Stanley strategists led by Hans Redeker wrote in a note. “The more ‘Presidential’ this speech comes across, the better the outcome for markets.” Trump’s campaign promises of tax and regulatory reforms and higher infrastructure spending had driven Wall Street to multiple highs post-election. However, the Trump trade has been unraveling in recent weeks as investors wait to see how he will carry out his ambitious plans. “I would expect an extremely calm day,” said Brad Lamensdorf, chief executive officer of Active Alts Inc. “Usually these type of events are highly publicized so people are very distracted during the day and I wouldn’t expect a lot of volatility.” The CBOE Volatility index, or Wall Street “fear gauge”, was down nearly 3%. The dollar index edged up for the third straight session, while a 2% rise in oil prices pushed up energy stocks. At 9:36am ET (1436 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 109.18 points, or 0.55%, at 19,841.58 and the S&P 500 was up 12.86 points, or 0.57%, at 2,276.55. The Nasdaq Composite was up 33.45 points, or 0.6%, at 5,573.53. Ten of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, with technology giving the biggest bump to the broader index. Industrials, which have risen for the past two days, were flat. A thrush of quarterly earnings reports from Dow components also kept investors busy.  Procter & Gamble was the top stock on the S&P and the Dow, rising 2.7% after the consumer products maker reported quarterly sales and profit above expectations. General Electric was off 1.4% after the industrial conglomerate reported a drop in quarterly revenue. Merck rose 3.3% to US$62.35 after Bristol-Myers said it would not seek accelerated US approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer, giving Merck an advantage in the lucrative market. Bristol-Myers’ stock was down about 10%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,890 to 670. On the Nasdaq, 1,520 issues rose and 685 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 11 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 20 new highs and five new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Wall Street Related Stories Wall Street slightly lower at open Dow holds above 20,000 at open Stocks up on reinvigorated Trump rally; Dow tops 20,000 Dow hits 20,000 as post-election rally resumes Wall Street edges higher as earnings gather pace You May Be Interested Wall St slips after soft GDP data, earnings Entries open for ‘Evolve or Die’ Kancil Awards 2017 Fed to stop mortgage reinvestments in 2018 Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Go purple this CNY if you want to get lucky in love Six simple steps to feng shui your home Others Also Read Hong Kong securities brokers hit by cyberattacks, may face more Senegal eager to live up to favourites tag at Nations Cup Interracial marriage makes Chinese New Year celebration unique for some Property Related advertisement Latest News Tycoon Slim says Trump not 'Terminator,' sees opportunities for Mexico In double whammy for Turkey, Fitch cuts to junk after S&P slashes outlook Fed to stop mortgage reinvestments in 2018 Wall St slips after soft GDP data, earnings Giving banks a run for their money Most Viewed in Business Making money from money Azman’s journey with AMMB Tycoon Slim says Trump not 'Terminator,' sees opportunities for Mexico Joey Yap: Good time to invest as assets are cheap What Dow hitting 20,000 points means to Malaysia Unlocking value in MMC In double whammy for Turkey, Fitch cuts to junk after S&P slashes outlook Giving banks a run for their money Fed to stop mortgage reinvestments in 2018 Wall St slips after soft GDP data, earnings advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Investors are disappointed that the company will not be pursuing accelerated regulatory approval for its lung cancer drug Opvido/Yervoy. It has been a rough seven days for the pharmaceutical company, since it peaked on January 10 at $60.45 and ended the session at $59.98. The following day, the issue shed $3 when Merck announced favorable results for Keytruda, which is a competing lung cancer drug. After holding steady for a few days, the issue tumbled to $49.62 following the surprise announcement. That marks the lowest level for the issue since it put in a trio of lows just above $49.00 in late October. Since making that low, it has returned to the lower $50.00 handle.

Posted 20 Jan 2017 21:00 Updated 21 Jan 2017 06:35 A trader watches the Trump inauguration on TV on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., January 20, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Yang Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday in a modest but broad-based advance as Donald Trump was sworn in as U.S. President, marking the first time in more than 50 years that a new commander-in-chief has been welcomed by a rising equity market on his first day in office. In his speech, Trump said U.S. policy will be to buy American and hire American, reiterating what he had said many times during this campaign for the White House. Some investors said the comments reinforced concerns about potential protectionist trade policies. Indexes pared gains during his speech and ended off the highest levels of the day. However, the rally in stocks since the Nov. 8 election had stalled in recent weeks as investors awaited clarity on his plans to boost the economy. All three major indexes ended with losses for the week. "We're now trading off of reality rather than hope, and it's natural to be a bit more cautious when we make that transition," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. The S&P 500's 6.2-percent gain since the election is one of the best performances for the American stock market for any presidential transition period of the modern era. Former President Barack Obama's transition period, which came amid the throes of the 2008 financial crisis, overlapped a 15.5 percent fall for the S&P 500 from his election to the day of his 2009 inauguration. Yet he presided over the second-best run for the stock market under any president since Dwight Eisenhower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a five-session losing streak, closing up 94.85 points, or 0.48 percent, to 19,827.25. The S&P 500 gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.25 points, or 0.28 percent, to 5,555.33. The last time when either the S&P or Dow rose on the day a new president was inaugurated was Jan. 20, 1961, when John F. Kennedy was sworn in to succeed Eisenhower. The S&P gained 0.32 percent and the Dow added 0.31 percent; the Nasdaq did not yet exist. The first day aside, the coming month might not be as rosy. The S&P 500 has fallen by a median 2.7 percent in the month after each new president has taken the keys to the White House since Herbert Hoover in January 1929, according to a Reuters analysis. Trump also loomed on the earnings front. Shares of Kansas City Southern rose 4 percent even as it reported a lower quarterly net profit that missed Wall Street estimates. A historic drop in the Mexican peso after Trump's election affected the regional U.S. railroad's operations in Mexico. Among other gainers, Merck rose 3.6 percent to US$62.53 after Bristol-Myers said it would not seek accelerated U.S. approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer, giving Merck an advantage in the lucrative market. Bristol-Myers' stock fell 11.3 percent. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, higher than the 6.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.76-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and 33 new lows.

BMY, +1.96% shares sunk 7.2% in pre-market trade Friday after the company said it wouldn't try for accelerated approval in first-line lung cancer for its combination of Opdivo and Yervoy. The company said the decision was made "based on a review of the data available at this time," and said it would say no more "in order to protect the integrity of ongoing registrational studies." Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said the development was a "clear setback for BMY," especially given a fall approval by rival drugmaker Merck MRK, +0.90% in first-line lung cancer. The combination of Opdivo and Yervoy is seen by many as Bristol's best approach to lung cancer, and the company has four clinical trials underway. "Regardless of the data used to inform this update, it is obvious that it did not meet the threshold for a filing and BMY confirmed to us that MRK's surprise filing did not influence this decision," Fernandez said. Bristol shares have risen 10.2% over the last three months, compared with a 5.7% rise in the S&P 500 SPX, -0.09% Quote References BMY +0.92 +1.96% MRK +0.55 +0.90% SPX -1.99 -0.09% Most Popular Two things are happening in the U.S. stock market for the first time since 1900 Looking to get a mortgage in 2017?

Inauguration day: Donald Trump is set to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday. Trump will take the oath of office around noon. Since his election, he has shown an uncanny ability to move markets. Investors have pushed U.S. and global stock markets higher in response to his pro-business rhetoric. The Dow Jones industrial average has surged 7.6% since the election and even traded near 20,000 points before easing back down. The S&P 500 jumped 5.8% while the Nasdaq added 6.7% over the same period. But the Republican has also introduced a heavy dose of uncertainty to markets. Trump has made a habit of targeting and calling out specific companies on Twitter. He's criticized Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), United Technologies (UTX), GM (GM) and Ford (F) -- as well as foreign car companies Toyota (TM) and BMW (BMWYY). He has also threatened tariffs on companies building their products in Mexico instead of the U.S. and slammed China's trade policies. Related: Watch the inauguration of Donald Trump 2. Global market overview: U.S. stock markets hit record highs earlier this year and they're not far from those levels right now. But U.S. stock futures suggest investors want more detail from Trump before they're ready to push shares even higher. The major indexes are holding steady right now. "Investors [will be] hoping that his speech comprehensively outlines his policy plans for the next four years in a scripted rather than lively off-the-cuff affair," said Mike van Dulken, a market analyst at Accendo Markets. European markets are mostly edging up in early trading, though the gains are modest. Asian markets ended the day with mixed results. Before the Bell newsletter: Key market news. In your inbox.

Drug wars -- Bristol-Myers Squibb vs Merck: Shares in Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) are falling by about 5% premarket after the firm announced it wouldn't pursue "an accelerated regulatory pathway" for a lung cancer treatment it had been developing.

Trump will take the oath of office around noon. By Alanna Petroff LONDON (CNNMoney) -- 1. Inauguration day: Donald Trump is set to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday. Trump will take the oath of office around noon. Since his election, he has shown an uncanny ability to move markets. Investors have pushed U.S. and global stock markets higher in response to his pro-business rhetoric. The Dow Jones industrial average has surged 7.6% since the election and even traded near 20,000 points before easing back down. The S&P 500 jumped 5.8% while the Nasdaq added 6.7% over the same period. But the Republican has also introduced a heavy dose of uncertainty to markets. Trump has made a habit of targeting and calling out specific companies on Twitter. He's criticized Boeing, Lockheed Martin, United Technologies, GM and Ford -- as well as foreign car companies Toyota and BMW. He has also threatened tariffs on companies building their products in Mexico instead of the U.S. and slammed China's trade policies. 2. Global market overview: U.S. stock markets hit record highs earlier this year and they're not far from those levels right now. But U.S. stock futures suggest investors want more detail from Trump before they're ready to push shares even higher. The major indexes are holding steady right now. "Investors [will be] hoping that his speech comprehensively outlines his policy plans for the next four years in a scripted rather than lively off-the-cuff affair," said Mike van Dulken, a market analyst at Accendo Markets. European markets are mostly edging up in early trading, though the gains are modest. Asian markets ended the day with mixed results. 3. Earnings: A number of blue-chip companies are reporting quarterly results this morning, including General Electric and Procter & Gamble. 4. Drug wars -- Bristol-Myers Squibb vs Merck: Shares in Bristol-Myers Squibb are falling by about 5% premarket after the firm announced it wouldn't pursue "an accelerated regulatory pathway" for a lung cancer treatment it had been developing. This has helped shares in competitor Merck pop by about 5% premarket. The company announced earlier this month that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had begun reviewing a license for its lung cancer treatment, Keytruda.

Benson III, MD, professor of Medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology, was a co-author of the paper, which evaluated a new approach to treating anal cancer. The addition of the drug cetuximab to a standard chemotherapy and radiation regimen reduced the incidence of disease persistence or recurrence in patients with anal cancer, but was also associated with significant adverse effects, according to recent Northwestern Medicine clinical trials. The findings, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, highlight the continued need to find effective and safe therapies for the disease. The paper was co-authored by Al B. Benson III, MD, professor of Medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology, and Mary F. Mulcahy, MD, ’00 GME, associate professor of Medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology, and members of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network Cancer Research Group. Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC) is a rare cancer that frequently occurs in the setting of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Although cure rates are high with chemotherapy and radiation, locoregional failure occurs in up to one-third of patients and is associated with significant morbidity. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody, had previously been shown to improve outcomes of HPV-associated cancer when administered in conjunction with radiation therapy or the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. As such, the investigators hypothesized that adding cetuximab to chemoradiation therapy would reduce locoregional failure in patients with SCCAC. In the phase II trial, 61 patients with SCCAC received chemotherapy and radiation therapy, plus eight weekly doses of cetuximab. After three years, the locoregional failure rate for study participants was 20 percent — a moderate improvement over the expected historical rate of 35 percent. Mary F. Mulcahy, MD, ’00 GME, associate professor of Medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology, also co-authored the study. In addition, 32 percent of patients in the trial experienced grade four toxicity — indicating life-threatening or disabling adverse effects — and there was one death felt to be related to the therapy. “There is significant interest in improving outcomes and reducing treatment-related toxicities for patients with anal cancer, particularly with the rise in incidence associated with HPV infection,” Benson said. “Biologic and immunotherapy approaches are of current interest and we are participating in discussions to bring forward new concepts to treat this disease.” Benson is associate director for cooperative groups at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. Mulcahy is the director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer program at Northwestern University. Relevant to this study, Benson has had a consulting and advisory role with Sanofi, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck Serono, Merck/Schering-Plough, Eli Lilly/ImClone Systems, and has received research funding from Merck Sharp & Dohme. The study was supported, in part, by Public Health Service Grants No. CA23318, CA66636, CA21115, CA180820, CA180794, CA14958, CA189859, CA15488, CA13650, CA17145, CA35267, CA189863, CA35431, CA189808, CA180864, CA35412, CA189956, and CA107868; the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Health and Human Services; Grant No. U10 CA029511 from the Quality Assurance Radiotherapy Committee; and Grant No. U24 CA180803 from the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core.
