The organization describes itself as some kind of liaison between the CDC and the private sector, existing solely for public benefit, but a quick look at their list of corporate partners reveals a much more sordid story; a story of fake science that is being propagated for industry benefit. While studying the rather lengthy list of corporate donors — who also sometimes collaborate with the CDC on their project — one might notice that many of them are pharma companies, pesticide makers, and biotech firms. And when considering CDC senior scientist-turned-whistle blower Dr. William Thompson’s recent testimony against the MMR vaccine — one corporate partner stands out among the rest: Merck. Merck is the manufacturer of the MMR vaccine — the very vaccine on which Dr. Thompson alleges he and his cohorts manipulated data and violated study protocols to protect. CDC obfuscated MMR vaccine and autism link In August 2014, Dr. William Thompson confessed that he and his colleagues had participated in an act of serious scientific fraud. Ten years prior, he had worked on a study of the MMR vaccine and published the findings, claiming that the vaccine was not linked to autism. (Related: Learn more about autism.) However, Dr. Thompson now says that he and the other study authors purposely omitted data that contradicted that outcome. Thompson claims that the CDC did find data showing the MMR vaccine demonstrated a statistically significant effect at the 36-month threshold. This shows that the study found a causal connection between the MMR vaccine and autism, but the evidence never made it to publication. The omitted data revealed that African American males vaccinated before 36 months of age were more likely to develop autism. (Related: Learn more about vaccines at Vaccines.news) In a statement, Thompson said “Sometime soon after the meeting, we decided to exclude reporting any race effects, the co-authors scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the study. The remaining four co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room and reviewed and went through all the hard copy documents that we had thought we should discard and put them in a huge garbage can.” Thompson knew what they were doing was illegal. He himself noted, “I believe we intentionally withheld controversial findings from the final draft of the Pediatrics paper.” Fortunately, Thompson held onto copies of the original documents that had been disposed. Dr. Thompson penned a letter in 2002 to the then-CDC Director Julie Gerberding because he was growing very concerned about the MMR vaccine study findings, and wrote to her again in 2004. It would appear that Gerberding did little in regard to Thompson’s concern. Following her time at the CDC, Ms. Gerberding went on to become the executive vice president at Merck. And of course, Merck isn’t the only company that gives money to the CDC Foundation — and indirectly,  the CDC.  Several other pharma companies like Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi Pastuer, and Pfizer are on the list. Is ‘fake science’ the norm at the CDC? When one considers the apparent ties the CDC has to Merck — and countless other corporations — it honestly raises doubts for just about anything the federal agency has put their stamp on. The 2004 “study” features cherry-picked data sets, and reached a conclusion that purposely ignored the facts: it is the epitome of fake science. Evidence was actually destroyed by the government to protect a product rather than the people. (Related: Learn more about misleading information at FakeScience.news) Their incessant pushing the of the flu vaccine is another example of fake science in the CDC. There is little evidence to suggest that the flu vaccine is beneficial for the average person — and those who need extra protection are unlikely to get it from a vaccine. The CDC’s webpage on “vaccine effectiveness” claims that studies show the flu vaccine can prevent the flu in 50 to 60 percent of people. However, a vaccine package insert for Flulaval reads,”There have been no controlled trials adequately demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with FLULAVAL.” The CDC conducts their own studies on these vaccines to see how effective they are. However, these studies are purely observational — which means that no causality can actually be determined. Any number of factors, such as diet, lifestyle, and current health condition, can impact how vulnerable a person is to getting the flu. The agency itself notes that the study results may vary due to differences in design, outcomes measured, and other such tribulations. In other words: the CDC itself does not have an accurate, finite method for testing the actual efficiency of the flu vaccine, they’re just guessing at it. While observational studies are not necessarily fake science, pretending that observational data is all that is necessary to confer the benefits of something most certainly is fake science.   Sources: VaccineImpact.com NaturalNews.com CDCFoundation.gov NaturalNews.com TruthWiki.org GlobalResearch.ca CDC.gov Previous :Anti-nutrition media runs fake news attacking vitamin D after baby in France suffocates on liquid medicine Next : Magic beans: Coffee protects against age-related inflammation 100% authentic hemp extract with CBD Authentic, honest and scientifically validated using breakthrough science.  IN STOCK, SHIPPING TODAY Join the Health Ranger's FREE email newsletter Get breaking news alerts on GMOs, fluoride, superfoods, natural cures and more...

In two clinical trials, researchers found that the drug, called bezlotoxumab (Zinplava), cut the risk of a recurrent C. difficile infection by almost 40 percent. That's important, because the gut infection commonly comes back after treatment with antibiotics -- around 20 percent of the time, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The infection can also make people seriously ill, with symptoms ranging from diarrhea to life-threatening inflammation of the colon, the CDC says. Zinplava has already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and it should be available early this year, according to Merck, the drug's maker. That approval was based on the findings of two Merck-funded trials, published in the Jan. 26 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The drug "will give us another tool in the toolbox" for fighting C. difficile infections, said Dr. Johan Bakken, former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. And additional weapons are welcome, he said, given the scope the problem. C. difficile sickened almost half a million Americans in 2011, according to the most recent numbers from the CDC. An estimated 29,000 of those patients died within a month. Most infections happen in the hospital, the CDC says. In fact, C. difficile has become the most common hospital-acquired infection nationwide, Bakken pointed out. The bacteria can contaminate hospital surfaces and equipment, and be transmitted to patients. That's a particular threat when patients are on powerful antibiotics to treat an infection: The drugs kill not only harmful bacteria, but also the "good" bacteria that normally dwell in the gut and crowd out the bad ones. "The antibiotics hit the innocent bystanders, and that allows C. difficile to get a stronghold," said Bakken, who wasn't involved in the Zinplava trials. To treat C. difficile, doctors use more antibiotics, which actually do a good job of killing the bug. The problem, Bakken explained, is that C. difficile produces spores that can survive the onslaught. Continued Once the antibiotics are stopped, those spores can spring to life again and churn out illness-causing toxins. Zinplava is not an antibiotic. It's a lab-generated "monoclonal" antibody designed to neutralize one of the C. difficile toxins -- toxin B -- and can keep it from damaging the colon lining, Bakken explained. "But it's not meant to be used alone," he stressed. Patients receive standard antibiotics, plus an IV infusion of Zinplava. The two trials involved over 2,600 adults who all received antibiotics for a first-time or recurrent C. difficile infection. Some were randomly assigned to receive a Zinplava infusion, while the rest received a saline infusion that served as a placebo. Over 12 weeks, 16 percent to 17 percent of Zinplava patients suffered a recurrent infection. That compared with 26 percent to 28 percent of placebo patients, the findings showed. The drug's main side effects included fever, nausea and diarrhea -- which affected between 5 percent and 7 percent of patients. According to Merck, there is also a concern about worsening heart failure in people who already have the disease. The drug is not for everyone with C. difficile infection, Bakken said. It's officially approved for people at "high risk" of a recurrence. Plus, Bakken noted, the drug is sure to be expensive -- as monoclonal antibody drugs always are. Dr. Mark Wilcox, the lead researcher on the trials, agreed that doctors will have to give the drug based on patients' personal odds of a recurrence. According to Wilcox, some high-risk patients include those who are age 65 or older, have a compromised immune system or have a severe C. difficile infection. "Bezlotoxumab was more effective in such patients," said Wilcox, a professor of medical microbiology at the University of Leeds in England. "So doctors should consider adding it to standard-of-care antibiotics according to these risk factors." The drug is not the final answer, however. "The recurrence rates were in the teens rather than the 20s," Bakken pointed out. He said researchers are working on other ways to protect vulnerable patients from C. difficile -- including vaccines. They also want to figure out which "key organisms" are needed in the gut to ward off the infection, Bakken said. A study last year hinted that "good" strains of the C. difficile bug, itself, could be beneficial. In that study, patients given antibiotics and a liquid containing non-toxic C. difficile had a lower risk of a repeat infection, versus those who drank a placebo brew.

Merck is known as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada. About Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is defined by elevated pressure in the arteries going from the right side of the heart to the lungs. Typical symptoms of PAH include shortness of breath on exertion, fatigue, weakness, chest pain and syncope.  PAH is caused by abnormalities in the walls of the pulmonary arteries that include constriction, inflammation and fibrosis.  About Adempas® (riociguat) Riociguat, licensed in the U.S. as Adempas, is a stimulator of soluable guanylate cyclase (sGC) and is the only treatment approved in the U.S. for use in two types of pulmonary hypertension (WHO Groups 1 and 4). INDICATIONS Adempas (riociguat) tablets is indicated for the treatment of adults with persistent/recurrent chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), (WHO Group 4) after surgical treatment, or inoperable CTEPH, to improve exercise capacity and WHO functional class. Adempas is indicated for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), (WHO Group 1), to improve exercise capacity, WHO functional class and to delay clinical worsening.*                              Efficacy was shown in patients on Adempas monotherapy or in combination with endothelin receptor antagonists or prostanoids. Studies establishing effectiveness included predominantly patients with WHO functional class II–III and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (61%) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (25%). *Time to clinical worsening was a combined endpoint defined as death (all-cause mortality), heart/lung transplantation, atrial septostomy, hospitalization due to persistent worsening of pulmonary hypertension, start of new PAH-specific treatment, persistent decrease in 6MWD and persistent worsening of WHO functional class. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING:  EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY Do not administer Adempas (riociguat) tablets to a pregnant female because it may cause fetal harm.

Consider a dose reduction if patient develops signs or symptoms of hypotension.  Bleeding. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, serious bleeding occurred in 2.4% of patients taking Adempas compared to 0% of placebo patients. Serious hemoptysis occurred in 5 (1%) patients taking Adempas compared to 0 placebo patients, including one event with fatal outcome. Serious hemorrhagic events also included 2 patients with vaginal hemorrhage, 2 with catheter site hemorrhage, and 1 each with subdural hematoma, hematemesis, and intra-abdominal hemorrhage.  Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease.  Pulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Therefore, administration of Adempas to such patients is not recommended. Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, the possibility of associated PVOD should be considered and if confirmed, discontinue treatment with Adempas. Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions occurring more frequently (>3%) on Adempas than placebo were headache (27% vs 18%), dyspepsia/gastritis (21% vs. 8%), dizziness (20% vs 13%), nausea (14% vs 11%), diarrhea (12% vs 8%), hypotension (10% vs 4%), vomiting (10% vs 7%), anemia (7% vs 2%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (5% vs 2%), and constipation (5% vs 1%). Other events that were seen more frequently in Adempas compared to placebo and potentially related to treatment were: palpitations, nasal congestion, epistaxis, dysphagia, abdominal distension and peripheral edema.

(*this news item will not be available after 04/25/2017) Wednesday, January 25, 2017 WEDNESDAY, Jan. 25, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A newly approved drug may help in the battle against Clostridium difficile -- a potentially fatal "superbug" gut infection that has become a scourge in U.S. hospitals. In two clinical trials, researchers found that the drug, called bezlotoxumab (Zinplava), cut the risk of a recurrent C. difficile infection by almost 40 percent. That's important, because the gut infection commonly comes back after treatment with antibiotics -- around 20 percent of the time, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The infection can also make people seriously ill, with symptoms ranging from diarrhea to life-threatening inflammation of the colon, the CDC says. Zinplava has already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and it should be available early this year, according to Merck, the drug's maker. That approval was based on the findings of two Merck-funded trials, published in the Jan. 26 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The drug "will give us another tool in the toolbox" for fighting C. difficile infections, said Dr. Johan Bakken, former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. And additional weapons are welcome, he said, given the scope the problem. C. difficile sickened almost half a million Americans in 2011, according to the most recent numbers from the CDC. An estimated 29,000 of those patients died within a month. Most infections happen in the hospital, the CDC says. In fact, C. difficile has become the most common hospital-acquired infection nationwide, Bakken pointed out. The bacteria can contaminate hospital surfaces and equipment, and be transmitted to patients. That's a particular threat when patients are on powerful antibiotics to treat an infection: The drugs kill not only harmful bacteria, but also the "good" bacteria that normally dwell in the gut and crowd out the bad ones. "The antibiotics hit the innocent bystanders, and that allows C. difficile to get a stronghold," said Bakken, who wasn't involved in the Zinplava trials. To treat C. difficile, doctors use more antibiotics, which actually do a good job of killing the bug. The problem, Bakken explained, is that C. difficile produces spores that can survive the onslaught. Once the antibiotics are stopped, those spores can spring to life again and churn out illness-causing toxins. Zinplava is not an antibiotic. It's a lab-generated "monoclonal" antibody designed to neutralize one of the C. difficile toxins -- toxin B -- and can keep it from damaging the colon lining, Bakken explained. "But it's not meant to be used alone," he stressed. Patients receive standard antibiotics, plus an IV infusion of Zinplava. The two trials involved over 2,600 adults who all received antibiotics for a first-time or recurrent C. difficile infection. Some were randomly assigned to receive a Zinplava infusion, while the rest received a saline infusion that served as a placebo. Over 12 weeks, 16 percent to 17 percent of Zinplava patients suffered a recurrent infection. That compared with 26 percent to 28 percent of placebo patients, the findings showed. The drug's main side effects included fever, nausea and diarrhea -- which affected between 5 percent and 7 percent of patients. According to Merck, there is also a concern about worsening heart failure in people who already have the disease. The drug is not for everyone with C. difficile infection, Bakken said. It's officially approved for people at "high risk" of a recurrence. Plus, Bakken noted, the drug is sure to be expensive -- as monoclonal antibody drugs always are. Dr. Mark Wilcox, the lead researcher on the trials, agreed that doctors will have to give the drug based on patients' personal odds of a recurrence. According to Wilcox, some high-risk patients include those who are age 65 or older, have a compromised immune system or have a severe C. difficile infection. "Bezlotoxumab was more effective in such patients," said Wilcox, a professor of medical microbiology at the University of Leeds in England. "So doctors should consider adding it to standard-of-care antibiotics according to these risk factors." The drug is not the final answer, however. "The recurrence rates were in the teens rather than the 20s," Bakken pointed out. He said researchers are working on other ways to protect vulnerable patients from C. difficile -- including vaccines. They also want to figure out which "key organisms" are needed in the gut to ward off the infection, Bakken said. A study last year hinted that "good" strains of the C. difficile bug, itself, could be beneficial. In that study, patients given antibiotics and a liquid containing non-toxic C. difficile had a lower risk of a repeat infection, versus those who drank a placebo brew.

(NASDAQ: INCY) is one of the health care stocks that hit it big in 2016 — that is, after it crashed and burned. As we all know, 2016 got off to a bad start, but a very strong finish that made up for it. Unfortunately, Incyte posted a loss on the year despite making an incredibly recovery from its February lows. Looking ahead, one analyst sees solid upside for this stock. Credit Suisse has an Outperform rating with a $137 price target, implying an upside of 15% from Friday’s close at $117.22. Earlier this month, Incyte and Merck announced a decision to advance the clinical development program investigating the combination of epacadostat, Incyte’s investigational oral selective IDO1 inhibitor, with Keytruda (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy. With the expansion of the clinical development program, the companies plan to initiate pivotal studies of epacadostat in combination with Keytruda in four additional tumors: non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Credit Suisse sees future earnings growth from Incyte’s pipeline, with epacadostat’s potential as a best-in-class immunotherapy combination agent making the stock an attractive takeout target for big biotech and pharma. The firm is positive on Incyte’s continued geographic expansion, with a long-term positive earnings impact as wholly owned early-stage assets enter clinical development and commercial markets. The firm continued in its report saying: We are bullish on Jakafi’s continued expansion into MF/PV driving earnings in 2017. We see future earnings growth from INCY’s pipeline, with epacadostat’s potential as a best-in-class immunotherapy combination agent making INCY an attractive takeout target for Big Biotech/Pharma. We are positive on INCY’s continued geographic expansion, with a long-term positive earnings impact as wholly owned early-stage assets enter clinical development and commercial markets. Credit Suisse added: We see the announcement of epacadostat data at ASCO ’17 as one of the most significant near-term inflection points. These data warranted the Jan ’17 decision for ph3 trial expansion into NSCLC, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, and RCC. We see INCB50465 in lymphoma, INCB54828 in bladder cancer/cholangiocarcinoma, and Itacitinib in treatment-naïve GvHD as keys to INCY growth beyond 2020. The question is whether one of the major players in big biotech and pharma will move to acquire Incyte. If this should happen, Credit Suisse values Incyte’s stock up to $167 per share to a potential acquirer. The firm views Incyte as having scarcity value as a commercial-stage oncology company. Credit Suisse remains bullish on M&A, with potential for tax-related U.S. political tailwinds. Shares of Incyte were last seen trading up 1.3% at $118.74 on Monday, with a consensus analyst price target of $122.21 and a 52-week trading range of $55.00 to $122.68.

Fearless Muckraking Since 1993 Home Articles Recent Articles Magazine Current Issue Back Issues Subscribe Subscriber Access Subscribe Donate Archives Search Authors About JOIN LIST Books T-shirts podcasts FAQs January 26, 2017 They Aren’t All Safe: Pharma is Willing to Look “Unscientific” to Sell Vaccines by Martha Rosenberg by Tweet Email Why do progressive news sites that expose government and corporate disinformation in other areas accept disinformation when it comes to vaccines–actually calling activists “unscientific”? It is not surprising mainstream scientists are vaccine absolutists who vilify “anti-vaxxers” given that their medical centers, hospital wings, universities and sometimes personal paychecks are funded by Pharma. (The motive of progressive sites is less clear.) But “Pharma knows best” rings false with a quick look at withdrawn drugs like Vioxx, Bextra, Baycol, Trovan, Meridia, Darvon, Phen-Fen, Raxar and Seldane–all called safe when they were making millions. Neither mainstream or progressive news sites want to acknowledge the existence of the federal National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) which, since 1988, has settled more than 16,000 claims and awarded $3.18 billion in injury settlements. When I asked a vaccine expert why the court existed if vaccines are unremittingly safe he told me that vaccines are so basic to public health yet so non-lucrative (compared to billion dollar pills), the government does not want vaccine makers bankrupted by lawsuits. But ignoring the court and the ghastly injuries it settles—I was told, off the record, about a woman who lost her fingers and toes from vasculitis caused by a vaccine—mainstream scientists are the ones who are “unscientific.”  The truth is not all vaccines are safe, life-saving or necessary and conflicts of interest do exist. Consider the case of Gardasil, a vaccine against the human papillomavirus vaccine types 6, 11, 16, 18. The Case of Gardasil A few years ago, Merck aggressively marketed Gardasil, a vaccine against the HPV virus (which is linked to venereal warts and cervical cancer)–even in poor countries where cervical cancer is hardly a leading cause of death compared to malaria or diarrheal diseases. (In developed countries, a Pap test is as effective as a vaccine in preventing cervical cancer.) Last year, judges in India’s Supreme Court demanded answers after children died during a trial of Gardasil and Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline’s counterpart vaccine, a few years earlier. According to CBS News there was another cloud over Gardasil. “Merck gave $6,000 to [Texas Gov. Rick] Perry’s election campaign fund as part of a national lobbying effort to persuade states that it ought to require Gardasil as one of the vaccines all kids should have before attending school,”  it wrote. The director of a Merck-funded pro-Gardasil group was also Perry’s then-chief of staff’s mother-in-law. Nor did the departure of former CDC director Julie Gerberding to head Merck’s vaccines division look right to many ethics specialists. Docs Gone Bad Mainstream scientists have savaged Andrew Wakefield, a British medical researcher found to have conducted fraudulent research linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). His corruption is said to disprove any scientific doubts about vaccine safety. Yet when researchers in the U.S. have been so corrupt they have gone to jail, mainstream scientists still accept their research. Scott Reuben published fraudulent research on Lyrica, Effexor, Celebrex and other drugs for Pharma. He went to prison for six months but the “science” behind the drugs he promoted stands. Richard Borison, former psychiatry chief at Augusta Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center and Medical College of Georgia, went to prison for 15 years for using clinical trials on veterans of the antipsychotic Seroquel to line his own pockets. The drug went on to earn billions and his for-profit “research” still stands. As a reporter I have interviewed a man whose blindness was caused by a 1976 flu vaccine for which the government compensated him. More recently I interviewed a parent whose normal toddler was never the same after a vaccine and is now institutionalized. “He cried hysterically for 24 hours,” the parent, who is a medical practitioner, told me. Pharma is unwise to cast such parents, of whom there are many, as “nuts.” The degeneration of their child is not their imagination. Also, there is no defensible reason for vaccines to be given all at once to a child, which many say heightens risks. Administering clusters of vaccines–once not given to children–has been called a major, new profit center for pediatricians. But anti-vaccination activists should also not be absolutist. Would anyone refuse a rabies vaccine after being bitten by a rabid raccoon? A tetanus shot after a serious wound? Would responsible parents deny their child a whooping cough or polio vaccine? Like all drugs aggressively marketed these days, patients and parents need to do their own research and weigh benefits and risks—never forgetting Pharma’s spotty safety record.

In two clinical trials, researchers found that the drug, called bezlotoxumab, marketed as Zinplava, cut the risk of a recurrent C. difficile infection by almost 40 percent. That's important, because the gut infection commonly comes back after treatment with antibiotics -- around 20 percent of the time, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The infection can also make people seriously ill, with symptoms ranging from diarrhea to life-threatening inflammation of the colon, the CDC says. Zinplava has already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and it should be available early this year, according to Merck, the drug's maker. That approval was based on the findings of two Merck-funded trials, published in the Jan. 26 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The drug "will give us another tool in the toolbox" for fighting C. difficile infections, said Dr. Johan Bakken, former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. And additional weapons are welcome, he said, given the scope the problem. C. difficile sickened almost half a million Americans in 2011, according to the most recent numbers from the CDC. An estimated 29,000 of those patients died within a month. Most infections happen in the hospital, the CDC says. In fact, C. difficile has become the most common hospital-acquired infection nationwide, Bakken pointed out. The bacteria can contaminate hospital surfaces and equipment, and be transmitted to patients. That's a particular threat when patients are on powerful antibiotics to treat an infection: The drugs kill not only harmful bacteria, but also the "good" bacteria that normally dwell in the gut and crowd out the bad ones. "The antibiotics hit the innocent bystanders, and that allows C. difficile to get a stronghold," said Bakken, who wasn't involved in the Zinplava trials. To treat C. difficile, doctors use more antibiotics, which actually do a good job of killing the bug. The problem, Bakken explained, is that C. difficile produces spores that can survive the onslaught. Once the antibiotics are stopped, those spores can spring to life again and churn out illness-causing toxins. Zinplava is not an antibiotic. It's a lab-generated "monoclonal" antibody designed to neutralize one of the C. difficile toxins -- toxin B -- and can keep it from damaging the colon lining, Bakken explained. "But it's not meant to be used alone," he stressed. Patients receive standard antibiotics, plus an IV infusion of Zinplava. The two trials involved over 2,600 adults who all received antibiotics for a first-time or recurrent C. difficile infection. Some were randomly assigned to receive a Zinplava infusion, while the rest received a saline infusion that served as a placebo. Over 12 weeks, 16 percent to 17 percent of Zinplava patients suffered a recurrent infection. That compared with 26 percent to 28 percent of placebo patients, the findings showed. The drug's main side effects included fever, nausea and diarrhea -- which affected between 5 percent and 7 percent of patients. According to Merck, there is also a concern about worsening heart failure in people who already have the disease. The drug is not for everyone with C. difficile infection, Bakken said. It's officially approved for people at "high risk" of a recurrence. Plus, Bakken noted, the drug is sure to be expensive -- as monoclonal antibody drugs always are. Dr. Mark Wilcox, the lead researcher on the trials, agreed that doctors will have to give the drug based on patients' personal odds of a recurrence. According to Wilcox, some high-risk patients include those who are age 65 or older, have a compromised immune system or have a severe C. difficile infection. "Bezlotoxumab was more effective in such patients," said Wilcox, a professor of medical microbiology at the University of Leeds in England. "So doctors should consider adding it to standard-of-care antibiotics according to these risk factors." The drug is not the final answer, however. "The recurrence rates were in the teens rather than the 20s," Bakken pointed out. He said researchers are working on other ways to protect vulnerable patients from C. difficile -- including vaccines. They also want to figure out which "key organisms" are needed in the gut to ward off the infection, Bakken said. A study last year hinted that "good" strains of the C. difficile bug, itself, could be beneficial. In that study, patients given antibiotics and a liquid containing non-toxic C. difficile had a lower risk of a repeat infection, versus those who drank a placebo brew. More information The CDC has more on C. difficile infection. Copyright © 2017 HealthDay. All rights reserved.

Pro Football Hall of Famer and Cancer Survivor Jim Kelly Teams Up with Merck and Leading Cancer Organizations to Launch Your Cancer Game Plan Kelly Provides His “Game Plan” for Navigating Head and Neck Cancer January 25, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Head and neck cancer survivor and Pro Football Hall of Famer Jim Kelly is sharing his personal experience as part of Your Cancer Game Plan, a new awareness campaign focused on helping people with cancer and their loved ones tackle their emotional, nutritional and communication needs. Kelly, one of the toughest quarterbacks to have played Pro Football, successfully handled the gridiron with his motto ‘Kelly Tough’ – a motto that took on new meaning after he was diagnosed with head and neck cancer. The campaign, from Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, in partnership with Kelly and leading cancer organizations, encourages people with head and neck cancer and their loved ones to make a cancer “game plan” to support their cancer journey. Many people living with head and neck cancer may experience different physical and emotional challenges than people with other forms of cancer. To help address these challenges, Your Cancer Game Plan provides support and resources, including Kelly’s tips on how to remain positive and healthy recipes for those facing head and neck cancer. “I know first-hand the special challenges people living with this disease and their families face,” notes Kelly. “My experience taught me so much about the importance of emotional support and taking care of myself, and I hope that by sharing my experience, I can inspire others to take action and know their game plan.” Your Cancer Game Plan is a collaboration between Merck, the Head and Neck Cancer Alliance (HNCA) and Support for People with Oral and Head and Neck Cancer (SPOHNC), the leading patient organizations supporting the head and neck cancer community for nearly six decades combined, and Savor Health, a service dedicated to supporting the nutritional needs of people living with cancer. Understanding Head and Neck Cancer Head and neck cancer describes a number of different tumors that develop in or around the throat, larynx, nose, sinuses and mouth. Each year more than 60,000 new cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. Many people with head and neck cancer face unique challenges as a result of surgeries and/or treatments that impact a person’s appearance, speech, smell, taste, ability to swallow and sight. “People with head and neck cancer can feel isolated and face depression, which is why support is extremely important. Through Your Cancer Game Plan, we are providing resources that can help them manage emotional needs at every stage of their journey,” said Holly Boykin, executive director of the Head and Neck Cancer Alliance. “Communicating with family members, friends or even your healthcare team can be very difficult for people living with head and neck cancer,” said Mary Ann Caputo, executive director of Support for People with Oral and Head and Neck Cancer. “Your Cancer Game Plan provides guidance and advice for communicating with family and friends to help those affected by head and neck cancer express themselves in an effective way.” “Making sure your body gets the nutritional support it needs may help to keep your strength up through a treatment course. Adapting and managing meals is important for people living with head and neck cancer, and we’ve developed helpful tips and recipes that are designed with this in mind,” added Susan Bratton, founder and CEO of Savor Health. About Your Cancer Game Plan Your Cancer Game Plan serves as a central hub for those living with head and neck cancer and their loved ones as they take an active role in developing a “game plan” to address the emotional, nutritional and communication needs of their cancer journey. By visiting www.YourCancerGamePlan.com, people can hear Jim Kelly’s story as well as inspiring stories from other patients. There is also unique content, including nutritional information and recipes, coping strategies and communication tips. To learn more about head and neck cancer and Your Cancer Game Plan, visit www.YourCancerGamePlan.com or share on Twitter using #CancerGamePlan. “At Merck, we’re committed to supporting patients with cancer, and providing them with resources that can help them better navigate this complex and often isolating journey,” said Jill DeSimone, senior vice president, Merck Oncology, U.S. "We were inspired by Jim Kelly's passion and positivity, and we are proud to come together with Jim and leaders in the head and neck cancer community to bring Your Cancer Game Plan to people living with cancer." About Jim Kelly Jim Kelly began his professional football career in 1986, following two years with the United States Football League’s Houston Gamblers. During his 11 years with the Buffalo Bills, he led the team to six AFC East Championships and four consecutive championship appearances. Kelly holds the all-time professional football record for most yards gained per completion in a single game, and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2002. He became known for his motto: “You have to be ‘Kelly tough’.” This motto, built on the importance of being physically and mentally strong and able to bounce back from injuries, took on a new – and more important – meaning after his cancer diagnosis. Kelly was diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell cancer in his upper jaw in 2013. He underwent surgery, but after a follow-up test, Kelly found out the cancer had returned and he would need to receive further treatment. Finally, in August 2014, doctors gave Kelly the good news that they could no longer find evidence of cancer. About Head and Neck Cancer Alliance (HNCA) Head and Neck Cancer Alliance was formed when the Head and Neck Cancer Foundation and the Association for Head and Neck Cancer Awareness joined forces in 2006. HNCA strives to advance prevention, detection, treatment and rehabilitation of oral, head and neck cancer through public awareness, research, advocacy and survivorship. HNCA works to maximize internal and external resources to become a “one-stop center” dedicated to oral, head and neck cancers. HNCA provides ongoing support for those affected by head and neck cancer through various programs, including Oral, Head and Cancer Awareness (OHANCA), Gas Card Program, #OperationOral Project and Smash Cancer. In addition, HNCA volunteers work passionately to educate people about oral, head and neck cancers, and the importance of early detection and prevention through their volunteer network, awareness events, educational programs and health fairs.

About Support for People with Oral and Head and Neck Cancer (SPOHNC) Support for People with Oral and Head and Neck Cancer (SPOHNC) was established when Nancy E. Leupold, MA, oral cancer survivor, Founder and President, was looking for support more than 25 years ago following her diagnosis. From the first support group in 1991, the need for this type of patient network is critical. Today there are more than 125 local SPOHNC chapters throughout the U.S. focused on helping to connect patients with others going through similar cancer journeys and seeking valuable guidance from oncology healthcare professionals who are experts in the field of head and neck cancer. SPOHNC provides information and resources for cancer patients trying to gain a better understanding of their illness, including publications that feature head and neck cancer specialists, survivor sharing stories and current head and neck cancer news, which helps to meet a patients overall needs. In addition, SPOHNC’s National Survivor Volunteer Network serves to provide "connections" from survivor volunteers to newly diagnosed patients providing encouragement, support and hope from someone who has walked in their shoes.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Jan 24, 2017 at 6:21PM Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) released its fourth-quarter 2016 financials and the numbers show that the launch of a Remicade biosimilar by Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:PFE) could pose a big threat to the company's growth in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. A massive market The market for autoimmune disease drugs like Remicade is huge. Every year, billions of dollars are spent on these drugs, which can cost thousands of dollars per dose. Remicade is one of the oldest biologics used to treat autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis, and it's a complex biologic that can't be copied identically. However, patent expiration has led to the launch of biosimilars that deliver similar safety and efficacy. These biosimilars are already available in abroad markets, including Europe, but they're only now launching in the United States. In November, Pfizer became the first company to launch a Remicade biosimilar in the U.S. when it rolled out Inflectra. Although Inflectra has only been on the market for weeks, not months, Johnson & Johnson's fourth-quarter financials suggest Remicade's best days are behind it. In the fourth quarter, Remicade's U.S. sales slipped 1.7% to $1.17 billion. That's a big swing from its third-quarter performance, when Remicade's U.S. sales climbed 9.4% year over year to $1.22 billion. It also suggests tough sledding may be ahead for the company's sales in 2017, given that U.S. Remicade sales totaled $4.84 billion in 2016, up 8.7% from 2015. What's on deck Pfizer launched Inflectra with a price tag that's only about 15% less than Remicade, which can cost between $1,300 and $2,500 per dose. While that's not as big of a discount to the brand name price as typical generic small molecule drugs tend to launch with, it could still be enough to convince payers and doctors to prescribe it to newly diagnosed patients and cost-conscious patients. If so, then Inflectra could carve meaningful market share away from Remicade. Abroad, where Remicade is marketed by Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK), biosimilars are already taking a toll on Remicade, and the experience in those markets offers insight into how the U.S. market could play this year. Merck & Co. hasn't disclosed its fourth-quarter figures yet, but Remicade sales in the third quarter fell 30% to $311 million versus the third quarter of 2015. When Merck reported those figures, management cited biosimilars as the reason behind Remicade's revenue drop. Protecting its moat Johnson & Johnson will likely compete on price with Inflectra by offering greater discounts to payers. That could help it maintain market share against Inflectra, but it will cause headwinds to Remicade's sales and the drug's contribution to Johnson & Johnson's bottom line. The company hopes to make-up some of the negative drag on its financials caused by biosimilars by expanding the use of other autoimmune disease drugs in its line-up, including Stelara. Stelara is approved for use in psoriasis, and in September, the FDA expanded the drug's label to include its use in Crohn's disease. Johnson & Johnson thinks that could add $500 million in annual sales, or more. Johnson & Johnson is also working on next-generation drugs that could help sure-up the company's market share in rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, Johnson & Johnson and co-developer GlaxoSmithKline filed for FDA approval of sirukumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug that industry analysts think could have peak sales potential of $1 billion, or more. Although Johnson & Johnson's efforts may help it absorb Remicade weakness, Remicade's the company's best selling drug, and that means that it could pose the biggest risk to sales in 2017.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Jan 24, 2017 at 6:21PM Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) released its fourth-quarter 2016 financials and the numbers show that the launch of a Remicade biosimilar by Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:PFE) could pose a big threat to the company's growth in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. A massive market The market for autoimmune disease drugs like Remicade is huge. Every year, billions of dollars are spent on these drugs, which can cost thousands of dollars per dose. Remicade is one of the oldest biologics used to treat autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis, and it's a complex biologic that can't be copied identically. However, patent expiration has led to the launch of biosimilars that deliver similar safety and efficacy. These biosimilars are already available in abroad markets, including Europe, but they're only now launching in the United States. In November, Pfizer became the first company to launch a Remicade biosimilar in the U.S. when it rolled out Inflectra. Although Inflectra has only been on the market for weeks, not months, Johnson & Johnson's fourth-quarter financials suggest Remicade's best days are behind it. In the fourth quarter, Remicade's U.S. sales slipped 1.7% to $1.17 billion. That's a big swing from its third-quarter performance, when Remicade's U.S. sales climbed 9.4% year over year to $1.22 billion. It also suggests tough sledding may be ahead for the company's sales in 2017, given that U.S. Remicade sales totaled $4.84 billion in 2016, up 8.7% from 2015.

By Colin EllisStaff Writer Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-861-9253 Share Comment Read Article The Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruled Thursday that an Newport woman may not recover damages from an Albion health center or drug manufacturer after she gave birth following a procedure in which she was told a birth control instrument was inserted into her arm. Kayla Doherty gave birth to a healthy boy in June 2014, when she was 21. However, on Jan. 26, 2012, Doherty said, she went to a federally supported health care center in Albion to look into birth control options. According to the decision filed by the high court, Doherty saw a physician who recommended an implantable drug manufactured by Merck, which consists of a 4-centimeter-long rod that is inserted into a patient’s arm. The drug is designed to be effective for at least three years and inhibits ovulation. Doherty went through the procedure on Feb. 28, 2012, but later learned the device never was actually installed. She believed she could not get pregnant, but a pregnancy test at the health care center in October 2013 revealed she was in fact pregnant. An examination and subsequent ultrasound couldn’t locate the device in either of Doherty’s arms, and she was told by a nurse it was never inserted. She gave birth in June 2014. Doherty filed a lawsuit again Merck on theories of “strict product liability, breach of warranty, negligence, and negligent misrepresentation”; and against the United States for negligence of the physician and the physician’s failure to obtain her informed consent. She sought $250,000 in damages. The complaint also asked the federal court to declare the “wrongful birth” statute unconstitutional. Both Merck and the government moved to dismiss the complaints on the grounds that a healthy child is not a legally recognized injury for which Doherty could recover damages, and that Doherty did not undergo a failed sterilization procedure that would allow Doherty to claim damages under the state’s wrongful-birth statute. The statute says, in part, that it is contrary to public policy to award damages for the birth or rearing of a healthy child. It says a person may claim relief if a failed sterilization procedure results in the birth of a healthy child, and the individual may receive damages for medical expenses and loss of earnings. The court said Doherty’s claim was barred by the statute. The court was asked to answer three questions to determine whether Doherty could claim damages under the wrongful-birth statute, and by answering those questions the court determined Doherty could not recover damages from either defendant. The court concluded that a sterilization procedure was a medical or surgical procedure that alters the body “for the purpose of permanently ending the possibility of procreation.” The court went on to say sterilization procedures do not include temporary pharmaceutical intervention such as the implant Doherty believed had been inserted into her arm.

For full-year 2017, the U.S. drugmaker cut its adjusted earnings per share outlook by 15 cents, to between $2.70 and $2.90. Wall Street analysts, on average, had projected $2.96 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Foreign exchange rates and the potential for earlier-than-expected lung cancer competition from Merck & Co Inc were the main reasons for the lowered outlook for 2017, Chief Financial Officer Charles Bancroft said on a conference call with investors. Shares of Bristol-Myers, down 15 percent so far this year, fell 5.6 percent to $46.75 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. "For the first time in five years you might walk away thinking (Bristol-Myers) is not as confident as they were," Guggenheim analyst Tony Butler told Reuters. "Is Bristol questioning their own strategy? That's what the stock is telling you." Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers said it earned 63 cents a share in the fourth quarter, short of the average analyst estimate of 67 cents a share. Revenue rose 22 percent to $5.2 billion. Bristol-Myers said it expects full-year 2017 worldwide revenue to increase by a rate in the low single digits. Fourth-quarter sales of Opdivo, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, soared to $1.3 billion from $475 million a year earlier. Approved in late 2014 to treat melanoma, Opdivo later won approvals to treat lung and kidney cancer and is being tested against a wide array of other types of cancer. New competition late last year from the launch of Roche Holding AG's immunotherapy Tecentriq cut Opdivo's share of the U.S. second-line lung cancer market to about 40 percent. Bristol-Myers projected flat U.S. Opdivo sales this year. Competitor Merck earlier this month said it had filed for speedy U.S. approval of its Opdivo rival, Keytruda, in combination with chemotherapy, as an initial lung cancer treatment, and received a May 10 regulatory decision date. Bristol-Myers, citing available trial data, said last week it would not seek accelerated approval of its own combination of immunotherapy drugs Opdivo and Yervoy in first-line lung cancer. Lung cancer is by far the biggest oncology market and a handful of companies have been battling to dominate as an initial, or first-line, treatment, and to provide much-needed combination therapies. Bristol said it still expects full-year 2017 net earnings of $2.47 to $2.67 per share due to a recent patent settlement that includes a payment of $625 million from Merck. Fourth-quarter 2016 net income rose to $894 million, or 53 cents per share, from a year-earlier loss of $197 million, or 12 cents a share.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 26, 2017 10:33am   Comments Share: Related BMY Bristol-Myers Squibb Hits Lowest Level In 2 Years After Mixed Q4 Report In Lockstep: Dow 20,000 Significance Magnified By Record Highs For SPX Biotech Forum Daily Digest: Merger And Acquisition Activity Continues To Pick Up, Spotlight On Nabriva Therapeutics (Seeking Alpha) Related MRK Dow 10K's Hottest Stocks: Where Are They Now? Which Pharma Players Dominate The Lung Cancer Space? Biotech Forum Daily Digest: Merger And Acquisition Activity Continues To Pick Up, Spotlight On Nabriva Therapeutics (Seeking Alpha) Analyzing the monthly immuno-oncology sales data, Leerink said Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK)'s Keytruda is picking up speed, but Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY)'s Opdivo is flattish. Immuno-Oncology Market On Strong Wicket Analyst Richard Goss noted that Symphony Health sales showed that overall U.S. immuno-oncology sales rose 5 percent month-over-month in December, which he termed as a good performance. Merck's Keytruda and Roche Holding Ltd. (ADR) (OTC: RHHBY)'s Tecentriq drove the growth, with 14 percent and 13 percent growth, respectively, the analyst added. According to the analyst, these two drugs are continuing to gain share at the expense of Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo, which saw an anemic 2 percent growth in December. Keytruda To Dominate Next 2–3 Years For the fourth quarter, Leerink noted that Symphony's sales estimate for Opdivo is $741 million compared to Keytruda's $267 million. The firm believes the acceleration into December bodes well for Keytruda. Consequently, Leerink expects Keytruda to dominate this setting at least during the next two to three years on the back of Merck's successful development and filing strategies. Opdivo Has More Aces Up Its Sleeve Following Keytruda and Tecentriq's recently approved non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLS, indications, Leerink noted that both continue to gain share. However, the analyst believes Opdivo's newer indications , such as renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, head and neck cancer, and likely bladder cancer would offset some of the trend. Additional Opdivo Opportunities Factored In Consensus Estimate Additionally, Leerink thinks OUS Opdivo sales not captured by the Symphony data would be strong, helping Bristol-Myers Squibb in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017. The firm also pointed to the management's statement that it would recognize deferred revenues from France in the fourth quarter of 2016 and that the uptake in Germany and France has been as swift as in the United States. Though the firm expects additional revenues for the company in the fourth quarter, it feels the possibility is already incorporated in the consensus Opdivo sales estimates. At Time Of Writing Bristol-Myers Squibb was losing 1.55 percent to $48.78. Merck was slipping 0.34 percent to $60.87. Roche ADR was adding 0.99 percent to $29.70.

Which medical affairs services are most important. How, and how often doctors want to meet with your team. What you can do to improve your medical affairs services. That's actionable information you can use to turn your team into one that doctors rely on. Top Takeaways No team is safe: While two teams have a clear lead, overall quality scores are close at the top of the market, and any team could take the lead. What can lower-ranked teams do to boost their scores? A winning formula: Two of the top three medical affairs teams come from the same company. What do performance and satisfaction data reveal about the secret to their success? Clamouring for attention: Up to nearly one-third of respondents report interacting with the surveyed teams more than once per month. Are teams struggling to differentiate their products in a crowded market? Room for improvement: Performance and satisfaction scores are not positive across the board. Doctors, it seems, are only moderately happy, and have a host of recommendations for teams to improve their services. No substitute for in-person interactions: Not only do doctors rate face-to-face communication methods highest, they say that nearly every team needs improvement in areas related to in-person interactions.

For 2017, the company now expects adjusted earnings of $2.70 to $2.90 a share, down from its previous guidance of $2.85 to $3.05. Bristol pioneered cancer immunotherapy, a type of treatment that aims to fight cancer by harnessing the body's immune system, but it has been struggling in recent months to cope with competition from Merck & Co.'s Keytruda and most recently Tecentriq from Roche Holding AG. After Bristol announced in August that its immunotherapy Opdivo failed to meet the main goal of a critical study exploring the drug's use in advanced lung cancer patients who hadn't previously been treated, the company sought to persuade investors it still had bright prospects treating such patients, known as "first-line" lung cancer patients, by combining Opdivo with Bristol's other immunotherapy, Yervoy. The combination is under study. But last week, Bristol said it won't pursue speedy U.S. regulatory approval to market that combination as a first-line treatment for lung cancer. That announcement fed investor fears the company is losing ground in the race for this all-important patient group. In a conference call Thursday, Bristol said it was adjusting its sales strategy for lung-cancer patients. Executives said they expect Opdivo sales to grow overseas but to be flat in the U.S., where Bristol will concentrate on serving lung-cancer patients who have already received treatment until its trials studying combinations of therapies for untreated patients finish. "We do believe we have a meaningful role to play in lung cancer in the future," Bristol CEO Giovanni Caforio said on the conference call. Mr. Caforio also pointed to Bristol's pipeline of new kinds of immunotherapies in development. "I remain confident in our significant long-term opportunity in immuno-oncology," Mr. Caforio said. During the fourth quarter, Opdivo sales rose to $1.3 billion, up from $475 million during the period a year earlier. Yervoy sales edged 0.4% lower to $264 million world-wide. Revenue from another key Bristol product, the blood thinner Eliquis, jumped 57% to $948 million globally. In all for the December period, Bristol-Myers Squibb posted earnings of $894 million, or 53 cents a share, compared with a loss of $197 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. The 2015 results included after-tax charges of 24 cents a share from the Five Prime Therapeutics Inc. and Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals Inc. business development transactions and 8 cents a share for the transfer of the Erbitux business in North America to Eli Lilly & Co. Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings rose to 63 cents a share from 38 cents. Revenue surged 22%, to $5.24 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had predicted earnings of 67 cents a share on $5.13 billion in revenue. In the previous quarter, Bristol said it had begun a reorganization to streamline certain operations, such as its supply chain for pills. The company provided no update on the reorganization in Thursday's report. Write to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com and Jonathan D.

The company’s latest report states that the major drivers of this growth include aging populations and rising incident cases of colorectal cancer across most markets, the launch and uptake of premium-priced therapies and the resulting increase in the number of patients upon disease recurrence that are treated with branded therapies rather than generic chemotherapy. For example, Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is expected to be the first immune checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of microsatellite high colorectal cancer, and enjoy rapid uptake across the 8MM. Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma’s napabucasin and Array BioPharma’s combination of encorafenib + binimetinib are also expected to launch in 2020 in the second-line setting, thus addressing some of the main unmet needs in colorectal cancer, particularly the insurgence of acquired resistance to available therapies and the poor prognosis of BRAF mutant patients. The launch of these drugs will facilitate a gradual increase in the number of patients receiving branded therapy across different lines of metastatic therapy, thus increasing the patient pool of these segments and the overall colorectal cancer market size. Despite these new drugs, there will remain a lack of development of neoadjuvant/adjuvant pipeline agents for the treatment of resectable high-risk colorectal cancer. This setting has significant unmet needs, and represents a lucrative opportunity for developers of efficacious treatments that can improve cure rates for resected patients. With the lack of any new premium-priced agents in resectable high-risk colorectal cancer, GlobalData expects the status quo of drug treatment to remain with the prescription of generic and relatively cheap chemotherapies throughout the forecast period. Increasing cost-consciousness will limit premium pricing opportunities for pipeline agents. Healthcare austerity measures are being incorporated across the major markets, and drug companies will need to consider the changing reimbursement landscape when determining pricing strategies for their drugs. This era of austerity and healthcare reform will negatively affect companies’ ability to gain reimbursement approval for new CRC therapies.

Johnson & Johnson isn't following President Trump's advice to buy American. It's spending $30 billion of its overseas cash pile on a Swiss biopharmaceutical company, Actelion (ALIOY). Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has a reputation for keeping tens of billions in cash outside the U.S. to avoid paying high American corporate tax rates. Now it's putting the money to work. The company will still have about $12 billion in overseas cash after the deal closes, which is expected to be in the second quarter of this year. Other American companies have been reluctant to bring overseas profits home because of the 35% U.S. corporate tax rate, the highest among developed economies. Apple (AAPL, Tech30), General Electric (GE), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) all keep tens of billions overseas. Asked on a conference call Thursday about tax implications, J&J chief financial officer Dominic Caruso said the Actelion deal was good in part because there were no U.S. taxes attached to it. "That's the most attractive tax rate -- zero," he said, but noted he was closely watching for any developments on tax reform in the United States. Trump has said he wants to lower U.S. corporate tax rates, which would encourage companies to bring money back into the United States. During the presidential campaign, he suggested a tax rate of 10%. But that may not have the effect he wants: When companies have been granted tax breaks in the past, very little cash ended up returning to the United States. Related: Ray-Ban owner makes $50 billion glasses deal Johnson & Johnson is known for baby shampoo and consumer products, but it makes the bulk of its revenue selling drugs and medical devices. It's buying Actelion to get access to its blood pressure drugs and other drugs in later stages of development. J&J said the takeover would boost sales and profits immediately. It will also lower the company's overall tax bill because Switzerland is known for comparatively low corporate tax rates. Executives did not say how much the deal would help J&J save in tax. A J&J spokesman said the company didn't know yet whether the takeover would affect jobs. Companies like Johnson & Johnson that do business abroad can avoid paying U.S. taxes on the billions of dollars they keep offshore. As part of the deal, Actelion will spin off its early-stage research and development unit into a separate business that will stay in Switzerland. Actelion shareholders will get a stake in that business, and J&J will take a large stake, too. J&J and Actelion have been working on the takeover for months. It got dramatic in December when they publicly broke things off, only to return a few days later to exclusive talks.

For 2017, the company now expects adjusted earnings of $2.70 to $2.90 a share, down from its previous guidance of $2.85 to $3.05. Bristol pioneered cancer immunotherapy, treatment that aims to fight cancer by harnessing the body's immune system, but it has been losing ground to competitors in recent months, including Merck & Co.'s Keytruda. After Bristol announced in August that its immunotherapy Opdivo failed to meet the main goal of a critical study exploring the drug's first-line use in advanced lung cancer patients, the company sought to convince investors it still had bright prospects treating first-line lung cancer patients by combining Opdivo with its other immunotherapy Yervoy, which is under study. But last week, Bristol said it won't pursue speedy U.S. regulatory approval to market that combination as a first-line treatment for lung cancer. That announcement fed fears the company is losing ground in the race for this all-important patient group. During the fourth quarter, Opdivo sales rose to $1.3 billion, up from $475 million during the period a year earlier. Yervoy sales edged 0.4% lower to $264 million world-wide. Revenue from another key Bristol product, the blood thinner Eliquis, jumped 57% to $948 million globally. In all for the December period, Bristol-Myers Squibb posted earnings of $894 million, or 53 cents a share, compared with a loss of $197 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. The 2015 results included after-tax charges of 24 cents a share from the Five Prime Therapeutics Inc. and Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals Inc. business development transactions and 8 cents a share for the transfer of the Erbitux business in North America to Eli Lilly & Co. Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings rose to 63 cents a share from 38 cents. Revenue surged 22%, to $5.24 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had predicted earnings of 67 cents a share on $5.13 billion in revenue. In the previous quarter, Bristol said it had begun a reorganization to streamline certain operations, such as its supply chain for pills. The company provided no update on the reorganization in Thursday's report. Also last week, Merck agreed to pay $625 million plus royalties on Keytruda sales to Bristol and Ono Pharmaceutical Co. to settle a suit alleging the cancer drug violates their patent for immunotherapy. Bristol and Ono filed suit in federal court in Delaware in 2014, the same day that Merck received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Keytruda as a treatment for the deadly skin cancer melanoma. Bristol and Ono, who discovered and developed the PD-1 antibody Opdivo, had asserted in litigation that Merck's sale of Keytruda infringed the companies' patents relating to the use of PD-1 antibodies to treat cancer in the U.S., Europe, Australia and Japan.

For full-year 2017, the U.S. drugmaker said it now expects adjusted earnings of $2.70 to $2.90 per share, down from its previous range of $2.85 to $3.05 per share. Wall Street analysts, on average, had forecast $2.96 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding special items, Bristol said it earned 63 cents a share in the fourth quarter, falling short of the average analyst estimate of 67 cents a share. Revenue for the quarter rose 22 percent to $5.2 billion. Bristol said it expects full-year 2017 worldwide revenue to increase by a rate in the low single digits. Fourth quarter sales of Opdivo, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, soared to $1.3 billion from $475 million a year earlier. Approved in late 2014 to treat melanoma, Opdivo later won approvals to treat lung and kidney cancer and is being tested against a wide array of other types of cancer. But Bristol is seen as having fallen behind competitor Merck & Co. Earlier this month Merck said it had filed for a speedy U.S. approval of Opdivo rival, Keytruda, in combination with chemotherapy, as an initial lung cancer treatment, and had received a May 10 regulatory decision date. Bristol, citing available trial data, said last week it would not seek accelerated approval of its combination of immunotherapy drugs Opdivo and Yervoy in first-line lung cancer. Lung cancer is by far the biggest oncology market and a handful of companies have been battling to become dominant in initial, or first-line, treatment, and to provide much-needed combination therapies. Bristol, which recently announced a patent settlement that includes a $625 million payment from Merck, said it still expects full-year 2017 net earnings of $2.47 to $2.67 per share. Fourth-quarter 2016 net income rose to $894 million, or 53 cents per share, from a year-earlier loss of $197 million, or 12 cents a share.

(Investor's Business Daily) Related AZN How Pharmacy Benefit Managers Add To The Cost Of Your Prescription The Best BioPharma Plays Amid Uncertainty From Trump Comments Will Merck Let Incyte Go After AstraZeneca, Bristol, Roche Team-Ups Too? (Investor's Business Daily) Lung and bronchus cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, according to the National Cancer Institute. Lung cancer is of two types, namely non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, with the former more prevalent than the latter. Estimates by the institute also show that a quarter of a million patients are diagnosed with lung cancer in the United States, with 85 percent of them being NSCLC patient. Lung Cancer Types Based on the kind of cells found in the cell, NSCLC can be categorized into squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Meanwhile, SCLC is of two types, namely small cell carcinoma or oat cell cancer and combined small cell carcinoma. Immuno-oncology drugs account for about 30 percent of the total lung cancer drug market in the fourth quarter of 2016, an Investor's Business Daily report, quoting Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham, said. Merck Recently, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) got a shot in the arm, as the FDA accepted for review the sBLA for KEYTRUDA, plus chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of patients, with metastatic or advanced non-squamous, NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression and with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. The company had received a May 10 decision date. In October 2016, the FDA approved Keytruda as a first-line treatment, meaning it could be used in previously untreated lung cancer patients. Keytruda has the distinction of being the only approved first-line treatment for lung cancer. The drug is used to treat metastatic NSCLC patients, with high-levels of PD-L1, a protein that suppresses the immune system. The mode of operation is by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein called PD-1. Keytruda had already been approved for patients who have gone through chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC. Merck is also supposed to be testing immune-oncology combination, Keytruda, plus Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY)'s Alimta. Bristol-Myers Squibb Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY), with its Opdivo, is the market share leader in the NSCLC space, with Barclays estimating a share of close to 40 percent. In March 2015, the drug was approved for treating patients with metastatic NSCLC, with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. With Bristol-Myers not being able to make headway, its rivals are slowing and steadily stealing share from it. Last week, the company announced that it would not push for accelerated approval for Opdivo/Yervoy combination in first-line lung cancer. In August 2016, Opdivo failed as a monotherapy for first-line lung cancer, giving Merck the edge, given Keytruda's success as a monotherapy. Roche Roche Holding Ltd. (ADR) (OTC: RHHBY)'s Tecentriq was approved in October 2016 for treating people with metastatic NSCLC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Barclays' fourth-quarter estimates show that Tecentriq is modestly trailing Keytruda and is slowly gleaning share from Bristol-Myers Squibb. Tecentriq targets PD-L1 protein, unlike Opdivo and Keytruda, which target the PD-1 protein. Its list price is $12,500. AstraZeneca AstraZeneca plc (ADR) (NYSE: AZN) announced results of a late-stage trial with Tagrisso, a treatment for lung cancer, which showed that the treatment was more effective than chemotherapy in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor T790M mutation-positive advanced NSCLC. These patients were already unsuccessfully treated with an EGFR-targeted tyrokinase inhibitor. Tagrisso was approved by the U.S. FDA in November 2015 following a priority review. The drug has also been approved in the EU, Japan and other countries and has been accorded fast track review status in China. China offers huge potential for the company, given that it has a huge number of EGFR T790M mutation-positive population. The company expressed confidence that it can achieve peak annual sales of $3 billion for the drug. A rival drug candidate named rociletinib developed by Clovis Oncology Inc (NASDAQ: CLVS) was shelved in mid-2016 after a FDA panel rejected it. AstraZeneca is trying to expand Tagrisso's label in earlier lines of the EGFR-mutant NSCLC. The company is evaluating it as a first-line therapy in a Phase 3 trial. Another early stage trial is on to evaluate Tagrisso for treating patients with leptomeningeal disease, a complication of EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Summing Up... A FiercePharma report, quoting Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, estimates Opdivo sales of $8.1 billion in 2021 followed by $6.5 billion for Keytruda, $4.9 billion for Tecentriq and $1.8 billion for AstraZeneca's Tagrisso. It remains to be seen which company rules the roost in the lung cancer space. Will Bristol-Myers Squibb lose its market leader advantage? Will Merck build on its recent momentum? Will Roche emerge a serious contender in the space? Investors await answers for these questions, as the players in the space fiercely compete against other each other in a bid to gain competitive edge.

REUTERS/Vivek Prakash/File Photo Novartis (NOVN.S), lagging some other big drugmakers in the first wave of immunotherapy drugs that are revolutionizing cancer treatment, hopes to catch up by focusing on the next wave of immune system-boosting medicines. Setting out its research objectives in slides for a press conference on Wednesday, it said it aimed for "a leadership position in oncology" by focusing on second-generation immunotherapy. The Swiss drugmaker said it was rapidly progressing 18 checkpoint and other novel targets and expected to be running 20 exploratory studies in immuno-oncology by early 2017. Merck & Co (MRK.N), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Roche (ROG.S) are in the lead with cancer immunotherapies already on the market, but the field is developing fast and new treatments are expected to play an important role in drug cocktails. Novartis is already developing a novel cell therapy for childhood leukemia called CTL-019, which is on track for submission to regulators for approval early this year, although this initial market opportunity is small. Outside cancer, Novartis has a closely watched new drug for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis called BAF-312, which it hopes to file for approval in the first half of 2017, pending consultations with regulators. It is also looking to new products for heart and eye conditions and other serious diseases to help offset generic competition to its old blood cancer drug Glivec.

The European drug regulator approved MSD’s Lusduna -- a biosimilar drug referencing Lantus (insulin glargine), an insulin-based diabetes treatment originally developed by Sanofi -- on Jan. 4. It is the second Lantus biosimilar to be approved by the EMA after Eli Lilly’s Basaglar, another biosimilar referencing Sanofi’s top-selling diabetes drug.  Lusduna, also known as MK-1293, was developed by MSD with Samsung Bioepis contributing to the drug’s development as an investment partner. The EMA’s approval clears the way for MSD to commercialize its Lantus biosimilar in Europe, one of the world’s biggest markets for cell-based biologic drugs alongside the US. Biosimilars refer to cheaper, near-replicas of biologic drugs whose patents have expired. Sanofi’s formulation patent on Lantus, the company’s best-selling product, expired in Europe and the US in 2015. In addition to Europe, MSD has sought to launch its Lantus biosimilar in the US market as well. The drug was accepted for review by the US Food and Drug Administration back in August 2016. However, MSD may not be able to immediately commercialize its Lantus biosimilar in the US even if the FDA approves the drug, as it is engaged in an ongoing litigation with Sanofi over patents involving Lantus. Sanofi sued MSD in the US District Court of Delaware in September last year, alleging that MSD infringed on as many as 10 patents held by Sanofi for its blockbuster drug Lantus. The case has yet to reach a settlement. By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1. Satellite image shows NK res... 2. S.

Here's why. Jim Kelly said President Donald Trump stood by his family while he was undergoing cancer treatments. (Buffalo News file photo/Harry Scull Jr.) By Jay Skurski Published Thu, Jan 26, 2017 Updated Thu, Jan 26, 2017 SHARE TWEET EMAIL Donald Trump has Jim Kelly's support. The Buffalo Bills' Hall of Fame quarterback explained why during an appearance on Fox Business' "Varney & Co." this week. Host Stuart Varney asked Kelly if he supported our country's new president, and Kelly indicated that he does. "When I was going through my cancer fight ... he provided my family and friends with a place to stay, his apartments. He took care of my whole family," Kelly said of Trump. "Donald did that for my whole family. There were days when I would come to New York City. I'd give him a call, and I'd go up and we'd sit there and shoot the bull, have a little fun." Kelly and Trump have known each other for more than 30 years, dating to when the quarterback played for the Houston Gamblers of the United States Football League. Trump owned the New Jersey Generals at the time, and purchased the Gamblers after the 1985 season. The league folded before Kelly would ever play for Trump. "Everybody has their personal opinions," Kelly said. "I'm not here to say yes or no, but yes, I like Donald. He's been very good to my family. We all make mistakes and I'm sure he's made a few, but I'm happy for him." Buffalo in the '90s: Donald Trump, Jim Kelly and Zubaz Kelly appeared on the show to promote the promotional campaign he has developed with pharmaceutical company Merck and various cancer organizations. Titled "Your Cancer Game Plan," the campaign stresses the importance of maintaining a positive attitude in the face of a cancer diagnosis. "I’m sitting here today and being able to talk about it," Kelly said, "and, hopefully, be a difference maker for others out there -- that you don’t want them to give up.” The complete video of Kelly's appearance is below: Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com Click here to see the comments.

Biotech, Pharma For J&J, $30B Actelion deal is less about synergies, more about future promise By Arundhati Parmar Post a comment / Jan 26, 2017 at 3:28 PM Shares3 The rationale for big deals in the devices sector in the past few years has been about synergies. Think about the $49 billion mega-merger of Medtronic and Covidien. Or the combination of Biomet and Zimmer. But in the world of Big Pharma, especially in the last few years, acquisitions are about finding new markets and growth as patent cliffs loom. Johnson & Johnson’s $30 billion purchase of Swiss biotech firm Actelion should be seen in that light. Synergy is more of an afterthought in this deal. Here’s a quick breakdown of the transaction announced Thursday: J&J will pay $30 billion ($280 per Actelion share) in cash to acquire Actelion, mainly known for drugs treating pulmonary arterial hypertension. A new unnamed (NewCoR&D) company will be spun out in which the New Brunswick company will have a 16 percent equity stake that will work on pipeline products. They will include treatments for specialty cardiovascular disorders, central nervous system disorders, immunological disorders and orphan diseases. “The main reason of this deal is to continue to build on the strength of the pulmonary hypertension franchise and the late-stage pipelines of Ponesimod, Cadazolid as well as the agreement to commercialize the ACT 577,”said Joaquin Duato, executive vice president and worldwide chairman, J&J, according to a webcast of a press conference held at the company’s headquarters in Switzerland. “Synergies will play a small role and they will come mainly from administrative areas.” Ponesimod and Cadazolid are drugs being developed to tackle multiple sclerosis and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. ACT-577 is a resistant hypertension drug in Phase II trials. The new research company is expected to be spun out in June and floated in the Swiss exchange. J&J’s move is to shore up Big Pharma’s position in new markets even though the price tag is high. “While some investors may question the price JNJ is paying for Actelion, the deal reflects the scarcity value of assets large enough to move the needle on revenue and EPS (earnings per share) growth,” wrote Glenn Novarro, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, in a research note. In other words, there aren’t a lot of biotechs out there that can provide immediate and noteworthy revenue upside. But J&J’s chief financial officer pushed back on this idea of how some investors are viewing this deal. “We have higher expectations on the penetration and the expansion of these products that maybe currently anticipated by the investor community and that’s a result of our in-depth discussions with Actelion, our review of the potential here and so we feel very confident that there is plenty of upside over and above what’s been currently modeled,” said Dominic Caruso, according to a transcript of a conference call from Seeking Alpha. There is a reason for investor concern. Patents of blockbuster drugs expiring mean more generic competition for Big Pharma. The mood was best captured at a morning reception during J.P Morgan’s annual healthcare conference in San Francisco recently. After attendees responded that large pharma companies won’t see growth much at all in 2017, a Merck executive explained that as a result, dealmaking for biotechs will be up. “So then the corollary becomes, ‘what do you do to fix it’ and that’s when you pay too much for a biotech company,” declared Sunil Patel, vice president and head of corporate development at Merck. J&J may have paid too much, but one good news that J&J is that there are no U.S. tax implications. “The purchase at $30B is more than steep and the contribution to J&J’s top-line outlook is de minimis, but because it effectively puts the company’s OUS cash to work, it is easily accretive,” wrote Michael Weinstein, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, in a research note Thursday.

Researchers focused on women with a common condition known as cervical dysplasia, abnormal tissue growth that is typically caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Milder cases of dysplasia may go away on their own, but doctors often surgically remove abnormal tissue in more severe cases to help prevent the condition from progressing to full-blown cervical cancer. “Women who have already had the surgery to remove pre-cancerous lesions may want to wait a while to get pregnant, as we found the risk of pre-term birth increased even more if women gave birth within a year of their surgery,” said study co-author Allison Naleway, of the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in Portland, Oregon. In the study, researchers examined data on pregnancy outcomes for 4,307 women who didn’t have cervical procedures and compared them to 322 women who had surgery to remove precancerous tissue and another 847 women who had cervical biopsies to investigate abnormalities. Women who had surgeries that cut out at least one centimeter of tissue were more than twice as likely to have preterm births or underweight babies as women who didn’t have any cervical procedures, the study found. And when women gave birth within one year of cervical surgery, their odds of these complications more than tripled. Compared to women who didn’t have surgery, those who did were more likely to be smokers, overweight or obese and first-time mothers. Researchers looked at several common surgical methods for removing or destroying precancerous tissue, including excising cells with a scalpel or destroying tissue with a laser, using a thin wire loop to burn tissue with an electrical current or using a device that freezes tissue. About 5 percent of women who had ablation procedures, typically using the wire loop, had preemies, compared with about 10 percent of women who had less than 1.6 centimeters of tissue excised with scalpels. When women had 1.6 centimeters of tissue or more cut out, 28 percent of them had preterm babies. By way of comparison, 7 percent of women in the study who didn’t have cervical procedures had preterm babies, as did 8 percent of women who had cervical biopsies. Women who had excision procedures cutting out at least 1 centimeter of tissue were 2.2 times more likely to have low-birthweight babies as women who had no cervical surgery or only biopsies, researchers report in PLoS ONE. Miscarriages and stillbirths were more likely among women who had ablations, however. About 25 percent of women who had ablations experienced pregnancy loss, compared with 19 percent of women who had excision procedures and 18 percent of women who didn’t have cervical surgery or biopsy. Cesarean deliveries were also more likely among women who had cervical surgeries, but the increased risk wasn’t big enough to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance. One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on excision thickness for some women and also didn’t have information on a variety of factors that can influence pregnancy outcomes like women’s income and education levels, marital status and type of insurance.

Former group business director Melissa Martinez is now chief marketing officer, the first to hold that title in New York. Global business director Michael Collins has been promoted to partner and managing director. The agency also hired Condé Nast veteran Kimberly Bernhardt to serve as managing partner and Alexander Rea as its first creative technology officer. "It's an exciting time for us," said DDB New York president and CEO Chris Brown. "We had a successful 2016 with revenue and profit growth and we are very focused on maintaining this momentum in 2017. These promotions and hires are part of this and reinforce our commitment to ensuring we attract and retain the very best talent." Martinez joined DDB more than two and a half years ago after serving in account director roles at the New York offices of BBDO, Havas and Ogilvy & Mather. Brown noted that she had been running "big integrated pieces of business for us" including portions of the New York Lottery and State Farm accounts.

Bernhardt previously worked in the publishing world as executive director of communications at Glamour magazine. She previously served as evp on the Unilever business at Edelman, the world's largest independent PR firm.

Regarding the office's plans moving forward, Brown said, "I don't think we've ever been busier from a pitch perspective ... there's always lots of stuff happening, and we're creatively busy in production on all of our clients, including new campaigns for the Tribeca Film Festival and the Ad Council."

Channel NewsAsia Return to Mobile Site Cervical surgery for pre-cancer tied to preemies and small babies News TV Connect Watch Live 0 My Playlist Sign In Menu News Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather MORE Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Live Shows News Schedule Features On The Ground Specials Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS Return to Mobile Site Health Cervical surgery for pre-cancer tied to preemies and small babies Posted 27 Jan 2017 01:05 Email More A A (Reuters Health) - - Women who get surgery to treat precancerous abnormalities on their cervix are more likely to have premature or low-birth weight babies than women who don’t have these procedures, a recent study suggests. Researchers focused on women with a common condition known as cervical dysplasia, abnormal tissue growth that is typically caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Milder cases of dysplasia may go away on their own, but doctors often surgically remove abnormal tissue in more severe cases to help prevent the condition from progressing to full-blown cervical cancer. “Women who have already had the surgery to remove pre-cancerous lesions may want to wait a while to get pregnant, as we found the risk of pre-term birth increased even more if women gave birth within a year of their surgery,” said study co-author Allison Naleway, of the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in Portland, Oregon. In the study, researchers examined data on pregnancy outcomes for 4,307 women who didn’t have cervical procedures and compared them to 322 women who had surgery to remove precancerous tissue and another 847 women who had cervical biopsies to investigate abnormalities. Women who had surgeries that cut out at least one centimeter of tissue were more than twice as likely to have preterm births or underweight babies as women who didn’t have any cervical procedures, the study found. And when women gave birth within one year of cervical surgery, their odds of these complications more than tripled. Compared to women who didn’t have surgery, those who did were more likely to be smokers, overweight or obese and first-time mothers. Researchers looked at several common surgical methods for removing or destroying precancerous tissue, including excising cells with a scalpel or destroying tissue with a laser, using a thin wire loop to burn tissue with an electrical current or using a device that freezes tissue. About 5 percent of women who had ablation procedures, typically using the wire loop, had preemies, compared with about 10 percent of women who had less than 1.6 centimeters of tissue excised with scalpels. When women had 1.6 centimeters of tissue or more cut out, 28 percent of them had preterm babies. By way of comparison, 7 percent of women in the study who didn’t have cervical procedures had preterm babies, as did 8 percent of women who had cervical biopsies. Women who had excision procedures cutting out at least 1 centimeter of tissue were 2.2 times more likely to have low-birthweight babies as women who had no cervical surgery or only biopsies, researchers report in PLoS ONE. Miscarriages and stillbirths were more likely among women who had ablations, however. About 25 percent of women who had ablations experienced pregnancy loss, compared with 19 percent of women who had excision procedures and 18 percent of women who didn’t have cervical surgery or biopsy. Cesarean deliveries were also more likely among women who had cervical surgeries, but the increased risk wasn’t big enough to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance. One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on excision thickness for some women and also didn’t have information on a variety of factors that can influence pregnancy outcomes like women’s income and education levels, marital status and type of insurance. GlaxoSmithKline, which makes one of two HPV vaccines approved in the U.S., paid for the research and three of the authors were employees of the company at the time. A fourth author disclosed having received consulting fees from both GSK and Merck, which manufactures the other U.S.-approved HPV vaccine. The results suggest that the actual treatment of cervical dysplasia, rather than the condition itself, is a relevant factor in increasing the risk of pregnancy complications, said Dr. Christina Chu, a gynecologic oncology researcher at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study. “The best thing that women can do is to protect themselves against HPV infection, which is the greatest risk factor for developing cervical dysplasia,” Chu added by email. “Girls and young women should get the HPV vaccine.” When women are treated for this condition, waiting to have a baby may make sense. “It does appear that the risks may be less for women who deliver more than one year after excision, so if excision is necessary, women may consider delaying pregnancy to allow the cervix to heal fully,” Chu said.

Jan. 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Fish & Richardson has been named an IP Practice Group of the Year for the fifth consecutive year by Law360 for helping "win a U.S. Supreme Court decision that reshaped a key aspect of patent law" and for securing "major litigation victories for companies such as Gilead Sciences Inc. and Power Integrations Inc." Fish was one of only five firms nationwide that was singled out by Law360 as an IP Practice Group of the Year.  According to Law360, the "firm is no stranger to accolades, having been consistently ranked among the nation's premier practice groups for years." "Headlining the firm's recent achievements was the Supreme Court's June decision in a case involving Halo Electronics Inc., in which the justices relaxed the standard for proving willful infringement and made it easier for patent owners to recover enhanced damages. Legal experts widely agree that the case was among the most important patent cases of 2016."  "We continually ask ourselves whether supposedly settled points of law should be challenged, even at the Supreme Court, if necessary," said Kurt Glitzenstein, Litigation Practice Group Leader at Fish. Law360 noted that this "type of mindset" was part of Fish's success in another high profile win for client Shaw Industries Group Inc. "that provided much-needed guidance for accused infringers that challenge patents at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board." "In a favorable decision for Shaw, the Federal Circuit held that petitioners are not barred from raising those noninstituted grounds, keeping them available for litigation." "Fish handled 90 new competitor cases in 2016, up 50% from the year before. That is a reflection of the confidence that big companies – blue chip, Fortune 500 companies – have in our practice because we simply know how to win at every level, whether it's at trial, at the PTAB or on appeal," added Glitzenstein. Law360 also highlighted some of Fish's impressive wins for several other clients. For Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Fish "successfully challenged a number of technology patents at the PTAB, including media storage patents owned by Smartflash LLC and semiconductor patents owned by Home Semiconductor Corp." "In district court, Fish was able to secure more than $200 million in damages for clients in four trial wins, including a $139.8 million damages award for Power Integrations Inc. in a patent infringement suit against Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc." "But perhaps the most memorable trial moment" for Fish came "when a California federal judge overturned a $200 million jury award that Merck & Co. had won in a patent case just months earlier against Gilead Sciences Inc." In the "headline-grabbing decision," the judge detailed "'serious and outrageous conduct' that…left Merck with no right to enforce against Gilead two patents related to hepatitis C treatment." "The opinion is 65 pages long and extremely well-reasoned," said Juanita Brooks, the Fish principal who co-led the Gilead litigation team with Fish principal Jonathan Singer. "The judge meticulously went through the record to support her findings. We were very pleased that she did such a thorough job." Fish & Richardson is a global patent, intellectual property (IP) litigation, and commercial litigation law firm with more than 400 attorneys and technology specialists across the U.S. and Europe. Fish has been named the #1 patent litigation firm in the U.S. for 13 consecutive years and is one of the busiest post-grant firms, representing more petitioners at the PTAB than any other firm. Fish has been winning cases worth billions in controversy – often by making new law – for the most innovative clients and influential industry leaders since 1878.

Profit excluding some items totaled 63 cents a share, below the 67-cent average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based drugmaker also lowered its forecast for 2017 profit to a range of $2.70 to $2.90 a share, compared with the average estimate of $2.96.  The shares dropped 5.7 percent to $46.75 at 1:42 p.m. in New York. Opdivo, which is approved to treat melanoma and lung cancer, and Yervoy, approved just for melanoma, remain the company’s main drivers of growth. Bristol-Myers is focusing mostly on these immune-based therapies, though investors hope their performance in clinical trials improves. In August, Opdivo failed in a lung cancer trial that would have widened its use. Combination Treatment Last week, the company announced that it wouldn’t seek early approval for its cocktail of Opdivo and Yervoy as a primary, or first-line, treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The decision doesn’t remove the possibility that the combination may succeed, and Bristol-Myers is relying on them working, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a research note.  Still, the decision was seen by analysts and investors as another boon to chief rival Merck & Co., whose similar drug Keytruda is now approved as a primary treatment for lung cancer. The decision adds long-term risk of failure for the Bristol-Myers trial, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The company didn’t provide details about its decision not to seek quicker approval on a Thursday conference call with analysts. Bristol-Myers still has multiple trials in which various uses of the drug are being tested, Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Caforio told analysts.  “We do believe we have an opportunity to have a meaningful role to play in the future in lung cancer,” he said. He said the company is fully committed to exploring the drug combination in multiple tumors and is optimistic about additional immune-oncology data for several types of cancer coming out in 2017. Hepatitis C Drugs Yervoy generated $264 million in fourth-quarter sales, little changed from $265 million a year earlier and well short of the $300 million predicted by analysts. Revenue from Opdivo almost tripled to $1.31 billion, compared with $1.16 billion predicted by analysts. The company is projecting U.S. sales for Opdivo to remain flat in 2017, Chief Commercial Officer Murdo Gordon said on the call, although it’s confident it can defend its market position in second-line lung cancer. Roche’s cancer treatment Tecentriq captured 10 percent of Bristol-Myers’s’ U.S. market in second-line lung cancer, the company said Thursday. Exclusive insights on technology around the world.

That included a 51 percent drop of hepatitis C drug sales to $226 million, missing predictions of $256 million. Analysts expect sales to continue to decline because of competing products from Gilead Sciences Inc. and AbbVie Inc. HIV franchises for Sustiva and Reyataz each saw sales declines of more than 20 percent, while hepatitis B drug Baraclude fell 4 percent. Bristol-Myers, the smallest major U.S. drugmaker by market value, is the second member of Big Pharma to report its fourth-quarter earnings since Donald Trump was sworn in as president last week. Cancer treatments such as Bristol-Myers’s are expensive, though they haven’t drawn the scrutiny from Trump and Congress that other high-priced medicines have attracted. Sales of heart drug Eliquis, another key to the company’s growth, increased 57 percent to $948 million, while analysts anticipated $967 million. Other highlights from the second quarter: Revenue increased 22 percent to $5.24 billion from a year earlier, above the $5.12 billion predicted by analysts. Net income was $894 million, or 53 cents a share, compared to a net loss of $197 million, or 12 cents, a year earlier. Analysts predicted $1.04 billion, or 61 cents a share. Orencia sales rose 16 percent to $625 million, topping the $607 million forecast by analysts. Sprycel sales rose 15 percent to $494 million, above estimates of $474 million.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Deena Beasley Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) on Thursday posted a fourth-quarter profit that fell short of Wall Street estimates and lowered its 2017 earnings forecast, citing tempered expectations for its key Opdivo immuno-oncology drug. For full-year 2017, the U.S. drugmaker cut its adjusted earnings per share outlook by 15 cents, to between $2.70 and $2.90. Wall Street analysts, on average, had projected $2.96 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Foreign exchange rates and the potential for earlier-than-expected lung cancer competition from Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) were the main reasons for the lowered outlook for 2017, Chief Financial Officer Charles Bancroft said on a conference call with investors. Shares of Bristol-Myers, down 15 percent so far this year, fell 5.6 percent to $46.75 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. "For the first time in five years you might walk away thinking (Bristol-Myers) is not as confident as they were," Guggenheim analyst Tony Butler told Reuters. "Is Bristol questioning their own strategy? That's what the stock is telling you." Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers said it earned 63 cents a share in the fourth quarter, short of the average analyst estimate of 67 cents a share. Revenue rose 22 percent to $5.2 billion. Bristol-Myers said it expects full-year 2017 worldwide revenue to increase by a rate in the low single digits. Fourth-quarter sales of Opdivo, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, soared to $1.3 billion from $475 million a year earlier. Approved in late 2014 to treat melanoma, Opdivo later won approvals to treat lung and kidney cancer and is being tested against a wide array of other types of cancer. New competition late last year from the launch of Roche Holding AG's (ROG.S) immunotherapy Tecentriq cut Opdivo's share of the U.S. second-line lung cancer market to about 40 percent. Bristol-Myers projected flat U.S. Opdivo sales this year. Competitor Merck (MRK.N) earlier this month said it had filed for speedy U.S. approval of its Opdivo rival, Keytruda, in combination with chemotherapy, as an initial lung cancer treatment, and received a May 10 regulatory decision date. Bristol-Myers, citing available trial data, said last week it would not seek accelerated approval of its own combination of immunotherapy drugs Opdivo and Yervoy in first-line lung cancer. Lung cancer is by far the biggest oncology market and a handful of companies have been battling to dominate as an initial, or first-line, treatment, and to provide much-needed combination therapies. Bristol said it still expects full-year 2017 net earnings of $2.47 to $2.67 per share due to a recent patent settlement that includes a payment of $625 million from Merck. Fourth-quarter 2016 net income rose to $894 million, or 53 cents per share, from a year-earlier loss of $197 million, or 12 cents a share.

Johnson & Johnson will Actelion kaufen Fünf Antworten zur Milliardenübernahme von Wener Grundlehner 26.1.2017, 11:43 Uhr Der US-Konzern Johnson & Johnson offeriert den stolzen Preis von 30 Mrd. Dollar für die Schweizer Biotechfirma Actelion. Warum zahlt der Konzern diesen Preis, und wie sieht die Zukunft von Actelion aus? Der markante Actelion-Hauptsitz von Herzog & de Meuron in Allschwil. (Imago) 1. Wieso ist Johnson & Johnson bereit, einen derart hohen Preis zu zahlen? Der angebotene Preis von 30 Mrd. $ entspricht dem 12-Fachen des Umsatzes und dem 36-Fachen des Betriebsgewinns von Actelion. Für diesen hohen Preis gibt es einen wichtigen Grund: Mehrere Anwendungen von J&J sind von Patentabläufen betroffen. Während der Jahresabschluss 2016 erfreulich ausfiel, blieb der Ausblick für 2017 hinter den Erwartungen zurück. Die Actelion-Medikamente gegen Bluthochdruck in der Lunge erzielen bisher hohe Preise und bedienen einen kleinen Nischenmarkt, der von den Diskussionen um die Preissetzung für Medikamente in den USA kaum betroffen sein wird. Johnson & Johnson zahlt 30 Milliarden Dollar für Biotechunternehmen Actelion lässt Gerüchte wahr werden 26.1.2017, 09:55 2. Zuletzt gab es zahlreiche Gerüchte zu Verhandlungen und Offerten. Wird dieses Angebot Bestand haben? Erstmals stehen die Verwaltungsräte beider Unternehmen hinter dem Angebot. Der Preis wird von Beobachtern als sehr vorteilhaft erachtet. Die vielen institutionellen Investoren, unter anderen Hedge-Funds, werden zugreifen, da ein besseres Angebot kaum wahrscheinlich ist. 3. Wie sieht die Zukunft des verbleibenden «Schweizer» Unternehmensteils um CEO Jean-Paul Clozel aus? Das ausgegliederte Unternehmen wird während Jahren keine Verkaufserlöse erzielen. Man wird sich darauf konzentrieren, die bestehenden Medikamente-Kandidaten durch die klinische Phase und die Marktzulassung zu bringen. Das dauert aus Erfahrung viele Jahre. Die Actelion-Abspaltung verfügt über den Vorteil, dass sie mit Jean-Paul Clozel über einen etablierten CEO verfügt sowie auf ein erfahrenes Forschungs- und Entwicklungsteam zählen kann. Auch die Geldbeschaffung dürfte einfacher ausfallen als bei Startup-Unternehmen, die sich bezüglich Produkten in einer ähnlichen Situation befinden. 4. Wer ist J&J überhaupt? Das US-Unternehmen ist ein Mischkonzern im Gesundheitsmarkt. Rund 45% des Umsatzes von 70,1 Mrd. $ (2015) werden im Pharmabereich erzielt. Damit ist der US-Konzern die Nummer fünf unter den Medikamentenherstellern hinter Pfizer, Novartis, Roche und Merck & Co. Im Medtech-Bereich werden 36% der Verkäufe erzielt (Implantate, Chirurgiegeräte). Im Jahr 2011 kaufte J&J für 18 Mrd. $ das Schweizer Orthopädie-Unternehmen Synthes. 19% des Umsatzes erzielen die Amerikaner mit Konsumgütern, beispielsweise dem bekannten Babyshampoo. Übernahme von Actelion An Geld fehlt es Johnson & Johnson nicht von Dominik Feldges 26.1.2017, 16:15 5. Ist dies der Auftakt zu einem weiteren Übernahmeboom in der Pharmabranche? Besonders aktiv dürften amerikanische Unternehmen werden. Der neue Präsident, Donald Trump, hat weitreichende Steuerreformen in Aussicht gestellt, die es Firmen mit Sitz in den Vereinigten Staaten ermöglichen würden, umfangreiche Barbestände aus dem Ausland gegen Bezahlung eines reduzierten Steuersatzes zu repatriieren. Diese Gelder dürften US-Konzerne in Kauflaune versetzen. Die Schweizer Vertreter Roche und Novartis sahen zuletzt von grossen Transaktionen ab und gaben an, organisch und mit kleineren Ergänzungsakquisitionen wachsen zu wollen. Blitzkarriere eines Roche-Spin-off (sda) Actelion hat sich in weniger als 20 Jahren von einem kleinen Roche-Ableger zu einem hochprofitablen Pharmaunternehmen gemausert. Der Gründer Jean-Paul Clozel ist heute noch Chef, inzwischen von 2560 Festangestellten weltweit. – Actelion gegründet hatten am 17. Dezember 1997 drei frühere Roche-Forscher, die beim Absprung einen vielversprechenden Stoff in Lizenz mitnahmen. Drei Jahre später überzeugte die junge Firma, die zunächst auf Pump vom Geld optimistischer Investoren lebte, die Börse: Beim IPO starteten die Aktien mit einem Rekordwert von 1,2 Milliarden Franken. – Das Vertrauen der Anleger zahlte sich aus, denn 2001 kam mit Tracleer das erste Medikament auf den Markt und schlug ein. Dessen Indikation «lebensbedrohlicher Bluthochdruck im Lungenkreislauf» (PAH) ist bis heute die Stärke der Actelion-Forscher. Im Jahr 2004 erreichte die Firma erstmals die Gewinnschwelle. – Zulassungserweiterungen und Nachfolgemedikamente zum PAH-Fokus sind seither gefolgt. Daneben strebt Actelion als inzwischen grösste europäische Biotech-Firma eine Diversifikation in andere Gebiete und Wirkstoffe an. Unter anderem steht seit 2015 mit Ponesimod ein Mittel gegen Multiple Sklerose in der klinischen Prüfung (Phase III). – Diversifikation soll das PAH-Klumpenrisiko reduzieren. Als die Umsätze wegen des Ablaufs des Patentschutzes für das Firmenstandbein Tracleer sanken, zog Actelion 2012 ein Sparprogramm mit Personalabbau durch. Zuvor hatte 2004 ein Misserfolg in einer klinischen Studie den Aktienkurs absacken lassen. Mittlerweile setzt Actelion 2 Milliarden Franken jährlich um. 2015 wies das Unternehmen einen Reingewinn von 552 Millionen Franken aus. - Actelions Erfolg, symbolisiert auch durch einen spektakulären Konzernsitz der Architekten Herzog & de Meuron in Allschwil bei Basel, hatte schon früher Übernahmegelüste geweckt. So machte 2010 der Hedge-Fund Elliott Advisors Druck auf das Unternehmen zwecks Renditesteigerung. Clozel konterte erfolgreich mit der ersten Dividendenzahlung sowie einem wertsteigernden Aktienrückkauf. Johnson-&-Johnson-Chef Alex Gorsky Ex-Militär an Actelions Fersen von Stefan Paravicini, New York 29.11.2016, 05:30 Zwar war Alex Gorsky auch in die Synthes-Übernahme involviert gewesen, in jüngster Zeit war Johnson & Johnson bei grossen Deals aber zurückhaltend. Ändert sich das jetzt? Pharma-Branche Actelion verhandelt exklusiv mit Johnson & Johnson von Dieter Bachmann 21.12.2016, 18:27 Das Hin und Her um die Baselbieter Pharmafirma Actelion geht weiter: Statt angeblichen Verhandlungen mit Sanofi bestätigt Actelion erneute Verhandlungen mit dem amerikanischen Konzern Johnson & Johnson. Biotech-Übernahme Und täglich grüsst der Actelion-Interessent von Werner Grundlehner 16.12.2016, 11:26 Vermeintliche Insider lassen weitere Details zum Angebot des französischen Pharmakonzerns Sanofi durchsickern. Der Aktienkurs reagiert aber nicht ganz so, wie erwartet wurde. Weitere Übernahmegerüchte Actelion hält die Phantasie am Leben von Werner Grundlehner 14.12.2016, 20:17 Johnson & Johnson zieht sich aus dem Bieterkampf um Actelion zurück. Die französische Sanofi soll mit einem sehr hohen Angebot noch im Rennen sein. Die Aktionäre trauen der Sache aber nicht. Gerüchteküche brodelt Erneut wirbt Johnson & Johnson um Actelion von Werner Grundlehner 21.12.2016, 21:29 Actelion berichtet über ein erneutes Interesse des amerikanischen Pharmakonzerns. Es gibt gute Gründe dafür, dass der Deal diesmal schnell über die Runden geht.

(Benzodiazepines, Non-Benzodiazepines (Zaleplon), Orexin Antagonist) & OTC Treatment (Antihistamine, Melatonin, Valerian Root)) - Forecasts to 2021   (EMAILWIRE.COM, January 26, 2017 ) Browse 16 market data tables and 33 figures spread through 144 pages and in-depth TOC on U.S. Insomnia Market" <||>rnhttp://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/us-insomnia-market-55727597.html Early buyers will receive 10% customization on reports. The U.S. insomnia market is projected to reach USD 4.24 Billion by 2021 from USD 3.38 Billion in 2016, at a CAGR of 4.6% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the launch of new drugs for the treatment of insomnia and government support to control rising insomnia cost. However, due to the erosion in branded drugs sales and growing adoption of generics attributed to their low cost and equal efficacy as compared to branded products may hinder the growth of the market. Download PDF Brochure@ http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownload.asp?id=55727597 Based on the type of treatment, the U.S. insomnia market is segmented into non-pharmacological treatment and pharmacological treatment market. The pharmacological treatment market is further is categorized into prescription sleep aids and over-the-counter sleep aids. The OTC sleep aids segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. Owing to their easier availability and low price as compared to prescription sleep aids. Furthermore, the publicity regarding the side effects of the prescription sleep aids has also steered the patients towards OTC sleep aid options. The prescription sleep aids segment is categorised into non-benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines, orexin antagonists, melatonin receptor agonists, and other prescription sleep aids. The orexin antagonist sleep aids segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period due to its greater efficacy than non-benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine drugs. The OTC sleep aids is further segmented into antihistamines, melatonin, valerian roots, and other herbal and dietary supplements. Request Sample Pages@ http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsample.asp?id=55727597 The non-pharmacological treatment market is categorised into cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTI), hypnotherapy, and other alternative therapies. The other alternative therapies include exercise/ yoga, acupuncture, biofeedback, bright light therapy, music therapy, and aroma therapy. Most of these therapies are given in combination with CBTI and hypnotherapies in order to provide better results for insomnia patients. CBTI is the highly recommended treatment option for insomnia patients due to its most effective use with multiple approaches such as relaxation training, cognitive therapy, stimulus control (SC), sleep restriction therapy (SRT), sleep hygiene, biofeedback, and others that help doctors to understand and cure patient comprehensively. CBTI is followed by hypnotherapy, due to its advantage of curing insomnia with its root cause. Some of the major players in the U.S. insomnia market market include Eisai Co., Ltd. (Japan), Meda Consumer Healthcare Inc. (U.S.), Merck & Co., Inc. (U.S.), Pernix Therapeutics Holdings (U.S.), Pfizer, Inc. (U.S.), Sanofi S.A. (France), Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd.

When subpoenaed to answer questions on the price increases, Shkreli proved himself to be arrogant and intractable, at one point refusing to answer all questions, except for those relating to his name, in front of a panel convened by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for the US House of Representatives. He later tweeted that he considered the lawmakers to be ‘imbeciles.' The pharmaceutical industry and Stephen Ubl, CEO of the trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), quickly distanced themselves from Shkreli. In a response, Shkreli launched a website detailing how his crimes are only a very small part of a much larger ongoing practice within the pharmaceutical industry. The website, called Pharma Skeletons, is a simple text-only page that lists pharmaceutical giants like AbbVie, Allergan, Merck, Novo Nordisk, and many others. Each listing is accompanied by short, often personal, notes and links to news articles pointing out those companies' remarkably similar wrongdoings and shady business practices. "This website took me half an hour to make, just 'membering a few moments from the past. Pharma is a wonderful industry that does great things, but trying to throw me under the bus is foolish," Shkreli notes on the site. Shkreli's site appears to be an attempt to counter comments made by PhRMA boss Ubl during an appearance on CNBC, in which the latter announced an initiative called GOBOLDLY, diverting public attention from unethical business practices in the pharmaceutical industry by pointing to expensive and groundbreaking drug innovation. During that appearance, Ubl remarked that there should be more attention paid to researchers in "lab coats" and less notice paid to people in "hoodies," a clear reference to Shkreli's choice of outerwear. "Stephen Ubl, don't you dare point your finger at me for the pharmaceutical industry's troubles. It turns out we've all made some unpopular moves," Shkreli wrote. Shkreli, in attempting to justify his own questionable actions, claimed that, as a CEO, he received "a very low or zero salary" at his companies. "Your CEOs enjoy the fat paychecks they receive from price increases. I put my money from price increases into research," Shkreli wrote. Shkreli promised to update his website regularly. ...

By Philipvan Doorn Investing columnist To some, Dow 20,000 is a cause for celebration. To others, it’s just a fascination. For shrewd investors, it’s an opportune time to consider how expensive stocks are. This chart shows that the price-to-earnings ratio for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04%  has never been higher (going back 15 years), while the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.09%  was considerably higher in 2002: FactSet So we thought it would be helpful to see which of the 30 Dow stocks are cheapest, according to consensus 2018 earnings estimates. After that, we’ll review which stocks have posted the fastest growth in sales per share and the ones most beloved by Wall Street analysts.

The heroic group goes by the acronym CDC SPIDER, the latter half of which stands for Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research. In their accusatory letter, the CDC SPIDER group wrote to Carmen S. Villar, Chief of Staff at the CDC, and a copy was sent to the renowned watchdog organization, US Right To Know (USRTK). “We are a group of scientists at CDC that are very concerned about the current state of ethics at our agency. It appears that our mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests. It seems that our mission and Congressional intent for our agency is being circumvented by some of our leaders. What concerns us most, is that it is becoming the norm and not the rare exception.” The letter goes on to note that several senior management officials are clearly aware of what is transpiring and continue to remain silent, merely turning a blind eye and acting as if these unacceptable practices aren’t taking place. The CDC SPIDER group states that some of these officials even encourage these practices. CDC SPIDER writes that these illegitimate behaviors are taking place at all levels and units of the CDC; no one appears to be immune. The group states, “These questionable and unethical practices threaten to undermine our credibility and reputation as a trusted leader in public health.” (Related: Learn more about CDC controversies at CDC.news) Concerns about the CDC’s ethics have been on the rise for the last several months, the culmination of which truly resides in CDC SPIDER’s momentous letter. While their complaints were filed anonymously for obvious reasons — like fear of retribution — CDC SPIDER could very well be the face of a revolution against a government addled with corporate interests and steeped in fake science. It is easy to see how the CDC could fall prey to corporate interests. A quick look at the CDC Foundation reveals a huge list of corporations that donated money to the CDC during the 2016 fiscal year. Among the dozens of companies on the list, one can see that several big name brands have made such donations. Abbott Laboratories, Merck, Bayer Corporation, Cargill Inc., The Coca-Cola Company and Pfizer Foundation are just a few of the names on the list. Oddly enough, one of SPIDER’s complaints, as noted by Carey Gillam for Huffington Post, was that the CDC had developed a “troubling” relationship with the beverage giant Coca-Cola and their nonprofit group International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). One must wonder if the relationships with other cash donors might also be viewed as unsettling. The Coca-Cola relationship is particularly startling when you note the fact that several CDC scientists appear to have colluded with them or ILSI to further the beverage industry agenda. One example of this was when the CDC’s Director for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention, Barbara Bowman, had to retire after her bad behavior came to light. She was, apparently, even giving a Coke advocate guidance on how to influence world health authorities on sugar and beverage policies. Another scientist, Dr. Michael Pratt, has come under fire for his close work with ILSI, co-authoring papers funded by Coca-Cola, and most disturbingly, even receiving funding to attend industry-sponsored events and conferences. While the CDC Foundation notes that their organization is authorized by Congress to “facilitate partnerships between CDC and the private sector,” one can’t help but wonder if the concerns brought forth by CDC SPIDER are possibly related to the foundation. While the organization appears to make great efforts to create some semblance of ethics, it is truly mind-boggling that a government agency is allowed, indirectly, to take money from major corporations. Desperate for change, the SPIDER group concluded their letter with a plea for the Director of Staff to put an end to the corrupt practices taking place at the CDC. Whether or not anything will come of it remains to be seen.

By Philipvan Doorn Investing columnist To some, Dow 20,000 is a cause for celebration. To others, it’s just a fascination. For shrewd investors, it’s an opportune time to consider how expensive stocks are. This chart shows that the price-to-earnings ratio for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04%  has never been higher (going back 15 years), while the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.09%  was considerably higher in 2002: FactSet So we thought it would be helpful to see which of the 30 Dow stocks are cheapest, according to consensus 2018 earnings estimates. After that, we’ll review which stocks have posted the fastest growth in sales per share and the ones most beloved by Wall Street analysts.

By Alan Tovey 6:27 AM Thursday Jan 26, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Markets United States Sponsor message.   Video will play in Play now Don't auto play Never auto play What's happening? The Dow Jones Industrial average has hit the psychologically important 20,000 mark, having repeatedly tested this level in the run-up to Christmas and consistently hit record highs. What is the Dow Jones? It's a price-weighted index of 30 of the largest and/or most important publicly traded companies in the US. Invented by Charles Dow in 1896, it acts as a proxy for the wider health of the US economy. What's so important about the 20,000 level? In many ways, nothing - it's just a number that relates to performance. However, to humans trading shares, rather than computer algorithms, it represents a significant marker. It's a "resistance level" that can be difficult to break through for human dealers who often trade on fears.But we've got here. How? Myriad factors. 1. President Trump Perhaps the most important one is President Donald Trump. There was a degree of nervousness ahead of the US election but once the bombshell result had been digested, investors decided that Trump would be good for business, and particularly some of the companies that are Dow members. 2. Industry's likely to be stronger Continued below. Related Content Donald Trump's White House press secretary Sean Spicer: 'One way or another Mexico will pay for wall' China touted as TPP partner after US move Video Watch: Dow Jones industrial average crosses 20,000 Trump has pledged to strengthen US manufacturing and bring work home, bolstering companies such as Caterpillar, which is up more than a third in the year to date, and United Technologies, 15 per cent stronger. Other big winners are 3M and IBM, both about a fifth more valuable.

Photo / AP Trump's tweeted threats about the repercussions for US companies which elected to offshore work caused some consternation, but did have the effect of least encouraging some high-profile names to bring work home or invest in domestic production facilities. Companies with big manufacturing operations such as Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble have also soared, as their prospects are closely linked to economic growth. There's also been the promise to rebuild the US's worn-down infrastructure, which will generate jobs and in turn boost economic growth domestically. Today, Trump is expected to sign legislation promising to build his controversial wall on the US-Mexico border, a massive infrastructure project which will deliver a huge lift to construction and building materials businesses. 3. A shot in the arm for pharma businesses Drug companies also surged immediately after the election, on the belief that Trump would support a free market in healthcare and a potential roll-back of the controversial Obamacare, though the president-elect has since tempered this enthusiasm, saying: "I'm going to bring down drug prices... I don't like what's happened to drug prices." Still, companies in the sector such as United Health and Merck have risen by almost 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. 4. Banks are in the money The real stock market darlings are in the banking sector, which has surged on the prospect of lighter regulation. As the Dow neared the 20,000 mark just before Christmas, analysts calculated that investment in Goldman Sachs, up 34 per cent in the year to date, was responsible for 419 points of the index's rise since the start of the year. Rival JP Morgan wasn't far behind, with its shares rising a hair less than 30 per cent in the year to date. Higher interest rates - Fed chair Janet Yellen has already hiked once and signalled two or three more rises to come - have also helped, as banks perform better when rates are higher as they can charge more for loans.

Oiling the wheels Trump's Cabinet appointments also send a loud signal that his administration could be good for big business. Most notable is ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson as secretary of state - it's no wonder that Dow constituent Exxon is a major gainer over the year, rising 16pc, though this is far behind Chevron, which is up more than 30 per cent. 6. A cabinet of billionaires Other big business names will be joining Trump in the White House. Investor and former banker Wilbur Ross - who has an estimated fortune of US$2.5 billion - is slated to be secretary of commerce. The nomination for army secretary is Vinnie Viola, the founder of trading firm Virtu Financial; he's estimated to be worth US$1.8b. Other leading business figures in Trump's cabinet include a former Goldman COO. There's a lot of bad things going on, though - why is the Dow rising? Despite terrorist attacks, markets have proven surprisingly resilient, shrugging off fears. It seems that there's a newfound confidence in the air. Anything else driving this? Well, there's the traditional Santa rally that took place before Christmas which set up the Dow to get to the 20,000 mark. As the year ends, shares tend to rise. There are many theories about what drives it, from dealers clearing up trades for the end of the year, people investing bonuses, and just general seasonal good cheer driving stocks higher. Whatever the reason, it held true at the end of 2016, and set up the Dow for a winning start to 2017. - Daily Telegraph UK By Alan Tovey Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Januar 2017 , aktualisiert 25. Januar 2017, 13:10 Uhr Bild vergrößern Der US-Konzern ist damit weltweit fünftgrößter Anbieter von Medikamenten, nach Pfizer, Novartis, Roche und Merck & Co. Bild:  Bloomberg von Siegfried HofmannQuelle:Handelsblatt Online Was Produkte für Diabetespatienten betrifft, gibt es seit Jahren einen Preisverfall. Nach Bayer will sich auch US-Pharmariese Johnson & Johnson aus dem Geschäft zurückzuziehen – und sich auf andere Sparten konzentrieren. FrankfurtDer amerikanische Pharma- und Medizintechnik-Riese Johnson & Johnson (J&J) versucht, sein Produktspektrum weiter auf Wachstum zu trimmen. Während der Konzern auf der einen Seite weiter mit der Schweizer Biotechfirma Actelion über eine Übernahme verhandelt, leitet er im Gegenzug nun einen Rückzug aus dem Geschäft mit Diabetes-Diagnostika ein. Für die Tochterfirmen Lifescan, Animas und Calibra prüfe man strategische Optionen, gab J&J bei Vorlage der jüngsten Quartalszahlen bekannt. Mit knapp zwei Milliarden Dollar Umsatz im vergangenen Jahr und sieben Prozent Umsatzrückgang gehört das Diabetesgeschäft zu den kleineren Sparte von J&J und zudem zu den wachstumsschwächsten Teilbereichen des Konzerns. J&J leitet mit den Plänen den kompletten Rückzug aus dem Diagnostik-Segment ein, nachdem man die Sparte Labordiagnostik bereits 2015 an Carlyle verkauft hat.  Anzeige Diabetes-Diagnostika erlebten in den vergangenen Jahren einen deutlichen Preisverfall aufgrund geänderter Erstattungsregeln und wachsender Konkurrenz aus Asien. Auch andere Hersteller sind in dem Segment daher unter Druck geraten. Bayer verkaufte sein Geschäft mit Diabetes-Tests bereits vor zwei Jahren an Panasonic. Abgesehen von der Schwäche im Diabetesgeschäft präsentiert sich J&J unterdessen in relativ in starker Verfassung. So konnte der Konzern den Umsatz insgesamt im vierten Quartal um knapp zwei Prozent auf 18 Milliarden Dollar und im Gesamtjahr um 2,6 Prozent auf 72 Milliarden Dollar steigern. Der Nettogewinn legte im Quartal um 18 Prozent auf 3,8 Milliarden Dollar und im Gesamtjahr sogar um 22 Prozent auf 16,5 Milliarden Dollar zu. Vor allem die Pharmasparte legte mit 6,5 Prozent weiter überproportional zu und trägt mit 31 Milliarden Dollar Umsatz inzwischen mehr als 40 Prozent zum Konzernumsatz bei. Der US-Konzern ist damit weltweit fünftgrößter Anbieter von Medikamenten, nach Pfizer, Novartis, Roche und Merck & Co. Stark vertreten ist J&J ferner im Geschäft mit rezeptfreien Gesundheitsprodukten und in der Medizintechnik (Implantate, Chirurgiegeräte etc.). Mit seinen Zahlen für das vierte Quartal hat der US-Konzern die Erwartungen des Marktes leicht übertroffen. Der Ausblick auf 2017 dagegen fiel etwas vorsichtiger aus als von vielen Analysten erwartet. Insgesamt stellt J&J vier bis fünf Prozent Umsatzwachstum sowie eine Steigerung des Gewinns je Aktie um fünf bis sieben Prozent in Aussicht.   Ähnlich wie viele Konkurrenten dürfte auch J&J in gewissem Grad vom wachsenden Preisdruck auf dem US-Pharmamarkt gebremst werden. Hier drängen Versicherer in jüngerer Zeit verstärkt auf Rabatte gegenüber den hohen Listenpreisen von Medikamenten. Zudem hat auch der neue US-Präsident Donald Trump Widerstand gegen die Preispolitik der Pharmabranche angedeutet, was für einige Verunsicherung in der Branche sorgt. Mit der Übernahme der Schweizer Actelion würde sich J&J unterdessen mehr als zwei Milliarden Dollar zusätzlichen Umsatz sowie Wachstumspotenzial im Bereich spezieller Herzmedikamente sichern. Agenturberichten zufolge ist der US-Konzern bereit, dafür mehr als 26 Milliarden Dollar zu zahlen. Actelion ist Marktführer bei Medikamenten gegen Lungenhochdruck, einer speziellen form von Bluthochdruck, und hat hier seine Position in den vergangenen Jahren durch zwei Neuzulassungen abgesichert, die für die nächsten Jahre ein relativ stetiges Umsatzwachstum versprechen. Vor allem solche Produkte sind in der Pharmabranche derzeit begehrt, um mögliche Umsatzschwächen und wachsenden Preisdruck bei älteren Präparaten auszugleichen. Nicht zuletzt vor diesem Hintergrund erwarten Branchenkenner, dass die Übernahmewelle im Pharmasektor generell weitergehen wird. Die Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Beratungsgruppe Ernst & Young etwa geht davon aus, dass „das globale Transaktionsvolumen in der Pharmabranche die im vergangenen Jahr erzielte Marke von 200 Milliarden US-Dollar auch 2017 wieder übersteigen wird.“ Auch die jüngsten Veränderungen der politischen Umfelds, insbesondere nach der Präsidentenwahl in den USA, schätzt EY-Pharmaexperte Gerd Stürz, „werden weitere Impulse für den Transaktionsmarkt geben.“ Quelle:  Handelsblatt Online Schlagworte: Mergers & Acquisitions M & A Anlagetipp-Aktie Aktie Johnson & Johnson Pharmazeutika Actelion EY Ernst & Young Roche Pfizer Novartis Merck & Co Panasonic Bayer © Sie wollen unsere Inhalte verwenden?

Wall Street Daily Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us WSD Team Contact Us Archives Ensure Email Delivery Frequently Asked Questions Broker Listing How Will We Stop the Rise of Superbugs? Published Thu, Jan 19, 2017  |  David Dittman, Contributing Writer A Nevada woman is dead because of an infection that was able to fend off every available antibiotic in the United States. Be afraid. Be very afraid. It’s happening. AMR is killing Americans. It’s not some descendent of al-Qaida or an offshoot of ISIL. Nor is it some new disease. It’s “antimicrobial resistance.” And like all the trouble in the post-Cold War world coming back to haunt us, it’s a serious case of blowback. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), AMR describes “the ability of a microorganism (like bacteria, viruses, and some parasites) to stop an antimicrobial (such as antibiotics, antivirals and anti-malarials) from working against it. As a result, standard treatments become ineffective, infections persist and may spread to others.” STAT News has it all in a January 12, 2017, headline: “A Nevada Woman Dies of a Superbug Resistant to Every Available Antibiotic in the U.S.” Writes Helen Braswell: Public health officials from Nevada are reporting on a case of a woman who died in Reno in September from an incurable infection. Testing showed the superbug that had spread throughout her system could fend off 26 different antibiotics. “It was tested against everything that’s available in the United States… and was not effective,” said Dr. Alexander Kallen, a medical officer in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s division of healthcare quality promotion. So-called superbugs are ascendant because of us. “We misuse antibiotics everywhere,” noted Dame Sally Davies, Chief Medical Officer for England, in a September 23, 2016, conversation with William Karesh of the Council on Foreign Relations. “They’re used for growth promotion and in well animals,” Davies explained. “So they’re actually substituting for good hygiene and sanitation. And as a result, infections — drug-resistant infections — are more prevalent in the States.” Use of antibiotics in agriculture, aquaculture, ethanol production and other everyday applications “provides multiple opportunities for the selection and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria,” read a study in PLoS Biology. “Testing showed the superbug that had spread throughout her system could fend off 26 different antibiotics.” According to STAT News’ Braswell, the Nevada woman had actually traveled extensively in India in recent years. She broke her femur a couple years back while on the subcontinent and subsequently developed an infection for which she was hospitalized there “a number of times,” the final instance in June 2016. In mid-August, she was hospitalized in Reno and diagnosed with an infection of Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are generally linked with urinary tract infections. Klebsiella pneumoniae are part of more generic classification, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, “bacteria that commonly live in the gut that have developed resistance to the class of antibiotics called carbapenems.” As Braswell notes: “CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden has called CREs ‘nightmare bacteria’ because of the danger they pose for spreading antibiotic resistance.” That this isn’t strictly a homegrown AMR is no cause for comfort. Dr. James Johnson, a professor of infectious diseases medicine at the University of Minnesota, tells Braswell it’s “highly improbable” that the Nevada woman is the “only person in the U.S.” similarly afflicted. It’s likely that other Americans “are carrying similar bacteria in their guts and could become sick at some point.” Indeed, Johnson thinks “this is the harbinger of future badness to come.” And it’s already pretty bad. As we discussed in the October 19, 2016, issue of Wall Street Daily: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 2 million people per year in the United States become infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 people die as a direct result of these infections. Worldwide, the number is more than 700,000. By 2050, we could be looking at 10 million AMR-related deaths per year. For reference’s sake, cancer kills about 8.2 million worldwide annually. Last October, we highlighted a handful of companies that were beginning to respond to this emerging threat, including France-based Eligo Bioscience, which is researching a CRISPR/Cas-based solution to the AMR problem. It’s likely that other Americans “are carrying similar bacteria in their guts and could become sick at some point.” Indeed, Johnson thinks “this is the harbinger of future badness to come.” Eligo recently won the Startup Battle at Labiotech Refresh, the premier biotech conference in the European Union. As Clara Rodríguez Fernández writes for Labiotech, “The startup’s revolutionary approach consists in delivering CRISPR via phages to selectively kill nocive bacterial strains. These ‘sequence-specific antimicrobials discriminate the bugs at the strain level while leaving the rest of the flora completely intact.’ Since a healthy microbiome is closely linked with multiple aspects of human health, this technique could make a big change in how we fight disease.” Seres Therapeutics Inc. (MCRB), a $400 million company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is developing an investigational oral microbiome therapeutic for the prevention of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). CDI, according to the Centers for Disease Control, is one of the top three most urgent antibiotic-resistant bacterial threats in the United States. Meanwhile, Allergan Plc (AGN), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK), Novartis AG (NVS), Pfizer Inc. (PFE), and Sanofi SA (SNY) have formed an alliance to plot a “roadmap to combat antimicrobial resistance. These are major movers in a market that could swell from $11.3 million in 2015 to $433.5 million by 2025. A little more news like that out of Nevada just might make antibiotics a lot more lucrative.
