ELLIOTT 6/08/2017 Reprints XAutoplay: On | OffTech stocks once again set the example as a late rally on Thursday hauled the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 out of shallow losses to a positive finish. The Nasdaq ended 0.4% higher, enough to notch a new closing high and turn the index positive for the week.  The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 scratched only the thinnest of gains, although the Dow did manage to jab briefly to a fresh high earlier in the session. Both indexes remain down for the week. Small caps ran well ahead of the general market, with Russell 2000 and the S&P SmallCap 600 each rallying 1.4%. Preliminary data showed volume sharply higher on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq vs. trading levels on Wednesday. Alibaba, Yahoo, Nvidia, HealthEquity Seize New Highs Stocks on the Dow industrials ended half higher, half lower. JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Caterpillar (CAT) bandied about the lead, each ending up more than 1.2%. Merck (MRK) narrowed its late loss to 1.3% after Newlink Genetics (NLNK) announced Genentech would return the rights to NewLink's navoximod following disappointing results in a joint trial that tested Genentech's indoximod in combination with Merck's keytruda. The move left Merck down 4% for the week and testing support at its 40-week moving average. The low-priced Newlink unraveled 41%. China's Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) lofted 13% higher, snapping far past a 126.50 buy point in a three-weeks tight pattern.  The online retail and e-commerce giant, also an IBD 50 and Leaderboard stock, announced full year revenue guidance far above consensus views at its investors day conference. Yahoo (YHOO) topped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 with a 10% advance. The rise came partly from Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba, but news reports that Verizon (VZ) planned to trim yahoo's work force by 2,100 during its integration with AOL may also have been a factor. The gain sent shares past Yahoo's November 2014 peak. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) hurtled ahead 7% after Citigroup lifted the stock's price target. That put the IBD 50 stock up 11% so far for the week and extended well into new highs. Health savings manager HealthEquity (HQY) popped 3% in heavy trade. After a strong quarterly report delivered late Tuesday, the stock has surged and is extended above a 49.35 buy point. Europe is likely to be a factor in early trade Friday as results come in from today's parliamentary elections in the U.K. Late polls showed Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative party with a significant lead over the Labour party. May hopes the snap election with strengthen her backing in Parliament and support negotiations on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.

Kolon Life Science's Invossa, a gene drug for osteoarthritis, will receive an approval from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety later this month at the earliest, according to sources. This would make it the world's first medicine for the degenerative joint disease. SK Chemicals is also expecting authorities to give the green light to its shingles vaccine in the coming months, the biotech company said. The new vaccine will break the current monopoly held by MSD Korea, the local unit of U.S. pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co, in the market estimated at some 80 billion won (US$71.35 million) in value. Green Cross Corp., another leading drugmaker, is also preparing to release its tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine for adults later this year, after receiving an approval from the government in November, the sources said. South Korea currently imports all Td vaccines. "The research and development capability that has been accumulated over the years by the local pharmaceutical industry is starting to bring about results," said Lee Jae-kook, senior executive at the Korea Pharmaceutical and Bio-Pharma Manufacturers Association.

Clockwise from left: Julie Gerberding, Wendy Williams, Sirio Maccioni, and Cheryl Boone Isaacs. Source: Subject (4) Bloomberg News June 8, 2017, 3:00 PM EDT From Subscribe Reprints For the past four years, dedicated readers of Bloomberg Businessweek have been rewarded for finishing the magazine with a back page titled “How Did I Get Here?” The feature profiled industry leaders by printing their résumés alongside first-person anecdotes about important moments from their childhoods and careers. Jeffrey Katzenberg, then chief executive officer of DreamWorks Animation LLC, was the first subject, in May 2013. Really dedicated readers know that at the bottom of the page participants listed “life lessons,” the shiniest pearls of wisdom from their time in the arena. In all, 168 of the most significant names in business shared their stories, resulting in about 500 lessons. The guidance was personal and practical and born as much of failure as success. We’ve collected the best of this counsel and organized it according to what an aspiring CEO would need to know en route to the corner office. Week to week, there were oft-repeated golden rules for advancing up the ladder, which we’ve compiled into four master classes. Print out these pages, uncap that highlighter, and never say we didn’t give you good advice. The attributions throughout this section reflect the job titles the interviewees had at the time their “How Did I Get Here?” page appeared in print. Starting out  “Don’t worry about making this choice or that one. Put each new opportunity in your toolbox—you never know when it’ll be useful.” —Julie Gerberding, executive vice president for strategic communications, global public policy, and population health, Merck & Co. “Try to find an easy field. In restaurants, you have to do everything, working six days a week.” —Sirio Maccioni, restaurateur, Le Cirque restaurants, and co-CEO, Maccioni Group Restaurants “Learn to code, even if you’re not techy. It’s the new literacy for a century worth of jobs.” —Alexis Ohanian, co-founder, Reddit Inc. “Internships are the way you learn what you want and don’t want out of your career, because you see the behind-the-scenes lifestyle. Lifestyle is as important as the career that you choose.” —Wendy Williams, host and executive producer, The Wendy Williams Show “Get an offer. Even if you decide you don’t want it, it will help you get other offers.” —Chip Bergh, president and CEO, Levi Strauss & Co. “Early on, put your head down, learn as much as you can, and look up in 10 years.” —Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Clockwise from bottom left: Tristan Walker, Beth Mooney, Roger Ferguson Jr., Freda Lewis-Hall, and Claus Meyer. Source: Subject (5) Planning your ascent “Careers are climbing walls, not ladders. A ladder is vertical and unidirectional.” —Roger Ferguson Jr., president and CEO, TIAA-CREF “Spend the first third of your life learning, the second earning, and the third returning.” —Tristan Walker, founder and CEO, Walker & Co. “When you aspire to be a CEO, it’s a slippery slope—not everyone will get on your side. Learn to wear ambition well and care about people.” —Beth Mooney, CEO and chairman, KeyCorp “You don’t need a long-term plan.” —Claus Meyer, culinary entrepreneur “If something seems out of reach, move closer. My uncle taught me that: He was a tailor who’d been touched by polio. He was undaunted by his paralysis—he just found himself in one meaningful and impactful situation after another.” —Freda Lewis-Hall, chief medical officer and EVP, Pfizer Inc. “Tell people what you want. Go ask for it.” —Laura Sen, CEO, BJ’s Wholesale Club Golden Rule No. 1: The smartest thing to do is hire smarter “Never be the smartest guy in the room. Surround yourself with talent.” —Lorenzo Fertitta, chairman and CEO, Ultimate Fighting Championship “Surround yourself with people who challenge you.” —Sheila Johnson, founder and CEO, Salamander Hotels & Resorts LLC, and vice chairman, Monumental Sports & Entertainment LLC “Surround yourself with people smarter and better than you.” —Spencer Rascoff, CEO and board member, Zillow Group Inc. “Hire people smarter than you. It’s an honor and a pleasure when my team outshines me.” —Danielle Brown, chief diversity and inclusion officer, chief of staff to the CEO, and VP for human resources, Intel Corp. “Hire people who know far more than you do.” —Anthony Romero, executive director, American Civil Liberties Union Picking the right job “If a job doesn’t make you think, ‘Wow, I’m not really sure I can do it,’ it’s not challenging enough.” —Danielle Brown, chief diversity and inclusion officer, chief of staff to the CEO, and VP for human resources, Intel Corp. “International assignments put you on the fast track to success.” —Ilene Gordon, chairman, president, and CEO, Ingredion Inc. “Find a job at the intersection of what you’re uniquely good at and what you love. A lot of people are good at a lot of stuff, but you need to find that thing that you’re uniquely good at.” —Suzy Welch, author and speaker “Don’t sell sugar water. The biggest problem is that the smartest people aren’t working on the biggest problems. It’s easy to go through life not realizing that you can have an impact on others.” —Scott Heiferman, co-founder and CEO, Meetup Inc. “Take the jobs that no one else wants to do. If you go work on a brand that 10 other people have worked on and everyone’s written off, and you can turn it around, then that’s how you make a name for yourself.” —Greg Creed, CEO, Yum! Brands Inc. “When assessing whether you’re in the right company, look at the compensation, work-life balance, and job descriptions of people 10 years senior.” —Spencer Rascoff, CEO and board member, Zillow Group Inc. “At a certain point in your career, don’t pick your next job, pick your next boss.” —Lauren Zalaznick, EVP, NBC Universal “Choose a workplace not for ego reasons like title and money, but because it fits your values.” —Brad Smith, CEO and chairman, Intuit Inc. Clockwise from left: Tracey Massey, Tom Colicchio, Glenn Kelman, and Kevin Hartz. Source: Subject (4) Hiring superstars “Never compromise on the team, especially in the early stages. Set an extremely high bar for talent of first-hired employees.” —Kevin Hartz, partner, Founders Fund “A human being’s most important trait is the quality of his or her energy.” —Glenn Kelman, CEO, Redfin Corp. “My first shift manager said, ‘I hired you because I could work for you one day.’ That was a valuable piece of advice he gave me—and if you listen to it, you’ll help your own development.” —Tracey Massey, president, Mars Chocolate North America LLC “If you don’t provide opportunities to grow, people leave.” —Tom Colicchio, owner, Crafted Hospitality, and head judge, Top Chef “Hire kind and interesting people who make you laugh. And when you make a hiring mistake, fix it as quickly as possible. You will make hiring mistakes.” —Ami Dar, founder and executive director, Idealist.org Finding your moral compass “Develop a reputation as a straight talker and a truth teller. Make your words mean something when you say them.” —Jo Ann Jenkins, CEO, AARP Inc. “Never lie to anyone about anything, and do the right thing—you know the difference.” —Alan Horn, chairman, Walt Disney Studios “Never compromise your integrity. It’s the only thing you have.” —Strauss Zelnick, founder and partner, ZelnickMedia Corp. “‘It’s business, not personal’ is the most damaging phrase in business, because it removes ethics and morality from decision-making.

By Arianne Cohen Most of the wisdom on these pages comes from interviews I conducted during the past three years. In that span, I’ve learned a few things. The first: Booking time with a chief executive officer is like hurling yourself into a castle moat and waiting for a guard to fish you out—you might be floating for a while. Assistants fend off interlopers, and publicists offer one 8:14 a.m. slot half a year away, along with a warning that their client will have mere minutes to chat. The interview will be canceled on short notice—“Earnings call! Sorry!”—and rescheduled for the next month. When they eventually happen, the Q&As are almost always worth the near-drowning. Generally, executives prove affable, and they’re likely to keep the conversation going past the allotted time. Here’s a little secret: Schedules in the corner office are cushier than they’re made out to be. After more than 100 interviews with business leaders, I can say, with all due respect to my subjects, that CEOs aren’t always geniuses. They are always dogged, however—they’ve navigated decades of meetings and deftly gathered power and purse strings along the way. Much of their advice reflects this: Persevere, and for God’s sake, make friends. I can also say that the people with the laugh-out-loud stories were the ones who’d gotten their hands dirty. The warts-and-all anecdotes usually came from people outside of the corporate world, such as comedian Marc Maron, who presented his career as a cascade of professional and romantic failures. Restaurateurs regaled me with tales of passed-out-drunk chefs, months-late openings, and sick staffers. All chieftains give advice—it’s part of the job description—and I benefited from it. I got personal financial tips from Suze Orman and diaper recommendations from Rosalind Brewer, then-CEO of Sam’s Club, who used to design the products for Kimberly-Clark. Female executives like her generally gave stronger interviews than their male counterparts. They were concise, prepared, and self-aware—“Was that OK?” was a familiar coda. A few women politely declined to participate, saying they wouldn’t have time to locate the personal photos the magazine needed to illustrate the page. Most males’ photos arrived in my in-box neatly labeled, often forwarded from their wives’ email accounts. Behind many successful male executives is a savvy, involved partner. And often by the CEO’s side was President Obama, who seems to have spent many days of his presidency grinning next to titans of industry. I have photographic evidence. Lastly, if you’re considering becoming a CEO, I can tell you that it’s doable. Just wake up extremely early—they all do—and put yourself in proximity to talented co-workers for 30 years, by which point your friends will be running corporations and boards. One day, the phone will ring: Want to come run this mess of a company? Welcome to the C-suite.   Nurturing entrepreneurship “Getting punched in the face is great practice for being an entrepreneur.” —Joe Fernandez, co-founder and CEO, Klout “The thing that makes you a good entrepreneur is a real love of making things happen. Start building something with whatever you’ve got from wherever you are.” —Caterina Fake, founder and CEO, Findery, and chairman of the board, Etsy Inc. “When you do something new, it takes at least two years for anyone to understand it.”  —Tina Brown, founder and CEO, Tina Brown LiveMedia “Finish the things you start—if you try it, you’ll find that it’s hard to do.” —Joe Echevarria “Everyone yearns for the same thing: social intimacy and connection. To connect, to belong, love and be loved. For me, it’s been all about understanding that that’s the driving force.” —Jim McCann “Find your co-conspirators, the folks who share a passion with you.” —Scott Heiferman From left: Jonathan Mildenhall, Caroline Hirsch and friend, and Freda Lewis-Hall. Source: Subject (3)  Capturing those “aha!” moments “Just because you can imagine a better mousetrap doesn’t mean you can build one.” —Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO, SanDisk Corp. “Even if it’s a good idea in the abstract, it might not be what you’re born to do.” —Glenn Kelman “If you have an idea and everybody thinks it’s great, it’s probably passé.” —Roy Price, head of Amazon Studios “When I think, ‘Huh, why didn’t I think of that?’ that’s a good indication that a pitch is worth pursuing.” —Nancy Kanter, general manager and EVP for original programming, Disney Junior Worldwide Golden Rule No. 3: Shh! “Listen. It’s something that leaders are often terrible at.” —Strauss Zelnick, founder and partner, ZelnickMedia Corp. “If you listen carefully, you’ll hear the answers.” —Arnold Donald, president and CEO, Carnival Corp. “Always be in learning-and-listening mode, whether it’s a tour guide or a person helping you with your computer.” —Sue Desmond-Hellmann, CEO, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation “Listen at all levels.

Staff and clients are often teaching things.” —Linda Heasley, president and CEO, Lane Bryant “Listen more than you talk.” —Carter Roberts, president and CEO, World Wildlife Fund “Shut up and listen. You can’t learn if you’re talking.” —Robert Gallucci, president, MacArthur Foundation “Sometimes the best way to lead is to listen.” —Eileen Fisher, founder and chief creative officer, Eileen Fisher Inc.  Practicing good office politics “People do not change when they see the light. They change when they feel the heat. My husband said that years ago, and he was so right.” —Freda Lewis-Hall “There’s no such thing as stress. It’s that you’re not having fun.” —Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO, WPP Plc “Longer meetings have diminishing returns.” —Jeff Clarke, CEO, Eastman Kodak Co. “Be open about mistakes. I often ask people what I did wrong in the last meeting, because then others feel they have permission to own their mistakes, too.” —Marne Levine “Be on time. I hate it when people are late.” —Caroline Hirsch, owner, Carolines on Broadway “You’ll be successful if you stop pretending to know it all and start learning from the brilliant people that you’re working with. Stop trying to do the job and learn how to do the job.” —Jonathan Mildenhall   Powering through “Momentum is a motherf---er.* Keep moving.” —Shane Smith, co-founder and CEO, Vice Media LLC *The only time a subject uttered an F-bomb in offering career advice “Patience is an overrated virtue.” —Jeff Clarke “Do everything fast.” —Meredith Whitney “I’d rather make a quick decision that can be fixed than be slow and miss an opportunity.” —Ron Perelman, chairman and CEO, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc.  From left: Meredith Whitney, Ron Perelman, and Shane Smith.

That’s rarely the case, though—in most companies, one needs to have Plan B and Plan C in the event that things take longer, as they typically do. Airbnb couldn’t raise funding, so they sold actual cereal boxes—Obama Os and Captain McCain’s.” —Kevin Hartz “Be totally results-oriented. Don’t get distracted by other people’s problems. People are going to say all kinds of things about you and have all kinds of opinions, so you listen, but you stay focused.” —Arnold Donald, president and CEO, Carnival Corp. “A company is built on people first, guests second, and financials third.” —Peggy Cherng, co-chair and co-CEO, Panda Restaurant Group “Stick to what you do. Starting that restaurant or music label or clothing company on the side almost never works out. I always tell the fighters that.” —Lorenzo Fertitta, chairman and CEO, Ultimate Fighting Championship “When you run a smaller organization, you need to know everyone and everything. Larger is easier.” —Darren Huston, president and CEO, Priceline Group “Growth isn’t about pressing the accelerator; it’s about moving in specific directions.” —Ron Shaich, chairman and CEO, Panera Bread Co. Steering the ship “People overestimate what you can do in a year and underestimate what you can do in 10—Bill Gates said that.” —Brian Goldner, president and CEO, Hasbro Inc. “Leadership is a privilege. I have that taped to my computer.” —Julie Gerberding “Lead from the front, but be in the mosh pit, not on the stage.” —Blake Irving, CEO, GoDaddy Inc. “When you’re working for an institution as visible as the Met, you get criticism from all sides—some people think we’re too conservative, some people think we’re too progressive. But as my father once told me when he was managing editor of the New York Times, the fact that you get criticized from all different sides usually is an indication that you’re doing something right.” —Peter Gelb, general manager, Metropolitan Opera Association Inc. “In 2009, which was the recession and one of our worst years, we thought we were going to have to ground airplanes. We got through that year and eked out a small profit, and I thought that was a major victory. I’ve always heard that leaders do their best work in the worst times, and it’s true.” —Gary Kelly, chairman, president, and CEO, Southwest Airlines Co. “Leadership isn’t about forcing people to follow you, it’s about inspiring them to want to.” —Joe Echevarria Knowing when to say goodbye “Leave the party before the lights come on. Everything has an expiration date, including organizations and people.” —Michael Houston, CEO, Grey North America “The hat doesn’t always fit, and you have to recognize it and move on. In 1996, I pushed hard for the job of head of women’s design at Aquascutum London. I wanted to reinvent a great British brand. But they weren’t ready for a Burberry, so I went to Burberry.” —Deborah Lloyd Clockwise from left: Peggy Cherng, Kevin Hartz, Arnold Donald, and Lorenzo Fertitta.

You do have control over how it affects you.” —Lisa Price, founder and CEO, Carol’s Daughter “Don’t get hung up on ‘should’ve.’ Yesterday’s never going to come around again, so get on with it.” —Gert Boyle Boiling It Down By Gregory Gundersen We ran all of the life lessons through something called a “bigram model,” which uses probability to string words together. If you’re ever at a loss for what to tell someone you mentor, feel free to borrow this language: “Believe in your life.” “I’ll take advantage of a bad enough, you do.” “Make it is, let them back.” “Seek people smarter than talent.” “Create a bad taste good.” “If it’s all about failing, you want to.” “Money teaches young designers think about yourself.” “Try to have to do something you do.” “You’ll be known for it. Make yourself indispensable.” “Story, story, story.” “Drink black coffee. My father, Arthur Gelb, was fond of a bad luck.” “Live your next boss.” “As a good thermostat.” “Longer meetings have an old video game screen.” “Being bilingual helps people, they’ll trust yourself where the right thing.” “Fight the most influential people.” “Develop the best work, and work harder.” “Find a business model is what I can always control.” “Nonprofits have done amazing things.” “Get the right instinct.” “Lifestyle is a job title.” “Show your own money.” “Paper Mate makes the best crossword pencil.” “Patience is a bad taste good.” “Passion is never done; continuous evolution is a bad thing. You can always neutral.” “Truly believe it’s probably passé.” “Meaningful work, family for a job title.” “Take the right answer.” “Always think fast.” “Never give up.” “Whatever you’re not having fun.” Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

This puts it below the radar for most fund managers, but makes it potentially attractive for active small-cap investors. The company in question is Sopheon (LSE: SPE), which provides software to help companies manage innovation and product development. The firm's client list includes blue-chip names such as PepsiCo, Proctor & Gamble and pharmaceutical giant Merck. So it seems to be a fairly credible business. Sopheon's revenue rose by 11% to $23.2m in 2016, while pre-tax profit rose by 125% to $2.7m. This dramatic increase was mostly down to a reduction in research, development and administrative costs, which fell from $7.1m in 2015 to $6.4m in 2016. The company issued an upbeat AGM statement today. So far this year, 20 licence orders have been received, up from 14 at the same point last year. Revenue visibility for the full year is currently $17.5m, up from "just under $17m" last year. These figures suggest to me that the strong momentum seen last year is continuing, although revenue per licence may still be falling -- a trend the company reported in 2016. Sopheon ended last year with net cash of $4.2m, so debt doesn't seem to be a problem. However, one risk facing shareholders is the prospect of serious dilution if £2m of convertible loans (due in 2019) are turned into shares. Doing so would increase the share count by 2.6m, or about 35%, effectively reducing earnings per share by about 26%. For this reason, I'd argue that with a forecast P/E of 15 for 2017, Sopheon is fairly valued at present. I'd hold at current levels. Will this disrupter make it big? Shares of online estate agent Purplebricks Group (LSE: PURP) are worth 255% more than they were one year ago. Annual sales have risen from £3.39m in 2015 to a forecast level of £43m for the year ended 30 April 2017. Encouragingly, the group's UK business is expected to report a full-year adjusted EBITDA profit this year. The firm's strong growth is expected to continue, but it's worth noting that Purplebricks shares now trade on a price-to-sales ratio of 40. That's astonishingly high, especially for a lossmaking business. Investors are clearly pricing-in a dramatic increase in sales and profits in the future. One of the main reasons for this is the recently announced plan to expand into the US market. If successful, this could open the door to a market many times bigger than the UK. However, gaining market share in the US -- in the face of growing competition -- is unlikely to be easy. Even if Purplebricks is eventually successful, I wouldn't be surprised to see the group's share price take a sharp step backwards at some point. In my view, the valuation could take a sharp knock if market sentiment changes or if overseas growth is slower than expected. For what it's worth, I think it's a good business that could be worth more at some point in the future. But I suspect shareholders will have a rocky ride. I believe a very long-term view will be needed to have any chance of making a profit from current levels. This could be today's top small-cap buy Sopheon and Purplebricks may deliver further gains for investors.

Deficient) Solid Tumors More Likely to Respond to Immunotherapy Results Published in Science Demonstrate Molecular Profile of Tumor Cells Rather than Tumor Origin Can Drive Therapeutic Strategy News provided by Caris Life Sciences 08 Jun, 2017, 15:46 ET Share this article IRVING, Texas, June 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Caris Life Sciences®, a leading innovator in molecular science focused on fulfilling the promise of precision medicine, today highlighted an article published in Science containing data on microsatellite instability (MSI) status and mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient tumors on a wide range of tumor types using Caris Molecular Intelligence®, the company's comprehensive genomic profiling plus (CGP+) molecular testing service. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the efficacy of the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab in patients with MSI-High or MMR-deficient cancers regardless of tumor origin, an indication recently added to the drug's label by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The study, entitled "Mismatch repair deficiency predicts response of solid tumors to PD-1 blockade," was published on June 8, 2017 in Science First Release online (doi:10.1126/science.aan6733).  The thesis underlying immunotherapy for cancer is that the immune system maintains the capacity to initiate an immune response against tumor cells if the immune system is appropriately activated to attack them. This approach has been successfully demonstrated with therapeutics that block PD-L1 (ex: pembrolizumab and nivolumab), a PD-1 receptor ligand found on the surface of tumor cells which, when overexpressed, down-regulates or suppresses the immune system's response. Blocking the receptor enables the immune system to recognize tumor cells and kill them. Tumor cells emerge from genetic mutations and thus they manufacture proteins that can be recognized as neoantigens (antigens not found on normal cells) that can activate the immune system. Tumors with MSI-H or MMR deficient cancers produce a very large number of mutations, and thus neoantigens, and would be good therapeutic targets for checkpoint inhibitors. "In the past, anti-neoplastic agents were developed based on the site of origin, such as breast, prostate or lung," said David Spetzler, M.S., Ph.D., M.B.A., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Caris Life Sciences and co-author on the paper. "With our increased knowledge, both of the genetic alterations that drive and sustain tumorigenesis, as well as the down-regulation of the immune system that enables tumors to escape an immune response, we are better positioned than ever to attack cancers based on their molecular profiles and to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to each patient, regardless of tumor origin. The results of this clinical trial demonstrate that this is truly the case. This now opens a new approach to therapy that is exemplified by the recent FDA approval of pembrolizumab for MSI-High or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors – the first cancer therapy approved for use based on a biomarker, regardless of tumor type, and the same population evaluated in this study." The clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of pembrolizumab in advanced MSI-High or MMR-deficient patients. Eighty-six patients, with 12 different tumor types were enrolled. The objective response rate was 53% and the complete response rate was 21%, demonstrating durable responses with pembrolizumab regardless of tumor origin. The investigators concluded that patients with a large number of neoantigens in MMR-deficient cancers made them sensitive to checkpoint inhibition. Researchers also included Caris Molecular Intelligence prevalence data for MSI-High or MMR-deficient tumors. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) across 24 tumor types, Caris Molecular Intelligence identified patients with MSI-High solid tumors by evaluating more than 7,000 microsatellite regions across approximately 2,200 cases. Patients were considered MSI-High if they had at least 43 altered microsatellite regions, which was determined by comparing NGS results to traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The Caris NGS platform performed at 95.8% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. "The results of this study, along with the FDA approval of pembrolizumab for MSI-High or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors, marks a turning point where precision medicine is now becoming standard of care for all solid tumor patients," said John Marshall, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Caris Life Sciences. Dr. Marshall is also the Associate Director for Clinical Care for the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Chief of the Division of Hematology-Oncology at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C. "The Caris CGP+ tumor profiling platform enables more patients to get MSI results because it does not require normal tissue like the PCR assay, therefore making it optimally positioned to assist clinicians in accurately identifying MSI-High patients so that they receive appropriate therapy. In addition, CGP+ assists innovative biopharmaceutical companies and other healthcare organizations develop the next personalized cancer treatments." The study was a multi-institution clinical trial conducted by academic, medical, government and commercial organizations including Johns Hopkins, Stanford University, Providence Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh, National Cancer Institute, Ohio State University, West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Merck & Company, with funding in part by The Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Is NewLink Genetics Losing One-Third of Its Value Today? Roche Holdings will no longer collaborate with NewLink Genetics on GDC-0919. Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Jun 8, 2017 at 2:28PM What happened After a surprising decision by Roche Holding (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) to exit its co-development deal on a new cancer drug, NewLink Genetics Corporation (NASDAQ:NLNK) shares were crashing 32% as of 1 p.m. EDT. So what Hope that success for NewLink Genetics' IDO-inhibiting cancer drugs could get its share price back on track, following a disappointing trial failure last year, were dashed today when Roche announced it was returning rights to co-develop GDC-0919. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The news is a bit surprising given that Roche just presented data from a trial of GDC-0919 at the high-profile American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting this week. However, it becomes a little less surprising when we dig into the data and discover that the benefit of adding GDC-0919 to Roche's PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor Tecentriq didn't move the needle much. The combination did improve response rates, but the improvement appears too slight for Roche to justify committing any more research to it. Specifically, the overall response rate in patients diagnosed with various solid tumor cancers was only 9%, and all responses were partial responses. Further sealing GDC-0919's fate was that the response rate appears to trail that of Incyte's (NASDAQ:INCY) epacadostat, a drug that has the same IDO-inhibiting target as GDC-0919. At ASCO, Incyte reported that teaming epacadostat up with Merck & Co.'s (NYSE:MRK) PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda delivered overall response rates of 30% to 35% in various cancers, including kidney cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Now what Roche's decision caps off a week of disappointing news at NewLink Genetics. On Jun. 2, it reported that another of its IDO-inhibitors, indoximod, failed a mid-stage breast cancer trial, casting doubt on its use in indications outside of melanoma, where results have been solid. In April, management said that combining indoximod with Keytruda resulted in an objective response rate of 52%, and a disease control rate of 73%. Those are good numbers, but they don't appear to be much different from epacadostat, which delivered a 58% overall response rate in advanced melanoma patients when used alongside Keytruda, and a 74% disease-control rate. Overall, IDO-inhibitors appear to work, but their efficacy might not be as strong across all cancers as hoped; undeniably, that puts peak sales forecasts for this class of drugs at risk. Only time will tell what NewLink Genetics does now that it has 100% rights to both indoximod and GDC-0919, but it may be a bit premature to assume that the company's IDO-inhibitors won't eventually make it to market.

The rights were part of a license agreement from October 2014. NewLink said the research collaboration with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group for the discovery of IDO/TDO inhibitors will continue. "We are obviously disappointed in this decision," said NewLink Chief Executive Charles Link. "We remain committed to advancing our IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod, which continues to generate exciting data in combination with anti-PD-1 agents, cancer vaccines, and chemotherapy in multiple cancer types including melanoma, prostate cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and pancreatic cancer." NewLink shares had tumbled in April after disappointing results of a trial in which indoximod was being tested in combination with Merck & Co.'s Keytruda. The stock traded at $7.38 ahead of the open, the lowest price seen during regular trading hours since February 2012. The stock has plummeted 47% over the past three months, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF has slipped 1.6% and the S&P 500 has gained 8.7%.

The company's indoximod was being tested in combination with Merck's Keytruda. NewLink Genetics said that data on 60 patients found an objective response rate of 52% and a disease control rate of 73%, with rates slightly higher among patients with non-ocular melanoma, at a 59% objective response rate and an 80% disease control rate. Though the company described the results -- which it is presenting at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting on Tuesday -- as impressive and emphasized that the cancer drug combination was well tolerated overall, investors questioned how much of an effect the company's drug had relative to Merck's Keytruda alone and compared NewLink Genetics negatively to Incyte Corp. , which is also developing an IDO inhibitor and is working with Merck. NewLink Genetics shares were valued at $18.40 as of Tuesday morning. The company's shares have surged 63.8% over the last three months, compared with a 3.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

Against this backdrop, the Dow industrials and S&P 500 have thus far maintained near-term support — circa Dow 20,850, and S&P 2,367 — though a slow-motion retest remains underway.

(AAPL) Stock Becoming the BlackBerry of China? Red-Hot Veeva Systems Inc (VEEV) Stock Could Double in 2017 View All Posts Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) is one of 2017’s standout stocks, even if the company itself doesn’t exactly … well, stand out. VEEV stock is up 60% year-to-date, performing better than well-known tech plays such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL,NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB). Source: Shutterstock But Veeva itself isn’t very well-known, not even comparatively speaking within its own industry: cloud software. Instead, operators like Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) get much of the buzz and attention. So, what is Veeva Systems? And more importantly to investors, can the momentum in VEEV stock continue? To answer these questions, let’s start with a little background. The Start of Veeva Systems It was 2007, and the cloud industry was still in the early stages. Peter Gassner — a former alum of Salesforce, PeopleSoft and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) — saw an enormous opportunity to target the life sciences industry, which was saddled with legacy technologies such as client-server systems and on-promise software. Gassner knew that the cloud was the silver bullet. He saw the powers of this technology while he worked for Salesforce. But his strategy also went against the conventions of Silicon Valley. He raised only a modest amount of venture capital and focused on getting to profitability early on. What’s more, Gassner did not reinvent the wheel — he struck a deal with Salesforce to capitalize the platform to build the core technology for VEEV. This had several key advantages, including lower costs, quicker time-to-market and credibility with customers. And by focusing on one industry, Veeva benefited from becoming a strategic partner to customers. The company was turning into a valuable a source of domain expertise and had a great sense of understanding the pain points. All this helps to explain why VEEV has had plenty of traction with customer adoption. VEEV Stock Going Forward Over the years, Veeva Systems has added offerings like helping to sell and market quicker, streamlining the onerous clinical regulatory process, understanding data and improving content management. That has led to a client roster that includes pharma giants like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). Some investors are concerned that Veeva is too reliant on healthcare — whether there are enough companies to sell to, and how much competition could cramp the space?/ They’re legitimate questions, but not pressing concerns. The lifesciences market spends a staggering $55 billion on IT spending every year. To put things into perspective, Veeva’s full-year forecast calls for revenues to range from $665 million and $669 million, with non-GAAP operating income between $191 and $195 million. So yes, there’s plenty of runway in the existing market.

The primary objective of this study was to estimate the efficacy of the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab in patients with MSI-High or MMR-deficient cancers regardless of tumor origin, an indication recently added to the drug's label by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The study, entitled "Mismatch repair deficiency predicts response of solid tumors to PD-1 blockade," was published on June 8, 2017 in Science First Release online (doi:10.1126/science.aan6733).  The thesis underlying immunotherapy for cancer is that the immune system maintains the capacity to initiate an immune response against tumor cells if the immune system is appropriately activated to attack them. This approach has been successfully demonstrated with therapeutics that block PD-L1 (ex: pembrolizumab and nivolumab), a PD-1 receptor ligand found on the surface of tumor cells which, when overexpressed, down-regulates or suppresses the immune system's response. Blocking the receptor enables the immune system to recognize tumor cells and kill them. Tumor cells emerge from genetic mutations and thus they manufacture proteins that can be recognized as neoantigens (antigens not found on normal cells) that can activate the immune system. Tumors with MSI-H or MMR deficient cancers produce a very large number of mutations, and thus neoantigens, and would be good therapeutic targets for checkpoint inhibitors. "In the past, anti-neoplastic agents were developed based on the site of origin, such as breast, prostate or lung," said David Spetzler, M.S., Ph.D., M.B.A., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Caris Life Sciences and co-author on the paper. "With our increased knowledge, both of the genetic alterations that drive and sustain tumorigenesis, as well as the down-regulation of the immune system that enables tumors to escape an immune response, we are better positioned than ever to attack cancers based on their molecular profiles and to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to each patient, regardless of tumor origin. The results of this clinical trial demonstrate that this is truly the case. This now opens a new approach to therapy that is exemplified by the recent FDA approval of pembrolizumab for MSI-High or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors – the first cancer therapy approved for use based on a biomarker, regardless of tumor type, and the same population evaluated in this study." The clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of pembrolizumab in advanced MSI-High or MMR-deficient patients. Eighty-six patients, with 12 different tumor types were enrolled. The objective response rate was 53% and the complete response rate was 21%, demonstrating durable responses with pembrolizumab regardless of tumor origin. The investigators concluded that patients with a large number of neoantigens in MMR-deficient cancers made them sensitive to checkpoint inhibition. Researchers also included Caris Molecular Intelligence prevalence data for MSI-High or MMR-deficient tumors. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) across 24 tumor types, Caris Molecular Intelligence identified patients with MSI-High solid tumors by evaluating more than 7,000 microsatellite regions across approximately 2,200 cases. Patients were considered MSI-High if they had at least 43 altered microsatellite regions, which was determined by comparing NGS results to traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The Caris NGS platform performed at 95.8% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. "The results of this study, along with the FDA approval of pembrolizumab for MSI-High or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors, marks a turning point where precision medicine is now becoming standard of care for all solid tumor patients," said John Marshall, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Caris Life Sciences. Dr. Marshall is also the Associate Director for Clinical Care for the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Chief of the Division of Hematology-Oncology at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C. "The Caris CGP+ tumor profiling platform enables more patients to get MSI results because it does not require normal tissue like the PCR assay, therefore making it optimally positioned to assist clinicians in accurately identifying MSI-High patients so that they receive appropriate therapy. In addition, CGP+ assists innovative biopharmaceutical companies and other healthcare organizations develop the next personalized cancer treatments." The study was a multi-institution clinical trial conducted by academic, medical, government and commercial organizations including Johns Hopkins, Stanford University, Providence Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh, National Cancer Institute, Ohio State University, West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Merck & Company, with funding in part by The Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research.

The primary objective of this study was to estimate the efficacy of the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab in patients with MSI-High or MMR-deficient cancers regardless of tumor origin, an indication recently added to the drug's label by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The study, entitled "Mismatch repair deficiency predicts response of solid tumors to PD-1 blockade," was published on June 8, 2017 in Science First Release online (doi:10.1126/science.aan6733).  The thesis underlying immunotherapy for cancer is that the immune system maintains the capacity to initiate an immune response against tumor cells if the immune system is appropriately activated to attack them. This approach has been successfully demonstrated with therapeutics that block PD-L1 (ex: pembrolizumab and nivolumab), a PD-1 receptor ligand found on the surface of tumor cells which, when overexpressed, down-regulates or suppresses the immune system's response. Blocking the receptor enables the immune system to recognize tumor cells and kill them. Tumor cells emerge from genetic mutations and thus they manufacture proteins that can be recognized as neoantigens (antigens not found on normal cells) that can activate the immune system. Tumors with MSI-H or MMR deficient cancers produce a very large number of mutations, and thus neoantigens, and would be good therapeutic targets for checkpoint inhibitors. "In the past, anti-neoplastic agents were developed based on the site of origin, such as breast, prostate or lung," said David Spetzler, M.S., Ph.D., M.B.A., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Caris Life Sciences and co-author on the paper. "With our increased knowledge, both of the genetic alterations that drive and sustain tumorigenesis, as well as the down-regulation of the immune system that enables tumors to escape an immune response, we are better positioned than ever to attack cancers based on their molecular profiles and to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to each patient, regardless of tumor origin. The results of this clinical trial demonstrate that this is truly the case. This now opens a new approach to therapy that is exemplified by the recent FDA approval of pembrolizumab for MSI-High or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors – the first cancer therapy approved for use based on a biomarker, regardless of tumor type, and the same population evaluated in this study." The clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of pembrolizumab in advanced MSI-High or MMR-deficient patients. Eighty-six patients, with 12 different tumor types were enrolled. The objective response rate was 53% and the complete response rate was 21%, demonstrating durable responses with pembrolizumab regardless of tumor origin. The investigators concluded that patients with a large number of neoantigens in MMR-deficient cancers made them sensitive to checkpoint inhibition. Researchers also included Caris Molecular Intelligence prevalence data for MSI-High or MMR-deficient tumors. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) across 24 tumor types, Caris Molecular Intelligence identified patients with MSI-High solid tumors by evaluating more than 7,000 microsatellite regions across approximately 2,200 cases. Patients were considered MSI-High if they had at least 43 altered microsatellite regions, which was determined by comparing NGS results to traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The Caris NGS platform performed at 95.8% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. "The results of this study, along with the FDA approval of pembrolizumab for MSI-High or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors, marks a turning point where precision medicine is now becoming standard of care for all solid tumor patients," said John Marshall, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Caris Life Sciences. Dr. Marshall is also the Associate Director for Clinical Care for the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Chief of the Division of Hematology-Oncology at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C. "The Caris CGP+ tumor profiling platform enables more patients to get MSI results because it does not require normal tissue like the PCR assay, therefore making it optimally positioned to assist clinicians in accurately identifying MSI-High patients so that they receive appropriate therapy. In addition, CGP+ assists innovative biopharmaceutical companies and other healthcare organizations develop the next personalized cancer treatments." The study was a multi-institution clinical trial conducted by academic, medical, government and commercial organizations including Johns Hopkins, Stanford University, Providence Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh, National Cancer Institute, Ohio State University, West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Merck & Company, with funding in part by The Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research.

Adapted Media Release Eczema / Psoriasis Dermatology Clinical Trials / Drug Trials Promising new treatment option for chronic plaque psoriasis Published: Thursday 8 June 2017 Published: Thu 8 Jun 2017 email 5 Affecting more than 6 million Americans, chronic plaque psoriasis manifests as patches of red, scaly skin most frequently on the scalp, elbows and knees. Chronic plaque psoriasis most often appears in adolescence or mid-life and can require lifelong medication. Until the 1990s, physicians had few options to offer their patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Up to a quarter of patients with psoriasis suffer from these more aggressive cases that can affect anywhere from 10 to a 100 percent of the surface of the skin. Now, two Phase 3 trials have demonstrated that a biologic agent called tildrakizumab is efficacious and well-tolerated in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The findings appear in the journal The Lancet and represent a major step forward in the treatment of the skin disorder. "We have made a huge amount of progress in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis over the past 15 years," said the paper's lead author, Alexa B. Kimball, MD, President and CEO of Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians (HMFP) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and a Professor of Dermatology at Harvard Medical School. "In these two trials, we tested whether this new, very targeted approach to a selected part of the inflammatory pathway would be effective in treating psoriasis, and it was - dramatically so." An antibody that targets only a very specific pathway, tildrakizumab belongs to a class of treatments called biologic agents, or biologics for short. Different from traditional pharmaceutical drugs, biologics are based on molecules that the body makes naturally - like antibodies - repurposed to treat disease. The parallel double-blind randomized controlled studies, known as reSURFACE 1 and 2, tested an antibody called tildrakizumab for its ability to clear up and control psoriasis in patients with moderate to severe disease. Together, more than 1,800 patients were enrolled in trials conducted at 250 sites in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Patients were randomized to one of three groups; one group received 200 mg tildrakizumab, one received 100 mg and one received an inactive placebo. On average, patients started the study with 30 percent of their body covered with psoriasis; 12 weeks later, 65 percent emerged with skin that was clear or almost clear - a 75 percent improvement as measured by the standard Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI). Fewer than 10 percent of those given a placebo achieved this level of improvement. "The breakthrough here is that we have continued to refine our treatments to those that are likely to be most effective against psoriasis but less likely to affect other important pathways at the same time," Kimball said. "The study also suggests that the 12-week end point may be too early to see optimal efficacy. Patients may continue to improve and that's going to be important to show over time." Within the last 15 years, researchers identified the components of the immune system that are complicit in psoriasis, molecules called interleukins, known to play a role in inflammation and allergy. Armed with that new knowledge, scientists harnessed the molecules that the body naturally produces - such as antibodies - to inhibit interleukins and manage psoriasis. The first generation of biologics to hit the market about 15 years ago led to improved clinical outcomes in the treatment of psoriasis. But, because the interleukins in question are involved in so many biological processes, inhibiting them to manage psoriasis can cause serious side effects in some patients, including infections or other unusual immune system dysfunctions. Through a combination of basic research, clinical observation and epidemiology, Kimball and colleagues identified another interleukin more specifically relevant to psoriasis. Targeting the more relevant interleukin may lead to fewer unwanted side effects. Their findings that tildrakizumab can successfully treat psoriasis by inhibiting this recently discovered interleukin represents a major step forward in the treatment of this potentially debilitating condition. This study was funded by Merck & Co., Inc. The study funder had roles in study design, data analysis and data interpretation. Safety data were reviewed at regular intervals by an independent data monitoring committee. All authors had full access to the study data.

Business Vaccine may cut HPV infections, an oral cancer risk, in men MARILYNN MARCHIONEAssociated Press The HPV vaccine that helps prevent cervical cancer in women also might lower the risk in young men of oral infections that can cause mouth and throat cancers, a new study finds. These cancers are rising fast, especially in men, and research suggests that HPV, the human papillomavirus, is spreading through oral sex. The actor Michael Douglas brought attention to this risk several years ago when he blamed his cancer on it. This is the first study of whether the vaccine might prevent oral HPV infections in young men, and the results suggest it can. No men who had received at least one dose were later found to have infections of HPV strains linked to cancer, but more than 2 percent of unvaccinated men had them. "There may be additional benefits to vaccinating your son or daughter" besides the problems the vaccine already is known to prevent, said Dr. Maura Gillison of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Results were released Wednesday by the American Society of Clinical Oncology ahead of presentation at its annual meeting next month. THE VIRUS HPV is very common — most sexually active people have been exposed to it. Some types cause genital warts. Usually, the virus causes no symptoms and goes away, but some people develop long-lasting infections of strains that can cause cancer. The vaccine was approved in 2006 to prevent cervical cancers in women, and later, for some others including anal cancer in men. But acceptance has been slow — only about half of those eligible are getting it now, according to the latest information. Now, awareness is growing of HPV's other risks — oral infections are blamed for 70 percent of cancers in the mouth and back of the throat. About 11,600 of these occur each year in the U.S. and rates are rising 5 percent per year. They're four times more common in men than women. There are now more mouth and throat cancers caused by HPV in the U.S. each year than there are cervical cancers. Oral sex is the main risk factor for getting an HPV infection in the mouth or throat, Gillison said. While "oral sex does not give you cancer," the infection in rare cases can develop into cancer over many years, she explained. THE STUDY She led the study, funded by the National Cancer Institute , while previously at Ohio State University. Researchers interviewed 2,627 men and women ages 18 to 33 years in a national health study from 2011 to 2014 about whether they had been vaccinated, and tested oral rinse samples from them for HPV. Infections with worrisome HPV strains were found in far fewer people who had received any shots — an 88 percent lower risk. The results in men were striking — no infections in the vaccinated group versus 2.13 percent of the others. The study was observational, so it can't prove the vaccine was responsible. But it may no longer be ethical to do an experiment where one group gets no vaccine, because its benefits for preventing other cancers is known. It might be possible to do such a study in people over 26, the age limit now for HPV vaccination, Gillison said. If a benefit were shown, it might lead to expanding the group for whom the vaccine is recommended. The bottom line is that the vaccine helps, and "so few people who should be getting it are," said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the oncology society who had no role in the study. WHAT PATIENTS SAY Scott Courville wishes it existed when he was young. The 43-year-old construction inspector from St. Martinville, Louisiana, was treated last year for HPV-related tonsil cancer that spread to lymph nodes. "I went through 33 rounds of radiation and six rounds of chemotherapy," lost 100 pounds, and now has damaged taste buds and sinuses, and constant ringing in his ears, he said. His three teenaged sons and stepsons are getting the vaccine. "There was no question at all" that they would, only how soon, he said. Tom Jackson also had an HPV-related tonsil cancer, found in 2013, and works to fight stigma over an infection that is largely sexually spread. As a school board trustee in Houston, "I believe strongly that all children should receive all vaccinations," Jackson said. "The horror of HPV cancer is tremendous," and not to be "whitewashed" by squeamishness or reluctance to discuss prevention, he said. THE VACCINES The vaccines are recommended mostly for young people, ideally before they're exposed to HPV. Merck's Gardasil is approved in the U.S. for females 9 through 26 to prevent cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers and genital warts. For males ages 9 through 26, it's approved for preventing anal cancer and genital warts. A newer version of Gardasil that includes more HPV virus types is approved for males 9 through 15. GlaxoSmithKline's Cervarix vaccine is approved for females 9 through 25 to prevent cervical cancer. All require two or three shots, depending on age. Other ways to help prevent oral HPV infections are limiting the number of sex partners and not smoking. Condoms or dental dams may help. Signs and symptoms of mouth and throat cancers may include a long-lasting sore throat, earaches, hoarseness, enlarged lymph nodes and pain when swallowing. ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter: @MMarchioneAP Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
