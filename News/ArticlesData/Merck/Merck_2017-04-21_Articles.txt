BERN & PARTNERS LLP FILES LAWSUITS FOR A HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS AGAINST MERCK ALLEGING SHINGLES/ZOSTAVAX VACCINE IS DEFECTIVE* NEW YORK, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES , April 21, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — MARC J. BERN & PARTNERS LLP FILES LAWSUITS FOR A HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS AGAINST MERCK ALLEGING SHINGLES/ZOSTAVAX VACCINE IS DEFECTIVE* MARC J. BERN & PARTNERS LLP, the attorneys who last month filed their first complaint in Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas on behalf of Jorja Bently, today have filed complaints for another 100 plaintiffs against Merck regarding its Shingles vaccine, Zostavax. The assertions are wide ranging and include plaintiffs claiming to have suffered various side effects which include contracting shingles, chickenpox, high blood pressure, intense neuropathic pain, eye injuries, headaches, dizziness amongst others. It is alleged by Marc J. Bern & Partners LLP that “Merck knew and had reason to know that its Zostavax vaccine was inherently defective and unreasonably dangerous as designed” that “Merck downplayed the serious and dangerous side effects of its product to encourage sales of the product; consequently, Merck placed its profits above its customers’ safety.” According to founding Partner Marc J Bern, the firm is currently representing nearly 5000 claimants and has thousands more filings to follow. “We have been investigating this drug for quite some time. We steadfastly believe in the merits of this litigation. This vaccination is at best 50 percent effective. Either it is not effective or it causes shingles or a host of other side effects. What is most troubling is that Merck had a better alternative on hand when this product was released.” says Bern.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Real-World Observational Study in the U.S. Veterans Affairs System Evaluating Use of Merck’s ZEPATIER® (Elbasvir and Grazoprevir) Shows High Sustained Virologic Response Rates in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced the presentation of findings from a retrospective database analysis of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who were administered ZEPATIER® in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system. For the evaluable population (n=2,436), 95.6 percent of veterans treated with ZEPATIER achieved the primary outcome of sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA at least twelve weeks after the end of treatment. For patients with no HCV RNA measurements at or after 12 weeks (19% of the study cohort), the analysis used HCV RNA measurements available at least four and less than 12 weeks after the end of treatment. The response rates in the real-world setting of the VA supplement the overall findings from the controlled clinical studies of ZEPATIER. These findings will be presented today in an oral session (abstract #PS-095) at The International Liver Congress™ 2017 being held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. In the United States, ZEPATIER is indicated for the treatment of chronic HCV GT1 or GT4 infection in adults. ZEPATIER is indicated for use with ribavirin (RBV) in certain patient populations. The U.S. Prescribing Information for ZEPATIER includes a Boxed Warning about the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in patients co-infected with HCV and HBV. In controlled clinical studies of ZEPATIER, SVR was the primary endpoint defined as HCV RNA less than lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at 12 weeks after the cessation of treatment (SVR12). “U.S. veterans are three times more likely to have chronic hepatitis C compared to the general U.S. population and a high proportion suffer co-morbid conditions that can make treatment challenging,” said Jennifer Kramer, investigator, Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center, Houston, Texas, and assistant professor of medicine, department of medicine, Baylor College of Medicine. “This study shows that chronic hepatitis C antiviral treatment can result in a high rate of sustained virologic response in U.S. veterans.” This retrospective database analysis included patients with chronic HCV treated with ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir) in the VA healthcare system between February 1, 2016 and August 1, 2016. Study outcomes include real-world utilization and SVR rates. Please see additional information about the design, methodology and limitations of this observational study below. After applying study exclusion criteria, 2,436 patients were included in the evaluable population cohort. The mean age of subjects was 63.5 years. The prevalence of co-morbidities as determined by ICD-9 and CPT codes as recorded in the VA database was as follows: cirrhosis (33.2%), diabetes (53.2%), depression (57.2%) and HIV co-infection (3%). Additionally, more than half of the patients had a history of drug (53.9%) or alcohol (60.5%) abuse. The population included 1,988 previously untreated patients and 448 treatment-experienced patients (322 of whom previously received an interferon-based regimen with or without an NS3/4A HCV protease inhibitor, and 126 of whom previously received an interferon-free direct-acting antiviral regimen). A total of 95.6 percent (2,328/2,436) of patients in the evaluable population achieved SVR following treatment with ZEPATIER. The SVR rates by genotype (GT) were as follows: all GT1, 95.4 percent (2218/2324); GT1a, 93.4 percent (788/844); GT1b, 96.6 percent (1379/1428); and GT4, 96.9 percent (62/64). The SVR rates by baseline viral load (BVL) were as follows: BVL greater than 800,000 IU/ml, 94.7 percent (1497/1580); and BVL less than or equal to 800,000 IU/ml, 97.3 percent (726/746). The SVR rates by baseline patient characteristics were as follows: male, 95.5 percent (2,245/2,350); female, 96.5 percent (83/86); African American, 95.9 percent (1,342/1,400); Hispanic, 95.1 percent (77/81); White, 95.0 percent (783/824); previously untreated, 96.1 percent (1,910/1,988); treatment-experienced, 93.3 percent (418/448); cirrhosis, 95.5 percent (772/808); without cirrhosis, 95.6 percent (1556/1628); stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m2), 96.7 percent (380/393); stage 4-5 CKD (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2), 96.3 percent (392/407); HIV positive, 98.6 percent (73/74); HIV negative, 95.5 percent (2255/2362); history of alcohol abuse, 95.9 percent (1412/1473); no history of alcohol abuse, 95.1 percent (916/963); history of drug abuse, 95.3 percent (1251/1313); no history of drug abuse, 95.9 percent (1077/1123). Adverse event data were not collected as part of this real-world data analysis. “Analysis of data from real-world medical settings can provide useful insights to supplement knowledge gained from randomized clinical trials,” said Susan Shiff, senior vice president, center for observational and real-world evidence, Merck. “These data from a real-world VA setting add to the body of evidence on ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir) and help deepen scientific understanding of the treatment of this complex disease affecting diverse, sometimes difficult to treat, patient populations.” Study Methodology Patients with chronic HCV treated with ZEPATIER from February 1 to August 1, 2016 were identified from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, a national repository of VA electronic medical records. Inclusion criteria specified initiation of ZEPATIER therapy, at least 18 years of age, positive HCV RNA, and at least one inpatient or outpatient visit within a one-year period prior to treatment initiation (n=2,985). Patients were excluded if they had RBV added greater than one month after treatment initiation (n=23). Patients without SVR data or on-treatment HCV RNA data (n=494), or those treated with ZEPATIER for greater than seventeen weeks (n=32), were excluded as well. The total number of patients in the evaluable population was 2,436. SVR was assessed based on undetectable HCV RNA at least twelve weeks after the end of treatment. For patients with no HCV RNA measurements at or after 12 weeks, the analysis used HCV RNA measurements available at least four and less than 12 weeks after the end of treatment. SVR was evaluated based on HCV RNA measurement at least 12 weeks post treatment in 81 percent of the study population. About Real-World Data Analyses and Associated Limitations Real-world studies analyze data generated outside of randomized clinical trials, such as through analyses of electronic medical records or claims databases, to provide insight into how medicines perform or are used from a clinical and economic viewpoint in real-world clinical settings. Information from real-world analyses alone does not provide sufficient evidence to validate efficacy or safety of a therapeutic regimen and does not provide a substitute for evidence obtained from randomized controlled clinical trials. This study is subject to certain limitations. The VA population may not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population, due in part to the potential for a differing demographic make-up and/or risk factors. Bias may exist as diagnoses and co-morbidities were identified through ICD-9 and CPT codes. Treatment completion was identified through prescription records which may not reflect adherence. Database analyses are also prone to errors in coding and missing data, including unavailable SVR data at or after the 12-week post-treatment time point. Additionally, some laboratory data including data on the presence of baseline NS5A resistance associated substitutions was not available at the time of this analysis. About the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) The Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) is supported by one of the largest integrated healthcare information systems in the United States. The VHA’s Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) was developed in 2006 to accommodate the massive amounts of data being generated from more than 20 years of use and to streamline the process of knowledge discovery to application. About ZEPATIER ®(elbasvir and grazoprevir) 50mg/100mg Tablets ZEPATIER is a fixed-dose combination product containing elbasvir, a HCV NS5A inhibitor, and grazoprevir, an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor. In the United States, ZEPATIER is indicated for the treatment of chronic HCV GT1 or 4 infection in adults. ZEPATIER is indicated for use with ribavirin (RBV) in certain patient populations. The efficacy of ZEPATIER has not been established in patients who have previously failed treatment with other regimens that included an NS5A inhibitor. Selected Safety Information about ZEPATIER The US Prescribing Information for ZEPATIER contains a Boxed Warning about the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in patients coinfected with HCV and HBV. Healthcare professionals should test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) before initiating treatment with ZEPATIER. HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Healthcare professionals should monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Healthcare professionals should initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated. HBV reactivation has been reported in HBsAg positive patients and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection (ie, HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive). The risk of HBV reactivation may be increased in patients receiving some immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic agents. HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level. In patients with resolved HBV infection, reappearance of HBsAg can occur. Reactivation of HBV replication may be accompanied by hepatitis, ie, increases in aminotransferase levels and, in severe cases, increases in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur. ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir) is not for use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B or C). ZEPATIER is also not for use with inhibitors of organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1/3 (OATP1B1/3) that are known or expected to significantly increase grazoprevir plasma concentrations (e.g., atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, cyclosporine), strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s Wort), and efavirenz. If ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir) is administered with RBV, healthcare professionals should refer to the prescribing information for RBV as the contraindications, warnings and precautions, adverse reactions and dosing for RBV also apply to this combination regimen. Elevations of alanine transaminase (ALT) to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 1% of subjects, generally at or after treatment week 8. These late ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic and most resolved with ongoing or completion of therapy. Healthcare professionals should perform hepatic lab testing on patients prior to therapy, at treatment week 8, and as clinically indicated. For patients receiving 16 weeks of therapy, additional hepatic lab testing should be performed at treatment week 12. Patients should be instructed to consult their healthcare professional without delay if they have onset of fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice or discolored feces. Healthcare providers should consider discontinuing ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir) if ALT levels remain persistently greater than 10 times ULN. ZEPATIER should be discontinued if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation or increasing conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or international normalized ratio. The concomitant use of ZEPATIER with certain drugs may lead to adverse reactions or reduced therapeutic effect due to drug interactions. Certain strong CYP3A inhibitors may increase the plasma concentration of ZEPATIER, leading to possibly clinically significant adverse reactions. Moderate CYP3A inducers may decrease the plasma concentration of ZEPATIER, leading to reduced therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance. Coadministration of ZEPATIER with these drugs is not recommended. Physicians should consult the Prescribing Information for potential drug interactions. In subjects receiving ZEPATIER for 12 weeks, the most commonly reported adverse reactions of all intensity (greater than or equal to 5% in placebo-controlled trials) were fatigue, headache and nausea. In subjects receiving ZEPATIER with RBV for 16 weeks, the most commonly reported adverse reactions of moderate or severe intensity (greater than or equal to 5%) were anemia and headache. Selected Dosage and Administration Information for ZEPATIER ®(elbasvir and grazoprevir) ZEPATIER is a single tablet taken once daily. The recommended dosing is 12 or 16 weeks with or without RBV, depending on HCV genotype, prior treatment history and, for patients with genotype 1a infection, presence of certain baseline NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms. See Prescribing Information for ZEPATIER for specific dosage regimens and durations. Refer to RBV prescribing information for RBV dosing and dosage modifications when ZEPATIER is given with RBV. To determine dosage regimen and duration of ZEPATIER for genotype 1a patients, testing for the presence of virus with one or more baseline NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms at positions 28, 30, 31, or 93 is recommended prior to initiating treatment.

About Cladribine Tablets   Cladribine Tablets is an investigational short-course oral therapy that is thought to selectively and periodically target lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. In July 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for review the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) of Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.  The clinical development program for Cladribine Tablets includes: About Rebif®   Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide™. Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Real-World Observational Study in the U.S. Veterans Affairs System Evaluating Use of Merck’s ZEPATIER® (Elbasvir and Grazoprevir) Shows High Sustained Virologic Response Rates in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced the presentation of findings from a retrospective database analysis of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who were administered ZEPATIER® in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system. For the evaluable population (n=2,436), 95.6 percent of veterans treated with ZEPATIER achieved the primary outcome of sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA at least twelve weeks after the end of treatment. For patients with no HCV RNA measurements at or after 12 weeks (19% of the study cohort), the analysis used HCV RNA measurements available at least four and less than 12 weeks after the end of treatment. The response rates in the real-world setting of the VA supplement the overall findings from the controlled clinical studies of ZEPATIER. These findings will be presented today in an oral session (abstract #PS-095) at The International Liver Congress™ 2017 being held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. In the United States, ZEPATIER is indicated for the treatment of chronic HCV GT1 or GT4 infection in adults. ZEPATIER is indicated for use with ribavirin (RBV) in certain patient populations. The U.S. Prescribing Information for ZEPATIER includes a Boxed Warning about the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in patients co-infected with HCV and HBV. In controlled clinical studies of ZEPATIER, SVR was the primary endpoint defined as HCV RNA less than lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at 12 weeks after the cessation of treatment (SVR12). “U.S. veterans are three times more likely to have chronic hepatitis C compared to the general U.S. population and a high proportion suffer co-morbid conditions that can make treatment challenging,” said Jennifer Kramer, investigator, Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center, Houston, Texas, and assistant professor of medicine, department of medicine, Baylor College of Medicine. “This study shows that chronic hepatitis C antiviral treatment can result in a high rate of sustained virologic response in U.S. veterans.” This retrospective database analysis included patients with chronic HCV treated with ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir) in the VA healthcare system between February 1, 2016 and August 1, 2016. Study outcomes include real-world utilization and SVR rates. Please see additional information about the design, methodology and limitations of this observational study below. After applying study exclusion criteria, 2,436 patients were included in the evaluable population cohort. The mean age of subjects was 63.5 years. The prevalence of co-morbidities as determined by ICD-9 and CPT codes as recorded in the VA database was as follows: cirrhosis (33.2%), diabetes (53.2%), depression (57.2%) and HIV co-infection (3%). Additionally, more than half of the patients had a history of drug (53.9%) or alcohol (60.5%) abuse. The population included 1,988 previously untreated patients and 448 treatment-experienced patients (322 of whom previously received an interferon-based regimen with or without an NS3/4A HCV protease inhibitor, and 126 of whom previously received an interferon-free direct-acting antiviral regimen). A total of 95.6 percent (2,328/2,436) of patients in the evaluable population achieved SVR following treatment with ZEPATIER. The SVR rates by genotype (GT) were as follows: all GT1, 95.4 percent (2218/2324); GT1a, 93.4 percent (788/844); GT1b, 96.6 percent (1379/1428); and GT4, 96.9 percent (62/64). The SVR rates by baseline viral load (BVL) were as follows: BVL greater than 800,000 IU/ml, 94.7 percent (1497/1580); and BVL less than or equal to 800,000 IU/ml, 97.3 percent (726/746). The SVR rates by baseline patient characteristics were as follows: male, 95.5 percent (2,245/2,350); female, 96.5 percent (83/86); African American, 95.9 percent (1,342/1,400); Hispanic, 95.1 percent (77/81); White, 95.0 percent (783/824); previously untreated, 96.1 percent (1,910/1,988); treatment-experienced, 93.3 percent (418/448); cirrhosis, 95.5 percent (772/808); without cirrhosis, 95.6 percent (1556/1628); stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m2), 96.7 percent (380/393); stage 4-5 CKD (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2), 96.3 percent (392/407); HIV positive, 98.6 percent (73/74); HIV negative, 95.5 percent (2255/2362); history of alcohol abuse, 95.9 percent (1412/1473); no history of alcohol abuse, 95.1 percent (916/963); history of drug abuse, 95.3 percent (1251/1313); no history of drug abuse, 95.9 percent (1077/1123). Adverse event data were not collected as part of this real-world data analysis. “Analysis of data from real-world medical settings can provide useful insights to supplement knowledge gained from randomized clinical trials,” said Susan Shiff, senior vice president, center for observational and real-world evidence, Merck. “These data from a real-world VA setting add to the body of evidence on ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir) and help deepen scientific understanding of the treatment of this complex disease affecting diverse, sometimes difficult to treat, patient populations.” Study Methodology Patients with chronic HCV treated with ZEPATIER from February 1 to August 1, 2016 were identified from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, a national repository of VA electronic medical records. Inclusion criteria specified initiation of ZEPATIER therapy, at least 18 years of age, positive HCV RNA, and at least one inpatient or outpatient visit within a one-year period prior to treatment initiation (n=2,985). Patients were excluded if they had RBV added greater than one month after treatment initiation (n=23). Patients without SVR data or on-treatment HCV RNA data (n=494), or those treated with ZEPATIER for greater than seventeen weeks (n=32), were excluded as well. The total number of patients in the evaluable population was 2,436. SVR was assessed based on undetectable HCV RNA at least twelve weeks after the end of treatment. For patients with no HCV RNA measurements at or after 12 weeks, the analysis used HCV RNA measurements available at least four and less than 12 weeks after the end of treatment. SVR was evaluated based on HCV RNA measurement at least 12 weeks post treatment in 81 percent of the study population. About Real-World Data Analyses and Associated Limitations Real-world studies analyze data generated outside of randomized clinical trials, such as through analyses of electronic medical records or claims databases, to provide insight into how medicines perform or are used from a clinical and economic viewpoint in real-world clinical settings. Information from real-world analyses alone does not provide sufficient evidence to validate efficacy or safety of a therapeutic regimen and does not provide a substitute for evidence obtained from randomized controlled clinical trials. This study is subject to certain limitations. The VA population may not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population, due in part to the potential for a differing demographic make-up and/or risk factors. Bias may exist as diagnoses and co-morbidities were identified through ICD-9 and CPT codes. Treatment completion was identified through prescription records which may not reflect adherence. Database analyses are also prone to errors in coding and missing data, including unavailable SVR data at or after the 12-week post-treatment time point. Additionally, some laboratory data including data on the presence of baseline NS5A resistance associated substitutions was not available at the time of this analysis. About the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) The Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) is supported by one of the largest integrated healthcare information systems in the United States. The VHA’s Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) was developed in 2006 to accommodate the massive amounts of data being generated from more than 20 years of use and to streamline the process of knowledge discovery to application. About ZEPATIER®(elbasvir and grazoprevir) 50mg/100mg Tablets ZEPATIER is a fixed-dose combination product containing elbasvir, a HCV NS5A inhibitor, and grazoprevir, an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor. In the United States, ZEPATIER is indicated for the treatment of chronic HCV GT1 or 4 infection in adults. ZEPATIER is indicated for use with ribavirin (RBV) in certain patient populations. The efficacy of ZEPATIER has not been established in patients who have previously failed treatment with other regimens that included an NS5A inhibitor. Selected Safety Information about ZEPATIER The US Prescribing Information for ZEPATIER contains a Boxed Warning about the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in patients coinfected with HCV and HBV. Healthcare professionals should test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) before initiating treatment with ZEPATIER. HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Healthcare professionals should monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Healthcare professionals should initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated. HBV reactivation has been reported in HBsAg positive patients and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection (ie, HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive). The risk of HBV reactivation may be increased in patients receiving some immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic agents. HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level. In patients with resolved HBV infection, reappearance of HBsAg can occur. Reactivation of HBV replication may be accompanied by hepatitis, ie, increases in aminotransferase levels and, in severe cases, increases in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur. ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir) is not for use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B or C). ZEPATIER is also not for use with inhibitors of organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1/3 (OATP1B1/3) that are known or expected to significantly increase grazoprevir plasma concentrations (e.g., atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, cyclosporine), strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s Wort), and efavirenz. If ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir) is administered with RBV, healthcare professionals should refer to the prescribing information for RBV as the contraindications, warnings and precautions, adverse reactions and dosing for RBV also apply to this combination regimen. Elevations of alanine transaminase (ALT) to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 1% of subjects, generally at or after treatment week 8. These late ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic and most resolved with ongoing or completion of therapy. Healthcare professionals should perform hepatic lab testing on patients prior to therapy, at treatment week 8, and as clinically indicated. For patients receiving 16 weeks of therapy, additional hepatic lab testing should be performed at treatment week 12. Patients should be instructed to consult their healthcare professional without delay if they have onset of fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice or discolored feces. Healthcare providers should consider discontinuing ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir) if ALT levels remain persistently greater than 10 times ULN. ZEPATIER should be discontinued if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation or increasing conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or international normalized ratio. The concomitant use of ZEPATIER with certain drugs may lead to adverse reactions or reduced therapeutic effect due to drug interactions. Certain strong CYP3A inhibitors may increase the plasma concentration of ZEPATIER, leading to possibly clinically significant adverse reactions. Moderate CYP3A inducers may decrease the plasma concentration of ZEPATIER, leading to reduced therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance. Coadministration of ZEPATIER with these drugs is not recommended. Physicians should consult the Prescribing Information for potential drug interactions. In subjects receiving ZEPATIER for 12 weeks, the most commonly reported adverse reactions of all intensity (greater than or equal to 5% in placebo-controlled trials) were fatigue, headache and nausea. In subjects receiving ZEPATIER with RBV for 16 weeks, the most commonly reported adverse reactions of moderate or severe intensity (greater than or equal to 5%) were anemia and headache. Selected Dosage and Administration Information for ZEPATIER®(elbasvir and grazoprevir) ZEPATIER is a single tablet taken once daily. The recommended dosing is 12 or 16 weeks with or without RBV, depending on HCV genotype, prior treatment history and, for patients with genotype 1a infection, presence of certain baseline NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms. See Prescribing Information for ZEPATIER for specific dosage regimens and durations. Refer to RBV prescribing information for RBV dosing and dosage modifications when ZEPATIER is given with RBV. To determine dosage regimen and duration of ZEPATIER for genotype 1a patients, testing for the presence of virus with one or more baseline NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms at positions 28, 30, 31, or 93 is recommended prior to initiating treatment.

 About Cladribine Tablets   Cladribine Tablets is an investigational short-course oral therapy that is thought to selectively and periodically target lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. In July 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for review the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) of Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.  The clinical development program for Cladribine Tablets includes: CLARITY (CLAdRIbine Tablets Treating MS OrallY) study and its extension: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients with RRMS and its two-year extension designed to provide data on the long-term safety and efficacy of extended administration of Cladribine Tablets for up to four years. ORACLE MS (ORAl CLadribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients at risk of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS). ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding Cladribine Tablets treatment to patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough disease while on established interferon-beta therapy. PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cladribine Tablets. The follow-up will consist of over 10,000 patient years of exposure in total, with follow-up in some patients exceeding eight years at completion. About Rebif®  Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide™. Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS.  RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

About Cladribine Tablets   Cladribine Tablets is an investigational short-course oral therapy that is thought to selectively and periodically target lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. In July 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for review the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) of Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.  The clinical development program for Cladribine Tablets includes: CLARITY (CLAdRIbine Tablets Treating MS OrallY) study and its extension: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients with RRMS and its two-year extension designed to provide data on the long-term safety and efficacy of extended administration of Cladribine Tablets for up to four years. ORACLE MS (ORAl CLadribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients at risk of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS). ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding Cladribine Tablets treatment to patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough disease while on established interferon-beta therapy. PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cladribine Tablets. The follow-up will consist of over 10,000 patient years of exposure in total, with follow-up in some patients exceeding eight years at completion. About Rebif®  Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ss is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide™. Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS.  RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

 About Cladribine Tablets   Cladribine Tablets is an investigational short-course oral therapy that is thought to selectively and periodically target lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. In July 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for review the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) of Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.  The clinical development program for Cladribine Tablets includes: CLARITY (CLAdRIbine Tablets Treating MS OrallY) study and its extension: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients with RRMS and its two-year extension designed to provide data on the long-term safety and efficacy of extended administration of Cladribine Tablets for up to four years. ORACLE MS (ORAl CLadribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients at risk of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS). ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding Cladribine Tablets treatment to patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough disease while on established interferon-beta therapy. PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cladribine Tablets. The follow-up will consist of over 10,000 patient years of exposure in total, with follow-up in some patients exceeding eight years at completion. About Rebif®  Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide™. Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS.  RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

Merck 21 Apr, 2017, 14:43 BST Share this article DARMSTADT, Germany, April 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Breadth of data and activities underscore company's long-standing commitment to enhancing care for people with MS  Merck, a leading science and technology company, will present data at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 69th Annual Meeting, taking place from April 22-28, 2017, in Boston, Mass. Merck will present 15 abstracts on multiple sclerosis (MS), including studies evaluating Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) and investigational Cladribine Tablets, as well as analyses of complications and MS relapse rates during pregnancy and real-world data related to the impact of treatment adherence and patient costs.      (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/492737/Merck_Logo.jpg ) "Rebif has a well-established safety profile supported by more than 20 years of accrued clinical trial and patient experience, and the information from the studies and analyses we are presenting at AAN deepens our understanding of this important RRMS therapy," said Dr. Kathleen Hawker, Vice President, Neurology and Immunology US, EMD Serono, the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. The company will also present efficacy and safety data for Cladribine Tablets, an investigational short-course oral therapy that is thought to selectively and periodically target lymphocytes which may be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States, Canada or elsewhere. In July 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for review the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) of Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of adult patients with RRMS. "We have an unwavering focus on delivering innovation to patients in need, and our presentations this week at AAN, a leading neurology conference, further validate the promise of Cladribine Tablets as a potential RRMS treatment option," said Luciano Rossetti, Head of Global R&D for the biopharma business of Merck. Attendees can learn more about our programs, pipeline and activities in neurology by visiting our medical booth #473. Booth activities include a $25,000 charitable donation presentation to Can DO MS on April 25 at 3 p.m., as well as "I'm Facing MS" simulation stations that will translate users' experiences with different MS impairments into artwork. AAN Brain Health Fair  EMD Serono, the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, in the US and Canada will have an exhibition at the AAN Brain Health Fair on April 21 from 10 a.m. - 4 p.m. ET, where attendees can gain first-hand experience about what it's like to have MS through virtual reality and other activities.

 About Cladribine Tablets   Cladribine Tablets is an investigational short-course oral therapy that is thought to selectively and periodically target lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. In July 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for review the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) of Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.  The clinical development program for Cladribine Tablets includes: CLARITY (CLAdRIbine Tablets Treating MS OrallY) study and its extension: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients with RRMS and its two-year extension designed to provide data on the long-term safety and efficacy of extended administration of Cladribine Tablets for up to four years. ORACLE MS (ORAl CLadribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients at risk of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS). ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding Cladribine Tablets treatment to patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough disease while on established interferon-beta therapy. PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cladribine Tablets. The follow-up will consist of over 10,000 patient years of exposure in total, with follow-up in some patients exceeding eight years at completion. About Rebif®  Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide™. Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS.  RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 10 Reasons Merck Could Be the World's Most Perfect Stock Merck may be a picture-perfect stock for long-term investors to consider buying. Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Apr 21, 2017 at 8:08AM The average investor has more than 5,000 publicly traded stocks on reputable U.S. exchanges to choose from. With that much hay in the barn, finding that needle can be quite difficult. But if you're looking for the world's most perfect stock, perhaps your search might end with pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK). Since Jan. 1970, including splits, shares of Merck have risen by a brisk 4,320%! Though it might appear that its best days are in the rearview mirror after such large gains, there are plenty of reasons to believe it still has ample upside opportunity. Here are 10 reasons Merck just might be the world's most perfect stock. Image source: Getty Images. 1. A leading cancer immunotherapy Without question, the biggest catalyst in Merck's pipeline is cancer immunotherapy Keytruda. Cancer immunotherapies are drugs that suppress cancer's ability to hide within the body, acting as an aid to help the immune system locate and kill these abnormal cells. Sales of Keytruda exploded higher by 151% to $1.4 billion in 2016. What makes Keytruda such an exciting compound ties into the recent failure of rival cancer immunotherapy Opdivo in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) Opdivo wasn't even close to meeting its primary endpoint in first-line NSCLC as a monotherapy in the CheckMate-026 study, yet Keytruda passed its similar first-line NSCLC trial with flying colors. This opens a new pathway for Keytruda where it'll be able to outshine Bristol-Myers' Opdivo. This is a drug that could wind up selling $10 billion or more annually within the next decade, and it's looking to be the foundation of cancer-fighting therapies for years to come. 2. A long-tail hepatitis C opportunity Another area of intrigue for Merck is its hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug Zepatier, which is a once-daily treatment. Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) has absolutely dominated the HCV space with Harvoni, Sovaldi, and Epclusa because of their convenience and efficacy. Merck's Zepatier presents the first real challenge to Harvoni, and it does so with a considerably lower list price than Gilead's therapies. Last year, Zepatier generated $555 million in sales, but its extrapolated Q4 sales have it on target for around $900 million in annual sales. As Merck nibbles at Gilead's market share, Zepatier could turn into a blockbuster drug in 2017. It's worth noting that Merck's HCV opportunity stretches well beyond the United States. The World Health Organization estimates that 180 million people are infected with HCV worldwide, leading to a long-tail opportunity for Merck. Image source: Getty Images. 3. Biosimilars Merck is also hedging its future by betting big on biosimilars, or biological drug copycats. Though the legal logistics surrounding biosimilar drugs is still a bit hazy, they're expected to go head-to-head with some of the biggest branded drugs in the U.S., and they're being priced at a discount to those branded therapies. In other words, there's a very strong incentive for physicians, insurers, and patients to consider biosimilar medicines because of their attractive price point. Merck has been focused on five biosimilars: Humira, Remicade, Enbrel, Lantus, and Herceptin. Combined, these drugs sell close to $40 billion a year. If Merck can get even a small piece of that pie, it would be a big deal. 4. Bolt-on acquisitions Merck is also a bit of a cash cow. With the exception of 2014, it's generated between $8 billion and $11.1 billion in free cash flow in every year since 2010. This healthy cash flow is what allows Merck to supplement its organic growth with what it likes to call "bolt-on acquisitions." Put simply, Merck is looking to complement its core therapeutic indications with mid-cap-sized acquisitions from time to time. A good example is the company's acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, which was completed a little over two years ago. Cubist was predominantly focused on acute hospital care drugs, which also happens to be one of Merck's primary therapeutic indications. The addition of blockbuster drug Cubicin and other therapies to its product portfolio provided Merck with an instant return on its investment in the form of higher EPS and cash flow. Image source: Getty Images. 5. A premier pharmaceutical pipeline As you'd probably expect from a company Merck's size, it has a very healthy pipeline of developing drugs, many of which are in specialty indications. As of Feb. 24, 2017, the latest pipeline update, it had 13 ongoing phase 3 studies and more than a half-dozen phase 2 studies. Aside from Keytruda, Merck has numerous diabetes combination studies being examined, including its blockbuster drug Januvia. Januvia is beginning to face a lot of pressure from SGLT-2 inhibitors, so if Merck can find a way to incorporate Januvia as a combination therapy for type 2 diabetes it could regain its luster. Add in the aforementioned biosimilars and Merck has a lot going on development-wise. 6. Tight cost controls While cost-cutting may not be a long-term strategy, it's been an effective tool that's helped Merck navigate the patent cliff. Between 2010 and Aug. 2015, FiercePharma reports that Merck shed 36,450 jobs. All the while, Merck's sales actually grew even though it cut a significant portion of its staff, showing just how efficient the company has become. In 2016, Merck saw its research and development costs rise by $490 million, or 7%. However, its materials and production expenses fell by more than $1 billion, and its marketing and administrative costs dipped by more than $550 million. Merck has the ability to pull levers and cut costs, which is a luxury most drugmakers don't have.  Image source: Getty Images. 7. Strong pricing power Investors are also bound to like the significant prescription drug pricing power that a company like Merck brings to the table. The U.S. has a long list of inherent advantages for drugmakers, including its lack of a universal health plan and the fact that Americans demand pharmaceuticals more than any other country in the world. Those exceptionally long patent protection periods don't hurt, either. There also aren't too many concerns that President Trump will be able to institute pricing curbs on prescription drugs. Congressional Republicans typically favor free market drug pricing, and Trump appears to be far too busy with other aspects of his agenda to concern himself with drug pricing. Translation: Merck can use its pricing power to boost its top and bottom line. 8. Steady growth in animal health Thought it's an oft-overlooked building block, the company's animal health division is a steady source of growth. On a constant currency basis, sales of animal health grew by 8% to $3.48 billion in 2016. The major factor at play is that American families, now more than ever, are welcoming pets into their homes. A Harris Interactive poll from 2012 found that 91% of respondents believed their pet was a part of the family. As a result, the American Pet Products Association found that total pet expenditures in 2016 grew to $66.75 billion, up from $21 billion just two decades earlier. Of that $66.75 billion, $14.7 billion was tied to supplies and over-the-counter care, and another $16 billion to veterinary care. This is a steadily growing business that Merck and investors can count on. Image source: Getty Images. 9. Shareholder yield Big Pharma is known for its healthy margins, and Merck is no exception. Aside from its cash flow giving the company ample flexibility when it comes to making acquisitions, it also provides plenty of capital that can be returned to shareholders. Merck is currently paying out $0.47 each quarter, which over the course of the year translates into a 3% dividend yield. That's well above the average yield of S&P 500 companies. Merck has also aggressively repurchased its own common stock. Buying back its stock reduces the number of shares outstanding, which can boost EPS, lower the P/E ratio, and make a stock look more attractive on a valuation basis. In March 2015, Merck authorized a $10 billion share repurchasing program. This followed a $5 billion repurchase authorization from May 2013. 10. Valuation Last but not least, Merck is priced attractively relative to the broader market. The company is valued at a forward P/E of less than 15 compared to the S&P 500, which has a forward P/E that's near 20. All the while, Merck has a healthy pipeline, excellent growth prospects from Keytruda and Zepatier, and ample cash flow to inorganically grow its business. Merck may very well be the world's most perfect stock. Sean Williams has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Gilead Sciences.

KEYTRUDA, which was funded for melanoma last year, is now registered for PD-L1 positive patients in both pre-treated and untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Paul Smith, MSD New Zealand Director, says, “This KEYTRUDA registration has the potential to transform the way lung cancer is treated in New Zealand and is particularly important for patients who express PD-L1. PD-L1 is a protein expressed by cancer cells to evade the immune system. “The recent KEYNOTE-024 clinical trial results have been so compelling that trial investigators believe KEYTRUDA should replace platinum-based chemotherapy to become the new “Standard of Care” for untreated advanced NSCLC that expresses high levels of PD-L1. 1 “Chemotherapy has long been the standard of care for advanced NSCLC; however the latest data from the KEYNOTE-024 trial demonstrates superior overall survival with KEYTRUDA, compared to chemotherapy in patients with high PD-L1 expression.2 “In light of that trial data, the external data and safety monitoring committee recommended that the study be stopped early to give the patients who were receiving chemotherapy the opportunity to receive KEYTRUDA.” 2 “Lung cancer is New Zealand’s biggest cancer killer, accounting for more than 1,600 deaths per year. 3 More people die of lung cancer, than of breast cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma combined.” 3 Philip Hope, CEO of Lung Foundation New Zealand, says, “This KEYTRUDA lung cancer registration is a hugely welcome step forward in ensuring New Zealanders can benefit from this new generation of treatments. I hope that this medicine will be made available on a funded basis to all New Zealanders with life-threatening lung cancer. “As New Zealanders we need to acknowledge the gravity of this disease and look at ways we can work together to prevent it, treat it and ultimately save lives. Lung cancer often affects the most disadvantaged with male lung cancer rates in the most deprived areas 3.2 times higher than those in the least deprived areas. 4 “Lung cancer can affect anyone, not just smokers; in fact, one in five people diagnosed with lung cancer have never smoked. 3 “It also has a significant impact on Maori compared to the non-Maori population with rates three – four times higher in Maori men and women respectively.” 5 Paul Smith says, “MSD has made an application to PHARMAC for funding of KEYTRUDA in advanced NSCLC. We hope that PHARMAC can work with urgency to provide lung cancer patients with a new treatment option, and we believe it is possible to fund KEYTRUDA for this group of patients as early as 1 July. “Patients wanting to access KEYTRUDA should seek further advice from their cancer specialist about the options that may benefit them.” -ENDS- Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url Trackback-URL  Print This Post comments feed for this post Tweet   No comments yet.

Renflexis -- a biosimilar of Janssen Biotech, Inc.'s blockbuster immunology medicine Remicade -- is expected to go on sale in the U.S. in about six months through Merck, a global health care company known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada. The move came more than a year after South Korea’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety approved Renflexis for treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis. Samsung Bioepis -- a joint venture between Samsung Biologics and Biogen Inc. -- also won approval for Renflexis from authorities in Europe and Australia last year. Samsung BioLogics is a biopharmaceutical unit of South Korea's top conglomerate Samsung Group. Samsung Bioepis is expected to compete with Celltrion Inc., a South Korean bio-pharmaceutical firm, over biosimilars in the U.S. Last year, Celltrion won approval from the FDA to sell Remsima, a biosimilar to Remicade. Biosimilars are defined by the FDA as products that are "highly similar to an already approved biological product," which has "no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and effectiveness from the reference product."    entropy@yna.co.kr (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

Samsung Bioepis, a partnership with Biogen, won U.S. approval for Renflexis, which is a version of infliximab referred to as a biosimilar because it is not an exact chemical copy like a generic drug. The biosimilar therapy is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in patients with adult and pediatric Crohn's disease, adult ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis, and for the treatment of adult plaque psoriasis. "Through relentless process innovation and an uncompromising commitment to quality, we remain committed to advancing one of the industry's strongest biosimilar pipelines," Samsung Bioepis spoksman Mingi Hyun said in an email. The FDA nod sets up a complex game of marketing with Merck handling sales of Remicade in Europe, while Samsung has a version called Flixabi approved by the European Medicines Agency last year that is marketed by Biogen in Europe. But Merck will handle marketing for Renflexis in the U.S. and compete against another biosimilar of Remicade from Pfizer called Inflectra. The musical chairs on marketing and sales underscore a growing effort to bring more biosimilars to the market in the U.S. akin to generics to bring down prices. That is an aim set forth in the Affordable Health Care Act known as Obamacare, which is the subject of repeal and replace legislation proposed by the Republican-led U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump. In another aspect on biosimilars, the U.S. Supreme Court could decide by this summer on whether to keep a 180-day waiting period in place before makers of biologic drugs can launch sales after approvals. The case pits Alcon, the generics arm of Swiss-based Novartis, against U.S.-based Amgen which makes autoimmune drug Neupogen to treat cancer. --Reuters contributed to this article.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Renflexis, developed by Samsung Bioepis Co. of South Korea. Its U.S. partner, Merck & Co. of Kenilworth, New Jersey, will market Renflexis. Merck said Renflexis should be available in six months. The delay is required under U.S. regulations for a relatively new category called biosimilars. That's the industry term for generic but not quite identical versions of biotech drugs. Without insurance, Remicade generally costs more than $30,000 annually for adults; dosage varies by weight. The first biosimilar for Remicade, Inflectra from New York-based Pfizer Inc., went on sale in November at a 15 percent discount. The companies refused to disclose the list price of Renflexis. Many U.S. insurers are requiring patients to switch to lower-priced biosimilars, and the new competition will help insurers negotiate bigger discounts from manufacturers. Remicade is health care giant Johnson & Johnson's top seller, with 2016 sales totaling $7 billion. It's approved to treat eight different immune disorders, including two in children. Renflexis is approved for seven of those: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis, plus Crohn's in children. Remicade and Renflexis both carry serious risks. More-common side effects include respiratory infections, headache, rash and stomach pain. Because the drugs suppress the immune system, their use can also result in serious infections, including tuberculosis, and unusual cancer types. ___ Follow Linda A.

Because the drugs suppress the immune system, their use can also result in serious infections, including tuberculosis, and unusual cancer types. ——— Follow Linda A.

NewLink Genetics intriguing IDO-inhibitors could make it a target of Gilead Sciences. Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Apr 21, 2017 at 12:02PM Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) sales (and its share price!) are nose-diving because of stiff competition for its top-selling hepatitis C drugs, and that's got everyone wondering if management will uncork its cash flow and make some acquisitions to rekindle growth. It's anyone's guess what management might do with its financial firepower, but I think it ought to be kicking tires at NewLink Genetics (NASDAQ:NLNK). Tough times It wasn't that long ago when Gilead Sciences could do no wrong. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The company launched Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014 -- two of the most remarkable drugs ever developed. Those two drugs reshaped hepatitis C treatment by delivering 90%-plus functional cure rates with fewer side effects and shorter treatment duration than prior therapies. The drugs were so effective and safe that doctors rushed to prescribe them, sending Gilead Sciences' sales and profit skyrocketing between 2014 and 2016. GILD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Since then, however, Gilead Sciences has become a victim of its own success. Sovaldi and Harvoni were the only game in town when they launched, and they were priced accordingly. Now, however, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) and Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) market competing drugs offering similar cure rates and lower prices, and that's forced Gilead Sciences to cut its own prices to maintain its market share. Because of the pricing pressure, the company's worldwide sales and net earnings declined 7% and 18%, respectively, in 2016. Falling short A few years ago, Gilead Sciences boasted an intriguing cancer drug pipeline that included Zydelig, a promising drug for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Management hoped Zydelig could serve as a foundation for a robust cancer drug franchise, but unfortunately, it hasn't panned out that way. Zydelig won FDA approval in 2014, but safety concerns made it less attractive than Imbruvica, a competing drug that launched around the same time. Eventually, Zydelig's safety concerns led management to shutter development of it in other indications, and Zydelig's become a niche drug with only $168 million in sales last year. Gilead Sciences says it hasn't given up on its ambition to become a top player in cancer treatment, but in my view, there's little in its internal pipeline that could be considered a needle mover. Why NewLink Genetics? Assuming Gilead Sciences' remains committed to cancer, I think they ought to focus on acquiring companies working on next-generation cancer fighting drugs, such as IDO inhibitors. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a natural protein that suppresses the immune system, and sometimes cancer cells hijack it to survive. IDO-inhibitors disable the protein, thereby removing cancer cells' ability to evade detection. So far, trial results suggest that inhibiting IDO could be a very important weapon in the fight against different types of cancer. Currently, the most advanced IDO-inhibitor in development is Incyte's (NASDAQ:INCY) epacadostat. However, NewLink Genetics is developing two IDO-inhibitors: indoximod and GDC-0919; and its valuation is a fraction of Incyte's. NewLink Genetics recently reported results from a study evaluating indoximod alongside Merck & Co.'s Keytruda, a checkpoint inhibitor, and that data showed that 73% of patients with advanced melanoma responded to the one-two combination. The result was impressive considering that Keytruda won approval as a monotherapy in this indication after delivering a 33% response rate. Despite the solid showing, many industry watchers believe that epacadostat delivers a better blend of efficacy and safety because it targets IDO directly. Unlike epacadostat, indoximod disables IDO via cell signaling. While it's true that indoximod might not be as robust of an IDO-inhibitor as epacadostat (no head-to-head studies are planned, nor are they likely to happen), NewLink's GDC-0919 does work similarly to epacadostat, and results are expected later this year from an early stage trial that's being conducted with collaboration partner Roche Holdings (NASDAQOTH: RHHBY) in patients with solid tumors. Admittedly, epacadostat is further along in development, but Incyte's market cap is $24 billion, and historically, Gilead Sciences' has avoided paying premium valuations for acquisitions. Since NewLink Genetics market cap is only $537 million, and it has two IDO-inhibitors in the works, I feel like it's a bigger bargain. If Gilead Sciences were to make this deal, it would take on the risk of trial failures. It would also have to share GDC-0919's success with Roche. Nevertheless, at this price, I'd be willing to accept those trade-offs.    Todd Campbell owns shares of Gilead Sciences. His clients may have positions in the companies mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Gilead Sciences.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Gram-Negative Bacterial Infection Market : Revenue, Sales Volume, Price by Regions and Consumption 2017 – 2025 Global Gram-negative Bacterial Infection: Overview The emergence and proliferation of highly resistant gram-negative bacteria is a major concern given the limited number of antimicrobial agents that are currently available to combat these organisms. The abundant and often inappropriate use of antibiotics is further contributing to the emergence of these organisms. This is creating a pressing need for reliable and effective therapeutics for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infection. Therefore, the rising research and development activities coupled with increasing investments are driving the global gram-negative bacterial infection market. The research report offers insights into both existing and therapeutics under development for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infection. It explores the investments in the pipeline, existing practices, and the latest clinical developments pertaining to the global gram-negative bacterial infection market. It also presents a detailed description of the competitive landscape of the market. Request a Brochure of the Report @ www.tmrresearch.com/sample/sample?flag=B&rep_id=94 Global Gram-negative Bacterial Infection: Infection-type Segmentation On the basis of type of infection, the global gram-negative bacterial infection market can be segmented into wound or surgical site infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, and meningitis. Pneumonia is the most common disease caused gram-negative bacteria followed by urinary tract infections. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), this disease killed 920 136 children under the age of 5 in 2015. Meningitis is also a common disease caused by these organisms. A study conducted by one of the key players in the market, Merck & Co. Inc., indicates that about 25% of the newborns who suffer from gram-negative bacteria induced meningitis die and 15% to 20% of the infants develop serious brain and nerve problems such as enlargement of ventricles, deafness, cerebral palsy, and mental retardation. The alarming rate of mortality and morbidity due to these organisms is escalating the growth of the market. Request for TOC of the Report @ www.tmrresearch.com/sample/sample?flag=T&rep_id=94 Global Gram-negative Bacterial Infection: Analysis of Treatment Options In terms of treatment, the global gram-negative bacterial infection market can be divided into Carbapenems, Colistin, Tigecyclin, Sulbactam, Doxycycline, and Rifampin. The demand for carbapenes is high for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections, particularly pneumonia. Some of the most commonly used carbapenes for the treatment of pneumonia are meropenem, imipenem, and doripenem. Sulbactam is majorly used for treatment of meningititis. However, colistin, tigecyclin, doxycycline, and rifampin are used for treating every type of gram-negative bacterial infection and are, therefore, likely to be adopted more in the long run. Global Gram-negative Bacterial Infection: Competitive Landscape Players in the global gram-negative bacterial market are primarily focusing on development of more effective drugs. To put this in perspective, Prokarium Ltd. has developed Typhetec for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. Currently, the drug is under phase II clinical trials and on the basis of phase I results, market experts predict that this drug will be beneficial for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections in future and will encourage the growth of the market. Some of the key players in the market are Baxter International Inc., Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Nektar Therapeutics, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd., Rib-X Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Targeted Genetics Corporation.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Therapeutics Market Analysis and Forecast 2025 By Drug and Region The global non-small cell lung cancer therapeutics market is expected to reach a value of USD 12.2 billion by 2025, based on a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. The non-small cell cancer therapeutics (NSCLC) market is anticipated to witness significant growth during the forecast period. This can be attributed to the high investment by market players in the research and development of lung cancer therapy, presence of a rich pipeline, and increasing penetration of drugs during the forecast period. Introduction of several drugs in various geographical regions is likely to drive the market during the forecast period. For instance, in October 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Alecensa (alectinib), a drug developed by Genentech to treat ALK-positive NSCLC as a first-line treatment. The drug has been approved in the U.S., Japan, Canada, Hong Kong, South Korea, Kuwait, and Israel. Presence of a strong pipeline of drugs for non-small cell lung cancer helps propel the market during the forecast period. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Orion Corporation, Merck KGaA, AstraZeneca, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, and Pfizer, Inc. have major molecules in the pipeline.

However, it is expected to witness decline in its share during the forecast period. Alecensa (alectinib) is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period. This is majorly attributed to the clinical benefit of the drug to treat ALK-positive NSCLC. Alecensa is expected to be a competitor to Pfizer’s Xalkori and Merck’s Keytruda during the forecast period. A superior progression-free survival rate of Alecensa was observed in the clinical trials as compared to Crizotinib. Geographically, North America dominated the overall industry in 2015. This is due to the early entry of drugs in the market, increased adoption of new treatment, and high cost of the drug. Request a sample copy of Report @ http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/267661 It is expected that North America would maintain its dominance during the forecast period and grow with the highest rate over the coming years due to expected entry of new drugs. Several players are operating in the industry. Geographical penetration and development of innovative & effective drugs are the key strategies of the players to increase their share. Some of the key players are GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Plc., Novartis AG, AstraZeneca, F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer Inc., Eli Lilly & Company, and Sanofi.

The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. Media release as of April 21, 2017 Interim Report of BB Biotech AG as of March 31, 2017 BB Biotech reports pleasing quarterly results The Swiss investment company with a special focus on small and mid-cap biotech stocks earned a bottom-line profit of CHF 375 mn in the first quarter of 2017 BB Biotech's share price advanced 7.7% in CHF and 7.1% in EUR in the first quarter amid a generally positive market environment. The healthcare sector showed signs of strength. Market-moving news stemmed primarily from the US, where Congressional leaders temporarily shelved a vote to repeal and replace Obamacare. In keeping with its strategy of investing in promising small and mid-cap stocks, BB Biotech opened a position in Five Prime Therapeutics. Profits were realized in the core shareholdings of Incyte, Celgene and Actelion and the proceeds reinvested to build up positions in numerous mid-cap stocks. The Board of Directors reiterated the company's shareholder-friendly dividend policy at the Annual General Meeting on March 16, 2017, consisting of a 5% dividend yield and share buybacks. Drug pricing practices and regulations will remain one of the key topics of discussion with regard to US healthcare policy in 2017. In the meanwhile, an even greater number of biotech products are likely to receive regulatory approval compared to last year. Overall, equity markets performed well in the first quarter of 2017 driven by hopes for stimulation of the US economy by lower corporate tax rates, potential repatriation of offshore cash and investments in infrastructure alluded to by President Trump. The S&P 500 gained 6.1%, the Dow Jones gained 5.2% and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 10.1 (all values in USD). European equity indices followed the same trend, apparently disregarding Brexit implications and national election risks, so that the Euro Stoxx 600 gained 6.3%, and the Dax Index gained 7.3% in EUR while the SPI's gained 7.5% in CHF. Healthcare markets were again influenced by a seesaw US healthcare agenda driven between the White House and Congress. Initial drafts of 'repeal and replace' legislation for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) failed to win sufficient votes in Congress after intensive debate and attempts at last-minute back-room deal making - at least for now. The associated short-term volatility and tweets however could not stop the overall positive trend in broad healthcare equity markets including the MSCI World Healthcare Index, which gained 8.7% in USD, and the Nasdaq Biotech Index, which gained 10.8% in USD for the quarter. BB Biotech's performance for the first quarter 2017 The total return for BB Biotech's share price was +7.7% in CHF and +7.1% in EUR for the first three months of 2017. The portfolio showed an overall gain of 12.5% in CHF, 12.4% in EUR and 14.4% in USD. Net profit of CHF 375 mn (CHF 1.2 bn loss in the corresponding period of the previous year) was driven by the overall portfolio appreciation. The currency impact in the first quarter was -1.9% as the US Dollar fell against the Swiss Franc. All total return calculations for BB Biotech take account of the dividend distribution of CHF 2.75 per share as set by BB Biotech's dividend policy, which was approved by shareholders at this year's AGM of March 16, 2017. Continued capital distribution BB Biotech paid out the proposed dividend of CHF 2.75 per share. The board confirmed continuation of the dividend policy, and expects to pay out a regular dividend calculated as 5% of the previous December average share price. The eleventh share repurchase program - started in April 2016 - continues, and allows BB Biotech to acquire up to 10% of the company's outstanding shares over a period of up to three years. Given the ongoing reduced difference between BB Biotech's Net Asset Value and share price, the company did not trade on the second trading line in the first quarter 2017 - in fact, that trading line has not yet been activated since April 2016. First quarter portfolio activity Existing portfolio positions were carefully adjusted amid volatile, yet upward-trending biotechnology equity market. BB Biotech took further profits from the core positions in Incyte, Celgene and Actelion - generating cash to increase its core positions in Novo Nordisk, Ionis and in several of its mid-sized investments. Continuing its strategy of investing in new promising smaller and mid-cap companies, BB Biotech added Five Prime Therapeutics to its portfolio in the first quarter of 2017. Located in South San Francisco, Five Prime is developing its lead asset FPA008, an anti-CSF1R (macrophage colony stimulating factor) antibody which blocks CSF1 and IL34 ligand binding. FPA008 is in clinical trials as monotherapy and in combination with Opdivo, Bristol Myers Squibb's PD1 antibody, in cancer patients. The same antibody is being developed for pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), a macrophage-driven tumor. In PVNS, macrophages express high levels of CSF1 and attract cells with CSF1 receptors to the joint, leading to the accumulation of non-neoplastic cells that form a tumor. Results for the Phase II study are expected in 2017. Solid progress of portfolio holdings Incyte (+33.3% in USD during 1Q 2017), BB Biotech's largest position at the end of March, announced further progress in the clinical development of epacadostat, an IDO1 inhibitor. Incyte will begin additional pivotal studies testing epacadostat in combination with Merck's Keytruda as well as with Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo. These moves position epacadostat as a leading agent which is likely to be combined with approved, market leading PD1 antibodies. The Phase II data, which prompted these exciting additional trials, will be presented in June at the 2017 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Ionis (-16.0% in USD during 1Q 2017) announced Phase III data for volanesorsen in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). The primary endpoint - triglyceride lowering - was met, showing a 77% reduction for volanesorsen versus an 18% increase for control group patients. But in addition, investors focused on safety data - and were disappointed by reports of thrombocytopenia and injection site reactions, leading to a significant correction of Ionis' share price. Nevertheless, BB Biotech is encouraged that there were no further cases of severe thrombocytopenia nor patient dropouts during the final 6-months of the study, following implementation of a monitoring program. Ionis intends to file volanesorsen for marketing approval in the US in the third quarter of 2017. In late January, Johnson & Johnson announced their intention to acquire Actelion (+28.0% in CHF during 1Q 2017) for USD 30 bn, or USD 280 per Actelion share. BB Biotech's end of Q1 2017 position means the sale will generate around USD 270 mn in cash upon once the deal is closed. In addition, BB Biotech will receive approximately one million shares of Idorsia, the spinout company that will retain Actelion's earlier stage pipeline. The main offer period ended on March 30, 2017, by which time 73.3% of Actelion's outstanding shares had been tendered and Actelion's shareholders had voted in favor of the demerger of Idorsia. BB Biotech believes that the transaction is on track to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. Vertex (+48.4% in USD during 1Q 2017) reported positive data from two Phase III studies of Kalydeco plus VX-661 in cystic fibrosis. Slightly better efficacy, but significantly improved tolerability were reported for patients who are carriers of the F508 deletion mutation on both alleles (so-called homozygotes), compared to Vertex's other product, Orkambi. Strong clinical benefit and good tolerability were reported for patients with residual function of the CFTR gene. If approved, the combination of VX-661 and Kalydeco should enable use of the treatment both in patients with residual function and also in some patients who previously stopped their Orkambi monotherapy treatment. Additional new data for various triple combination treatments (Kalydeco, Orkambi and VX-661 together) are eagerly anticipated in the second half of 2017. Kite (+75% in USD during 1Q 2017) released positive topline results from their complete pivotal trial population given KTE-019 to treat relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The data showed an impressive overall response rate of 82% including an initial complete response rate of 49%, (31% at 6 months) in this difficult-to-treat population. The median survival of the patients had not been reached after 8.7 months of follow-up. These data compare favorably with the initial complete response rate of just 8% and median survival of 6.6 months for historical controls. BB Biotech anticipates the approval of KTE-019 by the US FDA during 2017. Esperion's share price (+182% in USD during 1Q 2017) benefited strongly from Amgen's positive cardiovascular outcomes trial data for its PCSK9 antibody, Repatha. Amgen's data demonstrated once more that lowering LDL-cholesterol levels reduces clinical cardiovascular risk. Esperion also received encouraging news that the FDA is willing to grant an initial approval based on demonstration of LDL-cholesterol lowering. Outlook BB Biotech expects the US healthcare reform debate to simmer (discussion of the Affordable Care Act continues in Congress). Unless there is rapid consensus and action, which seems unlikely, the debate seems likely to focus on access to care and coverage - rather than purely on healthcare costs. However, drug pricing may remain a popular topic for Presidential tweets, and more serious initiatives may be expected around "best-prices" and "value-based prices" during 2017 and beyond. Each of these topics - particularly when tweeted by Donald Trump - will continue to rattle media interest and investor sentiment, but the related risk appears to be priced in for some time now. In contrast to the perennial political debate around drug prices and government payment, the biopharmaceutical industry has experienced increasing pressure on drug prices and on patient access by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and private insurance companies for years. BB Biotech's long standing criteria for selecting investments in companies delivering drugs for unmet medical needs and an increasing focus on pharmaco-economic driven price policy are solid grounds for confidence in its investments. For the remainder of 2017, BB Biotech expects a series of late stage clinical trial read-outs and an increase in the number of product approvals during 2017 compared to 2016. Merger and acquisition activities are also expected to continue to drive the performance of the biotech sector from time-to-time. Johnson & Johnson's acquisition of Actelion is expected to deliver significant cash for BB Biotech in the second quarter. BB Biotech will consider selective increases in undervalued portfolio positions and continue to add promising new smaller and mid-cap positions to its investment portfolio.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Birth Control Implant Market to Witness an Outstanding Growth by 2026 New York City, NY — (SBWIRE) — 04/20/2017 — Birth control implants are devices that are highly effective in preventing pregnancy for a short period. These implants are placed sub-dermally and contain progestin, release of which stops ovulation. It also leads to thickening of the vaginal fluid that avoids fertilization by preventing sperms from reaching the egg. It also causes thinning of uterine lining that makes it difficult for the fertilised egg to attach onto it. Birth control implants are reversible contraceptive birth controls and have very low failure rate and if properly placed are able to avoid pregnancy for three years. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/12052 The insertion and removal of the Birth control implants are done by healthcare professional after taking into consideration several other implications such as, history of blood clots, pregnancy, diabetes, breast cancer and heart, liver or kidney problems. These Birth control implants are also often associated with certain side effects such as headaches, acne or other pains. The Birth control implants now available are of single rod devices containing progestin, however, the first contraceptive implant that was developed and marketed as Norplant consisted of 6 rods. With further studies and researches, a 2-rod system that contained levonorgestrel with name Jadelle was eventually approved by FDA but was not, however marketed in United States. Later, in 1988, a single-rod implant containing etonogestrel, named Implanon entered the international market of birth control and was widely accepted for its convenience and better results. The 6 rod system was inconvenient and had difficulty with insertion and removal and thus was eventually removed from the US market. The 2-rod implant that was easier and better than 6-rod implants has been registered in 11 countries for birth control. The Birth control implants maker, Merck & Co. is phasing out its product Implanon and replacing it with its own another product Nexplanon. The Birth control implants market is a steadily growing market owing to the rise in awareness among people for birth control measures. The rise in the number of people undergoing treatments and the steady increase in the procedural volume implies that the market will be pushed further up in the forthcoming years. With not much competitors and products in the birth control implants market, the established key players have an added advantage. Technological innovations will keep driving the birth control implant market. However, the regulations related to the approval of the Birth control implants tend to restrain the market. The cost of these birth control implants and their inability for protection against STD’s act as another drawback. Advancements such as Nexplanon, which was launched in 2011 by Merck & Co. at United States. The Worldwide sales of Birth control implants by Merck & Co., that consist of Implanon and Nexplanon rose to $588 million in the year 2015 which indicates a 17% increase compared to 2014. This implies that these birth control products have a higher demand in the United States and the emerging markets. The birth control implant Jadelle, was developed and licensed by The Population Council. Further research and development activities pertaining to birth control implants are being undertaken with partnership with WomanCare Global. In 2016, Bayer announced its birth control implant Jadelle will be available at half the price until 2023, in order to cater to the needs of the poor. Thus, focusing and expanding its customer base to the emerging economies. Other birth control implants, such as Nesterone™ and Capronor™ comprising of different progestins, and biodegradable rods, pellets or microcapsules are under developmental stages. Geographically, Birth control implants is classified into regions viz. North America, Latin America, Europe, APAJ, Middle East and Africa. North America and Europe will remain key markets for Birth control implants due to rising awareness about the better results, hence a proportional increase in treatment procedures. The emerging regions are also anticipated to attain higher growth in the forecasted period for birth control implants market.

The drug, called Renflexis, is a biosimilar - a copy of a biotech drug - and the second Remicade copy to be approved in the world's largest pharmaceutical market. Remicade is J&J's biggest selling drug with U.S. sales of about $5 billion a year. Established in 2012 as a relative latecomer to the industry, Samsung Bioepis has found early success by beating rivals to market on biosimilars of some of the world's top-selling drugs by so far investing $1.3 billion into biosimilar development. It became the first company to launch a biosimilar version of Amgen's Enbrel, another rheumatoid arthritis drug, in Europe. It also submitted for approval its copy of Roche's blockbuster breast cancer drug Herceptin and its copy of AbbVie Inc's rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, both in Europe. Renflexis will be marketed and distributed in the United States by Merck & Co Inc, Samsung Bioepis said in a statement. It received European approval in May 2016. The FDA approved the drug a little more than a year after the first Remicade biosimilar copy - Pfizer's Inflectra, developed by South Korea's Celltrion - was approved. Inflectra was introduced in the U.S. in late 2016. Remicade accounted for about 9.7 percent of Johnson & Johnson's total revenues for fiscal 2016, and biosimilar competition is expected to reduce U.S. sales, J&J said in its annual report.

Industrial companies rose as stocks continued the up-and-down pattern they've been stuck in for the last month. Stocks slumped in morning trading as banks fell in tandem with bond yields and interest rates and energy companies sank with oil prices. Strong results from Honeywell and aviation electronics maker Rockwell Collins helped industrial firms. Toy maker Mattel plunged after it reported is second disappointing quarter in a row. Stocks climbed in the final minutes of trading and left the Standard & Poor's 500 index 1 percent higher for the week. President Donald Trump gave the market a fleeting boost in the afternoon when he said his administration will release a tax reform proposal next week that includes a large tax cut. He didn't provide details. "I don't think anything's actually going to happen or be implemented any time soon," said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He said he thinks a corporate tax cut is more likely to pass Congress and become law than a tax cut for individuals, and added that he wants the administration to focus on moves that can keep the economy growing. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 7.15 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,348.69. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 30.95 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,547.76. The Nasdaq composite fell 6.26 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,910.52. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 4.30 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,379.85. Financial companies fell Friday. Professional services firm Marsh & McLennan skidded $1.41, or 1.9 percent, to $71.88 and wealth management company Morgan Stanley dipped 70 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $41.80. Bank of America fell 36 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $22.7. Bond prices rose early on but wound up little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.24 percent. Health care companies moved lower. Biotech drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals lost $1.90, or 1.6 percent, to $116.82 and Merck declined 66 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $61.89. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts dipped 59 cents to $66.46. Stocks did well this week, but they've wandered up and down over the last few weeks. That may persist. Next Friday the government will release its report on first-quarter GDP growth, something to which investors pay a lot of attention. On the same day, the federal government is scheduled to reach its borrowing limit, which could trigger a government shutdown unless Congress agrees to extend it. "The stock market's been willing to wait to see what, if anything, comes out of Washington," said Wells Fargo's Wren. He adds that stock prices aren't too high even though they've been breaking records lately. Next week the market may also react to the first round of voting in the French presidential election.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad U.S. FDA approves Samsung Bioepis' copy of J&J's Remicade - company By Reuters Published: 18:54 EDT, 21 April 2017 | Updated: 22:24 EDT, 21 April 2017 e-mail SEOUL, April 22 (Reuters) - South Korea's Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd said on Saturday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its copy of Johnson &amp; Johnson's rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, the first drug developed by the Samsung Group unit approved in the United States. The drug, called Renflexis, is a biosimilar - a copy of a biotech drug - and the second Remicade copy to be approved in the world's largest pharmaceutical market. Remicade is J&amp;J's biggest selling drug with U.S. sales of about $5 billion a year. Established in 2012 as a relative latecomer to the industry, Samsung Bioepis has found early success by beating rivals to market on biosimilars of some of the world's top-selling drugs by so far investing $1.3 billion into biosimilar development. It became the first company to launch a biosimilar version of Amgen's Enbrel, another rheumatoid arthritis drug, in Europe. It also submitted for approval its copy of Roche's blockbuster breast cancer drug Herceptin and its copy of AbbVie Inc's rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, both in Europe. Renflexis will be marketed and distributed in the United States by Merck &amp; Co Inc, Samsung Bioepis said in a statement. It received European approval in May 2016. The FDA approved the drug a little more than a year after the first Remicade biosimilar copy - Pfizer's Inflectra, developed by South Korea's Celltrion - was approved. Inflectra was introduced in the U.S. in late 2016. Remicade accounted for about 9.7 percent of Johnson &amp; Johnson's total revenues for fiscal 2016, and biosimilar competition is expected to reduce U.S. sales, J&amp;J said in its annual report.

One billion people are now being treated for at least one such condition each year, and strong progress is being made towards eliminating several of them — including lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. Mass drug administration, supported by donations from a dozen pharmaceutical groups, plays an important part in this success. Fresh innovation is needed to produce better medicines and diagnostics. Delivery systems and improved management, surveillance and political leadership are also essential — highlighted in the FT’s Neglected Tropical Diseases special report this week. Nature has a way of adapting more quickly than humans, as the emergence of Guinea worm in dogs and even frogs has shown. Complete eradication is proving frustratingly elusive as a result. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are ultimately diseases of neglected people, whether in Uganda or the poor south of the US. Without economic and social development, including much more effective health and sanitation systems, they will continue to exact a heavy toll. Watch our video discussion with Dirk Engels, head of NTDs at the World Health Organization; Dhekra Annuzaili, public health specialist from Yemen; and Andy Wright from GSK Three questions We talk to Seth Berkley, chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, ahead of world immunisation week, marked by an FT Health special report on vaccines. What have you changed at Gavi? First, we have focused on data. We are more in touch now with the situation in countries. The next level of difficulty is understanding sub-national data to help us concentrate on coverage and equity. In Pakistan, for instance, the use of phones to report on polio has raised vaccination rates. It’s not about science but simple management . . . Second, we have made our model country-facing, with joint appraisals on evaluation and technical assistance to ensure that governments are getting the best advice they need. Is there a risk of “vertical” vaccine programmes undermining health systems? I’m against vertical systems [those that focus on a particular approach or disease at the expense of a stronger overall health system] but universal health coverage is a vague veneer. I think Gavi is a pretty amazing story in the development space. Immunisation is one of the most cost-effective interventions and if you don’t have it, you don’t have a perfect health system. With vaccines, I see our goal as building the base of the primary healthcare system. What are your concerns about the future? It’s an important moment for our model, with lower-income countries becoming richer and “graduating” from our help. Overall they are doing quite well although there are a few problems in the commodity exporting ones which are “rich” but not really investing in social systems. Sometimes the problem is not about money but political commitment: the willingness, not the ability to pay. There is a question about what we do about new vaccines, and helping countries with shocks like refugees and drought. Chartwatch Drug donations Pharma companies provide more than 1.8bn treatments a year for neglected tropical diseases. (FT)  News round-up ‘Weaponisation of healthcare’ The bombing of the hospital caring for survivors of the Syrian chemical attack is but the latest example of the wounded and sick being denied their fundamental rights to medical care. Political leaders must stand up and support the rules that govern conflict and protect the vulnerable caught up in it. (Chatham House) The politics of aid The Public Health Foundation of India was banned from receiving foreign funding, including from the Gates Foundation, after tobacco industry lobbying. (FT) Modifying mosquitoes Florida authorities are experimenting with containing the Zika outbreak by releasing bacteria-infected mosquitoes. When the lab-bred insects — from MosquitoMate — mate with females carrying the virus, their offspring do not survive. Officials are considering a separate test of mosquitoes genetically modified by Britain’s Oxitec. (NBC) Bird flu clipped South Korea, Japan and the UK all reported positive news on avian flu, but France halted foie gras production in the south west of the country to curb the spread of the H5N8 strain. (Cidrap) Climate effects More US citizens are at risk of climate-change related illnesses — from mosquito-borne infections to respiratory problems — while researchers fear for the future of the Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Dehydration is striking down labourers across the world. (CNN, Mosaic) Water spending Countries must triple investments in infrastructure to $114bn a year to reach the UN goal of universal access to safe water and sanitation by 2030. (WHO) Sanofi shock France's drug regulator said valproate, Sanofi's epilepsy drug, had caused serious birth defects in thousands of children, echoing the thalidomide scandal of the 1960s. The drug, introduced in France in 1967, is sold under the brand Depakine to treat epilepsy and as Depakote or Depamide for bipolar disorders. (FT) Marching for science Scientists across the world will march through 500 cities on Saturday in the biggest demonstration of scientific solidarity ever staged. The original March for Science in Washington DC was planned to coincide with Earth Day as a protest against what the organisers viewed as President Donald Trump’s “anti-science” stance. (FT) Smoke alarm Some 44% of the world’s cigarettes are smoked in China. The WHO warned that tobacco would kill more than 200m Chinese this century without tougher counter-action. (WHO) Marijuana markets Better news for other types of smoker: Canada is on the brink of legalising medical marijuana. Deloitte values the retail market at up to $8bn a year with a wider benefit of more than $20bn thanks to cannabis-related tourism, taxes and testing labs. South of the border, more than half Americans have smoked the drug. (FT, Yahoo) Tech titans weigh in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is funding a study of 10,000 people to collect data that may lead to better understanding of disease. Subjects will be monitored for four years via smartwatches and sleep sensors. Other tech companies such as Apple, IBM and Microsoft are tackling illnesses from diabetes to cancer. (FT, Stat) Medical devices Medtronic followed Abbott and Johnson & Johnson in shrinking operations to focus on niche products. The company is selling its medical supplies business to Cardinal Health. (FT) Immunotherapy hopes Incyte is attracting attention from other US biotechs after successful trials of Epacadostat, its second generation immunotherapy drug, sending its shares up 60%. First generation immunotherapy drugs already on the market include Merck’s Keytruda, Roche’s Tecentriqy, and BMS’ Opdivo. (FT) Politics and health Theresa May called a snap UK election for June 8 as a survey showed health jostling with Brexit as the most important issue for voters. Departure from the bloc will also mean the UK losing any rights to hang on to the EMA, Europe's medicines regulator. (BBC, FT, Reuters) Antidepressant alert Mental health issues sprang to prominence in the UK as Princes Harry and William sought to dispel the stigma surrounding the problem. A survey detailed the link with deprivation, with poorer areas seeing a huge rise in prescriptions for antidepressants. (Calm, Guardian)  Frogs and dragons The race to find new antibiotics has led to an unusual source: the Komodo dragon. US researchers say the reptile's blood has powerful germ-killing properties. Frog slime meanwhile was found to be effective at combating flu. (NYT, Immunity) Best from the journals Tackling NTDs More funding is required to tackle neglected tropical diseases, says PLOS in a 10th anniversary edition of an open access journal on NTDs. Its investment priorities should include research, improved training and integrating control programmes with other development initiatives. (PLOS NTDs, The Lancet) Sugar tax The first US sugar tax — in Berkeley, California, has led to a 10% drop in sugary drink sales and a rise in purchases of water, raising hopes that such taxes can be introduced more widely. A separate study showed a possible link between artificially sweetened drinks and a higher risk of stroke or dementia. (PLoS Medicine, Stroke) Two wheels good Good news for Mamils (middle-aged men in Lycra): A new UK study shows commuting by bikelessens the chances of cancer as well as cardiovascular disease. Policies including the building of cycle lanes, subsidised bike purchase schemes and better provision for cycles on public transport should be encouraged. (BMJ) Investing in youth Improving the physical, mental and sexual health of adolescents, at the cost of $4.6 per person per year, could bring a 10-fold economic benefit. (The Lancet) Community health workers Despite performing valuable work, health workers are still largely undefined and unsupported. They need to be formally integrated into health systems with supervision, training, clear career structures — and regular pay cheques. (The Lancet) Health spending The US spends the most on healthcare per person at $9,237 a year and Somalia the least at $33. By 2040, global expenditure is forecast to hit $24tn from $9tn in 2014. (The Lancet, two studies) Podcast of the week The letter that changed me: an MSF medic describes his experiences dealing with the aftermath of earthquake in Haiti. (MSF Everyday Emergency series, 23m) In case you missed it FT Health Last week's edition: Cholera in Haiti Previous editions available on our Facebook page  Coming up Mon Apr 24 World Immunisation Week Tues Apr 25 FT Health: Combating malaria (World Malaria Day) Latest news www.ft.com/health and @FT_Health Final thought Aid and self interest Britain's foreign aid budget in the post-Brexit age is again in the spotlight. Bill Gates says the UK has one of the most efficient regimes in the world but others argue it is wasteful. Martin Wolf, FT chief economics commentator, says Britain must continue to lead — not just for altruistic reasons but because rich countries cannot seal themselves off from the next global pandemic or wave of desperate refugees to approach their shores.

Required fields are marked * Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Name * Email * Website  +  five  =  7 Right now, there's a billion-dollar profit opportunity big pharma companies are completely ignoring: reversible male contraceptives. Bloomberg projects this form of contraceptive could cut into half of the $10 billion global female contraceptive market. And while big pharma ignores this opportunity, Indian startups are seizing this potential $5 billion market. All the way back in 1978, biomedical engineer Sujoy Guha invented a sperm-zapping gel. The treatment is 98% effective, and the entire procedure (including injection) takes as little as 15 minutes. One patient reportedly walked 1.6 miles back to his home after the procedure, and he was also back at work within two days. While recovery time is different for each patient, vasectomies generally have a longer recuperation period. According to Vasectomy.com, most men can return to work two or three days after an operation and can resume normal physical activity within a week. There are an estimated 540 men who had the new procedure in India. As you can see in the accompanying chart, injectable birth control was among the lowest percentage of unintended pregnancies through contraceptive methods as of 2014.   While this could revolutionize the industry and generate billions, big pharma companies are choosing to ignore this emerging market… Big Pharma Won't Invest in New Drug Market in India Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) have reportedly said it isn't an "area of active research." Bayer AG (OTCMKTS ADR: BAYRY), which bought a company that studied a male birth control pill in the 1990s, stopped research and development on male fertility control in 2006. With the big drugmakers not interested, you may be wondering why the inventor of the treatment hasn't gone out on his own to dominate this billion-dollar opportunity. He hasn't because it reportedly costs tens of millions of dollars to have birth control approved, according to Bloomberg. Trending: Big Pharma's Biggest Enemy Is… Apple? However, Guha has licensed the technology to a U.S. nonprofit to help establish a market outside of India. The nonprofit plans to manufacture and distribute its own version of the treatment called Vasalgel. It will cost between $10 and $12 for patients in low- and middle-income countries, and between $400 and $600 for patients in wealthier countries. This will help build a market across the globe, but we're still keeping our eyes on the treatment and its founder in India. That's because the creator of this reversible male contraceptive just created a startup to develop mass production of the gel. And if he's successful, this could be one of the hottest startup companies in India and the next big profit opportunity for investors… Indian Startup News: This Company Could Dominate a New $5 Billion Industry Join the conversation.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Growing Awareness Contributing to the Increasing Number of People Visiting Psychologists and Psychiatrists Are Likely to Propel the Anti-Suicide Drugs Market Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 04/21/2017 — Suicide is an act wherein a person kills oneself intentionally. This tendency is associated with various mental and emotional issues such as depression, personality disorder, substance abuse, alcoholism, impulsiveness due to stress, financial distress, and troubled relationships, among others. In addition, changing lifestyle and increasing societal pressures aid in the high suicidal tendencies, primarily among young adults. Suicidal tendencies are indicated to be higher among women than in men. Demand for psychotherapy for the treatment of this condition is increasing which in turn is likely to contribute to the growth of the anti-suicide drugs market. According to the WHO, close to 800,000 people commit suicide every year. It is considered to be the second leading cause of death among young adults in the age group of 15 years to 29 years. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., with over 43,000 deaths each year. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the suicide rate was over 12.93 per 1,000 people in 2014 in the U.S. Similarly, India, Russia, Sri Lanka, Kazakhstan, and Japan, among others have reported a high suicide rate. Changing opinion of the population related to mental health, growing awareness, increased focus on research and development leading to the launch of a range of drugs, and a strong pipeline of drugs contribute to the growth of the anti-suicide drugs market. For instance, NeuroRx completed the phase II trial for Cyclurad, a combination drug composed of anti-infective drug lurasidone and tuberculosis drug D-cycloserine, used in conjunction with ketamine for the treatment of suicidal tendencies associated with bipolar depression. However, increasing addiction to opioids, which are used for treating depression, lack of effective therapies, abusive usage of these drugs, and growing usage of unapproved therapies are likely to restrain the anti-suicide drugs market. The anti-suicide drugs market can be segmented based on drug class, distribution channel, and region. In terms of drug class, the market can be segmented into anti-depressants, anti-psychotic drugs, anti-anxiety drugs, antibiotics, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, and others. The NMDA agonists segment is anticipated to record faster growth after FDA approval and commercialization. Based on distribution channel, the anti-suicide drugs market can be segmented into hospital pharmacies and retail pharmacies. Hospital pharmacies are anticipated to record strong growth during the forecast period owing to increasing prescriptions of anti-suicide drugs. Fill the Form for an Exclusive Sample of this Report @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=22976 Geographically, the anti-suicide drugs market can be segmented into five regions: North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. North America accounted for a high market share in 2016, closely followed by Europe. North America and Europe are anticipated to gain traction owing to increased health care spending and launch of a range of anti-suicidal drugs. However, emerging markets such as Asia Pacific are anticipated to record a high CAGR during the forecast period owing to high suicide rates. In addition, changing opinions regarding the stigma associated with mental health and growing awareness contributing to the increasing number of people visiting psychologists and psychiatrists are likely to propel the anti-suicide drugs market. Increased health care spending by governments, rising number of associations working on spreading awareness about suicidal tendencies also contribute to the growth of the anti-suicide drugs market. Key players in the anti-suicide drugs market include Allergan plc, AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline plc, H. Lundbeck A/S, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., NeuroRx, Inc., and Pfizer, Inc.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Global Periodic Fever Syndrome Market Estimated to Expand at a Robust CAGR over 2016 – 2024 Periodic Fever Syndrome are autoinflammatory diseases which cause episodic illness and do not have an infectious cause. Periodic Fever Syndrome are genetic and are also present during childhood. It is defined by the various genetic defects, by the clinical features of the syndrome, the affected part of the body, age of the patient and the area of the world from where the patient belongs. Treatment is based on the understanding of the gene defect. Despite similarities in symptoms, periodic fever syndrome has different patterns of inheritance, causes, length and frequency of ‘attacks.’ Some of the chronic condition associated with Periodic Fever Syndrome includes Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS), TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and Periodic Fever, Aphthous Stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Adenitis Syndrome (PFAPA). The symptoms of Periodic Fever Syndrome are cyclic in nature, coming and going, with the difference in severity. A sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/12190 Periodic Fever Syndrome affects many organs and tissues and has its own set of symptoms along with high temperature during attacks. Elevated serum levels of acute-phase reactants such as fibrinogen and serum amyloid A, leukocytosis and high level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are associated with periodic fever syndrome. Diagnostic tools and genetic test are available for patients with periodic fever. For some conditions such as Periodic Fever, Aphthous Stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Adenitis Syndrome (PFAPA), no genetic test are available yet. Hereditary periodic fever syndromes (HPFSs) are rare and is characterized by short and recurrent attacks. These attacks undergo remission without the use of antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, or immunosuppressive treatment. The patient feels healthy and is back to its daily routine until the next episode of periodic fever occurs. Previously, there was no approved medicine for the treatment of TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D Syndrome (HIDS)/ Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD). In September 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Novartis’ ilaris (canakinumab) expanded use for the treatment of these three rare and distinct types of Periodic Fever Syndromes.Treatment with oral anti-inflammatory drugs, e.g. corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), helps to control the symptoms but does not assist in the prevention of Periodic Fever Syndrome. Based on the Indication, the global periodic fever syndrome market is segmented into Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D Syndrome (HIDS) and TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS). Familial Mediterranean fever is less common in other ethnic groups compared to people of Eastern Mediterranean ancestry. TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome and Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D Syndrome (HIDS)/ Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) are less common among people and is estimated to affect around 1-2 people per million (Mn). Expansion of the clinical pipeline by companies and the greater focus on patient care and monitoring have been the major strategies adopted by major players to fuel growth within the forecast period of 2016-2024 in the global Periodic Fever Syndrome Market. Key challenges faced by the market is limited knowledge, and limited treatment options as periodic fever syndrome is a rare disease. There is difficulty in the diagnosis of periodic fever syndrome due to unrelated symptoms. On the basis of geography, global periodic fever syndrome market is segmented into five key regions i.e. North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is expected to dominate the global Periodic Fever Syndrome Market due to high demand from U.S. To view TOC of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/12190 Some of the major players in global Periodic Fever Syndrome Market are Novartis AG, Simvastatin, Merck & Co., Inc., Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Global Prophylactic Hepatitis B Virus Vaccines Market Expected to Witness a Sustainable Growth over 2016 – 2024 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is disease related to the liver. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection results in deaths due to liver cancer and liver failure. The hepatitis B vaccine is available for all age groups to prevent HBV infection. The disease is caused due to transmission of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) through contact with body fluids, blood and semen of an infected person. Hepatitis B disease can cause acute and later may turn to chronic disease if not treated at early stage. In 2015, WHO estimated that 240 Mn people are infected with chronic hepatitis B virus. Every year more than 780,000 deaths occur due to complexity of hepatitis B viral infection. This infection caused by chronic hepatitis B virus develops fulminant hepatitis B (autoimmune disorder), liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), liver failure which can be treated by a liver transplant. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) provides direction and support to prevent transmission through vaccination. However, there is a significant decrease in incidence of hepatitis B virus infection after introduction of hepatitis B vaccine. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/10571 The prophylactic hepatitis B virus vaccines market is expected to grow remarkably during the forecast period due to increasing prevalence and incidence of hepatitis B infection, increasing public awareness (Patient Education Programs), government initiatives for promotion and creating awareness about prophylactic hepatitis B vaccines. However, factors such as side effects of the vaccine, high costs incurred during research and development and macro-economic factors like stringent regulations can affect the market adversely. The global prophylactic hepatitis b virus vaccines market is classified on the basis of end use and geography. Ever since 1982, vaccines were available for prevention of hepatitis B viral infections and currently more than 1 Bn doses of HBV vaccines have been distributed worldwide.

Thus, increase in the population base in APAC is expected to contribute significantly to the growth of global prophylactic hepatitis B virus vaccines market. Geographically, the global prophylactic hepatitis b virus vaccines market is segmented into five key regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. North America dominates the global prophylactic hepatitis B virus vaccines market followed by APAC and Europe. According to WHO, globally more than 240 Mn people suffer from chronic hepatitis B viral infection and about 780,000 people die every year due to consequences related with HBV infection. Of these majority of people belong to developing nations of APAC, Latin America and Africa. The prevalence is considerably low in countries with high level of living standards such as the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Request to View Tables of Content @http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/10571 Some of the major players operating in the market for prophylactic hepatitis B virus vaccines are Merck & Co, Inc., Sanofi Pasteur, Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline to name a few. Vaccine market is an oligopolistic market in which the major players such as GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co, Inc. and Sanofi Pasteur are using cost leadership and differentiating strategy.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Aerosol Therapy Market Estimated to Flourish by 2024 – Persistence Market Research New York City, NY — (SBWIRE) — 04/20/2017 — Aerosol is suspension of liquid or solid particles in a carrier gas, which makes use of it for treatment of respiratory system related diseases. Different forms of drugs can be utilized for aerosol therapy such as solid particles, liquid particles, solutions, and suspensions. Until recently, aerosol therapy concentrated primarily on treatment of asthma and COPD for which, pressurized metered-dose inhaler device was used. However, the role of aerosol therapy is expanding beyond the initial focus. This expansion eliminated CFC-based traditional metered-dose inhalers devices. This will ultimately boost the market growth of aerosol therapy in the field of gene therapy, inhalation therapy and vaccination. Aerosol therapy is a natural and easiest way to treat asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and broncho pulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Aerosol therapy is also used to deliver insulin, vaccines of influenza and measles, and pain medications. Aerosol treatment therapy gives an excellent and cost-efficient drug delivery. This therapy is effective for patients who cannot use metered-dose inhalers; primary inhalation devices are produced that guarantee breath-actuated aerosol delivery with minimal side effects. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/11944 Aerosol therapy provides a fast and non-invasive way for treatment of lung disorders as the drug is delivered at the receptor site. Effectiveness of the therapy depends on how deeply aerosol particles infiltrate into the bronchial track and where the particles are deposited. A particle size under 2?m is ideal and can permeate up to the peripheral airways. That is why most commercially available aerosol devices produce droplets of roughly this size. As per the World Health Organization, about half the cases of asthma and COPD are due to hereditary weakness and the other cases are due to environmental factors. The effect of pollution is likely to intensify globally along with industrialization of areas, and increasing the number of vehicles. Current government activities and rising healthcare investments are drivers of aerosol therapy market, which would upgrade over the examination time frame.
