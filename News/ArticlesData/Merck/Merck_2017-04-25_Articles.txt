OnAIR NEWS SPORTS AFRICA WORLD OPINIONS POLITICS BUSINESS DIASPORA LIFESTYLE ENTERTAINMENT REAL ESTATE CLASSIFIEDS MEDIA MEMBERS News Archive Dossiers Elections 2016 General News Health News Local News Corruption Scandals References OnAIR Columns Archive Uniting to Combat NTDs programme sets record GNA 16 hours ago | Health  0  By Linda Asante-Agyei, Ghana News Agency Special Correspondent, Geneva Courtesy Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Geneva, April 25, GNA - The Guinness World Records has officially presented a certificate to the Uniting to Combat NTDs programme, for setting a charitable world record of donating 207,169,292 doses of drugs in multiple venues within 24 hours. The donation by 10 world pharmaceutical companies formed part of a global initiative to fight against Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The pharmaceutical companies were: Bayer, Eisai, Gilead, GSK, Johnson &Johnson, MSD, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Sanofi. Marco Frigatti, Head of Global Records Management Team, Guinness World Records, who made the presentation, said the record was now considered one of the largest medical donation programmes in the world, greatly assisting the WHO's Roadmap in its aim to reach 2020 control of NTDs. He noted that whilst more than the 207 million NTD medicines donated in a day represent less than 10 per cent of the total number of medicines, it was more than enough to set a Guinness World Record for most medication donated in 24 hours. 'The record title accomplished by Uniting to Combat NTDs, is a reflection of what impact collaboration, aligned strategies, and diverse partnerships can have on humanity,' he added. The Organisation's effort was recognised at the just ended week long Global Partners Summit, organised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) which also marked the fifth anniversary of the London Declaration, a historic document signed by leaders from diverse sectors committed to controlling, eliminating or eradicating 10 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) by 2020. Representatives of Member States, donor agencies, foundations, the private sector, academia and stakeholders and pharmaceutical companies participated in the summit. The 207 million drugs donated on January 30th represented just a small amount of the group's generosity. Since 2012, when United to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases signed a declaration to control or eliminate 10 of the worst neglected diseases, they have donated 7 billion treatments. NTDs are a group of debilitating infectious diseases such as elephantiasis, river blindness and trachoma that affect the world's poorest communities. Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General WHO, said several influential foundations also helped to make the incredible record possible. The idea behind this record is a noble one, inspired by a mission of the World Health Organization to eradicate 17 Neglected Tropical Diseases affecting thousands of helpless individuals in impoverished nations. By enlisting the help of healthcare companies who could donate the necessary medication to rehabilitate infected people, efforts by the Uniting to Combat NTDs alliance proved to be record-breaking. Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO said the record breaking was a reminder of the work necessary to deliver a treatment from a manufacturer's warehouse, from the officials who receive and organize donations, the NGOs and government programs who deliver it to remote communities, all the way to the heroic health workers who dedicate their lives to bringing those treatments to patients. Treatment donations at such a large scale have enabled extraordinary reach and impact by NTD programs around the world. Since the goal to eliminate 17 NTDs first began, more than 300 million people who required preventative treatment for at least one NTD five years ago no longer need it. Ms Thoko Elphick-Pooley, Director of the Uniting to Combat NTDs Support Centre who received the certificate, said the Guinness World Records title was shared by all the partners of the Coalition, whose collective work has helped to drive progress and lift the burden of NTDs from some of the most vulnerable people in the world. Over the past five years, Uniting to Combat NTD had contributed to significant improvement in fighting these severely infectious diseases, which affect millions. Compared to five years ago, companies were now donating hundreds of millions more treatments each year from one billion treatments in 2011 to more than 1.5billion treatments in 2015. Bill Gates expressed his excitement to celebrate the group that achieved this incredible feat, Uniting to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases, a coalition of drug companies, governments, health organizations, charities, and other partners who work to reduce the burden of tropical diseases that impact the world's poorest. He was grateful to the pharmaceutical companies that have been making the historic donations year after year and commended them and their partners for their efforts in ensuring that millions of people were receiving the medicines they needed to cure and protect them from these diseases. These diseases, he noted, were in retreat and the world was moving closer to the day when they would be eliminated altogether. 'Of course, all world records get challenged. And I for one will be thrilled for the day when this record for drug donations gets broken. So will the millions of families around the world who need them,' he added.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Cidara Therapeutics Announces Promotion of Taylor Sandison, M.D., M.P.H., to Chief Medical Officer SAN DIEGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CDTX), a biotechnology company developing novel anti-infectives including immunotherapies, today announced that Taylor Sandison, M.D., M.P.H., has been named chief medical officer (CMO) of the company. Dr. Sandison has been serving as acting chief medical officer of Cidara since September 2016. As CMO, he will continue to lead the global clinical development of CD101 IV, Cidara’s novel echinocandin antifungal, currently in Phase 2 clinical trials, as well as the expanding pipeline of anti-infective candidates generated by the company’s Cloudbreak™ immunotherapy platform. “Dr. Sandison’s depth and breadth of experience in anti-infective clinical development has been tremendously valuable to Cidara,” said Jeffrey Stein, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Cidara. “We are fortunate to have his clinical leadership as we advance our portfolio of drug candidates to treat serious fungal and bacterial infections.” Dr. Sandison has been with Cidara since October 2015, first serving as the company’s senior medical director. Prior to joining Cidara, he served as senior medical director at Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. from July 2014 to January 2015 and then, following Merck’s acquisition of Cubist, as senior medical director at Merck from February to October 2015. Dr. Sandison also has held positions at Trius Therapeutics and Novartis Diagnostics, and served as a faculty member in the Department of Medicine at both Stanford University and the University of Washington. Dr. Sandison received B.S. and B.A. degrees from Dartmouth College, and M.D. and M.P.H. degrees from the University of Washington. He completed residency training at the University of Colorado and fellowship training at the University of Washington, and holds board certifications in both infectious diseases and internal medicine. About Cidara Therapeutics Cidara is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing new anti-infectives that have the potential to transform the standard of care and save or improve patients’ lives. The company is currently advancing its novel echinocandin antifungal, CD101 IV, through Phase 2 clinical trials and is developing CD201, a bispecific immunotherapy, for the treatment of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. CD101 IV has improved pharmacokinetics and expanded utility across patient settings compared to existing echinocandins. CD101 IV is the only once-weekly therapy intended for the treatment and prevention of life-threatening invasive fungal infections. CD201 is the first drug candidate selected from Cidara’s novel Cloudbreak™ immunotherapy platform and is designed to specifically direct a patient’s immune cells to attack and kill bacterial pathogens. Cidara recently received a grant for up to $6.9 million from CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Accelerator) to advance the development of CD201. Cidara is headquartered in San Diego, California. For more information, please visit www.cidara.com.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 25, 2017 8:30am   Comments Share: MENLO PARK, Calif., April 25, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Versartis, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAR), an endocrine-focused biopharmaceutical company that is developing somavaratan, a novel, long-acting form of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) for growth hormone deficiency (GHD), today announced the appointment of Jay Stout, Ph.D., as Senior Vice President, Technical Operations. Dr. Stout will oversee the company's CMC, device and distribution as the Company prepares for the potential commercial launch of somavaratan. "Dr. Stout will play an integral role as we execute on our worldwide program for somavaratan and begin preparations for potential launches in the U.S., Europe and Japan. During his career, he has overseen the development of blockbuster drugs such as Amgen's Enbrel and Merck's Keytruda, and led the build out of the manufacturing systems and operations at Merck's plant in Switzerland," said Jay Shepard, Versartis President and CEO. "Twice-monthly somavaratan is positioned to be the first long-acting treatment to market for PGHD, and Jay's experience will help us ensure that we maintain a high-quality product and device, and that we are well prepared for successful distribution following approvals in our key markets." Dr. Stout is an industry veteran with 25 years of experience in the development and commercialization of biologics. He joins Versartis from San Bio, where he was Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and led the process development, manufacturing, and quality assurance groups supporting the development of an innovative stem cell therapy for patients recovering from stroke. Prior to San Bio, Dr. Stout served as Global Process Team Lead at Amgen for Enbrel, an anti-TNF product, and as Global Technical Lead at Merck for Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which was the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved in the United States and was awarded Breakthrough designation. Previously, he served as Executive Director of Merck's Center for Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing, and was Executive Director of Amgen's Manufacturing Sciences and Technology Group. Earlier in his career he started and directed Pfizer's Biologics Development Group. Dr. Stout received a Ph.D. in Chemistry and Biochemistry from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and a BS, MS in Chemistry from the University of Iowa. About Versartis, Inc. Versartis, Inc. is an endocrine-focused biopharmaceutical company initially developing somavaratan, a novel, long-acting form of recombinant human growth hormone in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of GHD in children and adults.

Takeovers were part of Fresenius's growth strategy under previous boss Ulf Mark Schneider, now leading Nestle. But his successor, former finance chief Stephan Sturm, is lifting the pace, having already bought a Spanish hospital chain for 5.8 billion euros since taking over in June. The latest deals are in keeping with Fresenius's focus on drugs that have lost patent protection, but also mark a foray into new dosage forms, therapeutic areas and biotech drugs for its Kabi unit, a maker of generic infusion drugs as well as tube feeding and blood transfusion equipment. Akorn will add products such as medical creams, ophthalmic drugs, oral liquids, ear drops, nasal sprays and respiratory drugs, where competition is relatively benign compared with standard pills and tablets. "We are putting Fresenius Kabi on track for an even more broadly based and strong sustainable growth beyond the current decade," said Sturm. The separate deal with Merck KGaA marks an entry into "biosimilar" copies of complex biologic drugs made from living cells, which Fresenius has previously shunned. "We've always said the regulatory environment would have to clear up before we invest in biosimilars. A lot has been done in that area in the recent past," Sturm added. Reuters earlier on Monday reported Fresenius was close to acquiring Akorn. In a deal that has the backing of Akorn's management and its largest shareholder, Fresenius will pay $34 per share and take on Akorn's net debt of about $450 million for a total price tag of $4.75 billion, Fresenius said late on Monday. It will be financed by a broad mix of euro- and dollar-denominated debt instruments. Berenberg analyst Tom Jones said the price tag of 12.4 times Akorn's core earnings (adjusted EBITDA) estimate for 2017 should not "give anyone any great cause for concern". He flagged some risks related to Akorn's older drugs that might draw scrutiny from U.S. healthcare regulators but was reassured by the buyer's "long history of doing M&A, and doing it relatively well". Fresenius shares were up 0.9 percent at 0750 GMT, broadly in line with the European healthcare index. For the Merck deal, Fresenius will pay an initial 170 million euros and up to 500 million in milestone payments tied to the achievement of drug development targets as none of Merck's biosimilar drugs have been launched yet. Merck also stands to receive single-digit percentage royalties on sales. Fresenius said it expected first revenues towards the end of 2019. It also said it was prepared to spend and invest up to 1.4 billion euros to build up the new business through 2022, including the upfront and milestone payments to Merck. Fresenius, with a market capitalisation of more than 40 billion euros, runs businesses ranging from kidney dialysis and drug manufacturing to hospital management. Group net debt as a multiple of core earnings will temporarily increase to about 3.3 after both transactions but is expected to return to about 3 at the end of 2018. Fresenius has for years enjoyed low borrowing costs because of its diversified businesses in an industry largely immune to swings in the business cycle. The buyer's main advisers on the Akorn deal were investment banks Credit Suisse and Moelis, as well as law firm Allen & Overy.

Takeovers were part of Fresenius's growth strategy under previous boss Ulf Mark Schneider, now leading Nestle. But his successor, former finance chief Stephan Sturm, is lifting the pace, having already bought a Spanish hospital chain for 5.8 billion euros since taking over in June. The latest deals are in keeping with Fresenius's focus on drugs that have lost patent protection, but also mark a foray into new dosage forms, therapeutic areas and biotech drugs for its Kabi unit, a maker of generic infusion drugs as well as tube feeding and blood transfusion equipment. Akorn will add products such as medical creams, ophthalmic drugs, oral liquids, ear drops, nasal sprays and respiratory drugs, where competition is relatively benign compared with standard pills and tablets. "We are putting Fresenius Kabi on track for an even more broadly based and strong sustainable growth beyond the current decade," said Sturm. The separate deal with Merck KGaA marks an entry into "biosimilar" copies of complex biologic drugs made from living cells, which Fresenius has previously shunned. "We've always said the regulatory environment would have to clear up before we invest in biosimilars. A lot has been done in that area in the recent past," Sturm added. Reuters earlier on Monday reported Fresenius was close to acquiring Akorn. In a deal that has the backing of Akorn's management and its largest shareholder, Fresenius will pay $34 per share and take on Akorn's net debt of about $450 million for a total price tag of $4.75 billion, Fresenius said late on Monday. It will be financed by a broad mix of euro- and dollar-denominated debt instruments. Berenberg analyst Tom Jones said the price tag of 12.4 times Akorn's core earnings (adjusted EBITDA) estimate for 2017 should not "give anyone any great cause for concern". He flagged some risks related to Akorn's older drugs that might draw scrutiny from U.S. healthcare regulators but was reassured by the buyer's "long history of doing M&amp;A, and doing it relatively well". Fresenius shares were up 0.9 percent at 0750 GMT, broadly in line with the European healthcare index. For the Merck deal, Fresenius will pay an initial 170 million euros and up to 500 million in milestone payments tied to the achievement of drug development targets as none of Merck's biosimilar drugs have been launched yet. Merck also stands to receive single-digit percentage royalties on sales. Fresenius said it expected first revenues towards the end of 2019. It also said it was prepared to spend and invest up to 1.4 billion euros to build up the new business through 2022, including the upfront and milestone payments to Merck. Fresenius, with a market capitalisation of more than 40 billion euros, runs businesses ranging from kidney dialysis and drug manufacturing to hospital management. Group net debt as a multiple of core earnings will temporarily increase to about 3.3 after both transactions but is expected to return to about 3 at the end of 2018. Fresenius has for years enjoyed low borrowing costs because of its diversified businesses in an industry largely immune to swings in the business cycle. The buyer's main advisers on the Akorn deal were investment banks Credit Suisse and Moelis, as well as law firm Allen &amp; Overy.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Apr 26, 2017 - Page 10　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Fresenius to buy Akorn for US$4.3bn in US expansion BIG BET:Fresenius said it plans to spend about 1.4bn euros on patient trials and other development costs for biosimilars before the unit breaks even in 2022 Bloomberg In just 10 months at the head of Germany’s Fresenius SE, chief executive officer Stephan Sturm has now inked the healthcare provider’s two biggest-ever deals. With the US$4.3 billion acquisition of Illinois-based generic drugmaker Akorn Inc, announced late on Monday, Fresenius will get a stronger foothold in the US, with access to a network of retail pharmacies and outpatient clinics as well as the hospitals where it has traditionally marketed its products. Akorn is to complement Fresenius’s Kabi medicines unit, which specializes in intravenous drugs. Fresenius, Europe’s biggest publicly traded healthcare provider, also made a smaller purchase on Monday to gain Merck KGaA’s portfolio of biosimilars, which are copycat versions of complex biotechnology drugs. It agreed to pay Merck 170 million euros (US$185.05 million), plus licensing fees and as much as 500 million euros in milestones. With the two transactions, Sturm is further expanding the global reach of the Bad Homburg-based group, bolstering the medicines unit that is key to profit growth — and making a long-term bet on biosimilars. The CEO had already agreed to spend more than US$6 billion on the Spanish hospital group IDC Salud Holding SLU, known as Quironsalud, last year in the company’s largest acquisition. The Akorn and biosimilar deals make even more sense together than individually, Sturm said on Monday. “Akorn brings us additional US market access to small and mid-sized clinics and retail pharmacies, and that access will be important for our biosimilars,” he said. Akorn’s biggest shareholder, John Kapoor, who owns a quarter of the stock, has agreed to support the deal, Fresenius said. Integrating the businesses would save about US$100 million each year, the companies predicted. The payoff for biosimilars might take longer. Fresenius said it expects to invest as much as 1.4 billion euros in patient trials and other development costs for biosimilars before the unit breaks even in 2022. The first sales are targeted for the end of 2019, with revenue expected to reach high triple-digit millions of euros by 2023, it said. Fresenius agreed to single-digit percentage royalties for Merck KGaA — which is a German company unrelated to Merck & Co in the US — based on sales. Merck KGaA is working on copies of complex biologic drugs for cancer and inflammatory diseases and had a treatment in late-stage tests for chronic plaque psoriasis that’s similar to AbbVie Inc’s Humira, one of the world’s best-selling medicines. Fresenius expects the transaction to lift earnings per share from 2019 on and plans to raise both euro and US dollar-denominated debt to finance the deal. The additional borrowings should remain “manageable,” analysts at Berenberg yesterday told clients in a note. This story has been viewed 1607 times. Comments will be moderated.

The deal with Akorn bolsters Fresenius' drugs business - which is mainly focused on generic sterile injectable drugs - by adding capabilities in other categories such as ophthalmic, respiratory and intranasal drugs that are considered somewhat resistant to both generic competition and the current downward pressure in drug pricing, particularly in the US. Fresenius is paying $34 per share for Akorn - valuing the company at $4.3bn - and will also assume around $450m in debt held by the US firm. Akorn is predicting that it will post around $1bn in sales this year and operating earnings of $363-401m, and Fresenius predicts that there will be cost savings of around $100m a year after the two companies are joined together. The chief executive of Fresenius' US subsidiary, John Ducker, said merging the two companies would "strengthen and diversify both businesses” and that Akorn adds "specialised expertise in development, manufacturing and marketing of alternate dosage forms, as well as access to new customer segments like retail, ophthalmology and veterinary practices". Rumours of a deal have been circulating for several weeks, and Akorn confirmed it was in negotiations with the German company earlier this month. Fresenius has been steadily bolting on new acquisitions under new chief executive Stephan Sturm, buying Spanish hospital chain Quironsalud for €5.8bn last September. The Merck agreement comes four years after Fresenius hived off its biotech business to the owners of Israeli group Neopharm, saying it wanted to narrow down its focus to intravenous drugs, infusion therapy, clinical nutrition and medical devices. Adding in Merck's biosimilars business takes it right back into the biotech sphere. Fresenius is paying €170m upfront for the portfolio - headed by a copy of AbbVie's $16bn blockbuster Humira (adalimumab) that has reached the phase III trial stage in chronic plaque psoriasis - as well as €500m in milestones. Merck kicked off its biosimilar programme in 2012 via an agreement with India's Dr Reddy's Laboratories at a time when the company was facing patent expiries on some big-selling products, and the move was considered a "plan B" to its usual focus on innovative drugs, said chief executive Stefan Oschmann recently.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Better Buy: Celgene Corporation vs. Merck & Co., Inc. Which drug stock wins in a head-to-head matchup between Celgene and Merck? Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Apr 25, 2017 at 7:04AM Two of the hottest cancer drugs around belong to Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). Celgene claims blockbuster blood cancer drug Revlimid, while Merck's Keytruda appears to be one of the most powerful lung cancer treatments ever. But which of these two drugmakers has the better stock for long-term investors? Here's how Celgene and Merck compare. Image source: Getty Images. The case for Celgene There's one compelling reason to buy Celgene stock. If you want growth, the biotech should be able to provide plenty of it. Celgene's top-selling Revlimid has been the primary key to the company's growth in the past. Sales for the blood cancer drug continue to increase at impressive levels. Sales for another blood cancer drug, Pomalyst, are also rising at a fast pace. The big story for Celgene's growth right now centers on Otezla. Sales for the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis drug more than doubled in 2016 to $1 billion. Otezla seems poised for even better performance in 2017. The possibility of approvals for other indications down the road could boost sales even higher. Celgene is counting on growing earnings by 22% per year through 2020. To achieve that goal, the company will need more winning drugs. That shouldn't be a problem. Celgene's pipeline is loaded with candidates with huge potential.  Ozanimod stands out as an especially promising prospect for the biotech. In February, Celgene reported positive results from a late-stage study evaluating the drug in treating multiple sclerosis. The company plans to submit ozanimod for approval in the indication by the end of 2017. Another late-stage study of the drug targeting ulcerative colitis is also in progress. The case for Merck Keytruda generated revenue of $1.4 billion last year for Merck. However, it could very well become the company's top-selling drug in just a few years. Analysts think Keytruda will rake in global sales of $7.7 billion by 2022. Three different approval decisions are expected for experimental diabetes drug ertugliflozin by the end of the year -- one as a monotherapy and the others as part of combination treatments.  Ertugliflozin should have blockbuster sales potential. Merck's pipeline also includes several other promising drugs and vaccines in late-stage development. However, there are a couple of more iffy prospects -- experimental cardiovascular drug anacetrapib and experimental Alzheimer's disease drug verubecestat.  The biggest challenge for Merck is that sales for some of its current big sellers are declining. Remicade and Nasonex face biosimilar competition. The company loses patent exclusivity for cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia this year. Due to an agreement Merck made, a generic version of Zetia is already on the market in the U.S. Investors should like Merck's dividend, which currently yields 2.99%. Although the drugmaker paid out more in dividends than it made in profit last year, Merck's strong cash flow should make its dividend pretty safe.  Better buy Merck beats Celgene on the dividend front, since Celgene currently doesn't pay a dividend. However, even with Keytruda, Merck can't come close to matching Celgene's growth prospects. Celgene stock also looks more attractively valued than Merck's, with the biotech's shares trading at 14 times expected earnings while Merck's shares trade at nearly 15 times expected earnings. In my view, Celgene is the better choice for investors. I expect Celgene to remain a huge winner for years to come with its solid current product lineup and deep pipeline.

Business Lake Forest-based Akorn bought by German drug giant for $4.3 billion Akorn William DeShazer / Chicago Tribune Sanjay Patel, a research scientist with Akorn Pharmaceuticals, works in a Skokie lab in 2012. Sanjay Patel, a research scientist with Akorn Pharmaceuticals, works in a Skokie lab in 2012. (William DeShazer / Chicago Tribune) Naomi KresgeBloomberg In just 10 months at the head of Germany's Fresenius, Chief Executive Officer Stephan Sturm has now inked the health-care provider's two biggest-ever deals. With the $4.3 billion acquisition of Lake Forest-based generic drugmaker Akorn, announced late Monday, Fresenius will get a stronger foothold in the U.S., with access to a network of retail pharmacies and outpatient clinics as well as the hospitals where it has traditionally marketed its products. Akorn will complement Fresenius' Kabi medicines unit, which specializes in intravenous drugs. Fresenius, Europe's biggest publicly traded health-care provider, also made a smaller purchase Monday to gain Merck KGaA's portfolio of biosimilars, which are copycat versions of complex biotechnology drugs. It agreed to pay Merck 170 million euros ($184.7 million), plus licensing fees and as much as 500 million euros in milestones. With the two transactions, Sturm is further expanding the global reach of its Bad Homburg-based group, bolstering the medicines unit that's key to profit growth -- and making a long-term bet on biosimilars. The CEO had already agreed to spend more than $6 billion on the Spanish hospital group IDC Salud Holding SLU, known as Quironsalud, last year in the company's largest acquisition. The Akorn and biosimilar deals make even more sense together than individually, Sturm said Monday. "Akorn brings us additional U.S. market access to small- and mid-sized clinics and retail pharmacies," he said. "And that access will be important for our biosimilars." Including debt, the Akorn deal has an enterprise value of $4.75 billion. Akorn's shares had jumped 30 percent since April 6, the day before Bloomberg News reported that Fresenius was considering a deal. They were little changed at $32.80 following the announcement Monday, after the U.S. markets closed. Akorn's biggest shareholder, John Kapoor, who owns a quarter of the stock, has agreed to support the deal, Fresenius said. Integrating the businesses will save about $100 million each year, the companies predicted.

A Georgia jury has awarded more than $20 million to a retired kindergarten teacher and her husband who claimed that a pharmaceutical company failed to include a warning on a prescription drug label that it would harmfully interact with another drug she was taking. The Telegraph reports that a Houston... (Associated Press) The payoff for biosimilars may take longer. Fresenius said it expects to invest as much as 1.4 billion euros in patient trials and other development costs for biosimilars before the unit breaks even in 2022. The first sales are targeted for the end of 2019, with revenue expected to reach high triple-digit millions of euros by 2023. Fresenius agreed to single-digit percentage royalties for Merck KGaA -- which is a German company unrelated to Merck & Co. in the U.S. -- based on sales. Merck KGaA is working on copies of complex biologic drugs for cancer and inflammatory diseases and had a treatment in late-stage tests for chronic plaque psoriasis that's similar to AbbVie's Humira, one of the world's best-selling medicines.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Tesaro Inc Bulls Need a Reality Check Has the market overestimated the odds of success for Tesaro's fancy new cancer drug? Cory Renauer (TMFang4apples) Apr 25, 2017 at 3:43PM Tesaro Inc (NASDAQ:TSRO) enjoyed its best summer ever last year, but lately, this biotech has had a case of the blues. Following a peak in February, the stock has lost more than a quarter of its value. Despite the recent slide, investors should remain braced for further downside. The company's recently launched cancer therapy has plenty of potential, but its success is far from certain. Available drugs of the same class from Clovis Oncology Inc (NASDAQ:CLVS), and AstraZeneca plc (NYSE:AZN) might put up more of a fight than expected. Plus, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has a candidate in development that could become an even bigger hurdle along Zejula's path to success. Image source: Getty Images. At the moment, it's hard to say whether or not Tesaro's drug will become a multibillion-dollar blockbuster. The company's market value, though, is still high enough that anything less than a rousing success could lead to serious losses from present levels. How expensive? Compared to established businesses with positive, predictable cash flows, pinning a price tag to Tesaro is nearly futile. Last year, the company lost $387.5 million, and management expects operating expenses to rise further this year. For companies still losing money, the price-to-sales ratio comes in handy. On average, biotech stocks trade at prices about 5.8 times higher than their annual sales. Measured with this yardstick, Tesaro's recent market cap of about $7.3 billion suggests around $1.2 billion in annual sales. To meet this expectation, Tesaro's salesforce has a lot of catching up to do. The company's only other FDA-approved drug generated just $6.9 million in product sales last year. Analysts expect Zejula to generate around $2 billion in sales each year at its peak, but it's important to realize that Tesaro needs to send a large chunk of that revenue to Merck. The big pharma sold Tesaro exclusive rights to develop and market Zejula years ago in return for milestone payments and a royalty percentage on global sales that will probably end up in the mid-teen percentage zone. Leadership qualities Expectations that Zejula will quickly become a leading treatment for ovarian cancer are the main pillars holding Tesaro's stock price aloft right now. The efficacy data supporting its approval is impressive, and you can't blame investors for expecting sales to rocket upwards. Image source: Getty Images. Ovarian cancer patients who relapsed after two or more rounds of standard chemotherapy survived much longer than those given placeboes during clinical trials supporting Zejula's approval. Those with inherited BRCA mutations, generally associated with more aggressive disease activity, survived 3.8 times longer without signs of disease progression. Progression-free survival among patients without the mutation was a surprising 2.4 times longer than the placebo group. These results led to a couple of important features on Zejula's broader-than-expected prescription label that should help it hit the ground running. First, AstraZeneca's and Clovis Oncology's drugs of the same class are indicated for patients with BRCA mutations, while Zejula can be administered regardless of BRCA mutation status. Zejula will also benefit from its place in the pecking order. Patients in the middle of their first round of chemo can take Tesaro's drug. According to their labels, oncologists shouldn't treat patients with Rubraca unless they've relapsed after two rounds of chemotherapy, and Lynparza becomes an option after three rounds. Focus on safety A broad prescription label could fuel Zejula's launch, but too many side effects could also hold it back. During trials leading to its approval, 29% of patients treated with Zejula experienced a loss of platelets severe enough to require hospitalization, versus just 5% during Rubraca's clinical trials. Destruction of red blood cells, or anemia, looks like an issue across all three PARP inhibitors. About 25% of clinical trial participants treated with Rubraca and Zejula reported severe anemia, and this figure dropped to 18% for trial patients treated with Lynparza. AstraZeneca has already submitted an application to the FDA that would push Lynparza from fourth to second-line treatment status. Plus, another expansion to the front of the line could be possible depending on results expected later this year. If Lynparza can move up in the pecking order, a superior safety profile could make it difficult for Zejula to contend with. Image source: Getty Images. Look out for the late entry Further ahead, all three currently available PARP inhibitors might be upended by related candidate Pfizer acquired last year. Talazoparib operates along the same lines as Zejula, but it appears effective at a far lower dosage. Lower dosages generally lead to fewer side effects, and available clinical trial data suggests this is the case for Pfizer's candidate. It's early still, but it looks like talazoparib patients report fewer side effects across the board. Pfizer has aimed its candidate at the breast cancer indication first, and we can expect data from a late-stage study intended to support its first new drug application this summer. Although it could be years before we know if Pfizer's talazoparib will compete with Zejula in the ovarian cancer indication, right now, the breast cancer indication looks like an uphill battle for Tesaro. The company recently scuttled a mid-stage breast cancer study testing the drug on its own. What this Fool believes It's still too early to know how well Tesaro's drug can compete with Clovis Oncology's and AstraZeneca's for ovarian cancer patients. Zejula's label is an advantage now that could quickly evaporate in light of incoming data from competitors. That's a big problem because any hints that Zejula might not meet lofty expectations will almost certainly send the stock plummeting from present levels. With Pfizer, Clovis, and AstraZeneca aiming to provide those hints, buying Tesaro stock at recent prices would be an exercise in anxiety management.

Trump Punts On Border Wall, Will Wait Until September → Thousands Sue Merck for Shingles Vaccine “Causing What It’s Supposed to Prevent” Posted on April 25, 2017 by Mary Free Thought Project – by Annabelle Bamforth Attorney Troy Bouk was recently interviewed by Ring of Fire’s Farron Cousins to discuss the shingles vaccine Zostavax, the issues related to its effectiveness and the problems that are associated with the product, including the fact that the drugmaker’s vaccine seems to cause the very affliction that it seeks to prevent — and, according to a massive lawsuit, thousands of victims agree.   While we have everyone from attorneys to biologists, to political scientists who contribute to the Free Thought Project, none of us are doctors, so we do not make recommendations about what you and your family should do in regards to vaccination. That being said, the drug makers have an incentive for you not to see this information which means it will not be reported on in the mainstream media as their advertising dollars are tied directly to these companies. So, we find that it is our duty to spread this information and with your help sharing it, we can have a massive effect. In the interview with Cousins, Bouk explained that Zostavax is made with a live strain of the shingles virus and described the complications that are associated with shingles. Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chicken pox. The varicella-zoster virus lies dormant in people who have had chicken pox, but sometimes the virus reawakens and produces shingles. The virus often manifests as a painful rash, and can also lead to encephalitis, vision loss and postherpetic neuralgia. Bouk said that the virus sometimes “tends to get into your central nervous system, and then, once in there, it wreaks some havoc by usually causing swelling which ends up with these other medical problems. That’s the situation with the vaccine itself, is that Merck hasn’t warned anyone about those indications.” Cousins asked Bouk about the effectiveness of Zostavax, to which Bouk replied: “The FDA has approved the vaccine for people 50 years of age and older, whereas the CDC only recommends that those individuals 60 years of age and older get it. The reason is that once you have had the Zostavax shot, the FDA says it only lasts for about four years. It’s not proven to last any longer than that. Let’s say you’re 55 years old. It may stay in your system till you’re 60, but you actually are at the greatest risk of getting shingles when you’re in your 60s. That’s why the CDC recommends that you really don’t get it until you’re in your 60s, because that’s probably when you’re going to need it the most.” Book’s claim regarding the CDC’s recommendation is indeed correct. According to the CDC’s website, the agency specifically advises Zostavax to be given to people aged 60 and older and does not provide a recommendation for people between the ages of 50 and 59. The CDC warns that people in the 50-59 age group who receive the Zostavax shot may lose the vaccine’s protection benefits by the time they reach age 60, stating that “adults vaccinated before age 60 years might not be protected later in life when the risk for shingles and its complications are greatest.” Despite the CDC’s caution against administering Zostavax to people under 60, the FDA approves the vaccine for people age 50 and older, and Merck uses the FDA’s approval to market the vaccine to that age group. Zostamax sales reached $749 million in 2015. The true efficacy of Zostavax is unclear. The CDC states that the drug “reduced the risk of shingles by 51%” based on a study of 38,000 people age 60 and up. Reuters reported that Zostavax’s effectiveness “varies between 18 and 70 percent, and it declines noticeably in older people.” A second shingles vaccine from drug manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline, Shingrix, may be available if the FDA approves their filing. Shingrix, a two-dose vaccine, distinguishes itself from Zostavax because it’s derived from a protein of the virus rather than a live strain. The efficacy of Shingrix is more impressive, as Reuters noted that “in clinical trials, GSK’s vaccine remained 90 percent effective in people over age 70, even four years after injections.” Merck has explicitly stated that those who receive the Zostavax vaccine “may still get shingles.” However, Bouk argued that some people may be contracting shingles as a side effect of the vaccine itself due to the live virus strain in the vaccine, not because people are experiencing shingles despite the vaccine. Bouk went on to say that “there is a study out there that shows that in 50% of the patients that actually get the vaccine, that sometimes they don’t get shingles — the virus goes straight to manifesting in the central nervous system. It’s possible that you could get the vaccine and get meningitis or encephalitis without ever actually exhibiting shingles.” Bouk advises that patients weigh the risks of Zostavax before receiving the vaccine. While GSK seeks approval of Shingrix, which could lead to their product edging out Zostavax, a large number of claims have been filed against Merck. The Mark J. Bern Partners law firm “is currently representing nearly 5000 claimants and has thousands more filings to follow.” Marc J. Bern said that his firm has been “investigating this drug for quite some time. We steadfastly believe in the merits of this litigation. This vaccination is at best 50 percent effective. Either it is not effective or it causes shingles or a host of other side effects.” Bern added that “what is most troubling is that Merck had a better alternative on hand when this product was released.” Read more at http://thefreethoughtproject.com/merck-shingles-vaccine-lawsuit/#K8WTqgqqZe2DpoOG.99 Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

The former president of the CDC is now the president of Merck’s vaccine division. Move along, folks….Nothing to see here.” Sadly, this HAS to happen until people finally figure it out. Unfortunately, this won’t be shown on MSM, which is what 90% of the nation STILL watches after the fraud-exposure in the last election.

He previously worked for Reuters Breakingviews, as well as the Financial Times and the Independent newspaper. Follow @hughes_chris Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 25, 2017 9:00 AM EDT FRESENIUS SE & CO KGAA +0.13 As of 2:40 AM EDT 74.86 EUR AKORN INC +0.37 At Closing, April 25th 33.09 USD Stephan Sturm can't resist a deal. After paying 5.8 billion euros ($6.3 billion) for Spain's top private hospital operator in January, the boss of Fresenius SE is having a two-transaction happy meal for dessert. He only stepped up to the helm in July, having steered plenty of other transactions for the company before that. Faith Healer Investors have warmed to Fresenius's M&A activity Source: Bloomberg Fresenius is to pay $4.3 billion for Akorn Inc., an Illinois-based maker of drugs ranging from injected medicines to nasal sprays. Strategically, it fits with Fresenius's skills in liquid medicines and opens up a new U.S. retail channel. The second deal, for rival Merck KGaA's so-called biosimilars operation, is a strategic departure into a new area of R&D. Biosimilars are copycat versions of drugs more complex than those usually imitated by generics. The Akorn purchase exploits the target's recent share-price weakness, caused by concerns about the competition facing its lead drug. At $34 per share, the offer is 41 per cent above Akorn's three-month average price. That high-looking premium is worth about $1.2 billion -- roughly double the estimated present value of the $100 million of yearly "mid-term" synergies anticipated by Fresenius. Falling Akorn Bid for the U.S. healthcare group comes after a tricky second half of 2016 Source: Bloomberg Despite that, the deal should deliver acceptable returns. Akorn shares were trading at the offer level as recently as July. Add the projected synergies to Akorn's forecast operating profit of $430 million for 2020 and the transaction should make an 8 percent post-tax return in three years, matching its cost of capital. Taken in isolation, the acquisition will boost earnings per share from 2019 onwards.  Might a rival such as Baxter International Inc. or Mylan NV gatecrash? It's possible, although both are busy elsewhere. The snag is that these financial gains are effectively subsidizing the more speculative Merck deal. Here, Fresenius is paying 170 million euros up front plus 500 million euros if milestones are met. The payback on this will be more distant. First sales won't come before 2019, with break-even in 2022. Until then, it's all cash burn. As a pair, the transactions dilute earnings until 2020. Investing in biosimilars is risky. It's a crowded space with an uncertain payback, as my colleague Max Nisen has observed. At least Fresenius has capped the total investment it will make in the biosimilars operation at 1.4 billion euros. Investors know the downside, and given Fresenius's impressive performance versus peers in the last two years, they can give management the benefit of the doubt.

The pharmaceutical companies were: Bayer, Eisai, Gilead, GSK, Johnson &Johnson, MSD, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Sanofi. Marco Frigatti, Head of Global Records Management Team, Guinness World Records, who made the presentation, said the record was now considered one of the largest medical donation programmes in the world, greatly assisting the WHO’s Roadmap in its aim to reach 2020 control of NTDs. He noted that whilst more than the 207 million NTD medicines donated in a day represent less than 10 per cent of the total number of medicines, it was more than enough to set a Guinness World Record for most medication donated in 24 hours. “The record title accomplished by Uniting to Combat NTDs, is a reflection of what impact collaboration, aligned strategies, and diverse partnerships can have on humanity,” he added. The Organisation’s effort was recognised at the just ended week long Global Partners Summit, organised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) which also marked the fifth anniversary of the London Declaration, a historic document signed by leaders from diverse sectors committed to controlling, eliminating or eradicating 10 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) by 2020. Representatives of Member States, donor agencies, foundations, the private sector, academia and stakeholders and pharmaceutical companies participated in the summit. The 207 million drugs donated on January 30th represented just a small amount of the group’s generosity. Since 2012, when United to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases signed a declaration to control or eliminate 10 of the worst neglected diseases, they have donated 7 billion treatments. NTDs are a group of debilitating infectious diseases such as elephantiasis, river blindness and trachoma that affect the world’s poorest communities. Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General WHO, said several influential foundations also helped to make the incredible record possible. The idea behind this record is a noble one, inspired by a mission of the World Health Organization to eradicate 17 Neglected Tropical Diseases affecting thousands of helpless individuals in impoverished nations. By enlisting the help of healthcare companies who could donate the necessary medication to rehabilitate infected people, efforts by the Uniting to Combat NTDs alliance proved to be record-breaking. Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO said the record breaking was a reminder of the work necessary to deliver a treatment from a manufacturer’s warehouse, from the officials who receive and organize donations, the NGOs and government programs who deliver it to remote communities, all the way to the heroic health workers who dedicate their lives to bringing those treatments to patients. Treatment donations at such a large scale have enabled extraordinary reach and impact by NTD programs around the world. Since the goal to eliminate 17 NTDs first began, more than 300 million people who required preventative treatment for at least one NTD five years ago no longer need it. Ms Thoko Elphick-Pooley, Director of the Uniting to Combat NTDs Support Centre who received the certificate, said the Guinness World Records title was shared by all the partners of the Coalition, whose collective work has helped to drive progress and lift the burden of NTDs from some of the most vulnerable people in the world. Over the past five years, Uniting to Combat NTD had contributed to significant improvement in fighting these severely infectious diseases, which affect millions. Compared to five years ago, companies were now donating hundreds of millions more treatments each year from one billion treatments in 2011 to more than 1.5billion treatments in 2015. Bill Gates expressed his excitement to celebrate the group that achieved this incredible feat, Uniting to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases, a coalition of drug companies, governments, health organizations, charities, and other partners who work to reduce the burden of tropical diseases that impact the world’s poorest. He was grateful to the pharmaceutical companies that have been making the historic donations year after year and commended them and their partners for their efforts in ensuring that millions of people were receiving the medicines they needed to cure and protect them from these diseases. These diseases, he noted, were in retreat and the world was moving closer to the day when they would be eliminated altogether. “Of course, all world records get challenged. And I for one will be thrilled for the day when this record for drug donations gets broken. So will the millions of families around the world who need them,” he added.

At the same time, the company will pay €170 million (£145 million) up front for Merck KGaA’s biosimilars business, plus potential milestone payments of up to €500 million and royalties on any eventual sales. Fresenius specialises in sterile injectable medicines. Buying Akorn adds a large range of generic drug products to Fresenius’s portfolio, including many injectables. It also brings expertise in developing various other dosage forms, including sterile eye drops; topical creams, ointments and gels; liquids and sprays. The company’s injectables expertise also makes it ideally placed to enter the growing market in biosimilars – generic versions of biological drugs – which are usually injected. Buying Merck’s biosimilars business gives the company an instant foothold in the market. Merck is selling the unit as part of its plan to refocus its in-house R&D on small molecules, while building drug development and support services, which it will provide to Fresenius under the terms of the deal.

By Meera Selva Published on 25. April 2017, 07:28 Audio Audio LISTEN Pdf Stephan Sturm, Fresenius CEO, on Monday announced his third takeover in seven months. Source: Reuters. German healthcare giant Fresenius bought US generic drug maker Akorn in a $4.3 billion deal announced late Monday. The Frankfurt-listed company, the world’s largest provider of dialysis services through its listed subsidiary Fresenius Medical Care, said it had separately acquired the biosimilars unit of its German rival Merck. In buying Akorn, Fresenius will expand its business in areas like medical creams, ophthalmic drugs, ear drops and nasal spray. Fresenius will pay $34 per share and take on Akorn’s net debt of around $450 million, meaning the total takeover sum is around $4.75 billion. Two weeks ago, it said it was in talks to buy the Nasdaq-listed rival. Fresenius, which is valued at €40.7 billion, or $44.3 billion, on the Frankfurt stock exchange, has been snapping up businesses for more than a decade. In September, it announced its biggest takeover ever, buying Spain’s largest private hospital operator, Quirónsalud, for €5.8 billion. It marked the first expansion of its hospital operations outside Germany, where Fresenius is the largest publicly listed owner of medical centers. The deal with Merck KGaA, which is not related to US peer Merck & Co., will cost Fresenius an initial €170 million and up to €500 million in additional payments, which will depend on the achievement of certain targets. The takeover will give Fresenius exposure to the complex market of copies of biopharmaceuticals. Fresenius Chief Executive Stephan Sturm, who took the top job in July 2016, told Reuters the company had been reluctant to invest in biosimilars until the regulatory environment became clear – something he said had now happened.

Robinson Most established cancer treatments – from chemotherapy and radiation to the 200 drugs out there – have one thing in common. They're all more or less "one size fits all" treatments, procedures, or regimens. But the most exciting, promising discoveries – and biggest profits – are made on the frontier. And on the frontier of cancer research is a treatment under development that's going to disrupt the field for the next several decades. I'm talking about powerful "bespoke" cancer treatments for every patient, using their own bodies to boot. Not only will this improve and save lives, but it'll also crack open a market worth $25 billion by 2025. It really is a revolutionary development. But the "Buy" call I'm making today is still trading at "pre-revolutionary" prices… The Cancer Fight's "A-Bomb" I can't overstate this. The treatment I'm going to tell you about, as well as the most important company pioneering it, will change cancer treatment the way the atomic bomb changed the face of warfare moving forward. This biotech "A-bomb" is called immunotherapy, or "IO" to insiders. And it's progressing rapidly. The technique is straight out of science fiction. Immunotherapy uses a patient's own immune system – "tweaking" it by either suppressing, stimulating, or enhancing an immune response – to effect a desired change. It can be used to vaccinate people and fight microbial diseases, reduce allergic reactions, suppress the sometimes devastating response to organ transplants, and, most promisingly, help patients destroy their own tumors and beat cancer. Right now there are more than 1,000 drug trials underway for IO candidates. The trials mainly involve patients whose cancer isn't responding to traditional therapies like chemo or radiation and who are now terminal. There's good reason to move with haste. The longer we live, the more likely we are to develop some form of cancer. It's always been a killer, but it's becoming a huge problem. In addition to the human cost, traditional cancer treatments run about $10,000 a month, according to U.S. News & World Report. Insurers, doctors, researchers, regulators, and patients are all on the same page here. That's been an important driver in IO's development. I'm bullish on this entire segment, and I'm not alone. Barclays expects IO to be worth $25 billion by 2025 – just eight years. Now let me show you the company I think will reap the most benefit from this "frontier" research. The Biotech at the Top of the IO Pyramid Incyte Corp. (Nasdaq: INCY) is one of the leading IO and next-generation oncology drugmakers in the marketplace today. Its first major drug to market was Jakafi, a drug used to fight a bone-marrow cancer called myelofibrosis, where bone marrow is replaced with scar tissue. That makes the spleen swell as it takes over the job of making red blood cells. Jakafi uses inhibitors to slow or stop the conversion of the bone marrow. Approved in 2011, Jakafi is well on its way to becoming a blockbuster drug – a drug with annual sales above $1 billion. Last year, the drug hit more than $800 million in sales, almost doubling 2015 sales. Last summer, Jakafi got Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat graft-versus-host disease, which happens to some patients that get a bone-marrow transplant. That's another big market that should certainly push Jakafi over the $1 billion mark. Incyte Chief Financial Officer David Gryska raised his peak sales estimate for Jakafi to $2 billion earlier this year. Iclusig is another drug in Incyte's arsenal. Physicians use it to treat two types of leukemia. And in phase 3 trials begun late last year, epcadostat is looking to treat patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma. And just recently Incyte paid a $12 million milestone payment to Calithera Biosciences Inc. (Nasdaq: CALA) for its work on the development of small-molecule anticancer IO drugs. This makes Incyte a serious player in several IO niches. And most of the spaces it occupies don't have any competitors yet because the field is still new to many biotech firms. That's a significant advantage, too. That's why this innovative biotech going to pad your portfolio – and put you on the road to wealth – very nicely. How and Why to Buy This firm has returned 104% over the past 12 months with far, far less volatility than the S&P 500. What's more, compared to the Big Pharma firms working on IO, it's about a tenth of the size by market cap. Its IO portfolio will help it – and its stock price – grow much faster than that of its larger, more diversified competition. Its small size and full pipeline make it a nigh-irresistible takeover target, too. This company could very easily be scooped up (at a whopping premium) by, say, a Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) or a Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) looking to buy an IO operation with approved, proven products. Margins are solid, and earnings continue to grow at a healthy pace. The company beat earnings-per-share expectations in February, coming in a penny over forecasts, and is likely to do the same again in May. The stock has made gains of 26% since its last report. Incyte has plenty of cash in the bank for any new acquisitions or drug trials that need it. The stock recently dipped 20%, but I'm happy to see that. It means you're getting a great stock with blockbuster potential – and it's on sale. It will likely consolidate here until its next big leg up, so I'm comfortable recommending everyone grab this company at current market prices, with an eye to using the Cowboy Split – picking up more on any unexpected pullbacks.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dr. Jan Holmgren Receives 2017 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award WASHINGTON, April 25, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — Tonight, the Sabin Vaccine Institute (Sabin) will honor Dr. Jan Holmgren with the 2017 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award. Dr. Holmgren will be recognized for his pioneering contributions to oral vaccine research and mucosal immunology, as well as his leadership in the discovery of the world’s first effective oral cholera vaccine. Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease transmitted through contaminated food or water. For young children and those without rapid access to treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, severe cases of the disease can be fatal in as little as six hours. Cholera kills an estimated 93,500-143,000 people worldwide and sickens 2.9-4.3 million annually, due in large part to lack of clean water and inadequate sanitation. Jan Holmgren, MD, PhD, developed the world’s first effective oral cholera vaccine, and has continued to make significant contributions to the field through his pioneering research on oral vaccines and mucosal immunology. In the 1980s and ’90s, Dr. Holmgren and colleagues at the University of Gothenburg developed the Dukoral™ oral cholera vaccine, which became the first internationally licensed and World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified oral cholera vaccine. The vaccine, which was tested in large field trials in Bangladesh, Peru, Mozambique and Zanzibar, reduced cholera by 85 to 90 percent in the first six months after vaccination. Unlike previous injected cholera vaccines, which conferred weak protection for only a few months, Dukoral™ oral cholera vaccine continued to provide immune protection for three years after immunization. In addition, the vaccine gives indirect protection to unvaccinated individuals by reducing their risk of exposure to cholera. Dr. Holmgren and his colleagues later shared their data and technology with researchers in Vietnam and India to facilitate the development of a lower-cost version of the oral cholera vaccine, Shanchol™, which is now prequalified and stockpiled for international use by the WHO. Shanchol™ was used as part of the response to the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti, which helped avert an estimated 315,000 cholera cases and 3,100 deaths. Dr. Holmgren continues to provide technical assistance to manufacturers in India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Korea to produce the vaccine, as well as further improved versions at a much lower cost. Dr. Holmgren is currently a professor of Medical Microbiology at the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden; he is also the founding director of the University of Gothenburg Vaccine Research Institute. „Jan not only led development of the first oral cholera vaccine, he has also devoted his career to the continuous improvement of these vaccines,” said Amy Finan, chief executive officer of the Sabin Vaccine Institute. „Throughout Jan’s distinguished career he has collaborated with scientists in endemic countries to save lives in the most challenging conditions. Their innovative work resulted in an improved vaccine that is being used in Somalia today to stem a deadly outbreak of cholera. „Jan exemplifies the values of Albert Sabin and shares his commitment to protect every child from vaccine-preventable diseases. It’s an honor to present Jan with this year’s Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award.” „I am honored to receive this award commemorating Dr. Sabin’s extraordinary legacy,” said Dr. Holmgren. „It is indeed a great honor for me to have been chosen to join the distinguished group of eminent scientists who have received this award before me.” The 2017 Gold Medal Award ceremony will take place at the National Institute of Science Building in Washington, DC. His Excellency Björn Lyrvall, ambassador of Sweden to the United States, will offer remarks at the ceremony, along with Amy Finan and Bruce Gellin, president of global immunization at Sabin. The ceremony will also convene leaders in academia, government, industry and civil society.  Awarded annually since 1994, the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award recognizes a researcher who has made extraordinary contributions in the field of vaccinology or a complementary field. The award commemorates the legacy of Dr. Albert B. Sabin, who developed the oral live virus polio vaccine that is widely heralded with making a huge contribution to the near eradication of polio worldwide. This year marks the 24th year that the Sabin Vaccine Institute has bestowed the award. Past participants of this award include D.A. Henderson, Maurice Hilleman, Roger Glass and Ciro de Quadros, who later served as Sabin’s executive vice president and director of Vaccine Advocacy and Education. The 2017 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award ceremony was made possible in part by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Johnson & Johnson Innovation; Merck & Co., Inc.; Pfizer; PaxVax, Inc.; Sanofi Pasteur; Takeda Vaccines, Inc.; Affinivax; and Genocea Biosciences. About The Sabin Vaccine Institute  The Sabin Vaccine Institute is a leading advocate for expanding vaccine access and uptake globally, advancing vaccine research and development, and amplifying vaccine knowledge and innovation. Unlocking the potential of vaccines through partnership, Sabin has built a robust ecosystem of funders, innovators, implementers, practitioners, policy makers and public stakeholders to advance its vision of a future free from preventable diseases.

In the 1980s and '90s, Dr. Holmgren and colleagues at the University of Gothenburg developed the Dukoral™ oral cholera vaccine, which became the first internationally licensed and World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified oral cholera vaccine. The vaccine, which was tested in large field trials in Bangladesh, Peru, Mozambique and Zanzibar, reduced cholera by 85 to 90 percent in the first six months after vaccination. Unlike previous injected cholera vaccines, which conferred weak protection for only a few months, Dukoral™ oral cholera vaccine continued to provide immune protection for three years after immunization. In addition, the vaccine gives indirect protection to unvaccinated individuals by reducing their risk of exposure to cholera. Dr. Holmgren and his colleagues later shared their data and technology with researchers in Vietnam and India to facilitate the development of a lower-cost version of the oral cholera vaccine, Shanchol™, which is now prequalified and stockpiled for international use by the WHO. Shanchol™ was used as part of the response to the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti, which helped avert an estimated 315,000 cholera cases and 3,100 deaths. Dr. Holmgren continues to provide technical assistance to manufacturers in India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Korea to produce the vaccine, as well as further improved versions at a much lower cost. Dr. Holmgren is currently a professor of Medical Microbiology at the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden; he is also the founding director of the University of Gothenburg Vaccine Research Institute. "Jan not only led development of the first oral cholera vaccine, he has also devoted his career to the continuous improvement of these vaccines," said Amy Finan, chief executive officer of the Sabin Vaccine Institute. "Throughout Jan's distinguished career he has collaborated with scientists in endemic countries to save lives in the most challenging conditions. Their innovative work resulted in an improved vaccine that is being used in Somalia today to stem a deadly outbreak of cholera. "Jan exemplifies the values of Albert Sabin and shares his commitment to protect every child from vaccine-preventable diseases. It's an honor to present Jan with this year's Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award." "I am honored to receive this award commemorating Dr. Sabin's extraordinary legacy," said Dr. Holmgren. "It is indeed a great honor for me to have been chosen to join the distinguished group of eminent scientists who have received this award before me." The 2017 Gold Medal Award ceremony will take place at the National Institute of Science Building in Washington, DC. His Excellency Björn Lyrvall, ambassador of Sweden to the United States, will offer remarks at the ceremony, along with Amy Finan and Bruce Gellin, president of global immunization at Sabin. The ceremony will also convene leaders in academia, government, industry and civil society.  Awarded annually since 1994, the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award recognizes a researcher who has made extraordinary contributions in the field of vaccinology or a complementary field. The award commemorates the legacy of Dr. Albert B. Sabin, who developed the oral live virus polio vaccine that is widely heralded with making a huge contribution to the near eradication of polio worldwide. This year marks the 24th year that the Sabin Vaccine Institute has bestowed the award. Past participants of this award include D.A. Henderson, Maurice Hilleman, Roger Glass and Ciro de Quadros, who later served as Sabin's executive vice president and director of Vaccine Advocacy and Education. The 2017 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award ceremony was made possible in part by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Johnson & Johnson Innovation; Merck & Co., Inc.; Pfizer; PaxVax, Inc.; Sanofi Pasteur; Takeda Vaccines, Inc.; Affinivax; and Genocea Biosciences.

Sabin Gold Medal Award. Dr. Holmgren will be recognized for his pioneering contributions to oral vaccine research and mucosal immunology, as well as his leadership in the discovery of the world's first effective oral cholera vaccine. Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease transmitted through contaminated food or water. For young children and those without rapid access to treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, severe cases of the disease can be fatal in as little as six hours.

These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) -- the most advanced form of fatty liver disease -- has few medical treatment options but several candidate drugs were in the spotlight at the International Liver Congress. Note that early studies highlighted a recombinant version of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a variant of FGF19 genetically engineered to remove tumorigenic factors, and an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor, although experts cautioned that none is ready for prime time. AMSTERDAM -- Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) -- the most advanced form of fatty liver disease -- has few medical treatment options but several candidate drugs were in the spotlight at the International Liver Congress, the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). Early studies highlighted a recombinant version of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a variant of FGF19 genetically engineered to remove tumorigenic factors, and an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor. Experts said all three have some promising aspects but cautioned that none is ready for prime time. "It's very early," commented Dominique-Charles Valla, MD, of Hôpital Beaujon in Clichy, France, who co-moderated a late-breaker session at which data for two of the drugs were presented. "These have been given for 3 months or 16 weeks or 12 weeks," he told MedPage Today -- not enough to detect any long-term side effects. As well, he said, the focus is on reducing hepatic fat -- and all three drugs showed promising effects in that arena -- but investigations so far don't clearly demonstrate much effect on other aspects of NASH, such as inflammation and fibrosis. So it's not obvious yet how the effects of the drugs will "translate into prevention of the complications" of NASH, such as liver cirrhosis, Valla added. In a Phase 2 trial, investigators tested two subcutaneous doses of BMS-986036, the recombinant FGF21, against placebo in 74 patients with biopsy-proven NASH and fibrosis at stages 1, 2, or 3, according to Arun Sanyal, MD, of Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. In its natural form, the growth factor has a short half-life, but for this trial it was pegylated to allow dosing at longer intervals -- 10 mg daily or 20 mg weekly, Sanyal reported. In earlier studies, the molecule has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity, reduce lipogenesis, and lower levels of a marker of fibrosis, he said. For this trial, the primary goal was to measure the change in hepatic fat fraction after 16 weeks of therapy. On that score, both doses outperformed placebo, with mean absolute reductions of 6.8% for the daily dose, 5.2% for the weekly dose, and 1.3% for placebo. But BMS-986036 -- "That's a mouthful; we have to find a better name," Sanyal said -- also did better than placebo at improving biomarkers of fibrosis, metabolic parameters, and markers of hepatic injury. The drug appeared safe and well tolerated, he added, with no serious treatment-related adverse events, no deaths, and no discontinuations owing to adverse events. Another fibroblast growth factor variant was highlighted in a second presentation in the late-breaker session. FGF19 has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma and so investigators have been working with a gene-engineered variant that lacks the tumorigenicity of the natural compound, according to Stephen Harrison, MD, of Pinnacle Clinical Research in Live Oak, Tex. In animal models of NASH, the variant -- dubbed NGM282 -- normalized liver enzymes, reduced the fatty liver activity score, and appeared to have anti-fibrotic activity, all without causing tumors, Harrison said. Harrison and colleagues enrolled 82 patients with a minimum absolute liver fat content of 8% by magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and randomly assigned them to get a placebo or either 3 or 6 mg of the drug, delivered subcutaneously, every day for 12 weeks. As in the study by Sanyal and colleagues, patients had to have biopsy-proven NASH and fibrosis at stages 1, 2, or 3. The Phase 2 study's primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who had a drop in liver fat of at least 5% from baseline, Harrison said, with normalization defined as an absolute fat content of less than 5% after treatment. At 12 weeks, 7% of placebo patients had reached the primary endpoint, compared with 74% and 85% of those on the 3- and 6-mg doses, respectively, Harrison reported. No placebo patients reached a normal liver fat content, compared with 25.9% of those getting 3 mg of NGM282 and 42.3% of those getting 6 mg. Overall, he added, 89% of treated subjects had a clinically relevant change (defined as greater than 30%) in relative fat content compared with placebo. As well, Harrison said, there were "significant and rapid reduction in multiple markers" associated with resolution of NASH and fibrosis. The drugs were well-tolerated, he said: Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild, with only one serious event -- a case of pancreatitis -- that was regarded as possibly related to the therapy. Earlier in the meeting, a researcher reported on another approach -- blocking an enzyme dubbed acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) that plays a central role in de novo lipogenesis in NASH. In a small, uncontrolled "proof of concept" study of just 10 patients, the ACC inhibitor GS-0976 reduced lipogenesis, liver fat, liver stiffness, and markers of fibrosis, according to Eric Lawitz, MD, of the Texas Liver Institute in San Antonio. The 10 patients had a clinical diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a liver fat content of 10% or more by MRI-PDFF, liver stiffness of at least 2.88 kPa by magnetic resonance elastography, and no cirrhosis. After 12 weeks of daily oral therapy with 20 mg of the drug, Lawitz said, investigators saw "significant improvements" in the efficacy endpoints, without any treatment emergent adverse events, deaths or dropouts. The researchers noted a tendency to increased triglycerides and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol that appeared to be returning to baseline values over time, but Lawitz said longer follow-up will be needed to see what's going on. A placebo-controlled trial of the drug is currently under way, he said. The study by Sanyal and colleagues was supported by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Sanyal disclosed relationships with Sanyal Bio, Genfit, Hemoshear, Tiziana, Natural Shield, Indalo, Durect, Pfizer, Nimbus, Nitto Denko, Lilly, UptoDate, Elsevier, Quintiles, Salix, Conatus, Gilead, Novartis, Galectin, Merck, Astra Zeneca, Boehringer Knoll, Tobira, Intercept, Novo Nordisk, Malinkrodt, Octeta, Cumberland, Akarna, Syntlogic, Ardelyx, and Covance.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Thyroid Cancer Therapeutics Pipeline Analysis, 2017 by P&S Market Research The thyroid cancer therapeutics pipeline is expected to witness considerable growth due to increase in the demand for the targeted drug formulation for the treatment of cancer. Though less number of drugs are available for thyroid cancer treatment, an increasing awareness regarding cancer treatment and high demand for safe and effective medications are driving the therapeutics pipeline. According to the National Cancer Institute, a part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, thyroid cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the thyroid gland, a small gland at the base of the neck that produces hormones. It most commonly occurs in people aged 30-year-old. Women are two to three times more likely to develop this thyroid cancer, as compared to men. Thyroid cancer is usually treatable, and in many cases, can be cured completely, although it can sometimes come back after treatment. There are four main types of thyroid cancer; papillary thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer (hurthle cell thyroid cancer), medullary thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer. Explore Report at: www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/thyroid-cancer-t… The pipeline drugs for the treatment of thyroid cancer contains Ofranergene obadenovec, a Phase II drug candidate of Vascular Biogenics Ltd. It is an intravenously administered dual-action, anti-angiogenic and vascular disrupting agent. It is a targeted anti-cancer gene-therapy agent, which consists of a non-replicating adenovirus vector with a pre-proendothelin-1 promoter that encodes a Fas-Chimera transgene apoptotic receptor in tumor blood vessel endothelial cells, leading to their apoptosis. This mechanism retains activity, regardless of baseline tumor mutations or the identity of the pro-angiogenic factors secreted by the tumor. Vascular Biogenics is using vascular targeting system technology platform, which controls gene expression to either promote or prevent angiogenesis to target various diseases. The drug induces specific anti-tumor immune response, followed by entry of CD8 T-cells and apoptosis of tumor cells. Eisai Inc. is currently conducting a trial of lenvatinib in radio-iodine for refractory differentiated thyroid cancer in China, which is currently in Phase III clinical development. Request for Table of Content at: www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/thyroid-cancer-t… Many pharmaceutical companies are focusing on the research and development of thyroid cancer therapeutics pipeline drug candidates, collaborating with one another. In February 2015, Biologics, Inc., an integrated oncology services company, reported that it was selected by Eisai Co. Ltd. as a specialty pharmacy provider within Eisai’s limited distribution network for Lenvima (lenvatinib). Browse Other Related Report at: www.psmarketresearch.com/industry-report/pharmaceuticals Some of the key players having a pipeline of thyroid cancer therapeutics include Eisai & Co. Ltd., Exelixis, Amgen, AstraZeneca plc, Merck & Co., Inc., Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, and F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG.

Surgical treatments and radiation therapy, though effective at treating primary tumors, are not found to be successful in detecting metastatic tumor cells and those flowing in the bloodstream, making treatment of these cancer cells very difficult. Cancer is one of the largest causes of death worldwide and finding leads to cure or control the disease is one of the primary goals of governments globally. Global Protein in Oncology Market: Segmentation Obtain Report Details: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/proteins-oncology-mark… The global proteins in oncology market has been segmented based on protein type and geography. Protein types include recombinant non-glycosylated proteins, recombinant glycosylated proteins and recombinant peptides. Geographically, North America and Europe lead the global proteins in oncology market thanks to the very stringent regulatory environment for clearing the products. Asia-Pacific countries such as China and India are estimated to be the fastest-growing markets. South Korea and Brazil are also poised to register high growth in the coming years due to boost in biosimilars market. The services that can be provided in the global proteins in oncology market include contract research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations. Global Protein in Oncology Market: Drivers and Restraints Worldwide increase in the prevalence of cancer and the rising awareness of the therapeutic and commercial opportunities offered by new oncology treatments have provided a major incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to pursue the development of new agents for the treatment of cancer. Proteins or peptide drugs are usually required to be administered only by injection due to their large and labile nature. Peptide drugs are used effectively in monitoring various tumors and related therapies. They selectively are known to bind responsive versus unresponsive tumors. Therefore, this advantage associated with the use of peptides assists their use in assessing tumor response and evaluating its effectiveness in cancer therapy. The main challenge for the newer generation of recombinant drugs seems to be the new route of administration, new formulations and consequently even higher efficiency and safety. Though the parenteral route of administration is the most common, there are advances being made to deliver medicines through the oral route, which is considered to be the most preferred one due to better patient compliance. Recently new research has demonstrated that attaching a cancer killer protein to white blood cells annihilates metastasis. Isolation of a protein named as TRAIL by researchers at Cornell University in the U.S. demonstrated killing of cancer cells on contact. The TRAIL protein is binded with leukocytes (white blood cells) that are present across the bloodstream. The cancer cell is essentially known to kill itself when it comes in contact with TRAIL protein. The mechanism has been surprising and unexpectedly effective as compared to targeting the cancer cells with liposomes.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: America's 12 Most Charitable Companies These healthcare, bank, and tech companies are leading the way in investing in global change. Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Apr 25, 2017 at 6:05AM Image source: Getty Images. Whether through cash donations or through providing their products and services free of charge to people and nonprofits in need, corporations across America are making billions of dollars' worth of charitable donations each year. Here's the list of the nation's 12 most charitable companies, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy's mid-2016 report (registration required), along with some of the causes these companies are giving to.  Image source: ExxonMobil. 12. ExxonMobil First up is the oil and gas behemoth ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), which gave more than a quarter of a billion dollars in 2015 alone (the most recent year for which data is available). The company has spread its donation efforts across various areas, from education to global health initiatives to malaria prevention. ExxonMobil also has a program to donate $500 on behalf of an employee for every 20 hours the employee volunteers.  Goldman Sachs employees volunteering in Bangalore in 2016. Image source: Goldman Sachs. 11. Goldman Sachs Investments banks are driven solely by greed, and they only care about lining executives' pockets -- right? That's the image of big banks that's often played up in the media, but it turns out that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is one of the biggest corporate givers in America. Goldman Sachs Gives, a donor-advised fund, has given more than $1 billion in grants to thousands of nonprofits in 80 countries worldwide.  A community knowledge center in Kenya. Image source: Cisco Systems. 10. Cisco Systems Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is already using its data and cloud computing technology to help develop "smart cities" around the world in places like Copenhagen, Denmark. But the company also uses its funding and technology to build "Community Knowledge Centers" in areas that lack internet access, such as in Kenya, as shown in the image above. These centers allow local residents to connect to online resources such as skills training. Cisco's management believes investments like these are critical to ending the cycle of poverty in these areas. Image source: Wells Fargo.  9. Wells Fargo While Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has certainly come under public scrutiny over its problematic account-selling tactics in the last few months, the company has long been regarded as one of the most charitable for-profit organizations in the U.S. Wells Fargo supports hundreds of local nonprofits in the cities where it operates, as well as large national nonprofits that are involved in financial education and much more. Wells Fargo management announced its 2020 economic goals last year, and they include $500 million in philanthropic spending by 2020.  Image source: Eli Lilly. 8. Eli Lilly and Company Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is the maker of important pharmaceutical products like Prozac and insulin. It's also the parent of the Eli Lilly Foundation, which awards grants for philanthropic initiatives in the areas of quality healthcare in low- and middle-income countries, as well as public education in the United States, with an emphasis on science and math. The foundation also matches millions of dollars' worth of employee donations each year.  Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. 7. Bristol-Myers Squibb Healthcare company Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) says on its website that it seeks "to improve the health outcomes of populations disproportionately affected by serious diseases" through increasing healthcare worker capacity and integrated medical care. The company recently announced a $50 million donation (matched with another $50 million from other donors) in a new public-private partnership with the government of Botswana to treat children with cancer and blood disorders.  Microsoft employee Prashant Gupta in India. Image source: Microsoft.  6. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates is not only one of the wealthiest people in the world, but also one of the most charitable -- he's the co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has donated tens of billions toward the cause of improving healthcare and relieving poverty around the world. Microsoft seems to hold similar values, as the company notes that it donates nearly $2 million per day in cash and equipment. Its philosophy is that technology can help humankind overcome some of the greatest challenges it faces. In the image above, a Microsoft employee helps farmers in India use technology to better time their crops during a drought.  Google Cardboard headset being used to help veterans virtually attend a Veterans Day Parade. Image source: Google.org. 5. Alphabet Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) philanthropic efforts include donating its own services -- for example, it gives nonprofits free access to Google Adwords for advertising, and trains military veterans to learn new technologies as they transition to civilian jobs. The company also launches bold technological ventures that are meant to take dramatic steps toward solving the world's problems. For instance, the company provides funding and expertise to groups that can use the Google Earth tool to fight global deforestation.  Image source: Wal-mart. 4. Walmart Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is the world's largest retailer by sales, and it also holds the spot as the largest donor in the retail industry. The company gives cash and product donations to nonprofits working on labor benefits, food for those in need, and much more. The company also sends aid to communities in the U.S. that are affected by natural disasters. In December it gave $250,000 toward relief and recovery efforts in areas of Tennessee that were being ravaged by wildfires. Image source: Merck & Company. 3. Merck & Company Merck & Co., a leading healthcare company, donates both cash and medical resources, particularly within the communities where the company operates. It also aids in global initiatives to take on cancer, diabetes, hepatitis C, and HIV/AIDS. The company notes on its website that it donated $1.7 billion worth of products in 2015 alone.  Image source: Getty Images. 2. Gilead Sciences The second-largest corporate donor as of 2016 is Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD). Gilead is one of the leaders in HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals. Its products include a medication called Truvada, a form of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) that blocks the virus from spreading between individuals. The company's top philanthropic priority is ending the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and making life-saving healthcare accessible in areas of need.  Image source: Pfizer.  1. Pfizer The most charitable Fortune 500 company in America is Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). This healthcare company, which makes famous drugs like Viagra and Lipitor, seeks to build out healthcare opportunities for those in underserved communities worldwide through "people, products, and funding." As part of this goal, the company helps to fund programs that increase awareness of non-communicable diseases and that remove barriers preventing women and children from receiving sufficient care.  If there's any doubt as to whether it's possible to reward shareholders while leading the nation in charitable giving, consider that the shares of these 12 companies gained an average of 78% over the last five years, compared with 67% for the S&P 500. We look forward to seeing which companies have increased their own corporate giving when the next edition of The Chronicle of Philanthropy's most charitable companies is released.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The manufacturer's illustration of how the drug, Keytruda, stops cancer cells hiding from the immune system Photo: Supplied Medsafe has just approved the immunotherapy drug as a first treatment for some lung cancer patients, raising pressure for it to be funded. Lung cancer is diagnosed in about 2200 New Zealanders a year and more than 1600 people die from it each year. Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, was funded for those with advanced melanoma last year, along with the similar immunotherapy drug Opdivo, following a major campaign by patients with the skin cancer. Medsafe has approved use of Keytruda as a first or second-line treatment for those with PD L1 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Lung cancer patients say it's their turn now for better-funded treatments for the cancer. 'It's transformed my quality of life' Hanmer Springs woman Kate Hodges, 47, has a different kind of NSCLC and is on another drug, known as osimertimib, or Tagrisso, funded by a drug company on compassionate grounds. Kate Hodges. Photo: Supplied. She said it was working, and every time a scan confirmed that, she was intensely grateful. "It's one tablet a day and it's transformed my quality of life and is seemingly keeping the cancer at bay." She was not a smoker and it came out of the blue. "I didn't see it coming at all, and you're totally blown away in a sea of internet, googling and trying to find out what to do and getting advice from everywhere, and it takes a long time to come out of the fog of how to go forward." Mrs Hodges said new drugs were becoming available, and it was important patients were able to get them, in the hope they would provide a benefit. She added lung cancer "certainly always seems to be the poor cousin" to other cancers. "We'd just like our fair share of the research, the time and effort into getting these drugs into the New Zealand health system and getting them funded really because we're equally as important as people with other cancers". The chief executive of the Lung Foundation, Philip Hope. Photo: Supplied. The Lung Foundation's chief executive Philip Hope said lung cancer had been the biggest killer since 1968. "It's largely been under-funded and unspoken [about], and we've only begun to observe lung health month, which is November." It was time more was done for those with the cancer, he said. "Survival rates in New Zealand are poor in comparison to Australia and the US, simply because we don't have the range of funded treatments here in New Zealand. Keytruda is a classic example. That's funded abroad, it's not funded in New Zealand [for lung cancer]." Mr Hope said chemotherapy had been the standard of care when surgery was not possible, but a recent clinical trial showed a 40 percent improvement in survival with Keytruda compared to chemo. "That is a good option for treatment for patients that have the PD L1 expression of non-small-cell lung cancer, and I guess we're advocating and we're asking that this treatment be funded in New Zealand." One in five people diagnosed with lung cancer had never smoked, he said. Merck Sharp and Dohme, or MSD New Zealand's director Paul Smith was optimistic Pharmac would assess it soon. "The process is not particularly transparent, you often don't know where you are in the process. "But what we're seeing from them at the moment is really encouraging, that they are looking at this really as quickly as they can."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dr. Jan Holmgren Receives 2017 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award WASHINGTON, April 25, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Tonight, the Sabin Vaccine Institute (Sabin) will honor Dr. Jan Holmgren with the 2017 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award. Dr. Holmgren will be recognized for his pioneering contributions to oral vaccine research and mucosal immunology, as well as his leadership in the discovery of the world's first effective oral cholera vaccine. Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease transmitted through contaminated food or water. For young children and those without rapid access to treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, severe cases of the disease can be fatal in as little as six hours. Cholera kills an estimated 93,500-143,000 people worldwide and sickens 2.9-4.3 million annually, due in large part to lack of clean water and inadequate sanitation. Jan Holmgren, MD, PhD, developed the world's first effective oral cholera vaccine, and has continued to make significant contributions to the field through his pioneering research on oral vaccines and mucosal immunology. In the 1980s and '90s, Dr. Holmgren and colleagues at the University of Gothenburg developed the Dukoral™ oral cholera vaccine, which became the first internationally licensed and World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified oral cholera vaccine. The vaccine, which was tested in large field trials in Bangladesh, Peru, Mozambique and Zanzibar, reduced cholera by 85 to 90 percent in the first six months after vaccination. Unlike previous injected cholera vaccines, which conferred weak protection for only a few months, Dukoral™ oral cholera vaccine continued to provide immune protection for three years after immunization. In addition, the vaccine gives indirect protection to unvaccinated individuals by reducing their risk of exposure to cholera. Dr. Holmgren and his colleagues later shared their data and technology with researchers in Vietnam and India to facilitate the development of a lower-cost version of the oral cholera vaccine, Shanchol™, which is now prequalified and stockpiled for international use by the WHO. Shanchol™ was used as part of the response to the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti, which helped avert an estimated 315,000 cholera cases and 3,100 deaths. Dr. Holmgren continues to provide technical assistance to manufacturers in India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Korea to produce the vaccine, as well as further improved versions at a much lower cost. Dr. Holmgren is currently a professor of Medical Microbiology at the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden; he is also the founding director of the University of Gothenburg Vaccine Research Institute. "Jan not only led development of the first oral cholera vaccine, he has also devoted his career to the continuous improvement of these vaccines," said Amy Finan, chief executive officer of the Sabin Vaccine Institute. "Throughout Jan's distinguished career he has collaborated with scientists in endemic countries to save lives in the most challenging conditions. Their innovative work resulted in an improved vaccine that is being used in Somalia today to stem a deadly outbreak of cholera. "Jan exemplifies the values of Albert Sabin and shares his commitment to protect every child from vaccine-preventable diseases. It's an honor to present Jan with this year's Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award." "I am honored to receive this award commemorating Dr. Sabin's extraordinary legacy," said Dr. Holmgren. "It is indeed a great honor for me to have been chosen to join the distinguished group of eminent scientists who have received this award before me." The 2017 Gold Medal Award ceremony will take place at the National Institute of Science Building in Washington, DC. His Excellency Björn Lyrvall, ambassador of Sweden to the United States, will offer remarks at the ceremony, along with Amy Finan and Bruce Gellin, president of global immunization at Sabin. The ceremony will also convene leaders in academia, government, industry and civil society.  Awarded annually since 1994, the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award recognizes a researcher who has made extraordinary contributions in the field of vaccinology or a complementary field. The award commemorates the legacy of Dr. Albert B. Sabin, who developed the oral live virus polio vaccine that is widely heralded with making a huge contribution to the near eradication of polio worldwide. This year marks the 24th year that the Sabin Vaccine Institute has bestowed the award. Past participants of this award include D.A. Henderson, Maurice Hilleman, Roger Glass and Ciro de Quadros, who later served as Sabin's executive vice president and director of Vaccine Advocacy and Education. The 2017 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award ceremony was made possible in part by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Johnson & Johnson Innovation; Merck & Co., Inc.; Pfizer; PaxVax, Inc.; Sanofi Pasteur; Takeda Vaccines, Inc.; Affinivax; and Genocea Biosciences. About The Sabin Vaccine Institute  The Sabin Vaccine Institute is a leading advocate for expanding vaccine access and uptake globally, advancing vaccine research and development, and amplifying vaccine knowledge and innovation. Unlocking the potential of vaccines through partnership, Sabin has built a robust ecosystem of funders, innovators, implementers, practitioners, policy makers and public stakeholders to advance its vision of a future free from preventable diseases.

By: Reuters | Published: April 25, 2017 5:33 PM The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent, with energy and healthcare stocks supporting gains while earnings were mixed. British shares edged up on Tuesday as a strong Europe-wide market rally after the first round of the French election dissipated, with investors’ focus back on corporate results which indicated tougher times ahead for consumer goods stocks. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent, with energy and healthcare stocks supporting gains while earnings were mixed. The FTSE’s rise on Monday had been modest compared to European and French benchmarks, with investors flagging obstacles ahead for the UK market. “The UK has its own esoteric risks at the moment, with its own election and the bigger ongoing Brexit issue,” said Laura Foll, Henderson UK equity income and growth manager. Restaurant and pub owner Whitbread, and floor-covering retailer Carpetright, were the top blue-chip and small-cap fallers after their results were hit by slowing sales growth, adding to evidence of deteriorating UK consumer confidence. Whitbread was on course for its worst day since the Brexit vote last June, down 7.4 percent after it indicated tougher times were ahead, saying it expected consumer confidence to dip this year. You may like to watch: Its Costa Coffee chain saw like-for-like sales fall, and margins down 0.8 percentage points year on year due to a rise in the minimum wage. “[The valuation] feels fairly full to us, reflecting embedded value within Whitbread’s core two brands, but with waning UK consumer dynamics likely to cap near-term growth prospects,” Panmure Gordon analysts said. Small-cap Carpetright, Britain’s biggest floor covering retailer, fell 7.3 percent after the firm said full year profit would be at the lower end of market expectations, also citing tougher trading conditions. Some of the stocks that rallied most on Monday fell back on Tuesday, with Kingfisher, whose French exposure made it especially sensitive to the post-election rally, down 1.4 percent. Miners Antofagasta, Anglo American and Randgold Resources fell 1.3 to 2 percent, holding back the blue-chips. Goldman Sachs cut Anglo American to neutral in a broader downgrade of the mining sector, citing the commodity price outlook. Healthcare stocks Hikma and Shire were top gainers, up 1.3 to 1.7 percent, tracking gains in the Europe-wide pharma sector after Fresenius picked up the pace of dealmaking with its acquisiton of U.S. Akorn Inc and an arm of Merck. The mid-caps touched a new record high in early trading, up 0.2 percent. Chemicals firm Elementis jumped 5.6 percent after its trading update showed strong growth in personal care and energy business sectors, and it reiterated aims to grow operating profit across its three segments this year.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent, with energy and healthcare stocks supporting gains while earnings were mixed. The FTSE's rise on Monday had been modest compared to European and French benchmarks, with investors flagging obstacles ahead for the UK market. "The UK has its own esoteric risks at the moment, with its own election and the bigger ongoing Brexit issue," said Laura Foll, Henderson UK equity income and growth manager. Restaurant and pub owner Whitbread, and floor-covering retailer Carpetright, were the top blue-chip and small-cap fallers after their results were hit by slowing sales growth, adding to evidence of deteriorating UK consumer confidence. Whitbread was on course for its worst day since the Brexit vote last June, down 7.4 percent after it indicated tougher times were ahead, saying it expected consumer confidence to dip this year. Its Costa Coffee chain saw like-for-like sales fall, and margins down 0.8 percentage points year on year due to a rise in the minimum wage. "[The valuation] feels fairly full to us, reflecting embedded value within Whitbread's core two brands, but with waning UK consumer dynamics likely to cap near-term growth prospects," Panmure Gordon analysts said. Small-cap Carpetright, Britain's biggest floor covering retailer, fell 7.3 percent after the firm said full year profit would be at the lower end of market expectations, also citing tougher trading conditions. Some of the stocks that rallied most on Monday fell back on Tuesday, with Kingfisher, whose French exposure made it especially sensitive to the post-election rally, down 1.4 percent. Miners Antofagasta, Anglo American and Randgold Resources fell 1.3 to 2 percent, holding back the blue-chips. Goldman Sachs cut Anglo American to neutral in a broader downgrade of the mining sector, citing the commodity price outlook. Healthcare stocks Hikma and Shire were top gainers, up 1.3 to 1.7 percent, tracking gains in the Europe-wide pharma sector after Fresenius picked up the pace of dealmaking with its acquisiton of U.S. Akorn Inc and an arm of Merck. The mid-caps touched a new record high in early trading, up 0.2 percent. Chemicals firm Elementis jumped 5.6 percent after its trading update showed strong growth in personal care and energy business sectors, and it reiterated aims to grow operating profit across its three segments this year.
