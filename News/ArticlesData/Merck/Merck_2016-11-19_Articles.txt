Continue Reading Below Some dividend stocks don’t need you to babysit them. These stocks are typically the kind of companies with proven business models that can withstand storms and continue to reward you richly. With the markets turning volatile following Donald Trump’s victory, you might want to consider investing in such top-quality dividend stocks now that allow you to sleep well at night even during periods of uncertainty. We asked three of our contributors to pick one such low-risk dividend stock each. Here’s why Merck & Co.(NYSE: MRK), Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE: ED), and Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD) made the list. Patent headwinds aside, this drugmaker offers a solid dividend George Budwell(Merck & Co.): Merck & Co.is arguably a classic battleground stock at the moment, but that doesn’t mean income investors should flat-out avoid it. More From Fool.com The heart of the matter is that the drugmaker is facing a parade of top-selling products likeRemicade losing patent protection within the next year or so. In the same breath, though, Merck now controls the high-value non-small cell lung cancer checkpoint inhibitor market, following Keytruda’s recent breakthrough in the front-line setting and the FDA green-lighting a more favorable label in the second or later-line settings. The big picture is that Keytruda now appears to have enough juice to power the drugmaker through these patent headwinds, and even keep the company’s top line flat next year. While a flat top line generally doesn’t inspire confidence, Merck does offer a respectable yield of 2.89%, a proven track record of increasing its annual payout, and a robust clinical pipeline. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT All told, Merck has a rich tradition of rewarding patient shareholders, even during the toughest times in its history. So, this dividend-paying big pharma stock shouldn’t keep you awake at night if you do decide to grab some shares. This defensive dividend stock is a great choice! Neha Chamaria (Consolidated Edison): During uncertain times like these, I’d root for a dividend stock that belongs to a defensive industry where earnings are fairly stable regardless of the state of the economy. Consolidated Edison, a regulated utility that provides essentials like electricity and gas services to millions of customers, is one such stock to consider. Under the revenue decoupling mechanism, Con Ed’s revenues are essentially fixed at predetermined rates and not linked to its electricity or gas sales volumes. Any differences in the actual and predetermined revenues are adjusted on the customers’ accounts. In other words, Con Ed knows how much revenue it will generate in advance, eliminating volatility in its earnings. It is this stability in earnings that has allowed Con Ed to increase its dividend for 42 consecutive years. ED Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Going forward, Con Ed has outlined an aggressive multibillion-dollar program to upgrade and modernize its electricity and gas network over the next 20 years. At the same time, Con Ed is pumping billions into renewable solar and wind energy projects while tapping potential opportunities in battery storage and electric-vehicle infrastructure. I believe these investments should help Con Ed expand its customer base and boost earnings on decoupled revenues to reward you with higher dividends. With the stock down 8% in three months and offering a dividend yield of 3.8%, this is a good opportunity for income investors. You couldn’t babysit this ETF even if you tried Evan Niu, CFA (Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF): I’m picking of my favorite personal holdings, the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF. Charles Schwab jumped into the proprietary ETF game many years ago, and it has continued expanding its offerings ever since. I’ve long been a fan of the company’s ETFs, and not just because I used to work there. As a broad-based indexed ETF, the underlying portfolio is diverse and invests across a wide range of sectors, with consumer staples being the largest sector, following by tech. Since it’s diversified and passively managed, you really don’t have to babysit this ETF. Since it’s passively managed, the expense ratio is an incredibly affordable 7 basis points. The returns over time speak for themselves: SCHD Total Return Price data by YCharts. The current yield is approximately 2.7%, which may not sound like a whole lot compared to some of the other yields that are out there, but the point, here, is that the payout is extremely safe and reliable given the underlying diversified portfolio of large, mature companies. I’ve held this ETF for years, and it has been a consistently solid performer that requires absolutely no maintenance to follow. If you want a stock you don’t have to babysit, the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF is one to consider. A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world’s biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn’t miss a beat: There’s a small company that’s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

(MSD), in partnership with the TICBioMed, provider of business support in eHealth, has launched on Oct. 25, 2016 a competition dubbed “The MSD Innovative Factory Challenges” across all countries within the EEMEA region aimed at encouraging entrepreneurs and ideators create innovative eHealth solutions for 3 of the most important needs in the region. The competition is divided into three categories, namely INNOREP, EDUCARE, and SMARTSTOCK. According to MSD, all the technology-enabled solution entries must be cost effective, easy to implement, user friendly and educational. They also should promote a smooth patient-practitioner relationship and adherence to treatments. As defined, the scope of INNOREP is creating impressive experiences for healthcare professionals so as to improve and support the interaction of sales reps with healthcare professionals in an ethical, unique, engaging and memorable manner. The expected output is to collect innovative, engaging and impactful solutions to carry out the dialogue (facultative discussion) with healthcare professionals and stakeholders, and using the knowledge gained and compiled in product studies, clinical papers and scientific materials. Under EDUCARE, the solutions presented should be on getting the most out of the waiting room — the need to fill in the dead time spent in the waiting room of a practitioner that will add value to patients regarding how to improve their overall health, learn about their condition and improve or manage their pathologies. The aim is to find an easy and motivational solution for the patients, the clinical staff and the hosting institution. It should engage and foster followers across all generations. These solutions would be presented in two different/main areas of scope: Advertisement • Diabetes: offering essential information about the disease and how to manage it (highlighting medication adherence) • Vaccines: the importance of keeping up and following a timetable of mandatory vaccines. The expected output of the proposals is to raise the knowledge on specific health topics in a useful and memorable way, having a persuasive value proposition for the main stakeholders, cost-effectiveness and of an easy implementation and maintenance. In the third challenge, SMARTSTOCK, the entry solutions should address the rapid growth of pharmacy chains and their prescription filling in the EEMEA Region, and optimize the operational efficiency in medicine stock management. MSD is looking for solutions that will raise communication exchange channel empowering PoS of Pharmacy chains to engage in a proactive communication flow of sharing their internal stocking data with suppliers. The deadline for the submission of entries is Dec. 20, 2016. Nine finalists will be selected from the pool of all participants, three from each category, by early January 2017. Each one of the selected finalists has the opportunity to showcase his/her proposal and debate with MSD experts how to co-create together. Each one will also have the chance to earn $3,000 if selected as the most articulate challenger and has the most innovative solution. The final presentation will be held in Dubai on Feb. 1, 2017.

Small-company stocks bucked the downward trend and continued to climb, and bond yields rose to their highest level in a year. Drugmakers like Merck and biotech company Amgen took some of the biggest losses Friday. Weak results from Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch hurt retailers as investors kept a close eye on the upcoming holiday season. Small companies including regional banks continued to make large gains. Those stocks have risen sharply since the presidential election last week and are now at record highs. “Some of the proposals that (President-elect Donald) Trump has promoted, specifically deregulation and also some of his trade proposals, are better for small companies than potentially they are for large ones,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 35.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,867.93. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 5.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,181.90. The Nasdaq composite touched a record high early on, but turned lower and gave up 12.46 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,321.51. That’s not a big loss, but the major indexes hadn’t fallen that much since before the presidential election. Still, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished substantially higher this week after their big gains the week before. But indexes of smaller companies, like the Russell 2000 and the S&P 600, did better. They are on 11-day winning streaks and have hit all-time highs. Among small-company stocks, mortgage lending service company LendingTree added $6.80, or 7.3 percent, to $100 and coal miner Cloud Peak Energy rose 79 cents, or 15.8 percent, to $5.79. Losses for drug companies weighed down health care stocks. Botox maker Allergan retreated $8.20, or 4.1 percent, to $191.78 and biotech giant Amgen fell $2.13, or 1.4 percent, to $145.23. Hepatitis C drugmaker Gilead Sciences shed 96 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $74.62. Drug company stocks are coming off their biggest weekly gain in two years. The stocks had been falling in the months leading up to the election because investors worried that under a Hillary Clinton presidency, the federal government would take steps to rein in drug prices. Those kinds of steps are less likely under a Trump presidency and a Republican-controlled Congress. The dollar continued to climb. It’s near one-year highs against the euro and six-month highs against the yen. The dollar rose to 110.63 yen from 109.89 yen. The euro fell to $1.0599 from $1.0626. The dollar hasn’t been this strong since early 2003. Nixon of Northern Trust said that’s affecting big multinational companies because it can hurt their sales outside the U.S., but it’s less of a problem for smaller, domestically-oriented companies. Investors continued to sell U.S. government bonds at a rapid clip, and bond prices wobbled and turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.34 percent from 2.30 percent. Bond prices have fallen hard since the election and yields are now at their highest in a year. Teen clothing company Abercrombie & Fitch plunged $2.33, or 13.8 percent, to $14.60 after it reported weak sales and a smaller profit than analysts had expected. Gap’s said fewer people visited its stores heading into the holiday season. Its stock gave up $5.10, or 16.6 percent, to $25.61. Sporting goods Hibbett Sports retailer cut its annual forecasts after a weak third-quarter report. It dropped $4.90, or 10.8 percent, to $40.40. Shoppers are not buying as many clothes and moving toward discount chains. That trend continued as discount retailer Ross Stores rose $2.47, or 3.8 percent, to $68 after it posted a better-than-expected profit and sales. Companies that sell common household products are also moving lower. Procter & Gamble gave up $1.07, or 1.3 percent, to $82 and drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance slumped 72 cents to $83.27. Those companies have fallen since the election as investors buy companies that could benefit more from faster economic growth. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 27 cents to close at $45.69 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, added 37 cents to $46.86 a barrel in London. Energy companies traded higher. Chevron rose $1.08, or 1 percent, to $109.20 and ConocoPhillips jumped $1.15, or 2.6 percent, to $44.76. Gold fell $8.20 to $1,208.70 an ounce. Silver lost 15 cents to $16.62 an ounce. Copper dipped 2 cents to $2.47 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.46 a gallon. Natural gas climbed 14 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $2.84 per 1,000 cubic feet. France’s CAC 40 fell 0.5 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain dipped 0.3 percent. The German DAX lost 0.2 percent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.6 percent as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country’s big exporters. South Korea’s Kospi shed 0.3 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent. ———— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay     Tags: percent, companies, cents, company, stocks, continued, Other stories from today: Dakota Access oil pipeline developer: No rerouting Volkswagen to shed 30,000 jobs, cutting costs after scandal Drugmaker losses pull stocks lower     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   If you are traveling for Thanksgiving, when is the best time to go?

Wall Street equities took a breather after rising dramatically since Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the presidential election last week. While the three major indexes closed higher for the second week in a row, the rally lost some steam this week as investors awaited more information to support their bets that Trump could succeed in passing proposals to lift infrastructure spending and reduce taxes. “I see the market kind of churning here because it’s had a very decent move,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “Trump’s policies continue to be just rhetoric because none of it has been enacted.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 35.89 points, or 0.19 percent, to 18,867.93 while the S&P 500 dropped 5.22 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,181.9. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 12.46 points, or 0.23 percent, to 5,321.51 after hitting a record of 5346.8. The Nasdaq’s biggest drags came from technology companies such as Alphabet Inc. and drug firms including Amgen. Six of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors closed lower. Losses in shares of Allergan Plc and Merck were the biggest drags on the S&P health sector, which led the decliners. The health index pared its post-election lift but was still 1.8 percent higher than Nov. 8, even after Friday’s drop of 1.2 percent. Only five of the indexes stocks ended higher. Consumer staples fell 0.4 percent, weighed down by a 1.3 percent fall in Procter & Gamble. The S&P energy sector was the second-best performer with a 0.5 percent increase as producers added to rig count, suggesting that they might be expecting a demand boost, Polarci said. Traders are pricing in an 83 percent chance for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December, according to Thomson Reuters data. The S&P financial sector ended up 0.08 percent, and has risen 10.8 percent since the U.S. election, boosted by the prospect of higher interest rates and lighter regulation. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Friday he was leaning toward supporting a December increase and that the real question would be the Fed’s rate path in 2017. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George said that while she supports raising rates, the U.S. central bank must do so only gradually. The comments added to Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s Thursday statement that the rate hike could come “relatively soon.” Gap fell 16.6 percent and Abercrombie & Fitch fell 13.8 percent. Both retailers warned of a challenging end-of-year quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 253 new highs and 30 new lows. About 6.69 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well below the 8.02 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

V Geetanath » B Rishikesh Bahadurdesai » Zahid Rafiq » TOPICS  Weekend Being health medical research Pharmaceutical majors, including top names in India, commit to a new road map to combat antimicrobial resistance. Putting proper effluent treatment protocols in place would be a good start Something quite significant happened this last quarter that is likely to have a huge impact on the healthcare industry globally. Ahead of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) High-Level Meeting on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), 13 pharmaceutical companies came up with a new road map, assigning to themselves four key commitments that they will deliver by 2020 to reduce resistance. Companies that have signed up to the scheme include some of the top names in drug production, including Pfizer, Merck, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline and Allergan, and Indian drug makers Cipla and Wockhardt. The presentation they made was cognisant of, and allowed itself to be guided by the principles identified and agreed upon in the industry declaration made at the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year, and reflect the companies’ intent to continue to proactively contribute to the global efforts to address AMR. One of the key commitments on the list was to “reduce the environmental impact from the production of antibiotics, including a review of the companies’ manufacturing and supply chains, and work with stakeholders to establish a common framework for assessing and managing antibiotic discharge”. While awareness on use/misuse and abuse of antibiotics is common knowledge, as is the impact of dosing poultry with antibiotics, the environmental impact of antibiotics-manufacturing companies not treating their wastes has scarcely been discussed at any length or seriousness thus far.Towards sustainable antibiotics As they begin delivering on their commitments, a fresh hope emerges in a world that is literally down to its last effective bunch of antibiotics with the emergence of resistance even to last-line drugs. Changing Markets, a global organisation working in the environment sector, came up with a report in October detailing just how grave the problem is. The report, ‘Superbugs in the Supply Chain: How pollution from antibiotics factories in India and China is fuelling the global rise of drug-resistant infections’, exposed the “occurrence of resistant bacteria surrounding the pharma manufacturing plants and maps out the supply chain which delivers antibiotics from the dirty factories where they are produced to patients in Europe and the United States”. The field investigation took place in June 2016 and subsequent water samples were analysed under the supervision of Dr. Mark Holmes from the University of Cambridge. They were found to contain high levels of drug-resistant bacteria at sites in three Indian cities: Hyderabad, New Delhi and Chennai. In total, out of the 34 sites tested, 16 were found to be harbouring bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Anurag Roy, business unit director of DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals, says the situation is indeed grave in the country. While his company has made a voluntary commitment to sustainable antibiotics and spends higher to deliver on this goal, he says currently without regulatory systems in place, the responsibility rests with the manufacturer. Five of their production units globally, including in India, have gone clean. “In the last four-five years, we have seen a lot of traction, and we have started to educate several stakeholders. If you do not have these systems in place, then wastes from the plant seep into the ground and enter the ecosystem,” he explains. “We need to make a fundamental change in dealing with such wastes. Three areas need attention: treating water wastes, incinerators, and evaporators,” he adds, indicating the path ahead for manufacturers. Without interventions, substandard manufacturing and waste treatment methods at Indian antibiotics plants pose a danger to human health and environment by causing drug-resistant bacteria. As the World Health Organisation’s Director General Margaret Chan says, the emergency is now: “With few replacement products in the R&D pipeline, the world is heading towards a post-antibiotic era in which common infections will once again kill. If current trends continue, sophisticated interventions, like organ transplantation, joint replacements, cancer chemotherapy, and care of pre-term infants, will become more difficult or even too dangerous to undertake.”Government to the rescue? Invested with every manufacturer is the responsibility not only of developing new molecules to take on the challenge of AMR but also preventing the spread of AMR directly in their processes. Abdul Ghafur, co-ordinator, ‘Chennai Declaration’, a document prepared in 2012 to tackle the AMR challenge from an Indian perspective, comments: “It is true that reputed companies follow proper effluent treatment protocols. At the same time, many drug manufacturers are not so careful about this important aspect.” Mr. Roy sums it up with a clear inward eye: “Clearly, the onus lies with us pharma companies… we need to be mindful, watchful and proactive. The government should step in to regulate, especially in a price-sensitive market such as ours. In more regulated markets, people are willing to pay extra if they know that clean systems drive production.” In India, he reckons, costs may go up 20-30 per cent initially after making changes to the infrastructure in factories. A challenge all right, but not one the antibiotics industry with the heft of billions of dollars behind it cannot overcome. ramya.kannan@thehindu.co.in Keywords: antimicrobial resistance Post Comment More In: Health | Sci-Tech | Comment | Opinion | Newsletter Tweet Please Wait while comments are loading... 1.  Comments will be moderated by The Hindu editorial team. 2.  Comments that are abusive, personal, incendiary or irrelevant cannot be published. 3.  Please write complete sentences.

Cash generated by Bristol's operations is spread pretty thin. Should shareholders brace for another years-long dividend freeze -- or worse? Cory Renauer (TMFang4apples) Nov 19, 2016 at 12:04PM Image source: Getty Images. The 21st century hasn't been easy for yield-hungry Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) shareholders. The company froze its quarterly payout at $0.28 from 2001 through 2007, and the last four payments of $0.38 constitute a dismal growth rate of about 2.65% over the past 16 years. Despite such cautious raises, the dividend is teetering on the edge of sustainability. Can Opdivo sales grow fast enough to support further increases, or should investors brace for a pay cut? Let's take a closer look at Bristol's finances and the competitive landscape to uncover its main growth-driver and find out. Stretched thin During the first nine months of 2016, Bristol-Myers Squibb paid $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and generated about $3.6 billion in net income over the same period. On the surface, a 53% payout ratio -- the percentage of net income distributed as dividends -- during this period hardly suggests a problem. Bristol's free cash flow of just $578 million in the first nine months, however, tells a much different story. Free cash flow is cash generated by operations minus capital expenditures spent to keep those operations humming along, but income investors like to view it as funds available to distribute as dividends or share buybacks. It's a useful barometer in situations like this, because it generally strips away non-cash charges and events unrelated to operations that impact net income figures. It can get a bit complex, but you don't need an accounting degree to understand that a business simply can't distribute more cash than it generates for very long. BMY Dividends Paid (TTM) data by YCharts. The disparity between Bristol-Myers Squibb's net income and free cash flow this year owes largely to asset sales and $500 million in deferred income tax payments. In February, the company sold a collection of not-yet-approved HIV assets to a joint venture formed by GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, known as ViiV healthcare, for $350 million up front. In May, it sold its interest in an over-the-counter drug business for another $317 million. The candidates sold to ViiV could generate up to $5.4 billion in milestone payments, plus royalties, but this revenue stream is far from guaranteed, given the increasingly competitive HIV space. Trouble bridging the gap Bristol-Myers Squibb exited September with about $4.2 billion in working capital. This might be enough to continue raising its dividend gradually, but it needs to ramp up sales in the years ahead to avoid slashing the payout. Until recently, Bristol's star cancer immunotherapy looked like it was up to the task, but a recent clinical setback cast a shadow over Opdivo's growth story. The exciting therapy blocks the PD-1 shutoff switch on immune cells, which many tumors exploit to avoid attack. Unfortunately, it's not the only drug of this class. Keytruda from Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) operates the same way, and Tecentriq from Roche acts on tumor cells to block the same switch. Over the past year, Opdivo sales soared after the FDA expanded its label to include patients with the most common type of lung cancer, but only when their disease progresses during or after standard chemotherapy treatment. Bristol tried to prove Opdivo could also work in newly diagnosed, untreated patients, but the drug failed to outperform standard chemo in a head-to-head trial with this group. Among patients with PD-L1 -- a protein that throws the PD-1 shutoff switch on immune cells -- on 5% or more of their tumor cells, at least half treated with standard chemo progressed after 5.9 months, versus just 4.2 months in the group treated with Opdivo. Opdivo's growth story took another turn for the worse in October, when the FDA approved Merck's Keytruda for a similar population. Its main competitor became the first chemo-free option for newly diagnosed lung cancer patients with PD-L1 on at least half of their tumor cells. Compared to standard chemo, Keytruda lowered the risk of disease progression or death by about 50%. Down, not out In the U.S., lung cancer is the most deadly malignancy, and it looks like Keytruda will soon knock Opdivo out of the lead in this important indication. Luckily for Bristol, Opdivo has the jump on Keytruda in kidney cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. Although its lung cancer setback might knock a few billion off the therapy's peak sales potential, Opdivo sales are still expected to top out around $10 billion by 2025. Image source: Getty Images. Third-quarter Opdivo sales suggest an annual run rate of about $2.8 billion. If Bristol's main growth-driver doesn't disappoint again, then maintaining and raising its dividend at a faster pace than investors have grown accustomed to isn't out of the question. Bristol tends to announce payout raises in December, and another $0.01 bump would provide a 2.77% forward yield. If you're uncomfortable with future increases that are largely dependent on Opdivo's continued success, then it might be a good idea to look elsewhere.

Sargsyan said it was unfortunate that Armenia's accession to the EEU coincided with the imposing of sanctions against Russia, the main economic driving force the economic bloc. This created hassles for the Armenian economy due to the fact of it being "tied in a thousand ways to the economy of Russia." President Sargsyan, however, insisted his country had made the right choice joining EEU.

NEW YORK — Major U.S. stock indexes slipped Friday as drug companies dragged the market lower. Small-company stocks bucked the downward trend and continued to climb, and bond yields rose to their highest level in a year. Drugmakers like Merck and biotech company Amgen took some of the biggest losses Friday. Weak results from Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch hurt retailers as investors kept a close eye on the upcoming holiday season. Small companies including regional banks continued to make large gains. Those stocks have risen sharply since the presidential election last week and are now at record highs. “Some of the proposals that (President-elect Donald) Trump has promoted, specifically deregulation and also some of his trade proposals, are better for small companies than potentially they are for large ones,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 35.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,867.93. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 5.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,181.90. The Nasdaq composite touched a record high early on, but turned lower and gave up 12.46 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,321.51. That's not a big loss, but the major indexes hadn't fallen that much since before the presidential election. Still, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished substantially higher this week after their big gains the week before. But indexes of smaller companies, like the Russell 2000 and the S&P 600, did better. They are on 11-day winning streaks and have hit all-time highs. Among small-company stocks, mortgage lending service company LendingTree added $6.80, or 7.3 percent, to $100 and coal miner Cloud Peak Energy rose 79 cents, or 15.8 percent, to $5.79. Losses for drug companies weighed down health care stocks. Botox maker Allergan retreated $8.20, or 4.1 percent, to $191.78 and biotech giant Amgen fell $2.13, or 1.4 percent, to $145.23. Hepatitis C drugmaker Gilead Sciences shed 96 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $74.62. Drug company stocks are coming off their biggest weekly gain in two years. The stocks had been falling in the months leading up to the election because investors worried that under a Hillary Clinton presidency, the federal government would take steps to rein in drug prices. Those kinds of steps are less likely under a Trump presidency and a Republican-controlled Congress. The dollar continued to climb. It's near one-year highs against the euro and six-month highs against the yen. The dollar rose to 110.63 yen from 109.89 yen. The euro fell to $1.0599 from $1.0626. The dollar hasn't been this strong since early 2003. Nixon of Northern Trust said that's affecting big multinational companies because it can hurt their sales outside the U.S., but it's less of a problem for smaller, domestically-oriented companies. Investors continued to sell U.S. government bonds at a rapid clip, and bond prices wobbled and turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.34 percent from 2.30 percent. Bond prices have fallen hard since the election and yields are now at their highest in a year. More Business Cozy retirement?

Photo: AP US stocks ended lower on Friday, with healthcare stocks leading the declines, as investors cashed in on a post-election rally and waited for clarity on the next administration’s policies. Wall Street equities took a breather after rising dramatically since Republican candidate Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the presidential election on Nov. 8. While the three major indices closed higher for the second week in a row, the rally lost some steam this week as investors awaited more information to support their bets that Trump could succeed in passing proposals to lift infrastructure spending and reduce taxes. “I see the market kind of churning here because it’s had a very decent move,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “Trump’s policies continue to be just rhetoric, because none of it has been enacted.” The Dow Jones industrial average on Friday fell 35.89 points, or 0.19 percent, to 18,867.93, while the S&P 500 dropped 5.22 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,181.90. The NASDAQ Composite slipped 12.46 points, or 0.23 percent, to 5,321.51 after hitting a record of 5,346.8. For the week, the Dow is up 0.1 percent from last week’s 18,847.66; the S&P is 0.8 higher from last week’s 2,164.45; and the NASDAQ is up 1.6 percent from last week’s 5,237.10. The NASDAQ’s biggest drags came from technology companies, such as Alphabet Inc, and drug firms, including Amgen. Six of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors closed lower on Friday. Losses in shares of Allergan PLC and Merck were the biggest drags on the S&P health sector, which led the decliners. The health index pared its post-election lift, but was still 1.8 percent higher than on Nov. 8, even after Friday’s drop of 1.2 percent. Only five of the index’s stocks ended higher. Consumer staples fell 0.4 percent, weighed down by a 1.3 percent fall in Procter & Gamble. The S&P Energy sector was the second-best performer, with a 0.5 percent increase as producers added to rig count, suggesting they might be expecting a demand boost. The S&P financial sector ended up 0.08 percent, and has risen 10.8 percent since the US election, boosted by prospect of higher interest rates and lighter regulation. St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard on Friday said he was leaning toward supporting an increase next month and that the real question would be the Fed’s rate path next year. Kansas City Fed President Esther George said that while she supports raising rates, the US central bank must do so only gradually. The comments added to Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s Thursday statement that the rate hike could come “relatively soon.” Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on NASDAQ, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The drug may play a role in slowing down disease progression. The new medication has been designed to inhibit an enzyme BACE1. The action may lead to a clearing up of amyloid plaques from patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloid plaques are a form of adhesive build-up that can accumulate outside nerve cells. Although amyloid is a protein that is normally found throughout the body, when it is associated with Alzheimer’s disease the protein divides improperly (folding) which creates a form called beta amyloid. This folded protein is considered toxic to neurons in the brain (that is, neural death occurs.) The reason for focusing on Beta-secretase 1 (or BACE1) is because this enzyme is responsible for the production of beta-amyloid peptides in the brain. The enzyme has become a major target for Alzheimer’s disease researchers. The new drug, called verbuecestat, has been designed by Dr. Matthew Kennedy, who is the Director of Early Discovery Neuroscience at Merck. The drug has shown some initial success in early studies. Here the drug reduces the sticky peptide beta-amyloid in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. This was initially tested on rats, and then on monkeys. In addition, some controlled trials have been performed on humans. With people the research has been part of a phase 1 clinical study involving 32 patients. This was designed to see if the drug was safe and if there were any toxic effects. Following this a phase 3 study commenced and this is currently in progress. The second study involves 2,200 patients who have been diagnosed with mild Alzheimer’s. The next stage of results reporting is expected in 2017. The research has been published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The research paper is titled “The BACE1 inhibitor verubecestat (MK-8931) reduces CNS β-amyloid in animal models and in Alzheimer’s disease patients.” More about Alzheimer's disease, Neurodegenrative disease, plaques, Beta amyloid More news from Alzheimer s disease Neurodegenrative dis... plaques Beta amyloid Latest News Top News Erdogan says Turkey can spurn EU and join Shanghai Pact France's seven centre-right presidential hopefuls Review: Keith Urban headlines the Barclays Center, puts on awesome show Special Philippines' Duterte meets 'hero' Putin Merkel: from austerity queen to democratic torch-bearer Op-Ed: Why Kovalev deserves immediate rematch against Ward New Zealand town builds underpass tunnel for penguins 15 killed, more than 35 wounded in southern Libyan tribal clashes Review: Barclays Center falls in love to the beat of Brett Eldredge Special Violence puts Yemen ceasefire extension in doubt Corporate Contact Us About Us Advertise Investors & Partners Help & Support Editorial Guidelines Terms of Use Privacy Policy News Links Latest News Live Events News Alerts GlobeNewswire News Global Press Releases 24-7PressRelease.com copyright © 2016 digitaljournal.com   |   powered by dell servers
