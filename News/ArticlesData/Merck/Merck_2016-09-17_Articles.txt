DARMSTADT, Germany, September 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Merck, a leading science and technology company, announced they presented new efficacy data for investigational Cladribine Tablets in two oral presentations at the 32nd Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) taking place September 14-17, 2016, in London. The findings, from the phase III CLARITY and CLARITY EXTENSION trials and from the open-label maintenance period of the phase III ORACLE-MS study, demonstrated durable efficacy of Cladribine Tablets in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) along with a well-characterized safety profile. CLARITY and CLARITY EXTENSION studies confirmed that 20 days of oral dosing over two years was effective in reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing disability progression for up to four years. "The results presented this week show that the clinical benefits of Cladribine Tablets can be maintained in most patients for an additional two years without the need for redosing," said Dr. Giancarlo Comi, Professor of Neurology, Chairman of the Department of Neurology, and Director of the Institute of Experimental Neurology, at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan and a lead investigator in the studies. "Although multiple therapies are available for patients with MS, there is still a large unmet need within this patient community, including for therapies that offer lasting benefits." In one oral presentation, data from the two-year phase III CLARITY trial and its two-year extension study (CLARITY EXTENSION) showed that patients with relapsing MS who received placebo in CLARITY and were switched to Cladribine Tablets in CLARITY EXTENSION had significantly reduced annualised relapse rates (ARR) (0.26 vs. 0.10, P<0.0001) and were significantly more likely to be relapse free (58.0 percent vs. 79.6 percent, P<0.0001) at the end of the extension phase. ARR were maintained for patients who received Cladribine Tablets for two years in CLARITY and were then switched to placebo for two years in the extension phase. The second oral presentation reported data from the open-label maintenance period of the phase III ORACLE-MS study. ORACLE-MS showed that, for patients with a first demyelinating event, treatment with Cladribine Tablets significantly reduced the risk of progression to clinically definite MS compared with placebo. For the open-label portion of the study, patients who converted to clinically definite MS during the initial treatment period were switched to Rebif® therapy. The new data presented at ECTRIMS show that patients who had received Cladribine Tablets in the initial treatment phase had lower ARR over the maintenance period (median time on Rebif = 56.0 weeks) compared with those who had received placebo in the initial treatment phase [0.14 for Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (n=25), 0.24 for Cladribine Tablets 5.25 mg/kg (n=24) and 0.42 for placebo (n=60)]. "Cladribine Tablets has a unique oral dosing schedule, with just two short treatment courses administered orally in years one and two. Together with more than 10,000 patient years of safety data and phase III efficacy data, these findings of lasting reductions in relapse rates support our belief that, if approved, Cladribine Tablets may serve as an important new advance for patients with relapsing-remitting MS," said Luciano Rossetti, Head of Global R&D for the Biopharma business of Merck. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) of the investigational product Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Rebif® Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide™. Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS. RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

Ford CEO Mark Fields says they will move their production of the Ford Focus to Mexico to create room for "two very important products" coming to the Michigan factories. Fields states that this will not affect on jobs in Michigan what so ever. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized Ford for the decision to shift production to Mexico, and said he would consider levying tariffs on Mexican-made Fords.

Quotes in the article Merck KGaA 0O14 ▲ 94.23 +1.44 +1.55% Pfizer Inc PFZ ▲ 32.27 +0.06 +0.19% Johnson & Johnson JNJ = 116.32 0.00 0.00% Amgen Inc AMGN ▲ 147.69 +0.63 +0.43% Proposition 61 is a proposal Californians will vote on in this November's election that requires state agencies to pay the same prices the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pays for medication - approximately 50% less than list prices. The federal department already pays less for most prescription drugs, so the bill will likely be a boon to patients in the state. As a result, Proposal 61 has received overwhelming support from citizens and visible politicians like former Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, but not so much love from large drug companies. If the bill passes into law, drug manufacturers don't have to offer savings to the state. According to analyst David Larsen of healthcare-focused investment bank Leerink, the major drug companies could choose to extend the prices they offer to the Department of Veterans Affairs to the state, while offsetting the discounts by raising the prices of other drugs. "If drug manufacturers chose to extend [Veterans Affairs'] pricing to California, the state might realize savings but this could be partially offset by prices raised on drugs not purchased by the VA," Larsen wrote. "Additionally, drug companies could risk a domino effect of having to discount other states." This, though, is unlikely, as companies are not required by law to extend the prices. Instead, the state must pay those same prices, and if they can't, they can no longer offer to pay for the drug under insurance plans. Drug manufacturers could also decline to offer the Veterans Affairs prices to California agencies, which Larsen said is most likely. As a result, fewer drugs will be offered under state funded insurance programs. Finally, manufacturers could raise the prices they offer to the VA, which was threatened in 1992 when Congress considered doing something similar on a federal level. While drug companies stand to benefit politically from opposing this bill, they likely won't see an impact on their bottom lines if Proposition 61 passes - at least at first. "In our opinion, due to the fact that Prop 61 addresses such a narrow portion of the California population - state agencies and non MCO Medi-Cal, the revenue and earnings exposure for the distributors and PBMs is minimal," Larsen wrote. He added that down the line, it is likely that California's legislature will realize that companies can raise prices elsewhere, and will ultimately repeal the ballot measure. Merck, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson each contributed over $7 million to efforts opposing the proposition, while Amgen , Abbvie and Sanofi contributed over $5 million, according to the California Fair Political Practices Commission. In total, those opposing the bill have spent $70 million, seven times the amount those supporting the bill have spent. These numbers may seem small in comparison to each company's market cap, but it is important to note that this bill would only affect a sliver of the state's population--those using Medicare, Medicaid and other state-run healthcare programs. Still, it could encourage other states to attempt to pass similar bills, especially in the wake of recent drug pricing scandals, like Mylan's MYL decision to boost EpiPen prices 25% each year, resulting in a $600 pricetag for some patients.

Opioid lobby spends big on Tennessee politics Mike Reicher , mreicher@tennessean.com 2:01 p.m. CDT September 20, 2016 Since 2006, Tennessee legislators have introduced at least 41 bills that dealt with opioids, about half of which passed. (Photo: Getty Images / Ingram Publishing) Tennessee politicians received more than $1.6 million in campaign contributions over the past decade from pharmaceutical companies and other members of the Pain Care Forum, a coalition that meets monthly to discuss opioid-related issues. An investigation by The Associated Press and the Center for Public Integrity examined the industry’s influence at statehouses around the nation. About $560,000 went to Tennessee state candidates and state political parties, and more than $1 million went to those running for federal office. Since 2006, Tennessee legislators have introduced at least 41 bills that dealt with opioids, about half of which passed. Here are the top five current Tennessee lawmakers who received the industry money from 2006 through 2015, according to a Tennessean analysis of data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics, the Center for Responsive Politics and the Federal Election Commission. THE TENNESSEAN Drugmakers fought state opioid limits amid crisis Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, R- Blountville: $24,025 Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey  (Photo: Submitted) The outgoing lieutenant governor, Ramsey was seen as one of the most influential figures in state government whose support or opposition could easily determine the fate of bills. As speaker of the Senate since 2007, though, he could not introduce his own legislation. The pharma money, he said, was “a drop in the bucket” in his campaign coffers. And its influence on his votes? “None whatsoever.” Rep. Charles Sargent, Jr., R-Franklin: $16,425 Rep. Charles Sargent  (Photo: TN.gov) In 2010, Sargent sponsored a bill that authorized physicians to refer workers' compensation patients for “pain management” treatment and limited their treatment to one year. An amendment extended the time to two years. Sargent said his contributions didn’t play a role: “I couldn’t even tell you who makes the opioid drugs.” House Speaker Beth Harwell, R-Nashville: $10,000 House Speaker Beth Harwell  (Photo: Submitted) As speaker of the House of Representatives since 2011, Harwell doesn’t introduce her own bills, but her stance on legislation can prove pivotal. “I have a very strong record,” she said on combating the opioid addiction epidemic. Sen. Jack Johnson, R-Franklin: $9,925 Buy Photo Sen. Jack Johnson  (Photo: File / The Tennessean) In 2012 Johnson sponsored a bill that enabled physicians to prescribe pain medication to workers' compensation patients who experienced pain beyond the expected treatment time. “We take money from a lot of different people,” said Johnson, chairman of the powerful Commerce and Labor Committee. “I don’t keep track of it.” He added that he’s opposed some bills pushed by the drug industry. Sen. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge: $9,900 Buy Photo Sen. Randy McNally  (Photo: Jed DeKalb / File / The Tennessean) McNally has sponsored four opioid-related bills since 2006, two of which passed. The most recent required that all pain management clinics be licensed. In 2011 he introduced legislation that would have required insurers to cover “tamper-resistant” opioids. While that bill failed, it could have boosted drug company profits because most tamper-resistant opioids have no generic equivalent. Evidence, too, is mixed on whether those formulations actually prevent abuse. “You balance out the good effects against the bad,” he said. “Overall, we thought it was good.” Top 5 big pharma players in Tenn. politics While most opioids are made by large generics makers, some U.S. drug companies market opioids — and are active in state politics. Here are the top five contributors in Tennessee that also are members of the Pain Care Forum, an opioid advocacy group. To be sure, pharmaceutical companies donate to political campaigns and employ lobbyists for a range of legislative issues, including opioids. These totals include contributions to Tennessee candidates and state parties from 2006 to 2015. Pfizer, $227,150: The company promotes Embeda, which Pfizer acquired when it bought King Pharmaceuticals in 2011. Pfizer also is seeking FDA approval for a long-acting drug with abuse-resistant properties called Troxyca ER. Merck & Co., $102,900: Merck is not known for any major opioid-based drugs, but it's an active player behind the scenes on medical-related legislative issues. Abbott Laboratories, $97,025: The long-time maker of Vicodin, the widespread drug used to treat extreme pain. It’s a mixture of the opioid hydrocodone and the primary ingredient in Tylenol. Abbott spun off its pharmaceutical wing into an independent company called AbbVie in January 2013. King Pharmaceuticals, $73,500: Known primarily for its tamper-resistant formulations of opioids, Bristol, Tenn.-based King was acquired by Pfizer in 2011. Johnson & Johnson, $25,425: In 2015, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, announced that it sold the U.S. rights to license opioid-based Nucynta for $1.05 billion.

Pharmaceutical companies and allied groups belonging to the Pain Care Forum lobbying collective gave nearly $2.5 million to federal candidates from Ohio from 2006 through 2015, according to data analyzed by The Associated Press and the Center for Public Integrity. State-level giving of more than $1 million was directed at candidates of both parties, including governors, attorneys general, Ohio Supreme Court justices and legislative leaders, and committee chairs in power positions over Ohio health law. Republican Party committees received about $137,000, while Democratic ones got $41,000. A huge chunk of the Ohio campaign cash identified through the analysis went to former U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, of southwest Ohio, who received about $875,000 over the decade, according to the data. Boehner was speaker for about half the period reviewed, from 2011 to 2015. The investigation by AP and CPI found that the Pain Care Forum worked in Washington over the past decade to quietly derail efforts to curb U.S. consumption of pain-killing drugs, such as OxyContin, by promoting the vital role of prescription painkillers in Americans’ lives. That went hand in hand with a 50-state strategy. Participating drug companies, associations and alliances also have other business before Ohio’s Legislature, but a steady flow of contributions from forum participants – who employed, on average, 37 lobbyists a year in the state – has meant their interests remain well represented when pain care issues arise. Among state candidates, Republican Gov. John Kasich topped the list, with about $46,000. Top state givers among forum members were Pfizer, Abbott Labs, Merck and Johnson & Johnson. Abbott spun off its U.S. pharmaceutical operation in 2013 and no longer lobbies on related issues. Kasich has championed a host of remedies to Ohio’s opioid problem, including creation of the Governor’s Cabinet Opiate Action Team within days of his 2011 inauguration. He has worked with state leaders since then to extend access to treatments and increase availability of the overdose drug naloxone and launched an education campaign for schoolchildren called Start Talking, among other initiatives. In the wake of those efforts, data from the analysis shows, painkiller prescriptions in Ohio have fallen from 11,261,528 in 2013 to 9,955,858 last year.

Data analyzed by The Associated Press and the Center for Public Integrity show pharmaceutical companies and allied groups belonging to the Pain Care Forum lobbying collective gave nearly $2.5 million to federal candidates from Ohio from 2006 through 2015. State-level giving of more than $1 million went to candidates of both parties, including governors, attorneys general, justices and legislators in power positions over Ohio health law. Then-House Speaker John Boehner received the most among federal candidates, Gov. John Kasich most among state candidates. Both are Republicans. Top state givers were Pfizer, Abbott Labs, Merck and Johnson & Johnson. (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
