Skip to content Patent Blog Jobs Ethics Journal America's leading patent law source Search for: Although Functionally Claimed, Court Imports Structural Limitations from Specification October 27, 2016PatentDennis Crouch by Dennis Crouch – Note, the prevailing party here (Merck & Co.) is represented in this case by MBHB Partner Dan Boehnen. MBHB is a major sponsor of Patently-O. ProFoot v. Merck & Co. (Fed. Cir. 2016) This case offers a straightforward narrowing claim construction analysis involving the ProFoot’s patented method of fitting shoe inserts.  U.S. Patent No. 6,845,568.  The decision also lays traps for prosecutors hoping for implicitly broad claims.  After a narrowing claim construction, the plaintiff stipulated that Merck’s Dr. Scholl’s process did not infringe and the case was dismissed.  On appeal, the Federal Circuit has affirmed in a nonprecedential opinion. The claim construction process looks to provide additional meaning and context to the expressly stated claims.  The approach is to look for how a personal of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the application filing date would have interpreted the claim language.  In this process, Phillips v. AWH indicates that the primary sources for interpretation are the intrinsic documents: the patent document (the single best guide) and the prosecution history (a helpful additional resource).  When appealed, the Federal Circuit reviews claim construction determinations de novo while giving deference to underlying factual findings. Here, the claimed insert-fitting method include use of a “neutralizer” that is used to place a customer’s ankle in a “neutral position.”  Following the Markman process, the district court construed the “neutralizer” according to how it was described in the specification — requiring a housing, protractor, and angular-adjustable foot plate.  On appeal, ProFoot argued that the district court improperly imported elements of the specification to limit the claims and that the claimed neutralizer does not require those specific components.  Rather, according to ProFoot, a neutralizer should be defined based upon its functional ability rather than any particular physical elements. On appeal, the Federal Circuit rejected ProFoot’s broad-construction argument — holding that “when read in the context of the [asserted] patent, this term requires a device that includes these components.”  To reach this conclusion the court started with claim language that require a user to step on the neutralizer (claim 1 requires “place right foot on a neutralizer”) and to use the neutralizer to measure an angle.  Looking to the specification, the court found that the patentee had described “only two embodiments of the neutralizer” – and both embodiments required all of the components found in the claim construction in ways that are consistent with the requirements of the claims. Although the appellate panel found that evidence from the specification was sufficient to support the district court ruling, it also noted that the prosecution history of the parent application offered additional support. The prosecution history story goes as follows: the claimed neutralizer was not found in the originally filed claim set but was added during prosecution with an express claim requirement that the neutralizer include the physical elements (housing, protractor, etc.). Although the physical components are not included in the child application, the court noted that the patentee never  indicated that it intended the child-patent neutralizer to be any different from the parent-patent neutralizer.  ProFoot made the claim-differentiation argument here – the child application does not include the express limitations that are included in the parent and therefore should be seen as broader.  The court rejected that argument as not providing any further information as to what the inventor understood “neutralizer” to include.  I the inventor had thought the word should be interpreted differently in the two cases “he could have said so explicitly or revised the [asserted] patent to include other, broader embodiments of the neutralizer.” One question that I have here involves the court’s use of prosecution history as providing “evidence of the inventor’s understanding of neutralizer.”  The court has previously held that inventor’s understanding of claim meaning is not directly relevant to claim construction.  Rather, the focus is on the objective meaning understood by someone of ordinary skill in the art. = = = = ProFoot’s Claim 1. A method of fitting an individual with right and left foot inserts which place the ankles of the individual in a neutral position comprising the steps of: for creating a right foot insert, having the individual place the right foot on a neutralizer while elevating the left foot off of the neutralizer; using the neutralizer to determine the angle necessary to place the right ankle in a neutral position; providing an insert having an angle which represents the neutral state for the right ankle; for creating a left foot insert, having the individual place the left foot on a neutralizer while elevating the right foot off of the neutralizer; using the neutralizer to determine the angle necessary to place the left ankle in a neutral position; and providing an insert having an angle which represents the neutral state for the left ankle.

The case turns on the fact that “neutralizer” is a neologism coined for the purpose, with no definition in the art, no definition in the claim, and no express definition in the spec. On these facts, it’s always been fair game to import every mention of the neologism from the whole specification into the neologism claim term. Watts v. XL Systems, Inc., 232 F.3d 877, 882–83, 56 USPQ2d 1836, 1840 (Fed. Cir. 2000); McGill, Inc. v. John Zink Co., 736 F.2d 666, 673, 221 USPQ 944, 949 (Fed. Cir. 1984). After all, if you can’t look it up in a dictionary, where else would you look? And how would you choose one part of the specification that describes the neologism to import, and choose others to leave out? Reply link does not work in your browser because JavaScript is disabled.

The case turns on the fact that “neutralizer” is a neologism “Neologism” isn’t mentioned as “a relevant factor”, either. It’s never mentioned at all. On these facts, it’s always been fair game to import every mention of the neologism from the whole specification into the neologism claim term. Or you could find the claim indefinite, which it surely is when the patentee says that the term refers to “some kind of measuring device” that performs the stated function of … measuring. Oops, I said “function”. Pretty difficult to avoid doing that. Note also that without this “neutralizer”, this claim is unpatentable because people have been making measurements to prepare shoe parts, including “inserts”, for a long, long time. Note that the CAFC doesn’t cite any of the cases you mentioned. Note what the CAFC says instead: inclusion of these components is consistent with the specification’s description of how the neutralizer is used. In other words, the CAFC imported into the claim the components that were necessary to perform the function of the “neutralizer.” It certainly did not import all the elements that appear in the two pictured embodiments, which would have been perfectly “fair” and would have rendered the claim even more worthless (as if that’s possible). Instead, the CAFC panel here “picked and chose” which elements to import. it’s always been fair game to import Are you sure you don’t mean “inform”?

Reply 11.3 Ned Heller says: October 28, 2016 at 5:59 pm And, David, and if the neologism was never used in the specification but was coined in the prosecution history to mean something specific, that is what it means in the claim.

Reply 11.3.1 David Boundy says: October 28, 2016 at 9:17 pm I think I agree with that, partly — a term created mid-prosecution and defined in the prosecution history (but not in the spec) has that definition in a Markman/Phillips construction. If you mean “coined to mean” with the meaning existing only in the head of the attorney, but with no square statement of that meaning, I wouldn’t bet on the attorney’s meaning sticking. As a practical matter, don’t count on that construction in a “broadest reasonable interpretation” context without the intervention of the Federal Circuit.

The CAFC could have — and probably should have — found these junk claims indefinite so that nobody would ever have to worry about them again. Instead they imported limitations from the specification to breath life into this nebulous “neutralizer”. The patentee, you’ll recall, wanted to construe the term to mean any measuring device which performs the measurement that is used to “provide” the super awesome shoe insert.

Yet again we are told that at the EPO drawings cannot provide that written description. Wrong. They can. A strict written description requirement is an artefact of any First to File system, as the USA is going to find out, in the coming years. Any patent system has to balance fair protection for the inventor with reasonable legal certainty for those having to design around.

Reply 9.1 anon says: October 28, 2016 at 5:28 am “Any patent system has to balance fair protection for the inventor with reasonable legal certainty for those having to design around.” Agreed.

Reply 9.1.1.1 anon says: October 28, 2016 at 7:06 am The point in reality though, MaxDrei, and the point of the jab at the EPO, was that a TOO strict view is not necessary.

Granted, there are very many individual Examiners at the EPO who, when examining cases in English, find it difficult reliably to make the correct WD judgement. But that is invariably because their first language is not English (you will recall that EPO Examiners have to operate in all three EPO languages, regardless what is their language at home). In such cases, appeal is often needed, to get to a fair outcome. When you assert that “the EPO” is too strict, show me where this over-strictness manifests itself in the EPO’s “established caselaw” or in its MPEP. Otherwise, your opinion (or that of AAA JJJ) that “the EPO” is over-strict on WD, impresses me not at all. Reply link does not work in your browser because JavaScript is disabled.

But you know that already, don’t you. Second, that very strictness is just the ticket, when you are being threatened by a patent owner with a claim, amended in prosecution, leaving it directed to an invention that was perceived later than the filing date of the patent application that founded the asserted patent. But you knew that already, didn’t you, with all that experience you have accumulated, over your long career, of patent disputes in First to File country; oppositions, revocation actions and nullity suits under the EPC.

Novelty claimed by function rather than structure so they write in the structure to save the claim. Should have reversed construction and let entire claim fail under 112a or 101. Here we see the very threat of overbreadth that Morse, Wabash, Halliburton, etc fear – Applicant posits two ways of achieving a functional result, defendant clearly invented a third, unposited manner, and rather than the law rewarding him with his own patent he is put on trial as an infringer. There is zero record evidence that the infringer’s manner of achieving the result was posited by the patentee, or else the construction would not be dispositive of the case. The office needs to properly train the examiners to recognize the functionally claimed invalidity to protect the later-inventor.

Reply 7.2 MM says: October 27, 2016 at 4:01 pm What’s hilariously desperate about the patentee’s theory of the case is how the claims read if we use the patentee’s definition of “neutralizer”, i.e., “just some kind of measuring device.” Let’s ignore the silliness of repeating the steps for each foot (surely that wasn’t necessary for patentability). A method of fitting an individual with a shoe insert which places the ankle of the individual in a neutral position comprising the steps of: having the individual place one foot on some kind of measuring device while elevating the other foot off of said measuring device; using the measuring device to determine the angle necessary to place the foot in a neutral position; providing an insert having an angle which represents the neutral state for the foot Wow.

Reply 7.4 Ned Heller says: October 28, 2016 at 6:26 am Random, I think the problem is the claim is (at least potentially) indefinite. If a person of ordinary skill in the art cannot tell with reasonable certainty what the scope of the claim is, then the claim is invalid. Here, if what a neutralizer is was clearly defined in the specification, then I believe there is no problem with definiteness. However if that is not the case from reading the specification, and the prosecution history provides no reliable definition, then it is also indefinite. In this case I believe that the court might be right that the claim term at issue, neutralizer, was clearly defined in the parent’s prosecution history. That is what saved this patent from being invalid. We get into scope issues if resort to the specification/prosecution history provides no definite structure – here for example if the specification only said that a neutralizer was anything that performed a neutralizing function.

Breadth is simply not the same as indefinitenes. No matter how many times it appears that certain people may want to conflate the two.

Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn’t. Different aspects of the patent statutes are informed by many of the same considerations. It should surprise nobody that a junk claim fails under multiple tests.

Reply 6 MM says: October 27, 2016 at 10:57 am Bookend provided by today’s CAFC decision in GE Lighting: As GE’s expert admitted, an ordinarily skilled artisan cannot, without additional information, differentiate an “elongated” core from a “non-elongated” core. “Elongated” appears nowhere in the specification, nor, as GE admits, are the core’s dimensions otherwise described in text or drawings. And in the prosecution history, GE distinguished two prior art references disclosing heat sinks … as not containing an “elongated” element. This patent should never have left the PTO and if the PTO wants to pretend to be concerned about “patent quality” it should apologize to the public for its rank incompetence here (and elsewhere) and teach applicants that they will never be allowed to overcome the prior art be relying on unsupported, much less undefined, claim terms that have been pulled from the ether.

Welcome to elementary school, tourb! It’s a big step up from kindergarten. You’re going to miss the graham crackers. Nobody’s “befuddled” by the definition of “elongated.” There are two problems here. First, the term doesn’t appear anywhere in the applicant’s specification and until the applicant was presented with prior art there was no suggestion anywhere that an “elongated” anything was worthy of protecting. Second, the definition of “elongated” is a relative term and even if the prior art failed to show an “elongated” thing, there is no way that the mere recitation of “elongated” is going to make your claim non-obvious. This is basic stuff but, hey, I’m used to explaining basic stuff to ign0rant patent attorneys for whom every day is a profound intellectual struggle.

According to the opinion, that wouldn’t have sufficed to get around the prior art in this case. Got any other definitions? There’s one out there about “unusually lengthened”. You think that’s “definite”? Here’s the deal: applicants need to learn how to write an application. That means you understand what’s in the prior art and you include the terms and definitions of terms that you need to rely on to distinguish your claim from the art. It really isn’t that difficult.

Reply 6.1.2.1 MM says: October 27, 2016 at 11:29 am There’s no requirement for “much longer” in the definition of “elongated.” It’s a relative term. If something is normally round and I stretch it a tiny bit along one axis, it is now “elongated” relative to the “normal” version. The relative nature of the adjective is the source of the ambiguity. Granted, there might be situations where the degree of elongation isn’t critical to “the invention”. But that’s certainly not this case here, nor would it be wise to ever include such a term without a definition and a back up disclosure of more specific parameters. All this assumes that there is an actual “innovation” involved as opposed to scrivening for monetization’s sake. Reply link does not work in your browser because JavaScript is disabled.

Drawings can provide written description support.

You might want to see Vas-Cath: “These cases support our holding that, under proper circumstances, drawings alone may provide a ‘written description’ of an invention as required by § 112.” So examiners are experts, huh? Interesting. I do hear that a lot. I hear it, of course, from the examiners themselves. I hear it from appeals court judges too. When it suits the conclusion based decision they are rendering. Of course, in this case, the examiner, oh excuse me!, I mean THE EXPERT, saw the amendment to add “elongated” and considered it to have written description support, and to define over the prior art.

Also, I know this hard for a person with a limited technological background (i.e., you) to understand, but biotech applications typically include drawings. Competent grown up practitioners still try to define their terms, particular the key terms. The failure to do so is almost always indicative of incompetence or chicanery.

And the truthful answer is that you can’t answer the question with any degree of specificity without “additional information.” Note that with respect to the prior art which was allegedly distinguished as being “non-elongated”, the CAFC opinion observes that “the disk … and the plate … [in each of the cited references] both extend in length”. But, according to the applicant, somehow those articles weren’t “elongated”. Why should the public be forced to play this game with patentees, at the cost of hundreds of thoudands of dollars?

Reply 5 MM says: October 27, 2016 at 10:39 am according to ProFoot, a neutralizer should be defined based upon its functional ability rather than any particular physical elements. Hilarious. The “neutralizer” is the key component to the method. The steps that don’t recite the use of the “neutralizer” simply recite “providing the insert” which has an angle “representing” the “neutral state” determined through use of … (wait for it) … the “neutralizer.” What a piece of junk. One question that I have here involves the court’s use of prosecution history as providing “evidence of the inventor’s understanding of neutralizer.” The court has previously held that inventor’s understanding of claim meaning is not directly relevant to claim construction. Rather, the focus is on the objective meaning understood by someone of ordinary skill in the art. Dennis, I think the prohibition on consideration of “the inventor’s understanding” is narrower than you make it appear in your discussion here. Certainly the inventor’s testimony about what he/she “understood” a claim term to mean can’t trump the meaning of the term identified through the lens of Phillips. But there’s no avoiding the fact that when the Phillips methodology is followed, the court (standing in the shoes of one of ordinary skill) will at times be trying to figure out what “the inventor” (or the inventor’s attorney) must have “meant” when he/she used or relied on certain words. The problem for claim interpreters arises in situations, as in this case, where “the inventor” uses a term to mean whatever is convenient at the moment. In such situations, the claim should be deemed indefinite or at least interpreted against the applicant/patentee. Reply link does not work in your browser because JavaScript is disabled. Reply 5.1 Paul F. Morgan says: October 27, 2016 at 1:49 pm I think Dennis asked a good question, and that you will find case law indicating that what the inventor now says he personally subjectively meant by a word in a claim is not relevant to what that word objectively means for a 103 [POSITA] test, and does not overcome intrinsic evidence. Of course the inventor’s testimony could presumably be used to present evidence of what others in his field thought such a word meant at the filing date, if he had such evidence?

Dennis and SCOTUK refer to the language of the claim whereas Philips is focussed on the meaning of an individual word in the claim. Is Dennis (perhaps unwittingly) closer to SCOTUK than to Philips?

Yes No Life Sciences VC & Funding Startups Mobile & Broadband Employment Analysis Insider Benefits Posted Oct. 26, 2016 at 1:55 p.m. Life science earnings: LabCorp, Merck, Novartis Published: 2016-10-26 13:55:52 Updated: 2016-10-26 13:55:52 Post a comment Print this blog postE-mail blog post Earnings By Wire reports Tags: Biotech & Life Science, LabCorp, Novartis, Merck Research Triangle Park, N.C. — Burlington-based LabCorp, Merck and Novartis have released their latest earnings. Here's a recap. LabCorp earnings lower than expected ​Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings reported third-quarter net earnings Wednesday that missed Wall Street expectations. Net earnings in the quarter were $179.5 million, compared to $154.7 million in the third quarter of 2015. Diluted earnings per shares were $1.71 in the period, an increase of 14 percent. Adjusted earnings per shares stood at $2.25, up 9 percent over last year. Analysts expected earnings to amount to $2.29 per share. Its stock fell by more than 6 percent in Wednesday morning trading. It was trading at $129.70, down $8.71. The laboratory network reported net revenue of $2.37 billion, up 4.5 percent compared with the same period last year. The company attributed the rise to the acquisitions and organic growth. “We remain confident in our outlook for the balance of the year and our positioning for long-term profitable growth, as we deliver proprietary solutions that address our customers’ greatest needs, and improve the health and lives of patients around the globe,” said David King, chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement. Headquartered in Burlington, LabCorp more than 48,000 people. Merck profits jump 20 percent Higher sales of vaccines and prescription medicines, coupled with restrained spending, helped Merck & Co. post a 20 percent jump in third-quarter profit, trouncing Wall Street expectations. The maker of Januvia diabetes pills raised and narrowed its 2016 financial forecasts, but noted some headwinds, including the start of U.S. generic competition to three drugs by year's end. Its shares edged higher in midday trading Tuesday. The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker is in transition, with revenue from older products such as immune disorder treatment Remicade and the Dulera asthma inhaler leveling off or falling amid increased competition. But sales are building for drugs launched since 2014, particularly immuno-oncology drug Keytruda and hepatitis C-curing Zepatier. Meanwhile, Zinplava for preventing recurrence of life-threatening C. difficile infections was approved Friday in the U.S., and Merck plans to apply soon for approval of experimental diabetes drug ertugliflozin and additional uses for Keytruda, its newest blockbuster, with more than $1 billion in sales over the past four quarters. In addition, chief executive Ken Frazier told analysts during a conference call that deals to boost Merck's pipeline of experimental drugs, with a focus on small -to-midsized assets that fit well within its business, are a priority. He noted Merck is calling attention to the innovation of its medicines amid the U.S. political furor over soaring drug prices. Novartis net profit drops Swiss drug company Novartis saw net profit slip in the third quarter as the loss of a key drug to generic use in the United States outweighed strong sales of its psoriasis drug Cosentyx and MS treatment Gilenya. Core net income fell 2 percent to $2.94 billion from $2.99 billion in the previous-year quarter. The loss of Gleevec, used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, to generic use hurt sales revenue. Gilenya, a medicine for relapsing multiple sclerosis, brought in $790 million, an increase of 15 percent. The company said that Cosentyx, with $301 million in sales, was "on track for blockbuster status" in its first full year after approval.

Ho/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images WELCH, W. Va. — The warning signs of what would become a deadly opioid epidemic emerged in early 2001. That’s when officials of the state employee health plan in West Virginia noticed a surge in deaths attributed to oxycodone, the active ingredient in the painkiller OxyContin. They quickly decided to do something about it: OxyContin prescriptions would require prior authorization. It was a way to ensure that only people who genuinely needed the painkiller could get it and that people abusing opioids could not. But an investigation by STAT has found that Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin, thwarted the state’s plan by paying a middleman, known as a pharmacy benefits manager, to prevent insurers from limiting prescriptions of  the drug. The financial quid pro quo between the painkiller maker and the pharmacy benefits manager, Merck Medco, came to light in West Virginia court records unsealed by a state judge at the request of STAT, and in interviews with people familiar with the arrangement. “We were screaming at the wall,” said Tom Susman, who headed the state’s public employee insurance agency in the early 2000s and led the push to limit OxyContin prescribing in West Virginia. “We saw it coming,” he said of the opioid epidemic, which today causes 28,000 overdose deaths a year in the United States. “Now to see the aftermath is the most frustrating thing I have ever seen.” Overprescribing of OxyContin and other opioid painkillers is blamed for helping to plant the seeds for the current opioid crisis. West Virginia has been hit harder than any other state: It suffers the highest per capita drug overdose death rate in the country – more than double the national average. It also has one of the highest rates of painkiller prescribing. In McDowell County, where the court records from a state lawsuit against Purdue were unsealed, the local sheriff said prescription pill abuse is so rampant that the county plans to file a new lawsuit against painkiller makers. The strategy to pay Merck Medco extended to other big pharmacy benefit managers and to many other states, according to a former Purdue official responsible for ensuring favorable treatment for OxyContin. The payments were in the form of “rebates” paid by Purdue to the companies. In return, the pharmacy benefit managers agreed to make the drug available without prior authorization and with low copayments. “That was a national contract,” Bernadette Katsur, the former Purdue official, who negotiated contracts with pharmacy benefit managers, said in an interview. “We would negotiate a certain rebate percentage for keeping it on a certain tier related to copay or whether it has prior authorization. We like to keep prior authorization off of any drug.” Katsur said prior authorization programs do little to eliminate inappropriate prescribing by “bad doctors” and usually just create needless paperwork for doctors working in the best interest of patients. She said some doctors simply won’t deal with the hassle of a prior authorization program, resulting in some legitimate patients not getting the medication they need. “You don’t want to make it harder for a doctor to prescribe when they are doing the right thing,” she said. Read more:Secret trove reveals bold ‘crusade’ to make OxyContin a blockbuster But the arrangement between the painkiller maker and companies hired by insurance plans to manage prescription drug benefits removed a key safeguard in the system that may have slowed the growth of OxyContin as it became a national bestseller that eventually peaked at annual sales of $3 billion. The former Merck Medco was purchased by Express Scripts in 2012. A spokesman for Express Scripts said no one currently at the company had knowledge of the West Virginia contract. A spokesman for Purdue Pharma said the company had no comment. Prior authorization programs typically require doctors to get approval from an insurer before they can prescribe the drug to a patient. As part of such programs, insurers will often limit the conditions for which a drug can be used and the length of time the drug can be prescribed. A study published this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detailed how a private insurer’s prior authorization plan in Massachusetts reduced the prescribing of opioids by 15 percent. The West Virginia court records reveal an agonizing situation in which several West Virginia health and insurance officials were early to spot the growing threat of OxyContin addiction and moved to blunt its impact. The well-intentioned bureaucrats, however, were no match for Purdue Pharma or its paid allies. In early 2001, the pharmacy director for the state employee health plan said her office noticed coroners listing oxycodone as the cause of death for some plan members. This occurred as the number of OxyContin prescriptions written for plan members skyrocketed; spending on the drug went from $11,000 in 1996, the first full year it was on the market, to $2 million in 2002. Purdue, aided at the time by its marketing partner Abbott Laboratories, aggressively marketed OxyContin to doctors with the claim, later shown to be false, that the risk of addiction was low. STAT reported last month that the unsealed West Virginia court records showed that an Abbott sales rep won over an orthopedic surgeon with a box of doughnuts and snack cakes arranged to spell OxyContin. “We felt a need to put some type of management on the prescription because we saw death claim certificates come in with the cause of death of oxycodone,” said plan Pharmacy Director Felice Joseph in a 2004 deposition that was among the unsealed court records. The employee health plan contracted with Merck Medco to manage its pharmacy benefits, and when state officials asked Merck to put in place a plan to limit OxyContin prescribing, “basically they were refused,” she testified. The Medical Director for the state plan, Dr. Sandra Joseph, told a similar story in her deposition. “They felt strongly, and they were very, very reluctant or resistant, for whatever reason,” she said of Merck. “They did not want to put any limits or prior authorization criteria on that.” Merck downplayed concern about OxyContin abuse, Joseph testified, saying the company “referred to other areas where there were not that many prescriptions for OxyContin, it was not that much of a problem.” The pharmacy director testified that the state initially wanted to limit OxyContin to terminally ill cancer patients only. “It was because we felt there was a high abuse potential for its inappropriate use for short-term use,” she testified. She said a Merck official calculated that the company would lose $128,000 in rebate payments if OxyContin prescribing was limited in West Virginia. It was not specified if that was an annual or one-time loss. The extent of Purdue’s rebate arrangements with Merck and other benefit managers in other states is not detailed in the West Virginia court records. Read more:26 overdoses in just hours: Inside a community on the front lines of the opioid epidemic Katsur, who left Purdue in 2005, said the payment of rebates was part of a strategy to keep insurers from limiting OxyContin prescriptions. She said such arrangements were common in the industry and not unique to Purdue. In addition to keeping OxyContin from being subject to prior authorization, the rebates paid to pharmacy benefit managers were used to guarantee favorable status for OxyContin on their listings of approved drugs, she said. PBMs commonly place drugs in different tiers on these lists, called formularies. Some tiers are more restrictive and require higher copayments. Purdue wanted OxyContin placed in the least restrictive tier — and succeeded. The relationship with Merck Medco was so important that Purdue moved Katsur to New Jersey so she could be close to Merck’s national headquarters, she said. The court documents make clear that blocking any limits on OxyContin prescribing was a top priority for Purdue. In a memo listing the 2001 goals of Purdue’s West Virginia sales team, the first listed item under Medicaid is “Stop any preauthorization efforts for OxyContin.” In a separate memo, Purdue officials reported meeting with a state official to “interrupt” any efforts to require prior authorization of OxyContin. And in a presentation prepared for a 2001 West Virginia district sales meeting, a Purdue official wrote in regard to the state employee insurance plan that the company was “working with Medco (PBM) to try to make parameters less stringent.” Read more:Dope Sick: A harrowing story of best friends, addiction — and a stealth killer The internal memos and the actions of Merck contradicted claims by Purdue at the time that it was working with the state to curb abuse of OxyContin, lawyers for the state argued in a motion that was unsealed by the West Virginia court. “Contrary to the picture of helpfulness and cooperation Purdue attempts to paint, Purdue’s employees were actively and secretly trying to prevent West Virginia from imposing any control on the sale of OxyContin,” the state claimed. The case with Purdue was settled in 2004 when the company paid $10 million to West Virginia. Portions of the case file, including documents about marketing of the drug and Purdue’s attempts to ward off limits on prescribing, remained sealed until STAT filed a motion in May to open the records. Nearly two years after the state insurance plan asked Merck to put a prior authorization plan in place for OxyContin, it finally got what it wanted. But the agency succeeded only after it brought in a new company to manage its prescription plan. By then, OxyContin and other painkillers had gained a firm grip on West Virginia, especially in McDowell County, where the state brought its lawsuit against Purdue. In 2001, the county was a proverbial canary in a coal mine when it came to the emerging national opioid crisis. The rate of accidental prescription drug overdose deaths in West Virginia was relatively low at the time — about 6 deaths per 100,000 residents. In McDowell, however, the rate was 38 deaths per 100,000. Since 2001, the death rate in the state has more than tripled to 21 deaths per 100,000 in 2012. McDowell Sheriff Martin West said lawyers contracted by the county are preparing a new lawsuit against pain-pill makers. He said the county is considered a “third-world country” by state officials doling out funds to fight opioid abuse. “Listen to the scanner here every night,” he said. “It’s first responders out every night going up and down hollers for an overdose. It’s pitiful what is going on.” Go to MSN Home More in Medical Researchers Studying Role of Gender in Autism Associated Press More Physical Activity Can Lower Type 2 Diabetes Risk By 26 Percent Medical Daily 30% of Cancer Deaths Are Due to Smoking Time Should you let your dog lick your face?

Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Oct 26, 2016 at 8:03AM Image source: Getty Images. Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) disappointed investors in the first quarter of 2016. The biotech disappointed again in the second quarter. A pattern seems to be emerging here. When Gilead announces its third-quarter results on Nov. 1, will the disappointments continue or is a positive surprise in store? It depends heavily on the answers to these three questions. 1. How much did Harvoni sales slow down? After storming out of the gate following its commercial launch in late 2014, blockbuster hepatitis C drug Harvoni has lost a good bit of steam. In the second quarter, sales for Harvoni declined nearly 29% year over year. No one is expecting Harvoni sales to rebound in the third quarter, but the market is anxious to find out how steep the decline might be. There are three main reasons behind the waning sales for the hep C drug. Competition is probably the most important. AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) Viekira and Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Zepatier go head-to-head with Harvoni. Gilead seems to have fended off AbbVie pretty well, although Viekira is claiming its fair share of the market. Merck, however, changed the game by launching Zepatier at a significantly lower price. Merck's move helped bring about the second main reason Harvoni's sales are slowing down. Payers are demanding -- and getting -- rebates and steep price discounts. Gilead reported much-lower average selling prices in the second quarter due to these concessions. The other factor behind Harvoni's sales decline relates to the hepatitis C patient population. When Harvoni was first launched, physicians prescribed the drug for a huge wave of patients with the most serious cases of hep C. Because Harvoni is so effective, many of those patients are now cured of the disease. Newer patients taking the drug tend to have less severe cases of hep C and can get by with shorter treatment periods. That reduces the sales volume for Harvoni. None of these things changed in the third quarter. We'll find out soon if the worst of the impact is over.  2. Did new drugs outperform expectations? Gilead rolled out a crop of impressive new drugs over the past year. Genvoya was launched in November 2015. The TAF-based HIV drug saw sales of $360 million in the first half of 2016. A couple of other TAF-based HIV drugs are also coming on strong. Descovy was launched in April 2016. Odefsey was launched in the U.S. a month earlier but didn't win European approval until June.  Possibly the biggest potential winner of the group, though, is Epclusa. The hepatitis C drug, which is the first to treat all genotypes of hep C, gained FDA approval in late June. With only three days of sales in the second quarter, Epclusa generated revenue of $64 million. The addition of Epclusa to its lineup should help Gilead battle more effectively against AbbVie and Merck. Gilead should see great numbers in the third quarter from all four of these newer drugs. If those numbers are even better than great, combined with Harvoni's sales coming in higher than expected, Gilead could have a nice quarter. 3. Will any hints be given about potential deals? At the end of the second quarter, Gilead sat on a cash stockpile totaling $24.6 billion (including cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities). Inquiring minds want to know what the biotech will do with that money. Some of it will go to share buybacks. However, Gilead CFO Robin Washington noted in her second-quarter earnings call comments that the company would probably slow down repurchases in the second half of the year. Some will also go to pay out dividends, but Gilead spent only $1.2 billion on dividends in the first six months of the year. The only acquisition Gilead has made so far in 2016 is the purchase of Nimbus Apollo, in May. Gilead spent $400 million up front in the buyout. That amounts to pocket change for the biotech. Gilead has a lot of cash that it could use to forge a deal to bolster its pipeline. Any news (actually, any hint) that it is looking to make a smart strategic acquisition should be good for the stock. Keith Speights owns shares of Gilead Sciences.

You worked with Procter & Gamble for 17 years before joining Merck in 2013. Why the transition? I never worked in healthcare before I joined Merck. It is very important to be able to relate to the category and its purpose. The contribution [Merck] gives to real people in their day-to-day lives showed me a different perspective than working on something like hair color.  How has marketing and communications changed since you joined? The first year, I wanted to see what moves consumers, doctors, and pharmacists by intentionally and significantly emotionalizing our communications. We wanted to visually soften our comms but also use terminology and ideas that speak to the heart versus speaking to the left brain, which is masculine, binary, and black and white. Around 2014, we decided to use every opportunity to position our brands as sympathy holders — the ones who care, listen, understand, and hold hands with consumers. We called them "Love Brands." At Cannes this year, Merck launched the WE100 platform. What inspired it? Love Brands was WE100's precursor. We want to prepare society for a new era where people live 100 years. Life expectancy has picked up significantly since the 1960s, even in the least developed country. But the legislative environment, government, system that is overlooking people has barely changed. You go from school to a job, the rest is smooth sailing and counting our days to the grave once you retire. What shaped the strategy? We placed a big study to find out the pain point and needs of people in this context. That shapes the content we are chewing on and about to roll out in Europe and Africa. WE100 is about the right of everybody to look forward to 100 great years and ask their governments for all the support they need. At Cannes, I was trying to find partners in crime that without any financial expectations, out of the goodness of their hearts, will help us out — such as the media industry, pharmaceutical industry, and even royalty such as [Queen Elizabeth II] and the Pope. His endorsement could be a great help for families to take this seriously for their kids. What initiatives do you have coming up around that? Healthy Hour is about raising awareness and teaching kids how to prepare for a 100-year life versus just learning about the next 20 years and how you can be good in math, physics, biology, and maybe literature so you can nail the best college and job. We are kicking that off in Africa this fall with support and engagement from governments over there. We are relying on pharmacists and doctors who in smaller villages may be the teachers of the courses. Another big project is We4You, which asks Merck employees to take time off in an organized way to help the elderly and better integrate them into society. We are doing this in Europe, working with the elderly on topics such as digital crash courses, knowledge about your bones, avoiding accidents, and restarting your professional life. What areas are you focused on? Women's and babies' health. Femibion is a pregnancy multivitamin. To support it, we came out with a campaign called Working Mothers, which is about recognizing the dedication of new moms to their babies that is perceived as holding back your career, turning it around, and recognizing your experience as a mom is a great qualification for a job as well. What can moms bring to the table? Skills moms have include listening, operational discipline, prioritizing, and multitasking, which are needed in the real world [for jobs ranging from] receptionist to the top manager. We have many female leaders. Our CEO, Uta Kemmerich-Keil, is a mother of two. The company has enabled her to go through her maternity leave, recognized her, and rewarded her to move forward. We have a lot of great stories from within our company that we will provocatively share with broader audiences in 2017. This is based in Germany and Austria, but we feel it is going to be universal. What came out of the first Global Consumer Health Debate you threw earlier this year?  The biggest realization is that 70% or more of big decisions are made by women. We had better understand their hopes, wishes, needs and contributions to the health industry. In terms of consumer health, they are the gatekeeper for the entire family. What's your biggest challenge from a marketing perspective? If doctors, pharmacists are not falling in love with what you say, they don't care or remember about the info you provide them. If your nose is decongested in 15 seconds or 12, who cares? It is a beautiful, wonderful story that can be passed onto the next person. It is worth tweeting about, and sharing on YouTube with your friends. That is what matters for doctors, pharmacists, and nurses. The challenge for the healthcare industry is how we digitize our interaction with doctors, healthcare professionals, and consumers. What agencies do you work with?  We work with Saatchi & Saatchi, SelectNY, and Ogilvy. From a PR perspective, Weber Shandwick helps us.

Meet the Contributors → FDA: Keytruda Now OK For Some Patients With Untreated Lung Cancer Alex Lash October 25th, 2016 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  The FDA has approved the use of pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for some previously untreated patients with a certain type of lung cancer, the drug’s owner Merck (NYSE: MRK) announced late Monday. Pembrolizumab can now be used for patients who have never received treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body. To be eligible for the drug, patients must take a test that shows their tumors produce a high amount of the protein PD-L1, which pembrolizumab has been designed to recognize. Roughly a quarter of all advanced NSCLC patients have cancer with high PD-L1 levels, according to earlier studies from Merck. That restriction is important. The new wave of cancer immunotherapies called checkpoint inhibitors, which include pembrolizumab, work well for a minority of patients, but doctors and researchers are only beginning to understand the signs that might point to a benefit for some patients but not others. Those efforts will need to improve if the promise of precision cancer medicine—giving the right medicine to the right patients—is to bear fruit. (Another kind of cancer immunotherapy uses live, modified T cells but has yet to be approved. Xconomy has compiled a resource of T cell clinical studies here; a second part of the resource, compiling trials of checkpoint inhibitors, is coming soon.) Pembrolizumab becomes the first checkpoint inhibitor to be approved for first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Last year, the FDA approved the drug and another checkpoint inhibitor, Bristol Myers Squibb’s nivolumab (Opdivo), for second-line patients whose tumors have resisted treatment with either chemotherapy or a drug that targets specific genetic mutations. The first-line approval for pembrolizumab comes weeks after Merck and its academic collaborators touted positive data from a 305-patient study, KEYNOTE-024. Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) have been studying their flagship drugs in several cancer types. But nivolumab produced negative first-line NSCLC results in August when it failed to show it could do a better job than chemotherapy in progression-free survival—that is, shrinking tumors or keeping them in check. That news set the stage for pembrolizumab’s positive data. For patients taking the drug in KEYNOTE-024, they showed progression-free survival for a median of 10.3 months, compared to 6.0 months for patients on chemotherapy. Forty five percent of the pembrolizumab patients had either partial or total shrinkage of their tumors, compared to 28 percent of the chemotherapy patients. The FDA also updated the guidelines for the use of pembrolizumab in second-line NSCLC. According to Merck, patients who have failed to improve with chemotherapy are now eligible for pembrolizumab even if their tumors produce a low level of PD-L1.

A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The company's 'A' rating reflects the following: --Recently introduced therapies, an advancing pipeline and manageable patent expiries should support intermediate- to long-term growth. --Fitch believes that Merck will pursue targeted acquisitions as opposed to large transformative ones. An improving pipeline and narrowing strategic focus reduces the need to do big deals. --Fitch expects Merck will continue favor share repurchases to deleveraging, with the possibility of further debt-funded stock buybacks. --Fitch forecasts that Merck will generate solid FCF during the forecast period supported by improving margins and moderate revenue growth. New Products/ Growth Opportunities: Products approved during the last three years should help to drive intermediate- to long-term, top-line growth for Merck. Most importantly, Keytruda (skin and lung cancer) is gaining traction in the market, supported by an ongoing stream of clinical data, but facing competition from a Bristol-Myers product and potentially similar drugs that may receive approval during the next few years. Merck is also evaluating Keytruda's safety and efficacy in other cancers and in combination with other oncolytics. Bridion (post-surgical recovery), Belsomra (insomnia), Grastek (allergies) and Rawitek (allergies) are unique-acting therapies, which should provide these two drugs competitive positions. Zontivitiy (cardiovascular) and Zepatier (hepatitis C) have entered increasingly crowded segments but should be able to gain some share from both newer and older treatments. Expanding Late-Stage Pipeline: Fitch expects Merck to continue to build its late-stage pipeline with new molecular entities (NMEs) to treat cancers, bacterial and viral infections, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, central nervous afflictions, osteoporosis, and other diseases. While the majority of these projects are internally developed, Merck has partnered with other innovator firms to take advantage of technological advancements that were discovered externally. The landscape for drug development is expanding, particularly as developers learn more about how genetics influence the development, prevention and treatment of disease. As such, Fitch believes that it is responsible and strategically advantageous for firms to look externally as well as internally regarding new drug development. Patent Exposure Manageable: The company has and will continue to face some significant patent expiries during the next year, but Fitch views the risk as manageable with roughly 18% of total firm sales are at risk. In addition, Remicade, which accounts for about 4.2% of total firm sales, is a biologic that has experienced less rapid sales losses to generic competition compared to traditional small-molecule pharmaceuticals. Vytorin and Zetia, however, are small molecules and account for roughly 10% of total revenues. Fitch expects these two products will lose significant sales shortly after their patents expire, as is typically the case for small-molecule drugs. Solid Free Cash Flow Expected: Fitch forecasts that Merck will generate $5.7 billion - $5.9 billion in free cash flow (FCF) during 2016. Improving margins driven by an improving sales mix and strong cost control should more than offset expected soft near-term, top-line growth. Fitch expects FCF to incrementally increase during the multi-year forecast period. Targeted Acquisition Most Likely: Fitch looks for Merck to pursue mainly targeted acquisitions in the intermediate term. The company has improved its operational and financial prospects through successfully gaining regulatory approvals on late-stage pipeline projects and has continued to back fill its pipeline with new and advancing projects. An improved growth and profitability profile decreases the need for the company to execute large strategic business combinations. Share Repurchases to Continue: Fitch assumes continued shareholder friendly actions during the near term, some of which the company may fund with debt. Merck has occasionally funded its share repurchases with debt. During 2015, the company purchased a net $3.7 billion of its common stock, compared to $6.1 billion during the prior LTM period. The repurchases were executed under a $15 billion program authorized in May 2013 as well as an additional $10 billion authorized in March 2015. As of June 30, 2016, the 2013 allotment was fully utilized, with $6.9 billion remaining on the $10 billion extension. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Merck's 'A' rating include the following: --Incrementally increasing revenue during the forecast period, driven by newer products, largely offset in the near term by foreign exchange headwinds and select product patent expirations. --EBITDA operating margin improvement driven by a focus on costs and an improving sales mix. --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus dividends) of roughly $5.9 billion during 2016. --Targeted acquisitions prioritized over strategic, transformative transactions. --Continued significant share repurchases. --Leverage to range between 1.7x - 1.9x during the next two years. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include the following: --Improving operations including new product development that support long-term positive revenue growth and margin stability/increases; --An operational profile that would consistently generate significantly positive FCF; --Cash deployment strategy that maintains gross debt leverage below 1.7x, including managing through operational stress such as patent expiries. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include the following: --Material and lasting deterioration in operations and FCF, possibly driven by patent expiries not being offset by new product development; --Leveraging acquisitions without the prospect of timely debt/leverage reduction; --Persistent leverage above 2.2x. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Fitch looks for Merck to maintain adequate liquidity through strong FCF generation and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM ending June 30, 2016 was $4.7 billion. At the end of the period, Merck had approximately $11.8 billion in cash/short-term investments (u.s.:10% - 20% of total balances/OUS) and full availability on its $6 billion revolver, maturing in August 2019. Manageable Debt Maturities: As of June 30, 2016, the company had $24.1 billion in debt outstanding, with $234 million maturing in 2016, $317 million in 2017, $3 billion in 2018 and $1.3 billion in 2019. Fitch expects near- to mid-term maturities will be satisfied primarily through refinancing in the public debt markets. FULL LIST OF RATINGS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Merck & Co., Inc. --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Senior unsecured credit facility at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments - Financial statement adjustments that depart materially from those contained in the published financial statements of the relevant rated entity or obligor are disclosed below: --Historical and projected EBITDA is adjusted to add back non-cash stock based compensation. During the LTM period ended March 31, 2016, Fitch added back $304 million in non-cash stock based compensation to its EBITDA calculation and $214 million in restructuring costs to gross profit.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.

The study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of the combination, and is planned for initiation in 1H 2017. Adaptimmune's SPEAR T-cell candidates are novel cancer immunotherapies that have been engineered to target and destroy cancer cells. Its NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has previously been evaluated in multiple myeloma in a single agent Phase I/II trial in which 20 out of 22 patients (91 percent) experienced a response at day 100 post autologous stem cell transplant. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Blocking this interaction is reported to enable T-cell activation and potentiates antitumor activity. "In initial single-agent studies of our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy in patients with advanced myeloma in the context of stem cell transplantation, we have seen encouraging evidence of antitumor effect, safe administration and prolonged persistence of transduced cells," said Rafael Amado, Adaptimmune's chief medical officer. "KEYTRUDA has shown preliminary evidence of activity in multiple myeloma, and there is preclinical evidence to support the view that the combination of NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy and anti-PD1 therapy may lead to meaningful anti-tumor activity. We look forward to evaluating our therapy alone and in combination with KEYTRUDA in a randomized trial of patients with multiple myeloma who are refractory or have relapsed with standard therapy. " The agreement is between Adaptimmune and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, through a subsidiary. Under the agreement, the trial will be sponsored by Adaptimmune. The agreement also includes provision for potential expansion to include Phase III registration studies in the same indication. Additional details were not disclosed. About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma is a cancer formed by malignant plasma cells. Normal plasma cells are found in the bone marrow and are an important part of the immune system, which is made up of several types of cells that work together to fight infections and other diseases. Multiple myeloma is characterized by several features, including low blood counts, bone and calcium problems, infections, kidney problems, monoclonal gammopathy, and others; and by the proliferation of these plasma cells within bone marrow. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 30,300 new cases will be diagnosed in the United States in 2016. Average five-year survival rates are estimated to be approximately 45 percent with survival rates depending on factors such as age, stage of diagnosis and suitability for auto-SCT, which is used as part of the treatment for eligible patients with multiple myeloma. Despite recent therapeutic advances, multiple myeloma remains an incurable but treatable cancer. Patients are typically treated with repeat rounds of combination therapy with the time intervals to relapse becoming shorter with each successive line of therapy. The majority of patients eventually have a relapse which cannot be further treated. About Adaptimmune's TCR Technology Adaptimmune's proprietary SPEAR (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell receptor (TCR) technology enables the company to genetically optimize TCRs, equipping them to recognize cancer antigens that are presented in small quantities on the surface of a cancer cell, whether of intracellular or extracellular origin, thus initiating cell death. The company's differentiated, proprietary technology allows it to reliably generate parental TCRs to naturally presented targets, affinity optimize its TCRs to bind cancer proteins from solid and hematologic cancers that are generally unavailable to naturally occurring TCRs, and to significantly reduce the risk of side effects resulting from off-target binding of healthy tissues. About Adaptimmune Adaptimmune is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel cancer immunotherapy products based on its SPEAR® (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell platform. Established in 2008, the company aims to utilize the body's own machinery - the T-cell - to target and destroy cancer cells by using engineered, increased affinity TCRs as a means of strengthening natural patient T-cell responses. Adaptimmune's lead program is a SPEAR T-cell therapy targeting the NY-ESO cancer antigen. Its NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has demonstrated signs of efficacy and tolerability in Phase 1/2 trials in solid tumors and in hematologic cancer types, including synovial sarcoma and multiple myeloma. Adaptimmune has a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with GlaxoSmithKline for the development and commercialization of the NY-ESO TCR program. In addition, Adaptimmune has a number of proprietary programs. These include SPEAR T-cell therapies targeting the MAGE-A10 and AFP cancer antigens, which both have open INDs, and a further SPEAR T-cell therapy targeting the MAGE-A4 cancer antigen that is in pre-clinical phase with IND acceptance targeted for 2017. The company has identified over 30 intracellular target peptides preferentially expressed in cancer cells and is currently progressing 12 through unpartnered research programs. Adaptimmune has over 250 employees and is located in Oxfordshire, U.K. and Philadelphia, USA.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Oct 27, 2016 at 9:01AM Image source: Getty Images. Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) is a global pharmaceuticals giant with tens of billions in annualized sales, however, the company's top line is about to take a hit in the coming year because of patent expiration on Remicade, Cubicin, and Zetia -- three of its best selling medicines. Mounting patent headwinds Through the first nine months of 2016, sales of Merck's top selling autoimmune disease drug, Remicade, have plummeted from $1.4 billion last year to less than $1 billion. The drop is due primarily to the launch of Remicade biosimilars in Europe, where Merck is licensed to sell the drug. Biosimilars are effective inexact copies of brand name medicines, and since they're usually priced at a 30% to 40% discount to the brand-name drug, doctors and patients tend to favor them. Pfizer's Hospira launched the first Remicade biosimilar, Inflectra, in Europe last year, and Biogen and Samsung BioLogics launched another Remicade biosimilar, Flexabi, earlier this year. Because there are multiple Remicade biosimilars on the market now, Merck's Remicade revenue is likely to continue falling in 2017.  Merck is also about to feel the pinch of patent expiration on Cubicin, a treatment for flesh-eating bacteria. After failing to block generic competitors from launching until 2020, U.S. patents on Cubicin expired this summer. Since that expiration puts roughly $1 billion of Merck's revenue in play, Merck's management is warning investors to expect "a significant decline in U.S. Cubicin sales going forward." Patents protecting Merck's cholesterol-lowering therapy, Zetia, are also on the chopping block. Zetia patents expire in December and Merck anticipates a "significant decline in U.S. Zetia sales thereafter." Zetia's U.S. sales were $411 million last quarter. Across all three drugs, competition due to patent losses will put nearly $4 billion of Merck's $42 billion in annualized third quarter sales at risk in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Managing the risk To offset patent headwinds, Merck is going to need its fast-growing drugs, including Gardasil 9, Keytruda, and Zepatier, to over-deliver. Gardisal 9 is a vaccine that protects against human papillomavirus (HPV), and in Q3 combined Gardasil and Gardisal 9 sales totaled $860 million, up 38% year over year. Recently, a two-dose vaccination regimen for Gardasil 9 in certain girls and boys between ages 9 and 14 won FDA approval, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to recommend that two-dose approach. Previously, Gardasil 9 was given via three-doses. Because the FDA estimates Gardasil 9 "has the potential to prevent approximately 90 percent of cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers," and the dosing burden on patients is falling, Gardisal 9 is likely to remain a top-seller in 2017. Keytruda, a PD-L1 inhibitor that stops cancer from over-expressing PD-L1 to avoid detection by the immune system, also offers support to sales in the coming year. Initially, Keytruda was approved for use in melanoma patients in 2014, but Keytruda's label has expanded since then to include head and neck cancer patients and lung cancer patients, too. Because of those label expansions, Keytruda's sales climbed from $159 million in the third quarter of 2015 to $356 million in the third quarter of 2016. Keytruda's sales could head even higher next year because it recently secured approval as an alternative to chemotherapy in newly diagnosed metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients with high PD-L1 levels. This approval has led to industry watchers increasing their outlook for Keytruda's sales in 2017. For example, Bernstein's analysts bumped up their Keytruda sales outlook for next year by roughly $1 billion following the FDA approval.  Zepatier, a hepatitis C drug, also offers the company top-line tailwinds heading into next year. Zepatier won FDA approval in January and aggressive pricing by management undercut competitors and resulted in first, second, and third quarter sales of $50 million, $112 million, and $164 million, respectively. Eyes on 2017 Historically, patent expiration causes the vast majority of brand-name drug sales to shift to competitors, however, it's anyone's guess exactly how quickly that will happen at Merck. Merck's fast-growing drugs provide it with some insulation, and if the company secures FDA approval of MK-1293, a biosimilar to the $6 billion plus per year insulin Lantus, then it may be in even better shape to handle the hit to sales caused by expiring patents. Nevertheless, since expiring patents could weigh down sales and profit next year and cause shares to trade lower, the company's patent risk can't be ignored by investors.   Todd Campbell has no position in any stocks mentioned. Todd owns E.B.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Oct 27, 2016 at 9:01AM Image source: Getty Images. Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) is a global pharmaceuticals giant with tens of billions in annualized sales, however, the company's top line is about to take a hit in the coming year because of patent expiration on Remicade, Cubicin, and Zetia -- three of its best selling medicines. Mounting patent headwinds Through the first nine months of 2016, sales of Merck's top selling autoimmune disease drug, Remicade, have plummeted from $1.4 billion last year to less than $1 billion. The drop is due primarily to the launch of Remicade biosimilars in Europe, where Merck is licensed to sell the drug. Biosimilars are effective inexact copies of brand name medicines, and since they're usually priced at a 30% to 40% discount to the brand-name drug, doctors and patients tend to favor them. Pfizer's Hospira launched the first Remicade biosimilar, Inflectra, in Europe last year, and Biogen and Samsung BioLogics launched another Remicade biosimilar, Flexabi, earlier this year. Because there are multiple Remicade biosimilars on the market now, Merck's Remicade revenue is likely to continue falling in 2017.  Merck is also about to feel the pinch of patent expiration on Cubicin, a treatment for flesh-eating bacteria. After failing to block generic competitors from launching until 2020, U.S. patents on Cubicin expired this summer. Since that expiration puts roughly $1 billion of Merck's revenue in play, Merck's management is warning investors to expect "a significant decline in U.S. Cubicin sales going forward." Patents protecting Merck's cholesterol-lowering therapy, Zetia, are also on the chopping block. Zetia patents expire in December and Merck anticipates a "significant decline in U.S. Zetia sales thereafter." Zetia's U.S. sales were $411 million last quarter.

Ming Gefan, who manages the Shenzhen branch of MJ HK Health Screening Centre in Guangdong province and helps mainland customers book appointments to take the shots in Hong Kong, said she ­noticed an uptick in demand for protection against human papillomavirus after the mainland gave regulatory approval earlier this year for Cervarix, a vaccine that guards against the virus. But while Cervarix was the only HPV vaccine approved for sale on the mainland, it would be taken off shelves in the United States by its manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, due to weak demand, news outlet Fierce Pharma reported last week. Thousands set to benefit from Hong Kong’s free HPV vaccination programme Cervarix, which protects against two HPV strains that account for 70 per cent of cervical cancer cases, was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration in July and not expected to go on sale there until next year. An unidentified spokesman for GlaxoSmithKline was quoted as saying the company decided to stop supplying Cervarix in the US due to weak demand. HPV is sexually transmissible and infection is the leading cause of cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide according to the World Health Organisation. There are many strains of HPV, with some strains producing warts on various parts of the body. Many mainlanders learned of the vaccine on the internet Ming Gefan, manager, MJ HK Health Screening Centre, Shenzhen Gardasil and Gardasil 9, produced by Merck and which protect against four strains and nine strains of HPV respectively that account for 90 per cent of cervical cancer cases – is also available in the US but not on the mainland. Shanghai-based Thepaper.cn quoted Merck as saying the company was still seeking regulatory approval from the Chinese authorities. Questions sent to GSK and the drug administration were not immediately answered. About 50 countries have added HPV vaccines to their national immunisation programme, but the mainland has been relatively late in doing so. Ming said many mainlanders learned of the vaccine on the internet. “Those with a progressive mindset are going to take the vaccine shot, especially after China approved ­Cervarix,” she said. WHO launches new guide for cervical cancer prevention and control “They go to Hong Kong to choose the vaccine that offers wider protection, against four strains of HPV or even nine strains.” Ming said the Hong Kong clinic regularly gave 5,000 HPV shots a month and up to 300 injections on busy days. The youngest client was nine years old and the oldest a woman in her 70s. Not all came from Guangdong province, with some making the journey from as far away as Inner Mongolia, she said. A previous GSK statement said cervical cancer was the second most common cancer among Chinese women aged 15 to 44, with an estimated 130,000 new cases seen every year. Research shows that early treatment can prevent up to 80 per cent of cases.

17 °C Cavan Home News Farming Sponsored Editorial Events Weather Sport Entertainment Videos Puzzles Business & Tourism Awards 2016 ePaper Supplements Gallery Archive Pictures Shop Local Jobs More Contact Us News Adverse HPV reports 'taken seriously' - manufacturer Wednesday, 26th October, 2016 1:27pm Story by Seamus Enright Jump to comments The company behind the Gardasil HPV vaccine have assured, while they take reports of any adverse reaction “extremely seriously”, such outcomes do not necessarily prove a causal relationship with the vaccine and encourage further investigation, if required. The statement from Sanofi Pasteur MSD, the Irish subsidiary of Merek Sharp Dolhme, made the comments, after The Anglo-Celt was made aware of several incidents in the local region where families believe their daughters made have become seriously ill as a result of side-effects of the vaccine. Among the concerns highlighted are limb paralysis, early onset of MS, ovarian failure, even menopause. At the time of going to print, the HSE had still not responded with figures detailing the uptake rates of the vaccination in counties Cavan and Monaghan over since it was first introduced for young teenage girls back in 2010. But in a statement to The Anglo-Celt, Sanofi Pasteur MSD say that patient safety is the company’s “highest priority”. “We encourage people to self-report or report on behalf of others, any changes to their health which may or may not be medically confirmed. These reports are taken extremely seriously and are used to monitor long-term safety, however, they do not necessarily prove a causal relationship with the vaccine, but provide health authorities with a line of enquiry for further investigation, if required.” The Gardasil HPV vaccine is the result of over 10 years of research and development. The safety of the vaccine has continued to be evaluated in several large post-licence surveillance studies in more than one million people (Vichnin et al, 2015). HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 & 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. To date, more than 213 million doses of Gardasil have been distributed globally, and, by January 2016, in Ireland over 580,000 doses of the vaccine has been administered and over 200,000 girls have been fully vaccinated. Sanofi Pasteur MSD added: “Through constant worldwide surveillance, the safety of medicinal products, including vaccines, is routinely reviewed as part of an ongoing safety monitoring process. While no vaccine or medicine is completely without risk, leading international health organisations throughout the world continue to recommend routine HPV vaccination.” However, before the Dáil earlier this month, by way of Parliamentary Questions, Deputies Tony McLoughlin (FG), Marc MacSharry (FF), and Martin Kenny (SF) each submitted individual questions to the Minister for Health Simon Harris for response. The were joined by Independents Michael Fitzmaurice and Clare Daly. Each highlighted concerns, including if incidence of adverse reactions are under-reported as most doctors will not acknowledge any connection between a vaccine and a subsequent serious medical condition that manifests in the weeks or months afterwards.

Click here to return to MM&M's and PRWeek's Health Influencer 50 list and features. 50. Diana Littman Paige, executive director, consumer lifestyle and healthcare practices, Marina Maher Communications Diana Littman Paige has effectively blended her expertise in healthcare and marketing to women in her role as executive director of consumer lifestyle and healthcare practices at Marina Maher Communications. The agency works with clients ranging from Tide to Merck. "Engagement and sharing are increasingly our success metrics because it's no longer what a brand says about itself that matters; it's what people say about the brand," Littman Paige said while moderating a panel at the 2015 Marketing to Women Conference. She joined Marina Maher in 2007 and moved quickly up the ladder, with three promotions in three years. Alongside her executive role, she is also head of Rx Mosaic, a division of Marina Maher focused on pharma and scientific comms. Littman Paige grew the agency's health and well-being practice partnering with a range of pharma and consumer health brands. –––––––––––––––––––––– 49. Meighan Girgus, chief marketing and programs officer, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Meighan Girgus steered the AHA and ASA through the early internet revolution, evolving an aging brand with a minimalist website into a thriving digital presence. Its properties now attract 170 million visitors a year and cover the gamut of heart disease and stroke-related health needs. Throughout her two decades with the AHA and ASA, Girgus has been involved in national panels and writing groups to support the organization's battle against cardiovascular disease. Prior to being named chief mission officer in 2009, she served as EVP of healthcare. She's an academic at heart. The papers and programs she co-authored helped standardize stroke care and practices. During the past 13 years, more than three million patients received help through a program Girgus and her team created to improve patient care. The AHA and ASA have partnered with the Ad Council, launching a multiyear campaign that helped people recognize warning signs and encouraged them to call 911. Next up: Girgus is head of an AHA taskforce designed to help speed up the process through which newly published scientific guidelines can be implemented. –––––––––––––––––––––– 48. Lynn O'Connor Vos, CEO, ghg In addition to helming one of the industry's biggest and hottest agencies — by the time 2016's results are tallied, ghg will likely have blown past $120 million in U.S. revenue and grown staff size to about 650 — Lynn O'Connor Vos remains an in-demand speaker. And ghg was IBM Watson Health's first agency partner. Yet over the course of a conversation, she's as likely to devote considerable time to discussing nontraditional ventures as she is the addition of pharma brands, including Pfizer's Chantix and J&J's esketamine nasal spray, to the ghg roster. See also: 3 questions for 5 of the agency world's leading executives As an example, take ghg's work with GoNoodle, creators of an e-platform designed to prompt recess-deprived schoolchildren to engage in more physical activity. "We're curious about medicine and technology. We love problem-solving," Vos told MM&M earlier this year. "It's great to have startups mixed in with more traditional clients, though who knows what qualifies as ‘traditional' anymore? Every company we work with is somewhere on the continuum of change." –––––––––––––––––––––– 47. James Greenwood, president and CEO, BIO Prior to joining BIO, James Greenwood represented Penn­sylvania in the House of Representatives for 12 years. He's still putting his political expertise to good use. He remains the biopharmaceutical industry's chief lobbyist in Washington and, since 2005, has been at times the industry's biggest cheerleader, as well as its watchdog. Given the recent backlash to industry pricing practices, Greenwood's role has never been more important. He kicked off the BIO International Convention in 2016 with a rousing defense of the sector, declaring "we're not going to let our industry be tarnished by insurance practices that burden patients with unaffordable cost. See also: Lobbyists create off-label principles following FDA lawsuits And we don't let ourselves be defined by companies like Turing — outlier hedge funds masquerading as biotech firms. That's not who we are." On the heels of that, BIO spearheaded two campaigns, Time Is Precious and Innovation Saves, to better tell the industry's story and promote its value. Both are shot in a sentimental style and show patients whose lives have been saved by new drugs. Greenwood said in a Bloomberg interview the campaigns were meant to "make the point that these drugs, expensive or not, do save lives." –––––––––––––––––––––– 46. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, chief medical correspondent, CNN At a time when many tele­pundits are coming under fire, Dr. Sanjay Gupta remains one of the cable world's most reserved voices. In a media environment that prioritizes bluster and volume over restraint and accuracy, that's the highest of high praise. Gupta's formal training and his health-policy experience inform his reporting on medical issues: He's a practicing neurosurgeon and served as a White House fellow under Hillary Clinton during her time as first lady. He's one of the few medical correspondents who reports from war zones and regions battered by natural disaster. No journalist ever wants to become a part of the story, but Gupta often crosses this line for the worthiest of reasons: While embedded with the U.S. Navy's Devil Docs medical unit, he jumped into action five times, performing emergency brain surgery on soldiers and civilians. Gupta is equally comfortable embracing policy-level ideas. He played an integral role in shaping CNN's anti-obesity initiative Fit Nation, chronicling the progress of six CNN viewers as they trained for a triathlon. Did Gupta participate in the event alongside them? Of course he did. –––––––––––––––––––––– 45. Helene Ellison, chair, global healthcare practice, Burson-Marsteller By Aaron Graff, CEO Ferring Holding Insight. Creativity. Enthusiasm. Results. Helene Ellison makes it all look easy. Helene is savvy, and she gets the job done. For more than 30 years she has launched numerous drugs and managed diverse crises for a wide range of global clients. Through it all, her passion shines through as she quickly becomes an expert on any issue of relevance to her clients. But what makes Helene truly effective is her energy. I am consistently amazed by her ability to engage a team and infuse passion in the work. No matter the challenge, Helene approaches every project as if it's her first day on the job and it is the most important project of her life. This infectious enthusiasm is reflected in the teams she leads and in the results she delivers to her clients. –––––––––––––––––––––– 44. Andy Slavitt, acting administrator, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Less than six months into Andy Slavitt's job atop the nation's largest public payer, he faced a key leadership test: UnitedHealthcare Group, the country's largest health insurer, announced it would pull out of the federal health insurance marketplace. The loss of UnitedHealthcare from the exchange, a key facet of the Affordable Care Act, set off a wave of other defections. Open enrollment began on November 1, so all eyes are on Slavitt to maintain order. Managing through volatility appears to be one of his strengths. He served for nearly two years as CMS chief deputy, and the Harvard graduate worked for two decades in the healthcare and technology private sector. See also: Health exchanges, Obama administration challenged by recent insurer exits Slavitt's take: Premium increases will be short-lived. The longer-term goal is to attract more young people to enroll and more states to expand Medicaid. Meanwhile, uncertainty reigns — owing to election rhetoric about changes or repeal of the ACA — and insurers face heavy losses. President Obama even made an appeal to the remaining insurers. Stabilizing the young marketplace could be Slavitt's signature achievement, or, if CMS fails to shore up the exchange, his defining downfall. –––––––––––––––––––––– 43. Rob Clark, VP, global communications and corporate marketing, Medtronic Steering global comms and corporate marketing at a company the size of medical device behemoth Medtronic is job enough. Add to that a heavy slate of acquisitions, including the January 2015 purchase of Dublin-based surgical supplier Covidien for $49.9 billion, and it's safe to say Rob Clark has a lot of irons in the fire. As VP, global comms and corporate marketing at Medtronic, which reported revenue of $28.7 billion in its last fiscal year, Clark played a pivotal role in communicating the strategy behind the Covidien deal to all stakeholder groups, especially Medtronic's post-acquisition employee count of 85,000. See also: Watson Health partners with drug and devicemakers to tap into real-world data Clark, who has held a number of roles at Medtronic, leads the brand's corporate marketing, global PR, employee comms, digital and social media, and philanthropy communication teams worldwide. Minnesota-based Medtronic last year signed a 10-year deal with the Vikings to create the 3-acre Medtronic Plaza between downtown Minneapolis and U.S. Bank Stadium, to sponsor the Medtronic Club inside the stadium to showcase medical technology innovations invented in Minnesota, and to develop a joint community service program. –––––––––––––––––––––– 42. Paul van Arkel, head of corporate strategy and healthcare systems, Novartis Paul van Arkel is, in many ways, Novartis' champion of value-based outcomes. After all, the Swiss drugmaker was one of the first pharma companies to embrace value-based pricing, for its chronic heart failure treatment Entresto. Outcomes-driven healthcare and value-based pricing have been the subject of discussions around the industry for years, but Novartis — under van Arkel's tutelage — is one of the few companies bringing those discussions to reality. The company unveiled a risk-sharing pricing model for Entresto upon its approval in July 2015, announcing the drug's results would be linked to insurer payments. Subsequently, Novartis inked deals with insurers Aetna and Cigna that were based on the drug delivering real-world results similar to those seen in clinical trials. See also: Novartis considers new sales model for experimental cancer therapy In an interview with the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, he espoused the advantages of these kinds of deals. "Outcomes-based approaches are a better way to organize health across the whole system," he said. "We as an industry should be part of the solution," he continued. "We should help by developing the right products — whether it's drugs or beyond-the-pill services." –––––––––––––––––––––– 41. Patrick Blair, chief marketing and consumer officer, Anthem One year after he was named CMO, Patrick Blair oversaw one of Anthem's (then Wellpoint's) biggest changes: a name change. The move at the time was billed as a way to foster transparency and direct relationships. The company markets its plans under the Anthem name, which people know best. Blair took that push toward direct relationships even further by targeting millennials in 2013. He revisited the company's campaign for Tonik — an insurance plan geared toward young adults in California, Colorado, Nevada, and Georgia. The ad used shadow outlines of young 20-somethings — reminiscent of the iconic iPod commercials. The product would not survive the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, but it was an innovative approach that fostered curiosity among young people about their health coverage. Under his direction, Anthem also embraced more marketing strategies driven by digital and social media. The company enlisted Publicis-owned digital shop Rokkan to shake up the company's media mix ahead of open enrollment on new, state-run online exchanges under the ACA. –––––––––––––––––––––– MM&M's and PRWeek's Health Influencer 50 50-41 • 40-31 • 30-21 • 20-11 • 10 • 9 • 8 • 7 • 6 • 5 • 4 • 3 • 2 • 1 From the November 2016 Issue of MMM » Share this content: facebook twitter linkedin google Comments Print Previous Post Read the complete January 2016 Digital Edition Next Post Health Influencer 50 4031 Similar Articles Health Influencer 50 How We Picked the Health Influencer 50 Health Influencer 50: No. 9 Health Influencer 50: No. 3 Health Influencer 50: No. 8 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The company has demonstrated exceptional progress in preclinical and clinical development of multiple pipeline programs and I look forward to leading the development of these promising therapies.” Mr. Cleiftie added, “I believe Erytech is very well positioned to be a successful biopharmaceutical company. I am eager to direct the strategic initiatives necessary for continued growth of the company and its operations as it enters the next phase of development.” Dr. Scheer has over 15 years of experience in R&D and the life science industry. Prior to joining ERYTECH, he served as the Head of Research at Pierre Fabre in France, focused primarily on oncology and central nervous system research, and also served as a Deputy Head of Research at Pierre Fabre. Prior to joining Pierre Fabre, Dr. Scheer served as a Director, Global Research Informatics & Knowledge Management R&D and Project Leader, Neglected Diseases at Merck Serono in Switzerland where, among other responsibilities, he led Merck’s program to develop drugs for neglected diseases in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO). He also served as Head of Molecular Screening and Cellular Pharmacology Department, Group Leader of Biochemical Pharmacology and Research Scientist at Serono. Dr. Scheer holds a B.Sc in Natural Sciences and M.Sc. in Chemistry, both from the University of Gottingen, and a Ph.D. in Chemistry and Biochemistry from the German Cancer Research Center. Mr. Cleiftie brings 15 years of experience in drug development, life science venture capital, and business development and licensing within the U.S. and European biopharmaceutical ecosystem. Prior to joining ERYTECH, he served as Associate Vice-President, Global Business Development & Licensing at Sanofi in Paris, France, where he led licensing transactions across multiple therapeutic areas, financial valuation activities, and other strategic projects. Prior to joining Sanofi, Mr. Cleiftie was a Principal at Innoven Partners, a venture capital firm active as lead investor in healthcare and IT in Europe and the U.S. He was responsible for healthcare investment opportunity assessment, transaction execution, and active portfolio management, and led equity investments in a number of biotech and medtech companies which achieved successful exits. He started his career in drug development in the U.S. as a research scientist with Aventis (now Sanofi) in the fields of immunotherapy and gene therapy for cancer. Mr. Cleiftie earned a M.S. in Biological & Medical Sciences and a M.S. in Immunology from the University of Paris V, and received his M.B.A from Cornell University. About ERYTECH and eryaspase (eryasp/GRASPA®): www.erytech.com Founded in Lyon, France in 2004, ERYTECH is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies for rare forms of cancer and orphan diseases. Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS platform, which uses a novel technology to encapsulate therapeutic drug substances inside red blood cells, ERYTECH has developed a pipeline of product candidates targeting markets with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH’s initial focus is on the treatment of blood cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), by depriving tumors of nutrients necessary for their survival. ERYTECH has recently filed for European Marketing Authorization for its lead product candidate, eryaspase, also known as ERY-ASP or under the trade name GRASPA®, following positive efficacy and safety results from its completed Phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial in Europe in children and adults with relapsed or refractory ALL. ERYTECH also has an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of eryaspase in the United States in adults with newly diagnosed ALL, and a Phase 2b clinical trial in Europe in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML, each in combination with chemotherapy. ERYTECH believes that eryaspase also has the potential as a treatment approach in solid tumors and is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial in Europe in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Eryaspase consists of an enzyme, L-asparaginase, encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells. L-asparaginase depletes asparagine, a naturally occurring amino acid essential for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells, from circulating blood plasma. ERYTECH produces eryaspase at its own GMP-approved and operational manufacturing site in Lyon (France), and at a site for clinical production in Philadelphia (USA). ERYTECH has entered into licensing and distribution partnership agreements for eryaspase for ALL and AML in Europe with Orphan Europe (Recordati Group), and for ALL in Israel with TEVA, which will market the product under the GRASPA® brand name. The EMA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have granted orphan drug designations for eryaspase for the treatment of ALL, AML and pancreatic cancer. In addition to eryaspase, ERYTECH is developing two other product candidates that focus on using encapsulated enzymes to induce tumor starvation. The company is also exploring the use of its ERYCAPS platform for developing cancer immunotherapies and enzyme replacement therapies. ERYTECH is listed on Euronext regulated market in Paris (isin code:FR0011471135)(ticker:ERYP) and is part of the CAC Healthcare, CAC Pharma & Bio, CAC Mid & Small, CAC All Tradable, EnterNext PEA-PME 150 and Next Biotech indexes. ERYTECH is also listed in the U.S. under an ADR level 1 program (OTC, ticker EYRYY).

In 2.14pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.03 percent advance. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.7 percent. In 2pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent. In the Dow gains in shares of Boeing and those of Nike, recently trading 4.2 percent and 1.9 percent higher respectively, offset slides in shares of Apple and those of Merck, down 3 percent and 2.2 percent respectively. While Apple’s latest quarterly earnings per share exceeded analysts expectations, analysts were disappointed with its outlook for iPhone sales—especially given the rival Samsung’s woes. "In essence, in China and elsewhere, while Apple’s products are still seen favourably, the distance between Apple and its competitors is nowhere near as great as it once was," Neil Saunders, head of retail research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note, according to Reuters. The latest US economic data were better than anticipated. The US trade deficit shrank 5.2 percent to US$56.1 billion in September, bolstering hope that third-quarter GDP growth might beat expectations. “We now believe the boost from trade could be closer to a full percentage point, almost twice what we had expected," Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut, told Reuters. Girard said she now predicts real GDP growth in the third quarter of 3.3 percent. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed new home sales rose 3.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units in September, an unexpected gain. Mondelez International shares climbed, up 3.6 percent as of 1.35pm in New York, after the maker of Cadbury chocolate upgraded its full-year profit forecast. The company has increased its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook and now expects growth of about 25 percent on a constant-currency basis, Mondelez said in a statement. "Our third quarter results underscore our continued commitment to improve operational efficiency, expand margins and profitably grow volume while also investing in strategic growth initiatives for the longer term," CEO Irene Rosenfeld said in the statement. “In the face of challenging market conditions, we're building a stronger, more streamlined company that is well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and attractive cash generation,” Rosenfeld noted. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.4 percent slide from the previous close. France’s CAC 40 Index slipped 0.1 percent, Germany’s DAX Index declined 0.4 percent lower, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index shed 0.9 percent. Germany’s Bayer, which agreed to buy Monsanto in a US$66 billion deal, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit bolstered by its pharmaceutical unit. Even so, Bayer shares closed 1.4 percent lower in Frankfurt as investors were concerned about weakness in its Crop Science division. Pharmaceuticals posted “encouraging” sales growth of 7.6 percent in the quarter, Consumer Health sales grew 3.6 percent, while sales of Crop Science were level year on year, Bayer said. “Earnings are not strong enough to fuel markets,” Ralf Zimmermann, an equity strategist at Bankhaus Lampe in Dusseldorf, Germany, told Bloomberg. “Some investors who had expected accelerating earnings may be disappointed.” (BusinessDesk) © Scoop Media BusinessDesk Independent, Trustworthy New Zealand Business News The Wellington-based BusinessDesk team led by former Bloomberg Asian top editor Jonathan Underhill and Qantas Award-winning journalist and commentator Pattrick Smellie provides a daily news feed for a serious business audience.

(Courtesy of Changing Markets) The discharge from factories that produce antibiotics is a hotbed for growth of so-called “superbugs,” according to a report released Oct. 19 by environmental advocacy organization Changing Markets. Superbugs are bacteria that have developed a resistance to antibiotics. This antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health concern, rising to the level of HIV and Ebola. On Sept. 21, it became the fourth health issue ever taken up at the U.N. General Assembly.  A UN statement released after the meeting summarized the gravity of the problem: “Common and life-threatening infections like pneumonia, gonorrhea, and post-operative infections, as well as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are increasingly becoming untreatable because of AMR.” While the two leading causes of AMR are (1) excessive human consumption of antibiotics and (2) the use of antibiotics in rearing livestock, industry leaders are increasingly treating pollution from pharmaceutical manufacturing with urgency as a third major cause.  Ahead of the General Assembly meeting, 13 major pharmaceutical companies—including American companies Pfizer, Merck & Co., and Johnson & Johnson—announced commitments to battle AMR. At the top of their list was to “review our own manufacturing and supply chains to assess good practice in controlling releases of antibiotics into the environment.” They plan to establish a common framework for managing antibiotic discharge and put it into practice by 2018. Pfizer was identified by Changing Markets as one of the American companies that sources from factories in India and China, which are the main offenders. The report also identified American pharmaceutical companies McKesson and CVS Health as sourcing from factories that cause AMR, and it urged them and all American and European companies to clean up their supply chains. About 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients in U.S. drugs are sourced from overseas, mostly from India and China. McKesson spokesperson Jennifer Nelson told Epoch Times via email: “McKesson understands that protecting the integrity of the supply chain is critically important to global health as well as to our business. … We are aware of claims against some of our suppliers and are actively reviewing the matter. We will take action if necessary.” CVS Health did not respond to inquiries. Both companies source from Aurobindo Pharma, based in Hyderabad, India, which Changing Markets identified as one of the worst offenders. The company has grown about 800 percent in the past decade, with its biggest market (55 percent) in the United States, according to the report. A file photo of an Aurobindo pharmaceutical factory in Pydibhimavaram, India. (Courtesy of Changing Markets) About 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients in U.S. drugs are sourced from overseas, mostly from India and China, according to the Institute of Medicine.  Superbugs know no boundaries, easily spreading from factory effluent in India to the rest of the world. The superbugs can spread through the country’s waterways, to farmland and drinking water for livestock and people, and can easily hitch a ride on people or goods traveling abroad. The report touched on another emerging concern in the spread of these superbugs: Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturers are disposing of their solid waste, including antibiotic residues, by making it into fertilizer. Thus antibiotics are being spread over soil far and wide. “While experts see this as highly problematic from an environmental and human health perspective, the lack of specific laws or regulations covering fertilizer provides companies with a legal loophole which they are only too keen to exploit,” the report stated. Out of 34 sites tested, 16 were found to contain bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Dr. Mark Holmes from the University of Cambridge worked with Changing Markets to study the concentration of antibiotics and superbugs in some Indian waterways. Out of 34 sites tested, 16 were found to contain bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Holmes concluded, as have several other studies in recent years, that the pharmaceutical waste is greatly contributing to the development of superbugs in India’s waterways. An example of another study with similar results was one conducted by researchers at Sweden’s University of Gothenburg in 2014. They found that Kazipally Lake in India, affected by the dumping of pharmaceutical waste, harbored 81 types of resistance genes against “essentially every major class of antibiotics.” That’s 7,000 times more AMR than a lake in Sweden tested for comparison.  (Greentea Latte/Shutterstock) (Funnyangel/Shutterstock) The Changing Markets report not only highlighted the problem of pollution from pharmaceutical factories in Asia, it also traced the supply chains in the greatest detail yet from Asia to America and Europe. It called for greater transparency, as it was difficult, and in many cases impossible, to find the links in the chains using data that is publicly available. FDA Beyond US Borders The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sends inspectors to Indian and Chinese pharmaceutical factories, and has made great strides toward cleaning up the problems, though many remain. In 2015 alone, the FDA issued notices of manufacturing violations at 80 Chinese production sites. Such a notice usually results in an import ban.  In an email to Epoch Times, the FDA stated: “Drug products approved for marketing in the U.S. are held to the same quality standards regardless of their manufacturing location. Our application review and facility inspections are conducted with the same rigor independent of geographic location of the manufacturer.” The inspectors take into consideration how the companies handle their waste, the FDA said, according to general manufacturing process regulations, such as “Trash and organic waste matter shall be held and disposed of in a timely and sanitary manner” (21 CFR 211.56).   As AMR death tolls rise, Former Rep. Henry Waxman and Department of Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Bill Corr are working on a campaign to encourage American companies to clean up their supply chains. They also encourage the FDA to pressure authorities in India and China to strengthen local regulations. Every year in the United States at least 2 million people become ill from superbugs, and at least 23,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Globally, about 700,000 die annually, according to a report commissioned by the British government this spring, and that number is expected to grow to 10 million annually by 2050.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excluding some costs, rose 6 percent to 2.68 billion euros ($2.92 billion) last quarter, the Leverkusen, Germany-based company said in a statement Wednesday. That compared with the 2.53 billion-euro average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Bayer's pharmaceuticals once again sustained earnings, led by demand for medicines such as the blood thinner Xarelto. The German company last month raised the annual sales forecast for its latest blockbuster drugs -- including Xarelto and the eye treatment Eylea -- to more than 10 billion euros from 7.5 billion euros. Crop sciences, which will probably replace prescription medicines as Bayer's biggest business after the Monsanto takeover is completed, showed little growth. Bayer shares fell 2.2 percent to 89.51 euros at 11:22 a.m. in Frankfurt trading after the company said brands like Claritin and Coppertone, gained with the purchase of Merck & Co.'s over-the-counter medicines in 2014, were a drag on the consumer health business. Earnings at the division dropped 3,5 percent last quarter. The unit's performance "underlines how disappointing the Merck over-the-counter integration has been," wrote Alistair Campbell, an analyst at Berenberg Bank, in a note to clients. Funded with a combination of debt and equity, the Monsanto purchase will leave the German company little scope for acquisitions to boost its pharmaceutical business. Bayer on Wednesday said it had finalized the syndication of a $57 billion bridge loan at the start of the month. It expects to apply for regulatory approval of the transaction this year in the U.S. and probably in the first quarter in the European Union and doesn't expect any major holdups. "This is a very manageable risk," Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann said in an interview with Bloomberg TV's Guy Johnson and Caroline Hyde, pointing to Monsanto's relatively small presence outside the Americas. "We are very confident that we can resolve any issue that may come up there in product overlaps." Bayer isn't just working on buying Monsanto, it's also weighing the sale of its dermatology business, which includes the brand Desonate for eczema, according to people familiar with the plans. The German company may also offload its radiology business, which could be worth up to $3 billion, the people said. Bayer has agreed to a termination fee of $2 billion with Monsanto and may divest businesses from the combined entity with sales totaling $1.6 billion, if needed, to gain antitrust approval. Baumann declined to comment on whether the company plans to sell the radiology and dermatology units in a call with reporters. Bayer's sales rose 2 percent last quarter to 11.2 billion euros, buoyed by increased volumes of Xarelto in Europe and Japan. Older over-the-counter brands like Aleve and Alka-Seltzer also grew, but couldn't offset a broader cost-related decline at the consumer health unit. The "weak business environment, particularly in Latin America," held back crop science products in the quarter, the company said. Higher selling prices and a currency boost were offset by lower volumes and higher research spending in that business. Buying Monsanto will allow Bayer to tap growing demand as farmers seek to boost productivity to feed an estimated 10 billion people globally by 2050. Falling crop prices and a quest for greater efficiency have triggered a cascade of deals over the past year. DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical Co. have agreed to merge and then carve out a new crop-science unit and China National Chemical Corp. is buying Switzerland's Syngenta AG. Bayer's stock has declined almost 12 percent since March 21, when the possibility of a transaction with Monsanto first emerged. "In the short term we expect Bayer to remain trading below its intrinsic value as we await regulatory updates regarding the multiple agri-chemical transactions currently on the table," Peter Verdult, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., wrote in a note to clients. Bayer on Wednesday made a slight adjustment to its full-year outlook. Core earnings per share will probably rise by a high single-digit percentage this year, the company said. The previous forecast was for a gain of a mid- to high-single-digit percentage. It stuck to earlier estimates for two other measures of performance. In July, the company said sales this year would likely climb to between 46 billion euros and 47 billion euros including revenue from the plastics division Covestro AG. Ebitda before special items is likely to rise by a high-single-digit percentage. Bayer still holds a 64 percent stake in Covestro, which reported a 22 percent increase in profits on Tuesday.       Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

Italy’s 10-year yield climbed to the highest since June after the country sold inflation-linked debt due in 2024 and 2026. The selloff deepened, with similar-maturity U.K. bond yields approaching the most since the Brexit vote, after the Bank of England said Tuesday there were limits to officials’ willingness to look beyond an overshoot of their inflation target. Gilts also declined after Britain sold 4 billion pounds ($4.9 billion) of securities due in July 2065 via banks on Tuesday. Portugal auctioned bonds for the first time since DBRS Ltd. maintained the nation’s credit rating as investment grade, securing eligibility of its debt for the European Central Bank’s asset-purchase program. Germany added to the weight of supply, selling 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) of five-year notes, while companies including Merck & Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. sold bonds. The Treasury in Rome plans to auction as much as 8.5 billion euros of debt on Oct. 28. “Gilts are leading us down, they’re underperforming, taking Europe as a whole after that,” said Craig Collins, managing director of rates trading at Bank of Montreal in London. U.K. bonds are vulnerable after Tuesday’s debt sale as well as “concerns about BOE policy,” he said, while the supply from euro-zone nations is “adding to the mix.” Italy’s 10-year bond yields climbed nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 1.48 percent as of 4:04 p.m. London time, the highest since June 28. The 1.6 percent bond due in June 2026 fell 0.84, or 8.40 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.15. Benchmark German 10-year bund yields rose seven basis points to 0.1 percent. Gilts Slide Yields on U.K. 10-year gilts increased eight basis points to 1.17 percent. The yield touched 1.22 percent on Oct. 17, the highest since the June 23 Brexit referendum. Portugal’s 10-year bond yield added three basis points to 3.22 percent. The auctions Wednesday came a day after Austria joined the club of countries to have issued ultra-long-maturity bonds when it sold 2 billion euros of 70-year securities via banks. The nation also placed 3 billion euros of notes maturing in July 2023. The Austrian central bank retained 500 million euros of both securities. “You have the perfect environment for a selloff,” said Martin van Vliet, an interest-rate strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “First, you had this strong spillover from the gilts market. We also had some supply pressure with quite a lot of auctions.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier also spoke of his “serious concerns,” warning on his company’s earnings call that the law would “negatively impact millions of patients.” Known as Proposition 61, the initiative intends to bring down the cost of prescription drugs by prohibiting California state agencies, such as Medi-Cal and state prisons, from paying more than the price paid by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. While Medi-Cal, the state health program for the poor, already can negotiate with drug companies, the national VA typically gets the best deal. VA rates may be about 20 percent lower than Medicaid’s, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Joshua Schimmer. Political pressure The pharmaceutical industry has been under fire for how it prices its medications, with Mylan NV’s $600 EpiPen pack and Turing Pharmaceuticals AG’s 50-fold increase of an anti-parasitic’s price in the national spotlight. High-profile politicians also have weighed in: Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, has pledged to crack down on what she has called outrageous drug costs. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who has lambasted specific drugmakers for their pricing practices, supports Proposition 61. Opponents argue that the initiative won’t work as intended because drugmakers wouldn’t be required to offer the drugs at the VA price, meaning they could decline to offer California agencies some treatments, or raise the VA’s current drug prices. The law would apply only to about 25 percent of Medi-Cal enrollees who are part of its “fee-for-service” program, not to the remaining 75 percent who are in the Medi-Cal managed-care system. California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office says the potential for savings is unclear, given the uncertainty over how drug manufacturers will respond. Pricey proposition Proposition 61 has become the most expensive ballot measure battle in 2016, according to the nonpartisan politics website Ballotpedia. Led by industry lobbying group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, the opposition has raised more than $100 million for its campaign, compared to $14 million by supporters. Despite the heavy spending, the drug industry remains concerned about the proposition since two polls have found California voters leaning toward passing it. In an early September survey conducted by USC Dornsife and the Los Angeles Times, about two-thirds of participants said they would vote yes, 23 percent said no and 12 percent had no answer. A late September poll by Field Research Corp. found half inclined to vote yes, 16 percent leaning toward no and 34 percent undecided. “Nearly 200 groups including veterans, doctors, patients, taxpayers, seniors and aids/HIV groups are opposed, along with every daily newspaper in the state,” Kathy Fairbanks, spokeswoman for the No on Prop 61 Coalition, said in an e-mail. Representatives for the Aids Healthcare Foundation, which is the biggest backer of Proposition 61, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. If the initiative passes on Nov. 8, it’s not likely to have any “fundamental impact” on drug companies, according to Michael Yee, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. The industry’s main concern is “emboldening 49 other states to look at these types of legislation to try to change prices,” Yee wrote Tuesday in a note to clients. Piper Jaffray analyst Schimmer also questions the ultimate effect of Proposition 61 if it were to pass: “Will the pharma industry really compromise profits, or simply find another way around this Act?” he wrote in an October note to clients. “The industry is wily—cost shifting, cost cutting or raising prices to the VA will be the likely end result.” Email Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Recent Articles by Bloomberg News Pence to lead Trump transition team, replacing Christie as chairman Drugmakers' stocks jump on promise of Trump presidency Global markets rocked as traders see pathway for Trump victory Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is home to 800 companies, from startups to MIT. Even Google and Microsoft have satellite offices there. Once a salt marsh and the former home of a NASA research center, Kendall Square today is known as "the most innovative square mile" in America, based on the concentration of innovative businesses in the area. Collectively, they have raised $14 billion. As Kendall Square continues to be the place where entrepreneurs and inventors are making their mark in the world, here are three game changers of the "Miracle Mile" that are using technology to help us live longer, stay healthier and work out better. WHOOP Read More Chances are you are one of the 50-plus million people who own a popular activity tracker such as a Fitbit or Jawbone. The devices have created a workout frenzy encouraging regular people to participate in physical activity, and it can become competitive. But, what about a device for those who compete for a living? Athletes. Until now, there was nothing on the market to track an athlete's training. Then WHOOP, the first scientifically-grounded device specifically designed to help elite athletes perform at an ultimate level, debuted in the fall of 2015. Worn on the wrist, WHOOP monitors an athlete's heart rate, ambient temperature, accelerometry and other vitals 100 times a second. Those factors determine an athlete's strain, sleep and recovery. Founder and CEO Will Ahmed believes that athletes may overlook those factors because there's a thin line between over training and training optimally. He says WHOOP's goal is to empower athletes and help them understand their bodies.

Hide Caption 9 of 9 A digital dashboard allows coaches, trainers and athletes to monitor an athlete's training level. When training is complete, a color-coded recovery score is given, which determines if an athlete should continue or let their body rest. "When we started WHOOP we uncovered that there are a lot of biomarkers that predict how you're going to perform," says Ahmed. "Feelings in general aren't a very good predictor of your body's performance." NBA champion LeBron James, Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps and about 20 other professional and Olympic athletes have trained using WHOOP. College athletic programs train with the device as well. "We started using WHOOP in the middle of September and this is the healthiest we've been as a team," says Roy Coates, Northeastern swim team head coach. "It plays a huge factor in our success as a team." A recent study of 120 college athletes showed that when athletes used WHOOP, they gained an average of 41 more minutes of sleep and reduced their alcohol consumption by 76%. "You have to budget your time wisely because coaches can see everything you're doing," says Carly Schnabel, Northeastern women's swim team member. If you're not a professional or collegiate athlete and you want to get your hands on a WHOOP, there's good news. WHOOP announced last July that their WHOOP Strap 2.0 would be available to the general public at the end of this year. Moderna JUST WATCHED Is this the cure to cancer? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Is this the cure to cancer? 03:28 Will there ever be a cure for cancer or HIV? That's the question most of the world has been asking. One biotech company, Moderna, believes they are one step closer to finding a remedy. In fact, Moderna says the cure may be right in front of our eyes. "Your body is going to be the factory for your medicine," says Moderna's CEO Stephane Bancel. When someone becomes ill, Bancel says, it is usually due to the lack of a protein, which is then treated with a synthetic protein-based drug. However, those drugs are not always effective in curing the disease. Founded in 2011, Moderna says its technology will not only replace the missing protein but will swap it with a more natural protein. "Now we can have therapeutic proteins functioning inside cells," Tal Zaks, chief medical officer says. "And that's a huge difference." So, how will an emerging biotech startup be able to do what doctors have been unable to do for centuries? How will they change the makeup of proteins? By using Messenger RNA or mRNA. Messenger RNA is the molecules found in cells that carries the code for a particular protein and acts as a template for the formation of that protein. Moderna's technology will change the property of the mRNA molecules, then the mRNA will be injected into the body, theoretically allowing your cells to make any protein it needs to heal itself from a specific disease. "We are very focused on infectious disease," Bancel added. "Then we are trying to see if we could make personalized cancer vaccines." How Cuba is battling lung cancer with a vaccine Last June, Moderna announced a partnership with Merck to develop an mRNA-based personalized cancer vaccine with clinical studies anticipated to begin next year. Last July the company signed a deal with Vertex to create therapies for cystic fibrosis. With over $1.5 billion raised for research and development, including $20 million from the Gates Foundation to fight HIV, Moderna is establishing itself as a leader in clinical studies. An unprecedented two clinical studies are currently underway including a study with AstraZeneca on the experimental drug AZD8601, which treats vascular disease. With their ambitious work underway and the research continuing, the end results could potentially mean the end of devastating illnesses. "The next couple of years for us will be really transformational," Zaks says. Indigo JUST WATCHED Scientists grow natural supercrops to feed the planet Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Scientists grow natural supercrops to feed the planet 03:31 Ten billion. That's Earth's estimated population in 2050. That means 10 billion people will be consuming the Earth's food and water supply at the same time. In order to provide enough food and water for the population, agriculture productivity and water conservation needs to increase by 70%. Are we prepared? Tech startup Indigo says no, we are not. They however may have discovered an innovative way to meet the world's food and water needs. After studying human microbiomes found in or on the body that promote digestion and reproduction, scientists at Indigo studied microbiomes found in plants. The results showed that when added to a seed coding, microbes naturally found in plants have a positive effect on a plant's water stress tolerance as well as its resistance to certain insects and fungi. "It's almost like we've discovered a whole new organ inside of plants," says co-founder Geoffrey Ian von Maltzahn. "Now we have the tools to figure out what it's doing." After their discovery, more than a dozen plants were tested in various climate conditions during all seasons. When natural microbes were added, the results showed a 10% yield increase. How significant is that? With 75% of the Earth's food coming from just a dozen plants and five animals, that number is a game changer. "A 10% increase is a whole decade leap forward in terms of productivity," says CEO David Perry. The agricultural industry has taken notice of Indigo's groundbreaking advancements. Last July, the company announced that it received a record-breaking $100 million Series C investment. The investment will not only support Indigo's current and future research, but supports the newly launched Indigo Cotton, the company's first commercial product, which aims to increase water efficiency. Growing beyond its Kendall Square roots, Indigo is now housed in a 65,000-square-foot facility just a few miles north of its original hub. The company says it is preparing for growth -- expecting to double the size of its team as it strives to feed the world. Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

It has the potential to hurt your heart, your immune system, and even your memory. In an extreme case of stress-induced memory loss, a woman in England forgot her name, her husband's identity, and nearly everything else about her life after a nervous breakdown, The Daily Mail reports. Marie Coe, 55, was working upwards of 70 hours a week in a demanding job running an events company in the U.K., traveling constantly, all while also juggling a family and taking care of her household. One day, after she'd gone missing for 24 hours and couldn't remember anything, she asked a stranger at a gas station for help. An ambulance came, and she couldn't answer any of the paramedics' questions. After a CT scan revealed no head injuries, the doctors diagnosed her with "stress-induced amnesia,"according to The Daily Mail. This is, apparently, a real thing: Memory loss caused by extreme stress or trauma is actually "dissociative amnesia," according to Merck Manuals. It seems to run in families, according to The Cleveland Clinic. It can cause someone to forget everything, as with Coe, or it can concern specific areas of the sufferer's life. Sometimes, a person with the condition will forget who they are and go on to assume an entirely new identity without realizing it (this is known as "dissociative fugue."). When Coe's husband Mark picked her up from the hospital, she had no idea who he was. She didn't even know she was married. "It was terrifying sitting in the car with a strange man who claimed he was my husband," she told The Daily Mail.  [For the full story, head to Refinery29] More from Refinery29: 7 Very Weird Side Effects Of Stress Here's How Stress Can Make You Sick Sex Makes You More Intelligent, Apparently Search Shape Shop activity trackers running shoes dresses shoes rings wetsuits sandals ski training shoes headphones boots skin care health plus size clothing sneakers fragrances workout clothes Shop More Your Account Help Newsletter Customer Service Log In Join Now!

The drugmaker said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had placed a partial hold on enrolment into the final-stage Phase III trials involving two of its immune system-boosting drugs, although the studies are still continuing with existing patients. Trials of durvalumab and tremelimumab in different cancer types are also progressing as planned. Durvalumab is being tested on its own and with tremelimumab in various cancers. Expectations for the combination treatment have been building in particular in lung cancer, where the two-drug cocktail is being tested in a broad range of patients as an alternative to initial chemotherapy. News of the problems in head and neck cancer first surfaced on the website clinicaltrials.gov, run by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, which said one of the trials, known as KESTREL, had been "suspended". "The trial is not suspended," an AstraZeneca spokeswoman said. "We have a pause or a partial clinical hold on enrolment of new patients." Shares in AstraZeneca fell more than 4 percent in U.S. trading on concerns that the setback might signal wider problems for durvalumab. AstraZeneca sought to play down concerns, however, stressing that pivotal data in lung cancer were still expected in the first half of 2017. It also said that bleeding was a known complication in treating head and neck cancer, given the proximity of tumours to major blood vessels and use of prior cancer therapies, which may involve surgery and radiation. Merck's rival immunotherapy drug Keytruda is already approved for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the same condition that AstraZeneca is testing for. Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said there was some reference in the medical literature to a decrease in blood platelets, which are needed for clotting, when patients were given so-called CTLA4 drugs like tremelimumab, although cases were rare. Both Anderson and Deutsche Bank's Richard Parkes said it was unclear if bleeding constituted a real drug side effect or not. AstraZeneca said it had submitted its analysis of bleeding events to the FDA for review and would work to provide the required information to resume new patient enrolment as soon as possible.

Only 19 new molecular entity drugs have been approved year-to-date compared to 32 approved during the same time frame last year. For the uninitiated, a new molecular entity, or NME in short, is an active ingredient that has never before been marketed in the United States in any form. Stock market showing of biotech stocks in October isn't inspiring. The NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index has slid 10.81 percent thus far this year compared to a more modest 1.16 percent drop by the broader S&P 500 Index and a 0.5 percent slippage by the Nasdaq Composite Index. In October, only 2 new molecular entity drugs were greenlighted by the FDA. The two lucky novel drugs are Eli Lilly & Co.'s (LLY) Lartruvo and Merck's (MRK) Zinplava. Lartruvo is approved for use with chemotherapy drug doxorubicin in adults with certain types of soft tissue sarcoma while Zinplava is approved to reduce recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection. However, Nicox and Egalet Corp. (EGLT), which faced the FDA in October, were not so lucky. The regulator turned down Nicox's application seeking approval of AC-170 for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis while it sought more time to review Egalet's abuse-deterrent opioid medicine Arymo ER, extending the deadline of October 14, 2016. As we head into November, it's time to take a look at the upcoming FDA decisions of the month.

Only 19 new molecular entity drugs have been approved year-to-date compared to 32 approved during the same time frame last year.

The NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index has slid 10.81 percent thus far this year compared to a more modest 1.16 percent drop by the broader S&P 500 Index and a 0.5 percent slippage by the Nasdaq Composite Index. The underperformance may have something to do with the widely expected U.S. Presidential results. Hillary Clinton at the White House may mean a clampdown on biotech companies, which unscrupulously price their products for life threatening drugs. Two power-packed tweets regarding pricing of drugs sent out by the Democratic Party's Presidential candidate served to wreak havoc for two pertinent companies, namely Mylan (MYL) and Turing Pharmaceuticals LLC. Even as macroeconomic headwinds remain, this time and capital-intensive industry is gambling big time over novel products and technologies, giving them the status of risky bets. In October, only 2 new molecular entity drugs were greenlighted by the FDA. The two lucky novel drugs are Eli Lilly & Co.'s (LLY) Lartruvo and Merck's (MRK) Zinplava. Lartruvo is approved for use with chemotherapy drug doxorubicin in adults with certain types of soft tissue sarcoma while Zinplava is approved to reduce recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Ransdell Pierson Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), whose high-profile Opdivo immunotherapy failed an important lung-cancer trial last summer, sharply raised its 2016 profit forecast after strong quarterly sales of other leading medicines. The U.S. drugmaker on Thursday predicted 2016 earnings of $2.80 to $2.90 a share, up from its previous forecast range of $2.55 to $2.65. Bristol-Myers, whose shares rose 5 percent in premarket trading, said it expects 2017 earnings of $2.85 to $3.05 per share. Sales of Opdivo, which treats melanoma and lung cancer, tripled to $920 million in the third quarter, but trailed forecasts by $27 million. Opdivo had been considered the leader among a new class of cancer drugs called PD-1 inhibitors until August, when researchers said it failed to slow progression of symptoms in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer. Making matters worse for Opdivo, researchers earlier this month said Merck's rival Keytruda prolonged the life of similar patients, and on Monday, it became the first of new immunotherapy drugs approved in the United States for initial lung cancer treatment. The company said it authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program, in addition to the $1.1 billion remaining under an authorization in 2012. And it predicted flat operating expenses through 2020, which analysts said should help profit margins. "We believe today's updates should begin to address Wall Street concerns on Bristol's near-term earnings outlook" in the wake of Opdivo's setbacks, JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. Sales of Yervoy, an older melanoma treatment, jumped 19 percent to $285 million, $45 million above expectations, while sales of leukemia treatment Sprycel grew 15 percent to $472 million, $25 million above forecasts. Eliquis, used to prevent blood clots and partnered with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), jumped 90 percent to $884 million, $71 million above expectations, helped by compelling clinical trial data. It was not immediately clear how much of an impact price increases had on sales of Bristol-Myers drugs. Bristol-Myers earned $1.2 billion, or 72 cents per share in the quarter, compared with $706 million, or 42 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue jumped 21 percent to $4.9 billion, about $200 million above forecasts. Excluding special items, it earned 77 cents per share, well above expectations of 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Despite Bristol-Myers' rally on Thursday, its shares have fallen 31 percent since the unfavorable Opdivo lung cancer data was reported on Aug. 5.

Reese, MD at Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, on Oct. 6, 2016. Hendricks received a kidney transplant from a donor with hepatitis C, and took medications after surgery that cleared away the virus and left her feeling healthy again. Hendricks is part of a pilot study testing if new drugs that promise to cure most hepatitis C could allow use of organs that today go to waste, and speed transplants to people who might otherwise die waiting. (AP Photo/Jessica Kourkounis) WASHINGTON (AP) — Some patients facing a years-long wait for a kidney transplant are jumping ahead in line thanks to a startling experiment: They’re agreeing to an organ almost sure to infect them with hepatitis C. Knowingly transmitting a dangerous virus may sound drastic but two leading transplant centers are betting the strategy will save lives — if new medications that promise to cure hepatitis C allow use of organs that today go to waste. Pilot studies are under way at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University to test transplanting kidneys from deceased donors with hepatitis C into recipients who don’t already have that virus. If the research eventually pans out, hundreds more kidneys — and maybe some hearts and lungs, too — could be transplanted every year. “We always dreaded hepatitis C,” said Dr. Peter Reese, a Penn kidney specialist who is helping lead the research. “But now hepatitis C is just a different disease,” enough to consider what he calls the tradeoff of getting a new kidney years faster but one that comes with a hopefully treatable infection. It’s a tradeoff prompted by the nation’s organ shortage. More than 99,000 people are on the national kidney waiting list but only about 17,000 people a year get a transplant and 4 percent a year die waiting, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). “If we had enough organs, we wouldn’t do this,” said Dr. Niraj Desai, who is leading the Hopkins study. But, “most patients are pretty open to the idea once they hear what the alternatives are.” Doctors had told Irma Hendricks, 66, to expect at least a five-year wait for a kidney transplant. Dialysis three times a week was keeping the East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, woman alive but left her with no energy for even routine activities. “I call it the zombie syndrome,” she said. So she jumped at the chance to enroll in Penn’s study, even though doctors made clear they hoped for but couldn’t guarantee a hepatitis cure. “My son said, ‘Mom, this is a no-brainer. Just do it,'” Hendricks said, She swallowed an anti-hepatitis pill daily for three months, in addition to the usual post-transplant medications. Testing showed the drugs rapidly cleared hepatitis C out of her bloodstream. And with her new kidney functioning well, she now has enough energy to play with her toddler grandson. “This is giving people in my situation new hope,” Hendricks said. Kidney transplant specialists are closely watching the research. “It makes sense to me,” said Dr. Matthew Cooper, a transplant surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, who is not involved in the research. He cautioned that the studies should use only kidneys that are young and otherwise high-quality, and that patients must understand the risks. “They need to know you place their safety as the highest priority,” Cooper said. “But at the same time, recognize that we have these obstacles. We don’t want people to die on dialysis and there are not enough organs available for everybody.” Hepatitis C is a simmering infection that, if untreated, over two to three decades can quietly destroy someone’s liver. At least 2.7 million people in the U.S. have chronic hepatitis C. Until a few years ago, it was treatable only by medications with grueling side effects and poor cure rates. Now, breakthrough drugs promise to cure 95 percent of hepatitis C cases with fewer side effects — for people who can afford them. Treatment costs tens of thousands of dollars. Normally, hepatitis C-infected organs are transplanted only into patients who already have hepatitis C themselves, so as not to further spread the virus. Giving hepatitis C-positive organs to hepatitis C-negative recipients is allowed if the patient agrees, but it’s rare, said Dr. David Klassen, UNOS’ chief medical officer. UNOS statistics show a few dozen such transplants, mostly kidneys, last year, presumably when doctors feared their patients wouldn’t survive the wait for a healthier organ. More often, hospitals discard hepatitis C-infected organs. Reese and fellow Penn transplant surgeon Dr. David Goldberg found only 37 percent of hepatitis C-positive kidney donations between 2005 and 2014 were transplanted. The discards could have helped more than 4,000 patients during that time period, they reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. And the opioid epidemic is prompting a jump in donations from people who died of drug overdoses — typically young organs that, absent an infection risk, would be sought after. The small Penn and Hopkins trials are a first step; much larger studies are needed to prove if more routine use of these organs in immune-suppressed transplant recipients really works. Cost also is a question. Merck & Co. is helping to fund the pilot trials, donating its medication Zepatier, which costs $54,000 for a round of treatment. That’s still cheaper than a lifetime of a dialysis, which costs about $75,000 a year, UNOS’ Klassen noted. While the studies began with kidneys because of their demand, “I don’t think there’s any reason, if it proves safe and effective in kidneys, that we wouldn’t want to try it in other organs,” noted Penn’s Goldberg. Even if the hepatitis C-infected organs prove useful, the nation still is “desperate for more donors,” cautioned Hopkins’ Desai. “It’s a practical solution to help some of the people. It won’t solve the problem.” Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) More Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to send this to your Kindle device (Opens in new window) Related Posts Vitamin D deficiency is widely overestimated, doctors warn Wife of real-life ‘Fault in Our Stars’ couple dies days after husband TNT’s Craig Sager hangs tough in leukemia battle Toddler with cancer who completed bucket list passes away Advertisement « Previous Story — Next Story » Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Knowingly transmitting a dangerous virus may sound drastic but two leading transplant centers are betting the strategy will save lives — if new medications that promise to cure hepatitis C allow use of organs that today go to waste. Pilot studies are under way at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University to test transplanting kidneys from deceased donors with hepatitis C into recipients who don’t already have that virus. If the research eventually pans out, hundreds more kidneys — and maybe some hearts and lungs, too — could be transplanted every year. “We always dreaded hepatitis C,” said Dr. Peter Reese, a Penn kidney specialist who is helping lead the research. “But now hepatitis C is just a different disease,” enough to consider what he calls the tradeoff of getting a new kidney years faster but one that comes with a hopefully treatable infection. It’s a tradeoff prompted by the nation’s organ shortage. More than 99,000 people are on the national kidney waiting list but only about 17,000 people a year get a transplant and 4 percent a year die waiting, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). “If we had enough organs, we wouldn’t do this,” said Dr. Niraj Desai, who is leading the Hopkins study. But, “most patients are pretty open to the idea once they hear what the alternatives are.” Doctors had told Irma Hendricks, 66, to expect at least a five-year wait for a kidney transplant. Dialysis three times a week was keeping the East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, woman alive but left her with no energy for even routine activities. “I call it the zombie syndrome,” she said. So she jumped at the chance to enroll in Penn’s study, even though doctors made clear they hoped for but couldn’t guarantee a hepatitis cure. “My son said, ‘Mom, this is a no-brainer. Just do it,'” Hendricks said, She swallowed an anti-hepatitis pill daily for three months, in addition to the usual post-transplant medications. Testing showed the drugs rapidly cleared hepatitis C out of her bloodstream. And with her new kidney functioning well, she now has enough energy to play with her toddler grandson. “This is giving people in my situation new hope,” Hendricks said. Kidney transplant specialists are closely watching the research. “It makes sense to me,” said Dr. Matthew Cooper, a transplant surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, who is not involved in the research. He cautioned that the studies should use only kidneys that are young and otherwise high-quality, and that patients must understand the risks. “They need to know you place their safety as the highest priority,” Cooper said. “But at the same time, recognize that we have these obstacles. We don’t want people to die on dialysis and there are not enough organs available for everybody.” Hepatitis C is a simmering infection that, if untreated, over two to three decades can quietly destroy someone’s liver. At least 2.7 million people in the U.S. have chronic hepatitis C. Until a few years ago, it was treatable only by medications with grueling side effects and poor cure rates. Now, breakthrough drugs promise to cure 95 percent of hepatitis C cases with fewer side effects — for people who can afford them. Treatment costs tens of thousands of dollars. Normally, hepatitis C-infected organs are transplanted only into patients who already have hepatitis C themselves, so as not to further spread the virus. Giving hepatitis C-positive organs to hepatitis C-negative recipients is allowed if the patient agrees, but it’s rare, said Dr. David Klassen, UNOS’ chief medical officer. UNOS statistics show a few dozen such transplants, mostly kidneys, last year, presumably when doctors feared their patients wouldn’t survive the wait for a healthier organ. More often, hospitals discard hepatitis C-infected organs. Reese and fellow Penn transplant surgeon Dr. David Goldberg found only 37 percent of hepatitis C-positive kidney donations between 2005 and 2014 were transplanted. The discards could have helped more than 4,000 patients during that time period, they reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. And the opioid epidemic is prompting a jump in donations from people who died of drug overdoses — typically young organs that, absent an infection risk, would be sought after. The small Penn and Hopkins trials are a first step; much larger studies are needed to prove if more routine use of these organs in immune-suppressed transplant recipients really works. Cost also is a question. Merck & Co. is helping to fund the pilot trials, donating its medication Zepatier, which costs $54,000 for a round of treatment. That’s still cheaper than a lifetime of a dialysis, which costs about $75,000 a year, UNOS’ Klassen noted. While the studies began with kidneys because of their demand, “I don’t think there’s any reason, if it proves safe and effective in kidneys, that we wouldn’t want to try it in other organs,” noted Penn’s Goldberg. Even if the hepatitis C-infected organs prove useful, the nation still is “desperate for more donors,” cautioned Hopkins’ Desai. “It’s a practical solution to help some of the people. It won’t solve the problem.” ___ Associated Press Writer Michael Rubinkam contributed to this report.

Home Markets World markets Stocks decline with oil as Apple tumbles on forecast; Bonds fall Stocks decline with oil as Apple tumbles on forecast; Bonds fall A barrage of uninspiring outlooks from bellwethers including Apple Inc. and Bayer AG sent global equities down. Oil slumped. By: Bloomberg | Published: October 27, 2016 5:43 AM The MSCI All Country World Index posted a back-to-back slide as oil retreated after data showed an unexpected decrease in US stockpiles was centered on the West Coast. (Bloomberg) A barrage of uninspiring outlooks from bellwethers including Apple Inc. and Bayer AG sent global equities down. Oil slumped. The MSCI All Country World Index posted a back-to-back slide as oil retreated after data showed an unexpected decrease in US stockpiles was centered on the West Coast. Yields on two-year Treasuries, the most sensitive to Federal Reserve expectations, rose to the highest since June as traders bet on tighter policy by December. Italian bonds led losses in the euro-area as a glut of supply from governments and companies weighed on the market. Equities have failed to gain momentum since the start of the earnings season as traders grapple with disappointing forecasts from behemoths including Apple, Intel Corp. and 3M Co. amid uneven economic data. Meanwhile, investors have assessed the likely trajectory of interest rates and the outcome of U.S. presidential elections, with the next Fed meeting and the vote both due in November. “Apple earnings were probably in line with expectations, but nevertheless are going to subtract from the S&P,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Milwaukee-based Robert W. Baird. “The markets typically trade defensively in October before an election anyway, I expect more of the same. The market is going to go lower before it goes higher. It’s going to require a springboard and that springboard requires slightly lower prices.” Stocks MSCI’s global gauge of equities fell 0.2 percent at 4 p.m. in New York, extending this month’s slide to 1.3 percent. The S&P 500 Index retreated 0.2 percent to 2,139.43, after swinging between gains and losses. Apple sank 2.3 percent after predicting holiday sales that barely topped analyst estimates amid the first annual revenue drop since 2001. The KBW Bank Index rose to its best level this year, while Boeing Co. surged after reporting a jump in profit. Among shares moving on earnings news: Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. sank to a three-year low as results missed estimates. Southwest Airlines Co. slid after saying a revenue measure may worsen this quarter. Biogen Inc. rallied after its quarterly profit topped estimates. Mondelez International Inc. rose after boosting its earnings forecast. Northrop Grumman Corp. climbed to a record after raising its earnings outlook. Akamai Technologies Inc. and Juniper Networks Inc. surged on better-than-predicted profits. Losses worsened in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, which dropped the most in more than a week, as firms from Bayer to builder Vinci SA reported disappointing earnings. Antofagasta Plc led miners down after forecasting a slide in copper production next year. Industrial shares led declines on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index as South Korea’s industrial-goods makers fell amid speculation there will be more job losses. Bonds Treasuries fell as BlackRock Inc.’s Rick Rieder said he considers a December Fed hike a done deal. Traders are pricing in a 73 percent probability of tighter policy by year-end, according to futures data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on two-year notes rose for a fifth day, while a gauge of the yield curve steepened as reports showed U.S. wholesale inventories rose more than expected while the service sector expanded more than forecast, boosting the outlook for economic growth. Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields rose four basis points to 1.79 percent. Italy’s 10-year yield climbed to the highest since June after the country sold inflation-linked debt due in 2024 and 2026. The selloff deepened, with similar-maturity U.K. bond yields approaching the most since the Brexit vote, after the Bank of England said Tuesday there were limits to officials’ willingness to look beyond an overshoot of their inflation target. Gilts also declined after Britain sold securities due in July 2065 via banks on Tuesday. Portugal auctioned bonds for the first time since DBRS Ltd. maintained the nation’s rating as investment grade. Germany added to the supply, selling five-year notes, while companies including Merck & Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. sold bonds. The Treasury in Rome plans to auction as much as 8.5 billion euros of debt on Oct. 28. Mozambique’s Eurobonds slumped to a record for a second day after the government hired advisers to negotiate a restructuring that at least one adviser said could involve write downs for investors. Currencies The euro advanced from a seven-month low on signs the European economy may be improving enough to reduce pressure on the European Central Bank to further ease monetary policy. The shared currency rose 0.2 percent to $1.0907. “The recent data has been positive,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in London. “That helps to bring some sense of stability into the euro.” Bloomberg’s Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 major peers, rose 0.2 percent. Mexico’s peso slid as a Bloomberg poll showed U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton in Florida. South Africa’s rand slipped as Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan delivered a mid-term budget speech that highlighted downgrades to growth estimates, wider budget deficits and shortfalls in tax collection. The real fell as a drop in commodities outweighed optimism with another victory in Congress for President Michel Temer. Commodities Oil futures for December delivery fell 1.6 percent to settle at $49.18 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent for December settlement slipped 1.6 percent to $49.98 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Nationwide crude stockpiles fell 553,000 barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projected a gain and the American Petroleum Institute data showed an increase. Supplies along the West Coast decreased to the lowest since January 2015. But the region is sometimes ignored by traders because its distribution system is isolated from the rest of the country. “This is a sloppy market,” said Adam Wise, who helps run a $7 billion oil and natural gas bond and private equity portfolio at John Hancock in Boston. “News and changes of sentiment can easily send it moving into the opposite direction. We have mixed signals from today’s data.” Copper capped its longest stretch of gains this month as a run on stockpiles boosted speculation that demand for the metal is increasing.

We've long known stress can wreak havoc on your mind and body. It has the potential to hurt your heart, your immune system, and even your memory. In an extreme case of stress-induced memory loss, a woman in England forgot her name, her husband's identity, and nearly everything else about her life after a nervous breakdown, The Daily Mail reports. Marie Coe, 55, was working upwards of 70 hours a week in a demanding job running an events company in the U.K., traveling constantly, all while also juggling a family and taking care of her household. One day, after she'd gone missing for 24 hours and couldn't remember anything, she asked a stranger at a gas station for help. An ambulance came, and she couldn't answer any of the paramedics' questions. After a CT scan revealed no head injuries, the doctors diagnosed her with "stress-induced amnesia,"according to The Daily Mail. This is, apparently, a real thing: Memory loss caused by extreme stress or trauma is actually "dissociative amnesia," according to Merck Manuals. It seems to run in families, according to The Cleveland Clinic. It can cause someone to forget everything, as with Coe, or it can concern specific areas of the sufferer's life. Sometimes, a person with the condition will forget who they are and go on to assume an entirely new identity without realizing it (this is known as "dissociative fugue."). When Coe's husband Mark picked her up from the hospital, she had no idea who he was. She didn't even know she was married. "It was terrifying sitting in the car with a strange man who claimed he was my husband," she told The Daily Mail. In a scenario reminiscent of 50 First Dates, he told her about their relationship and showed her photos of their grandchildren, and they got to know each other all over again — while living together. "Although it was frightening, it was exciting at the same time. Like a first date," she told the paper. "I looked at Mark's kind face and smiling eyes and knew I could see why the old me had fallen in love with him... We had romantic dinners together and talked and laughed until the small hours of the morning." She turned to hypnosis and meditation to regain her memory and manage her stress. These are common treatments for dissociative amnesia, along with individual and family therapy, art and music therapy, and sometimes medication, according to The Cleveland Clinic. The hypnotist explained to her that the amnesia was her brain's way of shutting down when she didn't allow it any other way to rest. Coe has since learned to practice better self-care. She closed her business and got a less demanding job in order to reduce her stress. "I've realized you can't give from an empty cup, so I look after myself rather than running myself ragged for everyone else's sake," she said. She still suffers from short-term memory problems, but her long-term memory is back. The silver lining of all this is that the incident has strengthened Coe's relationship with her husband. "When Mark said he'd look after me in sickness and in health, he really meant it," she said. "When I look back to that day in [the] hospital, I think I'd always hoped that man they were telling me was my hubby, as he was handsome and had a twinkle in his eye. I know he really is the man for me because I fell in love with him twice — and that must mean he's the one." Advertisement How To Deal With Stress • Mind • Wellness Illustrated by Tyler Spangler.

He could stay on chemo and face the high risk of relapse associated with his particular disease, or he could undergo a blood or bone marrow transplant, which would offer the best chance of a cure but put him at risk for severe complications. To help guide the decision, Frederick Appelbaum, an expert in clinical research at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and other doctors there used a new diagnostic test that analyzed the patient’s own cancer DNA, as well as the genetic makeup of his immune cells, and then used that information to detect whether trace amounts of the disease remained after his treatment. That’s something standard diagnostic tests can’t do well. The new test revealed leukemia cells still lurking in the patient’s body, so he opted for the transplant, despite the additional risk. He’s now in remission, says Appelbaum. A T cell from the immune system of a person in good health. The diagnostic test, called ClonoSEQ, is the first product introduced by Adaptive Biotechnologies, which was founded in 2009 by brothers Chad and Harlan Robins. (Appelbaum is an advisor to Adaptive.) Harlan originally came up with the concept for the test at Hutchinson, where he holds a faculty position. His idea was to use DNA sequencing to scrutinize the genes of T and B cells, which are the building blocks of the immune system. Unlike other cells in the body, T and B cells constantly reshuffle their DNA in response to pathogens in their environment. Adaptive’s technology is designed to detect those changes—essentially tracking the immune responses of individual patients over time. The idea of sequencing the DNA of immune cells is still in its infancy and pursued mostly by academics and a handful of companies, so Adaptive must establish demand for a whole new category of test. In the past seven years, working with his brother Chad, a Wharton MBA and experienced executive, Robins has raised more than $400 million from a cadre of A-list investors including Matrix Capital Management, biotechnology giant Celgene, and Illumina, the leading maker of gene-sequencing technology. Understanding the immune system has become a priority in oncology research, particularly with the recent success of a class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which block proteins in the body that would normally prevent the immune system from recognizing and fighting cancer. Two leading examples are Merck’s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, used to treat melanoma, lung cancer, and other tumor types. Many more checkpoint inhibitors are being developed, as are other immune approaches, such as removing T cells from patients and engineering them to attack their specific cancers (see 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2016: Immune Engineering). Such immune-based treatments have improved the prognosis for some cancer patients, but others don’t respond to them at all—and scientists have not yet figured out why. “Oncologists had been trying to figure out how to coöpt the immune system to help kill cancer for 40 years, and finally they’re finding success,” Robins says. For treatments like checkpoint inhibitors to be effective, he explains, there must first be an existing immune response in the tumor. Adaptive’s technology measures that response. Illumina sees Adaptive’s approach as the next frontier in gene sequencing, says John Leite, vice president of marketing for Illumina’s oncology business, in addition to looking for genetic mutations in cancer cells that may help patients respond to particular therapies. Adaptive has shown that its test can be much more sensitive to disease than other tools, such as the cell-counting technology called flow cytometry. The insights gained from sequencing immune cells may include identifying which patients are most likely to respond to a particular immuno-oncology drug, pinpointing other drugs that might be effectively used in combination with that treatment, and suggesting what order the drugs should be taken in for best results, says Chad Robins. In January Adaptive formed a partnership with Pfizer aimed at identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from the immuno-oncology drugs the company is developing. And it is working with other large pharmaceutical companies as well. Beyond cancer, the technology could be useful in treating other diseases with a strong immune component, including autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, the Robinses say. It could be helpful in controlling infectious diseases, too. The brothers won’t reveal their pricing strategy for ClonoSEQ or future products, but they believe they’ll ultimately be able to prove that immuno-sequencing lowers costs by reducing the risk of disease recurrence and helping patients avoid expensive treatments that are unlikely to work for them. To prove the value of its test to oncologists, Adaptive has worked with scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, to study its use in patients with melanoma, myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma. Last year the company opened a research center in San Diego that’s using its system to generate ideas for new drugs. The ability to genetically profile immune cells is part of a larger push in oncology to scrutinize the cells and tissues that coexist with cancer and affect its ability to persist, says Jill O’Donnell-Tormey, chief executive officer and director of scientific affairs at the Cancer Research Institute in New York. Surviving cancer, she says, “is about what is happening not just in the tumor, but in the immune cells.” From Our Advertisers In partnership with Dynatrace Emerging Trend Analysis: What is Digital Performance Management?

Shares, which have climbed 4.2% in the past 12 months, rose 2.1% to $292 in premarket trading. The vast majority of Biogen's revenue comes from multiple sclerosis drugs that some analysts see as growing relatively slowly. Cambridge, Mass.-based Biogen has focused its research-and-development efforts on new treatments for multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The firm is spinning off its hemophilia drug business, where sales have been rising at a faster clip but make up a smaller chunk of total revenue. Sales of its biggest drug, Tecfidera, grew 10% its latest quarter and drove growth. Tecfidera brought in $1.03 billion during the period, representing roughly 41% of product revenue. The company said the MS drug was helped by inventory build. Meanwhile, the company's two hemophilia drugs grew at a much faster pace, and brought in a combined $217 million. Chief Executive George Scangos announced in July he would be leaving the company, allowing a new chief to lead the company as it works to reignite growth. The biotechnology giant has also drawn takeover interest from drug companies such as Merck Co. and Allergan PLC, The Wall Street Journal reported in August. Overall for the third quarter, Biogen reported a profit of $1.03 billion, or $4.71 a share, up from $965.6 million, or $4.15 a share, a year earlier. Excluding the restructuring charges, among other items, per-share earnings rose to $5.19 from $4.48. Total revenue rose 6% to $2.96 billion. Analysts had projected adjusted earnings of $4.97 a share on sales of $2.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.

A drop in the price of oil below $50 a barrel, lingering uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election and growing expectations of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, also contributed to the downbeat mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 53.76 points, or 0.3%, at 18,169.27, as shares of Home Depot weighed on blue-chips with a 3.2% decline. Earlier, the average had been down as many as 71 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index gave up 26.45 points, or 0.5%, to wrap at 5,283.40. The S&P 500 declined by 8.17 points, or 0.4%, to 2,143.16. Nine of the 11 main sectors ended in the red. The consumer-discretionary closed off 1.2%, while materials lost 1%. Shares of Dow component 3M fell 2.9% after reporting earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company posted sales that were flat relative to the prior year and reduced the top end of its yearly earnings forecast. Market participants have been wrestling with third-quarter earnings that have outperformed lowered expectations, but a number of companies have cut their annual outlooks, which has raised questions about future earnings. Investors were eager to find out the results from two of the tech giants this week, with Apple reporting after the closing bell on Tuesday. Traders continued to eye economic data for hints on the prospects for a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase before the end of the year. Higher rates tend to send investors away from precious metals into investments that carry a yield. A reading on consumer confidence Tuesday showed a decline to 98.6 in October, a three-month low, from 103.5 in September. The FHFA Housing Price Index for August rose 0.7%, which followed an increase of 0.5% in July. Separately, the Case-Shiller 20-city Home Price Index for August rose 5.1%, which fell in-line with the consensus. This followed the previous month's unrevised reading of 5.0%. Shares in Whirlpool dropped 11% after the appliance maker reported third-quarter profit and sales that missed expectations, and issued a downbeat outlook. Merck & Co. rose 2% after the drugmaker's third-quarter earnings and sales came in above expectations. Chemicals maker DuPont& Co. shares fell 0.7% despite the company raising its yearly profit forecast and better-than-expected quarterly earnings. The company is working on its merger with Dow Chemical. Procter & Gamble gained 3.4% after the consumer goods company reported earnings ahead of forecasts. Lockheed Martin shares jumped 7.4% after the aerospace company posted higher-than-expected revenue and hiked its dividend. Baker Hughes shares rallied 4.3% after the oil-field services company reported a narrower-than-expected loss. General Motors shares ended down 4.2% even as auto giant's quarterly profit doubled. GM also posted higher revenue on strong U.S. truck sales. But it signaled continued weakness in Europe because of the fallout from the U.K.'s pending exit from the European Union, or Brexit. Crude futures fell on Tuesday, 25 October 2016 with prices in New York settling below $50 a barrel for the first time in just over a week, pressured by the possibility that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' plan to curb output will fail after Iraq signaled unwillingness to take part in the proposed deal. December West Texas Intermediate crude fell by 56 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $49.96 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the lowest settlement and first finish below $50 since 17 October 2016. OPEC members in late September reached a preliminary agreement to limit the group's daily production to between 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day. Bullion prices ended higher at Comex on Tuesday, 25 october 2016. Gold futures settled Tuesday at their highest level in about three weeks, rebounding from the previous day's decline as uncertainty ahead of the U.S. presidential election, some weakness in the U.S. dollar and a fall in domestic equities boosted the metal's appeal. December gold rose $9.90, or 0.8%, to settle at $1,273.60 an ounce. Prices settled at their highest level since 3 October 2016. Prices are still down about 3.1% so far this month. December silver gained 17.6 cents, or 1%, to $17.78 an ounce. Treasuries finished on a mixed note with the short end of the curve underperforming. The yield on the 2-yr note rose two basis points to 0.86% while the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note ended down one basis point at 1.76%. Today's trading volume was below the average of 853 million as 819 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will include the weekly MBA Mortgage Index and International Trade in Goods for September, which will be released at 7:00 ET and 8:30 ET, respectively.

At the age of 11, while babysitting for a Lawn Doctor franchise owner, she was asked to help out after the children went to bed by making phone calls to schedule lawn evaluation appointments. Armed with a phone book, Caryn quickly learned that using the right words and connecting with the right person was the difference between a successful call and a "no-go." She also learned not to give up. A graduate of J.P. Stevens High School in Edison, that early experience helped her launch a successful business development company. Kopp Consulting's Door Opener Service helps b2b clients access the sales opportunities they wouldn't otherwise access so they can close more sales. Today, Kopp Consulting, has evolved into a MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR BUSINESS and has earned a spot on the prestigious NJ Biz Fast 50 list as one of the state's 50 most successful and fastest growing private companies, an honor most every NJ business strives to achieve. "I am proud and honored to be included among the community of high-growth companies but I'm mostly proud of the growth we've contributed to our clients' businesses," says Caryn Kopp, Founder and Chief Door Opener at Kopp Consulting. Recently, two New Jersey based Door Opener clients, TeamPar and Phoenix Marketing Solutions, each closed sales of over $1 million dollars as a direct result of their partnership with Kopp's Door Opener Service. Additionally, one of Kopp's clients, GD (General Devices) has also won the 2016 NJ Fast 50 Award. One of Kopp's technology clients targeting C level executives in large media and entertainment companies had meetings with ABC, NBC, Universal, HBO, Cable Vision and the list goes on, due to Door Opener strategies. "We grew this company because we are a team of high level, strategic business developers who create the right sales messaging and work to personally engage decision makers. We get our clients more of the initial conversations and meetings they can't get on their own. Our proprietary strategies work and clients keep coming back for more because we're helping them grow their businesses and give them access to sales opportunities they previously only dreamed about," adds Caryn. Many companies struggle with their own sales and sales teams, quarter after quarter, year after year. Kopp's proprietary Door Opener Service, Strategic Sales Insights and trademarked Moment of Yes Sales Message Development Process pave the way for clients to have a seat at the table with high profile, difficult to reach prospects. These introductions help Kopp clients accelerate profitable sales and eliminate the barriers to success they previously experienced. "When clients achieve success like adding over $5 million dollars in new revenue to their businesses, increasing close ratios from 20% to 48% or being included in RFPs AFTER the RFP process officially closed, we know we're doing business development right!" says Kopp. The NJBIZ recognition follows Kopp Consulting being featured on the 2016 Inc. 5000, being selected as Smart CEO Future 50 recipient and being named Sales Outsourcing Provider of the Year. We're very proud to be honored with the NJ Biz Fast 50 status, thankful for our wonderful clients and the magic our Door Openers create for our clients every day," said Kopp. About Kopp Consulting Inc.

A faster transplant but a kidney with hepatitis C Associated Press | WASHINGTON (AP) — A bold experiment is giving some patients a chance at cutting years off their wait for a kidney transplant if they agree to a drastic-sounding option — getting an organ almost sure to infect them with hepatitis C. Betting on new medications that promise to cure hepatitis C, two leading transplant centers aim to use organs that today go to waste, a bid to put a dent in the nation's long transplant waiting list. Pilot studies are underway at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University to test transplanting kidneys from deceased donors with hepatitis C into recipients who don't already have that virus. If the groundbreaking research eventually pans out, hundreds more kidneys — and maybe some hearts and lungs, too — could be transplanted every year. "We always dreaded hepatitis C," said Dr. Peter Reese, a Penn kidney specialist who is helping lead the research. "But now hepatitis C is just a different disease," enough to consider what he calls the trade-off of getting a new kidney years faster but one that comes with a hopefully treatable infection. It's a trade-off prompted by an organ shortage. More than 99,000 people are on the national kidney waiting list, but only about 17,000 people a year get a transplant and 4 percent a year die waiting, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). "If we had enough organs, we wouldn't do this," said Dr. Niraj Desai, who is leading the Hopkins study. But, Desai said, "most patients are pretty open to the idea once they hear what the alternatives are." Doctors had told 66-year-old Irma Hendricks of East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, to expect at least a five-year wait for a kidney transplant. Dialysis three times a week was keeping her alive, but leaving her with no energy for even routine activities. "I call it the zombie syndrome," she said. She jumped at the chance to enroll in Penn's study, even though doctors made clear they hoped for but couldn't guarantee a hepatitis cure. "My son said, 'Mom, this is a no-brainer. Just do it,'" Hendricks said. She swallowed an anti-hepatitis pill daily for three months, in addition to the usual post-transplant medications. Testing showed the drugs rapidly cleared hepatitis C out of her bloodstream. With her new kidney functioning well, she now has enough energy to play with her toddler grandson. "This is giving people in my situation new hope," Hendricks said. Kidney transplant specialists are closely watching the research. "It makes sense to me," said Dr. Matthew Cooper, a transplant surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital who is not involved in the research. He cautioned that the studies should use only kidneys that are young and otherwise high-quality, and that patients must understand the risks. "They need to know you place their safety as the highest priority," Cooper said. "But at the same time, recognize that we have these obstacles. We don't want people to die on dialysis, and there are not enough organs available for everybody." Hepatitis C is a simmering infection that, if untreated, over two to three decades can quietly destroy someone's liver. At least 2.7 million people in the United States have chronic hepatitis C. Until a few years ago, it was treatable only by medications with grueling side effects and poor cure rates. Now, breakthrough drugs promise to cure 95 percent of hepatitis C cases with fewer side effects — for people who can afford them. Treatment costs tens of thousands of dollars. Normally, hepatitis C-infected organs are transplanted only into patients who already have hepatitis C themselves, so as not to further spread the virus. Giving hepatitis C-positive organs to hepatitis C-negative recipients is allowed if the patient agrees, but it's rare, said Dr. David Klassen, UNOS' chief medical officer. UNOS statistics show a few dozen such transplants, mostly kidneys, last year, presumably when doctors feared their patients wouldn't survive the wait for a healthier organ. More often, hospitals discard hepatitis C-infected organs. Reese and fellow Penn physician Dr. David Goldberg found only 37 percent of hepatitis C-positive kidney donations between 2005 and 2014 were transplanted. The discards could have helped more than 4,000 patients during that time period, they reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. The opioid epidemic is prompting a jump in donations from people who died of drug overdoses — typically young organs that, absent an infection risk, would be sought after. The small Penn and Hopkins trials are a first step. Much larger studies are needed to prove whether more routine use of these organs in immune-suppressed transplant recipients really works. Cost also is a question. Merck & Co. is helping to fund the pilot trials, donating its medication Zepatier, which costs $54,000 for a round of treatment. That's still cheaper than a lifetime of a dialysis, which costs about $75,000 a year, UNOS' Klassen noted. While the studies began with kidneys because of their demand, "I don't think there's any reason, if it proves safe and effective in kidneys, that we wouldn't want to try it in other organs," Penn's Goldberg noted. Even if the hepatitis C-infected organs prove useful, the nation still is "desperate for more donors," cautioned Hopkins' Desai. "It's a practical solution to help some of the people. It won't solve the problem." ___ Associated Press writer Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania contributed to this report. © 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The discards could have helped more than 4,000 patients during that time period, they reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. The opioid epidemic is prompting a jump in donations from people who died of drug overdoses — typically young organs that, absent an infection risk, would be sought-after. The small Penn and Hopkins trials are a first step. Much larger studies are needed to prove whether more routine use of these organs in immune-suppressed transplant recipients really works. Cost also is a question. Merck & Co. is helping to fund the pilot trials, donating its medication Zepatier, which costs $54,000 for a round of treatment. That’s still cheaper than a lifetime of a dialysis, which costs about $75,000 a year, UNOS’ Klassen noted. While the studies began with kidneys because of their demand, “I don’t think there’s any reason, if it proves safe and effective in kidneys, that we wouldn’t want to try it in other organs,” Penn’s Goldberg noted. Even if the hepatitis C-infected organs prove useful, the nation still is “desperate for more donors,” cautioned Hopkins’ Desai. “It’s a practical solution to help some of the people. It won’t solve the problem.” Filed under: Health Print Email Gmail Related New Rules Bringing Kidneys to Hardest-to-Transplant Patients Kidneys, Cash and Caring Transplant Chains Let Strangers Give Kidney Patients New Life Police Shut Down Gang That Traded in Organs FDA Approves Breakthrough Hepatitis C Drug Subscribe to the Hamodia print edition More in Technology Life-Saving Technology for Autos Is Here, Just Not in Most Cars Intel Launches $6 Billion Production Line in Kiryat Gat Vroom: Gov’t to Require Hybrid, Electric Cars to Make Noise Samsung’s $8B Ticket Into the Red-Hot Automotive Tech Race It’s Not All in the Genes: Clean Living Can Cut Heart Risks OP-ED A Seriously Trumped-Up Charge Time for Conservatives to Come Together To Support Our New President Trump Voters: We Did Hear You – We Just Thought Better of You Without Calculations To Many, Trump Offered Fresh, Appealing Message Kristallnacht Lessons for the Present Sanctity of the Kosel Is Everyone’s Concern Spreading the Light of Shabbos Ripe Citrons and Ruby Slippers Reflections Of A Kohen A Time to Heal There’s a Strong Case to Be Made for Electoral College Voting as a Rational Act These Ballot Initiatives Could Help Fix Our Broken Election System Features This Day In History 13 Cheshvan/November 14 Sudoku – November 14, 2016 Helping Pre-Teenagers Nichum Aveilim 13 Cheshvan/November 14 Mrs. Rivka Herbst (Part IV) Editorial Cartoon – November 14, 2016 Get the Point Please Do Me a Favor Independence Mishmeres HaSholom: Ask the Rav This Day In History 10 Cheshvan/November 11 Not So Sure מרן ה”חזון איש” זי”ע Editorial Cartoon – November 11, 2016 Weather » Brooklyn 59°F Clear See more locations » Stocks » NASDAQ 5,218.40 -18.72 (-0.36%) S&P 500 2,164.20 -0.25 (-0.01%) See more stocks » Currency » EUR 0.9302 GBP 0.8001 ILS 3.8462 CHF 0.9955 See more currencies » Got a news tip, picture or story to share?

(AP Photo/Jessica Kourkounis) WASHINGTON (AP) — A bold experiment is giving some patients a chance at cutting years off their wait for a kidney transplant if they agree to a drastic-sounding option — getting an organ almost sure to infect them with hepatitis C. Betting on new medications that promise to cure hepatitis C, two leading transplant centers aim to use organs that today go to waste, a bid to put a dent in the nation's long transplant waiting list. Pilot studies are underway at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University to test transplanting kidneys from deceased donors with hepatitis C into recipients who don't already have that virus. If the groundbreaking research eventually pans out, hundreds more kidneys — and maybe some hearts and lungs, too — could be transplanted every year. "We always dreaded hepatitis C," said Dr. Peter Reese, a Penn kidney specialist who is helping lead the research. "But now hepatitis C is just a different disease," enough to consider what he calls the trade-off of getting a new kidney years faster but one that comes with a hopefully treatable infection. It's a trade-off prompted by an organ shortage. More than 99,000 people are on the national kidney waiting list, but only about 17,000 people a year get a transplant and 4 percent a year die waiting, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). "If we had enough organs, we wouldn't do this," said Dr. Niraj Desai, who is leading the Hopkins study. But, Desai said, "most patients are pretty open to the idea once they hear what the alternatives are." Doctors had told 66-year-old Irma Hendricks of East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, to expect at least a five-year wait for a kidney transplant. Dialysis three times a week was keeping her alive, but leaving her with no energy for even routine activities. "I call it the zombie syndrome," she said. She jumped at the chance to enroll in Penn's study, even though doctors made clear they hoped for but couldn't guarantee a hepatitis cure. "My son said, 'Mom, this is a no-brainer. Just do it,'" Hendricks said. She swallowed an anti-hepatitis pill daily for three months, in addition to the usual post-transplant medications. Testing showed the drugs rapidly cleared hepatitis C out of her bloodstream. With her new kidney functioning well, she now has enough energy to play with her toddler grandson. "This is giving people in my situation new hope," Hendricks said. Kidney transplant specialists are closely watching the research. "It makes sense to me," said Dr. Matthew Cooper, a transplant surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital who is not involved in the research. He cautioned that the studies should use only kidneys that are young and otherwise high-quality, and that patients must understand the risks. "They need to know you place their safety as the highest priority," Cooper said. "But at the same time, recognize that we have these obstacles. We don't want people to die on dialysis, and there are not enough organs available for everybody." Hepatitis C is a simmering infection that, if untreated, over two to three decades can quietly destroy someone's liver. At least 2.7 million people in the United States have chronic hepatitis C. Until a few years ago, it was treatable only by medications with grueling side effects and poor cure rates. Now, breakthrough drugs promise to cure 95 percent of hepatitis C cases with fewer side effects — for people who can afford them. Treatment costs tens of thousands of dollars. Normally, hepatitis C-infected organs are transplanted only into patients who already have hepatitis C themselves, so as not to further spread the virus. Giving hepatitis C-positive organs to hepatitis C-negative recipients is allowed if the patient agrees, but it's rare, said Dr. David Klassen, UNOS' chief medical officer. UNOS statistics show a few dozen such transplants, mostly kidneys, last year, presumably when doctors feared their patients wouldn't survive the wait for a healthier organ. More often, hospitals discard hepatitis C-infected organs. Reese and fellow Penn physician Dr. David Goldberg found only 37 percent of hepatitis C-positive kidney donations between 2005 and 2014 were transplanted. The discards could have helped more than 4,000 patients during that time period, they reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. The opioid epidemic is prompting a jump in donations from people who died of drug overdoses — typically young organs that, absent an infection risk, would be sought after. The small Penn and Hopkins trials are a first step. Much larger studies are needed to prove whether more routine use of these organs in immune-suppressed transplant recipients really works. Cost also is a question. Merck & Co. is helping to fund the pilot trials, donating its medication Zepatier, which costs $54,000 for a round of treatment. That's still cheaper than a lifetime of a dialysis, which costs about $75,000 a year, UNOS' Klassen noted.

Even if the hepatitis C-infected organs prove useful, the nation still is "desperate for more donors," cautioned Hopkins' Desai. "It's a practical solution to help some of the people.

(AP / Jessica Kourkounis) Lauren Neergaard, The Associated Press Published Thursday, October 27, 2016 4:00AM EDT Last Updated Thursday, October 27, 2016 11:04AM EDT WASHINGTON -- Some patients facing a years-long wait for a kidney transplant are jumping ahead in line thanks to a startling experiment: They're agreeing to an organ almost sure to infect them with hepatitis C.

UNOS statistics show a few dozen such transplants, mostly kidneys, last year, presumably when doctors feared their patients wouldn't survive the wait for a healthier organ. More often, hospitals discard hepatitis C-infected organs. Reese and fellow Penn transplant surgeon Dr. David Goldberg found only 37 per cent of hepatitis C-positive kidney donations between 2005 and 2014 were transplanted. The discards could have helped more than 4,000 patients during that time period, they reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. The opioid epidemic is prompting a jump in donations from people who died of drug overdoses -- typically young organs that, absent an infection risk, would be sought after. The small Penn and Hopkins trials are a first step. Much larger studies are needed to prove if more routine use of these organs in immune-suppressed transplant recipients really works. Cost also is a question. Merck & Co. is helping to fund the pilot trials, donating its medication Zepatier, which costs $54,000 for a round of treatment. That's still cheaper than a lifetime of a dialysis, which costs about $75,000 a year, UNOS' Klassen noted. While the studies began with kidneys because of their demand, "I don't think there's any reason, if it proves safe and effective in kidneys, that we wouldn't want to try it in other organs," noted Penn's Goldberg. Even if the hepatitis C-infected organs prove useful, the nation still is "desperate for more donors," cautioned Hopkins' Desai. "It's a practical solution to help some of the people. It won't solve the problem." ------ Associated Press writer Michael Rubinkam contributed to this report.

They're agreeing to an organ almost sure to infect them with hepatitis C. Knowingly transmitting a dangerous virus may sound drastic but two leading transplant centers are betting the strategy will save lives - if new medications that promise to cure hepatitis C allow use of organs that today go to waste. Pilot studies are under way at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University to test transplanting kidneys from deceased donors with hepatitis C into recipients who don't already have that virus.  If the research eventually pans out, hundreds more kidneys - and maybe some hearts and lungs, too - could be transplanted every year. Scroll down for video  Success: Irma Hendricks received a kidney transplant from a donor with hepatitis C, and took medications after surgery that cleared away the virus and left her feeling healthy again. She is pictured with her grandson CJ at her home in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis A never progresses to a chronic infection like hepatitis B and C. But C is the only one for which there is no preventative vaccine. Spread through contaminated blood, hepatitis C tends to develop into a chronic infection after six months. The infection attacks the liver, leading to cirrhosis or liver cancer. 'We always dreaded hepatitis C,' said Dr Peter Reese, a Penn kidney specialist who is helping lead the research.  'But now hepatitis C is just a different disease,' enough to consider what he calls the tradeoff of getting a new kidney years faster but one that comes with a hopefully treatable infection. It's a tradeoff prompted by the nation's organ shortage.  More than 99,000 people are on the national kidney waiting list but only about 17,000 people a year get a transplant and four per cent a year die waiting, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). 'If we had enough organs, we wouldn't do this,' said Dr. Niraj Desai, who is leading the Hopkins study.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next How killer superbugs like MRSA are being spread around... Cancers survivors are TWICE as likely to be on... Share this article Share But, 'most patients are pretty open to the idea once they hear what the alternatives are.' Doctors had told Irma Hendricks, 66, to expect at least a five-year wait for a kidney transplant.  Dialysis three times a week was keeping the East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, woman alive but left her with no energy for even routine activities. 'I call it the zombie syndrome,' she said. So she jumped at the chance to enroll in Penn's study, even though doctors made clear they hoped for but couldn't guarantee a hepatitis cure. 'My son said, 'Mom, this is a no-brainer. Just do it,'' Hendricks said, She swallowed an anti-hepatitis pill daily for three months, in addition to the usual post-transplant medications.  WHAT IS HEPATITIS C?  Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver.  Hepatitis A never progresses to a chronic infection like hepatitis B and C.  But hepatitis C is the only one for which there is no preventative vaccine. Spread through contaminated blood, hepatitis C tends to develop into a chronic infection after six months. The infection attacks the liver, leading to cirrhosis or liver cancer. Testing showed the drugs rapidly cleared hepatitis C out of her bloodstream. And with her new kidney functioning well, she now has enough energy to play with her toddler grandson. 'This is giving people in my situation new hope,' Hendricks said. Kidney transplant specialists are closely watching the research. 'It makes sense to me,' said Dr Matthew Cooper, a transplant surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, who is not involved in the research.  He cautioned that the studies should use only kidneys that are young and otherwise high-quality, and that patients must understand the risks. 'They need to know you place their safety as the highest priority,' Cooper said.  'But at the same time, recognize that we have these obstacles. We don't want people to die on dialysis and there are not enough organs available for everybody.' Hepatitis C is a simmering infection that, if untreated, over two to three decades can quietly destroy someone's liver.  At least 2.7 million people in the U.S. have chronic hepatitis C. Until a few years ago, it was treatable only by medications with grueling side effects and poor cure rates.  Now, breakthrough drugs promise to cure 95 per cent of hepatitis C cases with fewer side effects - for people who can afford them. Treatment costs tens of thousands of dollars. Normally, hepatitis C-infected organs are transplanted only into patients who already have hepatitis C themselves, so as not to further spread the virus. Giving hepatitis C-positive organs to hepatitis C-negative recipients is allowed if the patient agrees, but it's rare, said Dr David Klassen, UNOS' chief medical officer.  UNOS statistics show a few dozen such transplants, mostly kidneys, last year, presumably when doctors feared their patients wouldn't survive the wait for a healthier organ.

Knowingly transmitting a dangerous virus may sound drastic but two leading transplant centers are betting the strategy will save lives — if new medications that promise to cure hepatitis C allow use of organs that today go to waste. Pilot studies are under way at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University to test transplanting kidneys from deceased donors with hepatitis C into recipients who don’t already have that virus. If the research eventually pans out, hundreds more kidneys — and maybe some hearts and lungs, too — could be transplanted every year. “We always dreaded hepatitis C,” said Dr. Peter Reese, a Penn kidney specialist who is helping lead the research. “But now hepatitis C is just a different disease,” enough to consider what he calls the tradeoff of getting a new kidney years faster but one that comes with a hopefully treatable infection. It’s a tradeoff prompted by the nation’s organ shortage. More than 99,000 people are on the national kidney waiting list but only about 17,000 people a year get a transplant and 4 percent a year die waiting, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). “If we had enough organs, we wouldn’t do this,” said Dr. Niraj Desai, who is leading the Hopkins study. But, “most patients are pretty open to the idea once they hear what the alternatives are.” Doctors had told Irma Hendricks, 66, to expect at least a five-year wait for a kidney transplant. Dialysis three times a week was keeping the East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, woman alive but left her with no energy for even routine activities. “I call it the zombie syndrome,” she said. So she jumped at the chance to enroll in Penn’s study, even though doctors made clear they hoped for but couldn’t guarantee a hepatitis cure. “We always dreaded hepatitis C. But now hepatitis C is just a different disease.” — Dr. Peter Reese “My son said, ‘Mom, this is a no-brainer. Just do it,'” Hendricks said, She swallowed an anti-hepatitis pill daily for three months, in addition to the usual post-transplant medications. Testing showed the drugs rapidly cleared hepatitis C out of her bloodstream. And with her new kidney functioning well, she now has enough energy to play with her toddler grandson. “This is giving people in my situation new hope,” Hendricks said. Kidney transplant specialists are closely watching the research. “It makes sense to me,” said Dr. Matthew Cooper, a transplant surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, who is not involved in the research. He cautioned that the studies should use only kidneys that are young and otherwise high-quality, and that patients must understand the risks. “They need to know you place their safety as the highest priority,” Cooper said. “But at the same time, recognize that we have these obstacles. We don’t want people to die on dialysis and there are not enough organs available for everybody.” Hepatitis C is a simmering infection that, if untreated, over two to three decades can quietly destroy someone’s liver. At least 2.7 million people in the U.S. have chronic hepatitis C. Until a few years ago, it was treatable only by medications with grueling side effects and poor cure rates. Now, breakthrough drugs promise to cure 95 percent of hepatitis C cases with fewer side effects — for people who can afford them. Treatment costs tens of thousands of dollars. Normally, hepatitis C-infected organs are transplanted only into patients who already have hepatitis C themselves, so as not to further spread the virus. Giving hepatitis C-positive organs to hepatitis C-negative recipients is allowed if the patient agrees, but it’s rare, said Dr. David Klassen, UNOS’ chief medical officer. UNOS statistics show a few dozen such transplants, mostly kidneys, last year, presumably when doctors feared their patients wouldn’t survive the wait for a healthier organ. More often, hospitals discard hepatitis C-infected organs. Reese and fellow Penn transplant surgeon Dr. David Goldberg found only 37 percent of hepatitis C-positive kidney donations between 2005 and 2014 were transplanted. The discards could have helped more than 4,000 patients during that time period, they reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. And the opioid epidemic is prompting a jump in donations from people who died of drug overdoses — typically young organs that, absent an infection risk, would be sought after. The small Penn and Hopkins trials are a first step; much larger studies are needed to prove if more routine use of these organs in immune-suppressed transplant recipients really works. Cost also is a question. Merck & Co. is helping to fund the pilot trials, donating its medication Zepatier, which costs $54,000 for a round of treatment. That’s still cheaper than a lifetime of a dialysis, which costs about $75,000 a year, UNOS’ Klassen noted. While the studies began with kidneys because of their demand, “I don’t think there’s any reason, if it proves safe and effective in kidneys, that we wouldn’t want to try it in other organs,” noted Penn’s Goldberg. Even if the hepatitis C-infected organs prove useful, the nation still is “desperate for more donors,” cautioned Hopkins’ Desai. “It’s a practical solution to help some of the people. It won’t solve the problem.” ___ Associated Press Writer Michael Rubinkam contributed to this report.

Meanwhile there will be 28% fewer health insurance providers for 2017, as major insurers like Aetna (AET), UnitedHealthcare (UNH) and Humana (HUM) withdraw from the exchange. Rising premiums in a shrinking marketplace is only one health challenge that Americans face. That’s true whether they are covered in the marketplace or through their employer, the VA or another source. Factor in the cost of co-pays, deductibles and life-saving medications, and your pocketbook is getting crushed from every direction. That’s especially true if you’re one of the 3-in-5 Americans who take prescription drugs. In fact, you may already be reeling from their skyrocketing costs. In the U.S., we now spend over $309 billion on prescription drugs every single year. That’s a rise of over 38% in just the last two years! This staggering price increase isn’t because people are using more meds, though. It’s because pharmaceutical companies can get away with charging more. And hospitals, doctors and patients who need the medicine have little choice except to pay up. Both generic and branded drug prices are increasing as well, eliminating once-more-affordable alternatives. And the most-expensive drugs aren’t necessarily new and innovative miracle cures. In fact, many are commonly used and have been on the market for decades. For Americans, prescription drugs are becoming one of the biggest financial burdens we face. Especially for retirees who could never have predicted or planned for this. You really only have two options when a medicine you take increases in price: 1. Make monetary sacrifices elsewhere to afford the new rate, or 2. Stop taking the drugs altogether and face the consequences. For most people, option two isn’t even an option. If you’ve been reading my Afternoon Editions for any length of time, you know that I am a fan of free markets, free minds and the free choice of individuals to do what they want with their hard-earned money. That also means having a healthy dose of skepticism when it comes to government solutions that come in the forms of more laws and regulations. Especially when the biggest beneficiaries aren’t the citizens themselves … Consider that Big Pharma has spent $3.4 billion in federal lobbying since 1998 — more than any other industry — to get lawmakers on the payroll and make sure no one gets in their way. One of the most-famous cases of pharmaceutical price-gouging came in late 2015. That was when Martin Shkreli, now-former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, raised the price of the drug Daraprim by 5,000%. Although price hikes like this have happened before, Shkreli instantly became public enemy No. 1 for his complete lack of empathy toward consumers. Unapologetic to this day, the former CEO doubled down on his decision by saying, "I would have raised prices even higher." Related story: A Smirk of Defiance, or Just Dumb Hubris? Daraprim is used to treat a rare condition known as toxoplasmosis. It is only prescribed to around 2,000 patients in the U.S. For as notorious as Shkreli has become, not that many people use Daraprim and thus were mostly affected by the increase. Then there is pharmaceutical supplier Mylan (MYL), which took the price-hiking practice much further when it raised the prices of its popular allergen injection, the EpiPen. Mylan acquired the decades-old product in 2007 when pharmacies paid less than $100 for a two-pen set. Since then, the company has been steadily raising the price of this life-saving device. Related story: Price-gouging; the Senator’s Daughter; Cover from Washington In 2009, a pharmacy paid $103.50 for a set. By July 2013 the price was up to $264.50, and it rose 75% to $461 by last May. This May, the price spiked again to $608.61. Unlike the small group effected by the Daraprim increase, 3.6 million Americans were prescribed EpiPens last year. This type of price hike has a much greater impact and has affected the livelihood of millions of families in the U.S. Meanwhile, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch’s annual compensation has soared more than 700%, to $19 million. These examples, while extreme, are far from unusual … Take a look at some of the other recent price increases involving the most-prescribed drugs in America …  Pfizer’s pain medication Lyrica jumped 45% on a per-prescription basis between 2014 and 2013, according to Medicare data.  Lantus, a popular form of insulin, jumped 41% on a per-prescription basis, reaching $403 in 2014 from $285 in the prior year.  Merck’s cholesterol medication, Zetia, had a 21% jump in per-prescription prices in 2014, rising to $290.  Abilify, used to treat a number of psychiatric illnesses, rose 17% in the last year. It’s not like this is happening behind closed doors, either. But there is something we can do about it. And it starts at the ballot box. Now, I know many of you are frustrated with what’s happening at the national political level, and I don’t blame you. However, there are state and local races where you can also make your voice heard. California is voting this upcoming November on Proposition 61, which would enact various forms of price regulation. A similar type of bill is being voted on in Ohio in 2017. If radical drug price increases are something you or a loved one have fallen victim to, please share your story with us. Happy and healthy investing, Brad Hoppmann Your thoughts on “60% of Americans to Pay Up as Prescriptions Get Pricier” Paul says: October 27, 2016 at 9:04 am I am not an American but I don’t need to face this problem because I don’t believe in drugs. At my age of 83, all i take are supplements that have made me healthy. I’ve been wondering why doctors, I suppose everywhere, never teach people to take supplements to keep healthy. There are various supplements to help prevent illness. But then, if everybody is healthy who will need the doctors and the big pharmaceuticals? Reply Gary says: October 27, 2016 at 9:55 am And one other thing. There is a legal alternative to standard health insurance that was included as an option in ObamaCare. That means that if you have this sort of sharing of medical expenses you are not penalized for not having conventional health insurance. You can read about it here: http://www.naturalhealth365.com/obamacare-healthcare-2014.html. The person who started this company three years ago is interviewed there. I don’t know enough about it to say it is financially workable or that I think that the program is for me or anyone else. Only if I see the details will I be able to endorse it. Reply Michelle says: October 27, 2016 at 10:15 am A member of my family takes Enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis. It has increased in a few years from $18,000/year to $55,000/year. Enbrel is heavily advertised along with other similar drugs like Humira. There is an increase at least quarterly and I expect this to continue. All drugs will eventually have a huge increase until the country is pushed into a recession. Corporations that self insure will have to lay off employees to pay these pharmaceutical companies. Then people who defend with the “R&D is expensive” and this is “free market” will be singing a different tune as they clean out their office and are escorted out of the building. Reply thomas says: October 29, 2016 at 11:16 am i had taken Enbrel from Amgen, but it was not discovered by them they bought out a one horse pony Co who in their labs discovered it. And that’s a fact, i lived in NJ where this was all happening, we where told to invest in this little Co because it was going to be bought out. There was soo much demand from Embrel for that only people who had been using it could get it, I was one of those people, insurance paid it all and it wasn’t that expensive. Then Amgen built a new factory to produce it, by then my doctors told me to go to Humira because one only needs to inject every 2 weeks, but later it was once a week as it lost effectiveness or my condition worsened. that;s the story folks believe it or not. Reply Mark says: October 27, 2016 at 11:07 am Forget government price controls. We need the ultimate price control and that is competition. Terminate the patent protection on drugs and drug delivery systems whenever a company violates the public trust. That will get their attention.

The vaccine was one of the stars of GSK's third-quarter results, which benefited from the weakness of sterling but nevertheless outperformed expectations, defying critics who have called for a shift away from the company's high-volume, low-margin business focus. Revenues came in at £7.54bn ($9.21bn) in the quarter - around £300m more than consensus forecasts - driven by a "standout performance" from vaccines as well as gains for GSK's HIV drugs and a recovery in respiratory sales. For some time the back story at GSK has been the loss of patent protection for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease blockbuster Advair/Seretide (salmeterol and fluticasone). The product continued to slide, but newer drugs such as Anoro (vilanterol/umeclidinium bromide), Breo (vilanterol/fluticasone furoate) and new severe asthma therapy Nucala (mepolizumab) more than offset the decline, with total respiratory sales up 8%. Downward pricing pressure on Advair over the last few years, as well as GSK's broad portfolio of drugs, could allow it to make a compelling case to keep Advair on US formularies after the patent expires next year, according to GSK chief executive Sir Andrew Witty. GSK is also getting ready to file its much anticipated triple COPD therapy before the end of the year, which along with the rest of the portfolio "puts us in a very interesting position to have a competitive dynamic in the US," he said. Bexsero meanwhile brought in £133m in the quarter, with annual volume now running at around 10m doses this year, up from 2.5m a couple of years ago. That is making capacity "tight", said Witty, adding that the company is working hard to ramp that up so as not to put a brake on sales. Witty estimates that penetration of the vaccine is still only at around 10%, so "there is an awful lot of opportunity to go on a global basis". And with shingles vaccine Shingrix now filed for approval in the US and tipped for blockbuster sales, GSK's investment in the sector seems to be paying off, although it has suffered some setbacks as well. A few weeks ago the company ceded the US cervical cancer vaccine market to Merck & Co after withdrawing its Cervarix product, finding it was not competitive. There were some other disappointments in GSK's announcement, including decisions to terminate development of an HIV maturation inhibitor partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and COPD candidate losmapimod, which had reached phase II testing. Witty said the company has back-up maturation inhibitors coming through and he does not expect a lengthy delay to the programme. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

(AP Photo/Jessica Kourkounis) By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — Some patients facing a years-long wait for a kidney transplant are jumping ahead in line thanks to a startling experiment: They’re agreeing to an organ almost sure to infect them with hepatitis C. Knowingly transmitting a dangerous virus may sound drastic but two leading transplant centers are betting the strategy will save lives — if new medications that promise to cure hepatitis C allow use of organs that today go to waste. Pilot studies are under way at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University to test transplanting kidneys from deceased donors with hepatitis C into recipients who don’t already have that virus. If the research eventually pans out, hundreds more kidneys — and maybe some hearts and lungs, too — could be transplanted every year. “We always dreaded hepatitis C,” said Dr. Peter Reese, a Penn kidney specialist who is helping lead the research. “But now hepatitis C is just a different disease,” enough to consider what he calls the tradeoff of getting a new kidney years faster but one that comes with a hopefully treatable infection. It’s a tradeoff prompted by the nation’s organ shortage. More than 99,000 people are on the national kidney waiting list but only about 17,000 people a year get a transplant and 4 percent a year die waiting, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). “If we had enough organs, we wouldn’t do this,” said Dr. Niraj Desai, who is leading the Hopkins study. But, “most patients are pretty open to the idea once they hear what the alternatives are.” Doctors had told Irma Hendricks, 66, to expect at least a five-year wait for a kidney transplant. Dialysis three times a week was keeping the East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, woman alive but left her with no energy for even routine activities. “I call it the zombie syndrome,” she said. So she jumped at the chance to enroll in Penn’s study, even though doctors made clear they hoped for but couldn’t guarantee a hepatitis cure. “My son said, ‘Mom, this is a no-brainer. Just do it,’” Hendricks said, She swallowed an anti-hepatitis pill daily for three months, in addition to the usual post-transplant medications. Testing showed the drugs rapidly cleared hepatitis C out of her bloodstream. And with her new kidney functioning well, she now has enough energy to play with her toddler grandson. “This is giving people in my situation new hope,” Hendricks said. Kidney transplant specialists are closely watching the research. “It makes sense to me,” said Dr. Matthew Cooper, a transplant surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, who is not involved in the research. He cautioned that the studies should use only kidneys that are young and otherwise high-quality, and that patients must understand the risks. “They need to know you place their safety as the highest priority,” Cooper said. “But at the same time, recognize that we have these obstacles. We don’t want people to die on dialysis and there are not enough organs available for everybody.” Hepatitis C is a simmering infection that, if untreated, over two to three decades can quietly destroy someone’s liver. At least 2.7 million people in the U.S. have chronic hepatitis C. Until a few years ago, it was treatable only by medications with grueling side effects and poor cure rates. Now, breakthrough drugs promise to cure 95 percent of hepatitis C cases with fewer side effects — for people who can afford them. Treatment costs tens of thousands of dollars. Normally, hepatitis C-infected organs are transplanted only into patients who already have hepatitis C themselves, so as not to further spread the virus. Giving hepatitis C-positive organs to hepatitis C-negative recipients is allowed if the patient agrees, but it’s rare, said Dr. David Klassen, UNOS’ chief medical officer. UNOS statistics show a few dozen such transplants, mostly kidneys, last year, presumably when doctors feared their patients wouldn’t survive the wait for a healthier organ. More often, hospitals discard hepatitis C-infected organs. Reese and fellow Penn transplant surgeon Dr. David Goldberg found only 37 percent of hepatitis C-positive kidney donations between 2005 and 2014 were transplanted. The discards could have helped more than 4,000 patients during that time period, they reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. And the opioid epidemic is prompting a jump in donations from people who died of drug overdoses — typically young organs that, absent an infection risk, would be sought after. The small Penn and Hopkins trials are a first step; much larger studies are needed to prove if more routine use of these organs in immune-suppressed transplant recipients really works. Cost also is a question. Merck & Co. is helping to fund the pilot trials, donating its medication Zepatier, which costs $54,000 for a round of treatment. That’s still cheaper than a lifetime of a dialysis, which costs about $75,000 a year, UNOS’ Klassen noted. While the studies began with kidneys because of their demand, “I don’t think there’s any reason, if it proves safe and effective in kidneys, that we wouldn’t want to try it in other organs,” noted Penn’s Goldberg. Even if the hepatitis C-infected organs prove useful, the nation still is “desperate for more donors,” cautioned Hopkins’ Desai. “It’s a practical solution to help some of the people. It won’t solve the problem.” ——— Associated Press Writer Michael Rubinkam contributed to this report.

The small Penn and Hopkins trials are a first step; much larger studies are needed to prove if more routine use of these organs in immune-suppressed transplant recipients really works. Cost also is a question. Merck & Co. is helping to fund the pilot trials, donating its medication Zepatier, which costs $54,000 for a round of treatment. That’s still cheaper than a lifetime of a dialysis, which costs about $75,000 a year, UNOS’ Klassen noted. While the studies began with kidneys because of their demand, “I don’t think there’s any reason, if it proves safe and effective in kidneys, that we wouldn’t want to try it in other organs,” noted Penn’s Goldberg. Even if the hepatitis C-infected organs prove useful, the nation still is “desperate for more donors,” cautioned Hopkins’ Desai. “It’s a practical solution to help some of the people. It won’t solve the problem.” ___ Associated Press Writer Michael Rubinkam contributed to this report.

The adoption of western culture and changing lifestyle in the developing countries, such as India and China, has increased the adoption of pet animals, which supports the growth of the animal healthcare market. Pet ownership is considered as status symbol in the developing countries. Cats and dogs are adopted by people for psychological and therapeutic benefits. The evolution of new animal diseases offers untapped opportunities for the animal healthcare market. One such disease is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which is caused by corona virus, and leads to infection within the cell lining in the small intestine of pigs. The trend of adopting pets is increasing globally, which is supporting the growth of the global animal healthcare market to some extent. The adoption of western culture and changing lifestyles in the developing countries, such as India and China, has increased the adoption of pet animals. One of the major status symbols observed in the developing countries is pet ownership. The American Psychological Association published a survey in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2011, which shows that dog and cat owners in the U.S. were observed to be healthier, happier, and well-organized, in comparison to the non-owners. The dog and cat owners were also mentally more conscientious, balanced, extraverted, and less fearful. Dogs are also kept for thief detection and security reasons. Due to the growing population of the U.S., pet ownership doubled from 65 million households in 1970 and reached approximately 160 million households in 2012. According to the American Pet Products Association (APPA), in 2012, 47% of the total households had at least one dog within their families in the U.S. There were also 83.3 million owned-dogs within the country in the same year. Additionally, there were 46% of the total households having at least one cat, and 96 million owned-cats in the country in 2012. Australia is one of the countries having the highest rate of pet ownership globally. According to the Australian Veterinary Association, in 2013, there were 4.2 million dogs and 3.3 million cats accounting for 39% and 29% market shares respectively in the country. Approximately 27% of the dogs and 20% of the cats in the country have been insured with health insurance by their owners. Some of the transmissible diseases, such as zoonosis, in vertebrate animals can be transferred indirectly or directly to humans. If consumers digest worm through undercooked or raw infected fish, they can get infected with anisakiasis. In animals, food borne zoonotic diseases are spread due to consuming food or water contaminated with pathogenic microorganism, such as campylobacter, brucellosis, listeria, parasites, anisakiasis, and salmonella. The increasing prevalence of zoonotic and food borne diseases has raised the concern of animal farm owners and pet owners for the health of their animals. In the U.S. and other countries, brucellosis (bacterial infection) is increasing, which causes still birth or abortion in animals. The bacterial infection generally affects goats and livestock animals, such as cows and sheep. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), about 320,000 cases of zoonotic and food borne diseases are registered every year in the European Union. The most common zoonosis observed in animals is campylobacteriosis, which affected around 220,000 people in 2012 in the European Union (EU) countries. Due to animal care initiatives taken by the animal owning population in the European Union countries, the salmonellosis cases in humans had decreased by 5.4% during 2010-2012. Some of the major companies operating in the global animal healthcare market include Zoetis, Merck, Merial, Bayer, Virbac, Ceva Sante Animal S.A., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Elanco, and Vetoquinol.

The Wall Street Journal: Faith-Based Investor Group Calls For Drugmakers To Be Transparent On Pricing A group of 300 institutional investors, including many with ties to religious organizations, is waging a new campaign to press drugmakers to justify their price increases. The investors, members of the New York-based Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, are asking 17 drug companies—including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc. and Merck & Co.—to be more transparent about when and why they raise prices. (Loftus, 10/24) Stat: Interfaith Investor Coalition Pushes Shareholder Resolutions On Drug Prices In the latest bid to put a lid on rising drug costs, a coalition of 300 institutional investors has filed shareholder resolutions with 11 big US drug makers to explain and justify all price increases and the risks these may pose to stockholders. At the same time, the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility also wrote six large European companies to schedule talks about transparency around their pricing. The resolutions ask the companies to issue reports by November that list the rates of price increases for all of their top-selling brand-name medicines between 2010 and 2016, along with the rationale and criteria used to raise prices. (Silverman, 10/24) Roll Call: FDA Approval Changes Could Affect Drug Prices Upcoming changes to the Food and Drug Administration’s reviews for generic drugs could have an impact on drug prices if they help introduce more competition to the market. In separate public meetings on Thursday and Friday, FDA officials discussed their plans for renewing the programs that charge generic drugmakers a fee to go through the application process. The FDA has been scrutinized for aspects of its generic approval programs that critics contend prevent cheaper generic therapies from coming to market. (Siddons, 10/24) The Fiscal Times: Prescription Drug Prices Headed For Double-Digit Increases In 2017 Specialty drugs get a lot of attention when it comes to higher costs, although price increases are occurring across the board. Specialty drug prices are projected to increase 18.7 percent next year (after growing 18.9 percent in 2016). Although they comprise less than 1 percent of prescriptions, specialty drugs account for 35 percent of the prescription drug price trend, according to HR Consultancy Segal. Meanwhile, the overall cost of all drugs prescribed for employees under age 65 is expected to grow 11.6 percent next year, on top of an 11.3 percent hike this year. (Braverman, 10/24) Stat: FDA Official Warns Other Drug Makers Not To Copy Sarepta Any company that plans to mimic the approach taken by Sarepta Therapeutics to win regulatory approval of a drug should think twice. That was the blunt message delivered on Tuesday by a high-ranking US Food and Drug Administration official in the wake of simmering controversy over a recent decision to approve a Sarepta drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and fatal disease. (Silverman, 10/20) Stat: Elizabeth Warren Criticizes Feds For A 'Shamefully Weak' Deal With Mylan For the third time this month, a US senator is harshly criticizing a deal that Mylan Pharmaceuticals reached with the US Department of Justice for shortchanging Medicaid over rebates for its EpiPen device, which sparked national outrage after a series of price hikes. In an Oct. 21 letter, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) complained to US Attorney General Loretta Lynch that the $465 million settlement “fails to hold Mylan accountable” and is “shockingly soft on this corporate wrongdoer,” because Mylan did not admit any wrongdoing, none of its executives were penalized, and the company can deduct the payment from its corporate taxes. (Silverman, 10/24) Bloomberg: Senator Warren Says Mylan Settlement With DOJ ‘Shamefully Weak’ Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is the latest critic of the $465 million settlement that drugmaker Mylan NV said it reached with the federal government over Medicaid rebates for its EpiPen allergy shot. In a letter Friday to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the Democratic senator wrote that her staff calculated Mylan underpaid Medicaid rebates by an estimated $530 million -- $65 million more than the settlement -- mostly because Mylan didn’t pay the required inflation rebate. Warren wrote the settlement with the Department of Justice is “shamefully weak” because it lacks criminal penalties or any incentive to “prevent drug companies from engaging in abusive schemes to defraud Medicaid and rip off taxpayers.” (Hopkins, 10/21) Stat: Senator Richard Burr, A Pharma Favorite, Gets Help From His Friends If you leave the American Tobacco Trail and drive east, past Dame’s Almost Famous Chicken & Waffles, Bullock’s Bar-B-Que, and the Truly Blessed Hair Salon, you will eventually come to the world’s largest research park. This 16-square-mile stretch of Piedmont pine forest is home to about 200 companies that develop drugs and devices, run clinical trials, and otherwise push the boundaries of bioscience. GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co., and Biogen all have offices here, as do other industry leaders and startups. This is Burr country. (Kaplan, 10/25) Stat: EpiPen Prescriptions Continue To Climb, But Market Share Dropped EpiPen may be a budget buster for some households, but new data indicates prescriptions for the allergy emergency device are outpacing last year’s figures. At the same time, though, more prescriptions were written recently for lower-cost alternatives and, as a result, last month marked the first time in three years that EpiPen’s share of prescriptions for such devices fell. The number of prescriptions written for the auto-injector in August rose 19 percent from the same month a year ago. Overall, the number of prescriptions are up 14 percent through September, compared with the same period in 2015. In fact, there were 40 percent more prescriptions written in the first nine months of this year compared with 2013, even as the price for EpiPen was rising, according to Athenahealth, which provides technology services to physicians. (Silverman, 10/25) Stat: Congressman Calls For Probe Into Valeant's Pricing Of Lead Poisoning Drug The huge increase in the price of a lifesaving lead poisoning treatment has prompted a Michigan lawmaker to call for a congressional investigation into Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Two years ago, the drug maker boosted the list price for Calcium EDTA by roughly 2,700 percent. After Valeant bought the drug in 2013 as part of a deal in which it took over another company, the list price for a package of vials started rising quickly. After being stable at $950, Valeant raised the price several times before closing out 2014 at more than $26,900. (Silverman, 10/21) The Fiscal Times: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High  An analysis jointly published this week by the Center for Responsive Politics and FairWarning, a non-profit news organization, highlights the political clout exerted by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a major industry group, and some of the largest U.S. drug companies. Since early 2003, the drug manufacturing industry spent more than $1.9 billion on lobbying members of Congress on Medicare Part D and other issues important to the industry. In just 2015 and the first half of this year, the industry’s lobbying bill was equivalent to spending $468,108 on every member of Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. (Pianin, 10/20) Chicago Tribune: Drug Price Control? AbbVie, Takeda, Astellas Vote 'No' With Their Millions Three of the area's largest pharmaceutical companies are in the thick of an intense California-based battle over rising drug costs, a fight that could spread to Illinois and other states. AbbVie, Takeda and Astellas, along with other major drug companies, have contributed nearly $86 million toward an effort to defeat Proposition 61. That's an Election Day ballot referendum where voters decide yes or no about regulating prices of drugs purchased by some California agencies on behalf of 4.4 million people whose health care is covered by the state. (Reed, 10/21) The New York Times: Unicef Cuts Cost Of Vaccine That Protects Against 5 Diseases The United Nations Children’s Fund has made a deal with six vaccine manufacturers that will cut in half the price of a shot that protects children against five diseases, the fund announced last week. The deal will mean three years’ worth of vaccine at an average price of 84 cents a dose; buyers currently pay about $1.84, according to Unicef. (McNeil, 10/24) Columbus Dispatch: Middlemen Drive Up Prescription Drug Prices, Critics Say  The industry created to keep drug prices in check is capitalizing on a lack of government oversight to rake in huge profits — often at the expense of patients, health plans and pharmacies, critics say. Drugmakers such as Mylan have been the target of much consumer wrath after the cost of its EpiPen, used to treat potentially deadly reactions to food allergies and bee stings, rose by more than 500 percent in just a few years. But a lesser-known group of companies called pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, also play a critical role in driving up drug prices, said former state Rep. Tim Brown, a Bowling Green Republican. And not enough people know about it. (Pyle, 10/23) This is part of the KHN Morning Briefing, a summary of health policy coverage from major news organizations. Sign up for an email subscription.

If the results are positive it would represent a step forward in the treatment of Alzheimer's as well as a great parting gift for Lilly's chief executive John Lechleiter, who will retire at the end of the year after leading the company for eight years. There is no doubt that given the huge number of anti-amyloid drugs that have failed in trials solanezumab is a high-risk project, but Lilly's CEO-in-waiting David Ricks said that while it is possible that the drug will perform no better than placebo, he considers that the "least probable outcome". The company hasn't seen any preliminary data from the trial however. A win in the EXPEDITION3 trial could lead to rapid regulatory filings, said Ricks, and if approved could be a massive product for Lilly with analysts forecasting recently that sales could reach up to $7.5bn at peak. Many scientists continue to believe that amyloid is the main pathogenic factor responsible for the degenerative changes that occur in the brain during Alzheimer's, and if solanezumab does show any efficacy, it would be the first drug to support that hypothesis in a late-stage trial. Solanezumab failed to show a clear benefit in trials involving patients with more advanced Alzheimer's, but led to speculation that amyloid needs to be blocked early in the course of the disease in order to prevent the formation of plaques that seem to cause the neuronal damage that in turn leads to cognitive and memory decline. The company recently began another phase III trial of solanezumab in prodromal (very early) Alzheimer's that will have 2,500 subjects when fully enrolled. Results from that trial are due in 2021. Ricks said that if EXPEDITION3 is a bust the prodromal trial will probably be abandoned. The comments on solanezumab came during Lilly's third-quarter results call, in which it reported a sales increase of 5% to $5.2bn driven by new product launches. Among these, diabetes drugs Trulicity (dulaglutide) and Jardiance (empagliflozin) both saw solid sales gains that did not however meet analysts' expectations, while lung cancer therapy Cyramza (ramucirumab) fell 12% thanks to competition from immuno-oncology rivals, Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab). Initial sales of Taltz (ixekizumab), which was approved by the FDA in March for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, were $33m. The interleukin-17 (IL-17) inhibitor is chasing Novartis' Cosentyx (secukinumab), which has the same mechanism of action and made $301m in the third quarter.
