Thousands have attempted to file lawsuits against American pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. for problems associated with their product Zostavax. In an interview with TROFire.com, Troy Bouk, Associate Attorney at the Levin Papantonio law firm, stated that the side effects of the shingles vaccine included meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, palsy, and many others. According to Bouk, these side effects are all features of shingles—and with the vaccine created from a live strain of the virus, it’s no wonder that Zostavax has caused people to experience these conditions. Zostavax was approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Bouk said. The group has since recommended that only people 60 and above should take the vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on the other hand, approved Zostavax for people 50 and above, states TheFreeThoughtProject.com. The CDC has warned that people within the 50 to 59 age group may lose the alleged protection benefits of the vaccine by the time the reach 60, however. “Let’s say you’re 55 years old. It may stay in your system till you’re 60, but you actually are at the greatest risk of getting shingles when you’re in your 60s. That’s why the CDC recommends that you really don’t get it until you’re in your 60s, because that’s probably when you’re going to need it the most,” Bouk said. On the efficacy of the vaccine, the CDC has stated that it only reduced the risk of shingles by a mere 51 percent, making its true potency uncertain. This unpredictability is the reason why attorney Marc J. Bern of Marc J. Bern & Partners LLP has “thousands of complaints” that have yet to be filed in Philadelphia, Penn. In a statement to FiercePharma.com, Bern has said that the injuries run “the gamut from contracting shingles as a result of the vaccine all the way to serious personal injuries such as blindness in one eye, individuals who have serious paralysis in their extremities, brain damage, all the way to death.” In an additional comment, Bern stated that he thought “Merck has failed terribly … to warn about the very serious side effects and the failure of the vaccine to do what they claim it does.” (Related: Shingles vaccine made with pig gelatin, MSG and residual components of human DNA from an aborted fetus. Why?) Bern has said that his firm has been examining the drug “for quite some time”, and that the litigation has “merits.” The attorney has also expressed his belief that the cases should be grouped together for mass tort status. Another attorney, Michael Katz, agrees with Bern. In response, a spokesperson for Merck has stated that “Nothing is more important to Merck than the safety of our medicines and vaccines.” If that’s the case, then why are thousands of people experiencing ailments associated with the disease the vaccine is supposed to cure? Because it’s made from the same virus, that’s why. Is it wonder why Zostavax is causing more harm than good? News and other media concerning vaccines and drug companies can be read over at Vaccines.news and BigPharmaNews.com. Zostavax facts Zostavax was approved by the FDA in 2006. In 2016, Zostavax pulled in $749 million in sales for Merck. Currently, Zostavax is the only approved shingles vaccine in the United States. GlaxoSmithKline is working on a second shingles vaccine called Shingrix. The drug manufacturer is still seeking the approval of the FDA for their drug.

In the report, a TV ad campaign by the drug company Bristol-Myers is highlighted, which touts the benefits of the cancer drug Opdivo. The ad focuses on the phrase “the chance to live longer,” yet studies have shown that lung cancer patients taking Opdivo typically live only 3 months longer than those not taking the drug, offering marginal results, at best. Bristol-Myers isn’t the only pharmaceutical company overestimating the effectiveness of cancer therapies. Merck also claims their Keytruda drug allows cancer patients to live longer, touting statistics that indicate 71% of patients are alive at the time of follow up after taking the drug, compared to 58% of patients who received chemotherapy. Yet, Merck’s ads don’t indicate the followup time was only 11 months later. Ads like these and others, CNN reported, cause patients and families to feel overly optimistic about survival rates. Families buy into treatments that often don’t work, have poor results or cause severely debilitating, even deadly, side effects. While many early stage cancers are being diagnosed sooner and cured more quickly, most patients with advanced stages of cancer will die from the disease, and not many drug companies are talking about that. Instead, they raise patient’s hopes and indicate the “war on cancer” is being won by using revolutionary drugs or brand new treatments. Consumers are also often hit with illegal and misleading claims by manufacturers of products claiming to provide miracle “cures” for cancer, when in reality the products are unproven or completely fraudulent. Recently, the FDA issued warnings to 14 companies that sell 65 different products claiming to “cure” cancer. Costly Cancer Treatments Undergoing many of the specialized cancer treatments, or taking breakthrough drugs, involves a serious strain to a patient’s finances, forcing many families into bankruptcy during cancer treatments. The U.S. spent nearly $88 billion treating cancer in 2014. Patients spent nearly $4 billion in out-of-pocket expenses and the spending is predicted to increase, considering people as a whole are living longer. Similarly, hospital spending on cancer advertising increased more than 200 percent from $54 million in 2005 to $173 million in 2014. The Cancer Treatment Centers of America, a for-profit organization, settled a dispute with the Federal Trade Commission, which alleged they made false advertising claims concerning their cancer treatments. One of their commercials promises revolutionary cancer treatments, highlighting genomic testing to successfully treat cancer, by matching patients with drugs targeted to their tumor’s specific mutations. Statistics indicate the tests matched only 6.4% of patients with a drug. Only 1.5% of patents benefit from precision oncology. Yet, 60% of all cancer advertising was done by Cancer Treatment Centers of America. Immunotherapy is another treatment often advertised and promised as a “game changer” for patients. Only about 10 percent of patients actually benefit from immunotherapy, which typically causes serious nausea and flu-like symptoms, decreasing a patient’s quality of life during their final days. More so, immunotherapy treatments can cause deadly immune system attacks on the heart, lungs and kidneys. Hospitals and drug companies say advertising like this helps to inform patients and spark a conversation between the patient and the doctor. But many are worried the ads simply offer hope in treatments where hope shouldn’t be placed.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Insomnia Market to Record Sturdy Growth by 2026 The Insomnia Market report offers a comprehensive evaluation of the market. It does so via in-depth qualitative insights, historical data, and verifiable projections about market size. Global Insomnia Market: Brief Account The world insomnia market is envisaged to recoup promisingly from its drowsy growth in the past with a number of worthwhile and well-timed opportunities to take advantage of. Insomnia drugs could find an application in the treatment of Parkinson and Alzheimer’s disease as sedatives. The younger population can increase the global demand as intensively as the geriatric group with rising stress levels and persisting diseases such as cancer at the forefront. The launch of new products such as E-2006 by Eisai Co. Ltd. and Belsomra by Merck & Co. Inc. is forecasted to stimulate the market growth handsomely. Global Insomnia Market: Top Companies Some of the prominent companies functioning in the international insomnia market are Purdue Pharma L.P., Pernix Therapeutics, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., Sanofi, Pfizer, Inc., Meda Consumer Healthcare Inc., Merck & Co. Inc., and Eisai, Co. Ltd. Global Insomnia Market: Key Trends With the two premier categorizations of the worldwide insomnia market into play, viz. non-pharmacological treatments and pharmacological treatments, manufacturers can expect lucrative prospects from both the segments. The cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) listed under non-pharmacological treatments extends the ability of physicians to heal patients or understand their health issues in a comprehensive manner. Browse more detail information about insomnia market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/insomnia-market.html The international insomnia market could go through a downtime period due to inferior diagnosis rate, below par patient compliance, patent erosion, and ascendancy of generic products. Howbeit, the surging incidences of insomnia and unfulfilled medical needs, for instance, the inefficiency of central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are foreseen to compensate for the probable decline in growth. Global Insomnia Market: Geographical Study For the most part of the share in world insomnia market, the Americas including North America are foretold to showcase extensive dominance while offering some groundbreaking opportunities for global players. In the U.S., the OTC treatment market is anticipated to register a higher CAGR to address its growth in the insomnia pharmacological treatment sector.

The better-than-anticipated results from Opdivo, combined with bullish comments from executives on a conference call about quarterly results and an increase in the full-year forecast, sent the stock up as much as 4.4 percent Thursday. It was the biggest intraday gain since activist investors came onboard in February. The first-quarter results were a rare piece of good news since a clinical setback for Opdivo last August opened the door for rival treatments from Merck & Co. and Roche Holding AG to gain market share, sending Bristol-Myers’ stock spiraling down. After shares fell further following a reduction in the earnings outlook in January, hedge fun Jana Partners LLC disclosed a stake and, according to the Wall Street Journal, Carl Icahn bought shares too. “It’s kind of an abrupt reversal from cutting guidance and being so cautious to really blowing it out of the water there,” Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli & Co. who holds a position in Bristol-Myers, said about the results. “I was impressed.” Shares were up 3.8 percent to $55.82 in New York at 3:57 p.m. in New York. While Opdivo, part of a class of drugs known as immunotherapies that harness the immune system, got remarkable results in once-fatal diseases like advanced melanoma, it failed last year in the late-stage trial that would have widely expanded the use of the treatment for lung cancer patients. Meanwhile Merck’s Keytruda gained approval for new uses, taking the lead in some oncology markets. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Opdivo’s revenue rose 60 percent to $1.13 billion last quarter from a year earlier, surpassing analysts’ estimates by more than $100 million. Underneath the strong results, though, lie the signs of a slowdown: revenue fell sequentially for the first time. In addition to Keytruda, Opdivo is now facing competition from Roche’s Tecentriq. Another competitor, AstraZeneca Plc, is also developing combination immunotherapy treatments. During the earnings call with analysts, Bristol-Myers executives made reassuring comments about Opdivo, saying they were confident the drug will grow this year -- during the fourth-quarter call, they said sales would be little changed. They also emphasized that the company’s pipeline that went beyond oncology. “We are not just a lung cancer company,” Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Caforio said. Chief Science Officer Thomas Lynch, a former Harvard oncologist who joined about six weeks ago, was the most sanguine of all about the company’s research and development and approval track record. “It’s the kind of execution even Tom Brady would be impressed with,” he said, referring to the 5-time Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots quarterback. He praised Bristol-Myers’ broad approach to cancer, testing various combinations of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. The immunotherapy area is “a bit unpredictable at the moment,” and 2017 will be volatile year for the drugmakers in the field, Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C Bernstein & Co., who rates Bristol-Myers market perform, wrote in a note to clients. Blood Thinner Bristol-Myers’ other key growth driver, blood thinner Eliquis, also surpassed predictions in the first quarter, a sign that the drug is closing the gap with Johnson & Johnson’s Xarelto, which had a disappointing quarter. Sales totaled $1.10 billion, while analysts had anticipated $1.02 billion, on average. Through Thursday, Bristol-Myers had lost 29 percent of its value since Aug. 5, when it said Opdivo failed as a single agent for lung cancer. In February the drugmaker named three independent directors and agreed to buy back shares following discussions with Jana. On the same day, the Wall Street Journal reported that Icahn bought a stake and that he saw Bristol-Myers as a potential takeover candidate. Despite the activists, the company’s priorities haven’t changed, CEO Caforio said on the call. Business development remains a priority, he said. “We are extremely focused, and I am extremely focused, on delivering the value of an extraordinarily promising pipeline, which is probably the broadest and the deepest the company’s had.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Pharmaceutical Products and CMO Market Research Report by Geographical Analysis and Forecast to 2024 Pharmaceutical Products and CMO Market The pharmaceutical products and CMO market in Latin America is immensely fragmented and there are a number of small as well as large players operating in the region. The top five companies, namely BASF SE, Bayer AG, Pfizer, Inc., Novartis AG, and Merck & Co., Inc., jointly accounted for approximately 23% of the total market in 2015. Transparency Market Research states in a new report that the success of players in this market depends mainly on the development of innovative products that can address changing and unmet customer needs. Features and benefits that differentiate one company from its competitors are of utmost importance in the pharmaceutical products and CMO market. Expansion in regions with high growth potential is also a key strategy adopted by players to strengthen their position in the market. Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH has, over the past three years, expanded its footprint in China by investing an estimated EUR 22 mn in the construction of a new clinical research center. The opportunity in the Latin America pharmaceutical products and CMO market was pegged at US$127.9 bn in 2015 and is projected to be worth US$286.2 bn by the end of the forecast period, registering a strong CAGR of 9.3% therein. Read Full Report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/latin-america-pharmace… Based on product type, the LATAM pharmaceutical products market is led by the finished dosage form segment, accounting for a share of just under 86% in 2015. This segment is projected to amount to US$244.4 bn by 2024, retaining its lead throughout the forecast period. “The API and ingredients segment, on the other hand, has been witnessing strong growth in Latin America and is projected to register a 9.8% CAGR during the forecast period,” the analyst predicts. The CMO market in Latin America was led by the API and ingredients segment, with the finished dosage form segment registering a high growth rate from 2016 to 2024. Brazil leads the LATAM pharmaceutical products as well as CMO market in terms of value. Fueled by the growing focus on research, this market is projected to value US$67.3 bn by the end of the forecast period. Argentina, on the other hand, is anticipated to emerge as one of the most lucrative markets by 2024, registering an impressive 11.6% CAGR from 2016 to 2024. Download exclusive Sample of this report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… “Several LATAM countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Colombia have been undergoing an improvement in their regulatory frameworks and a more streamlined manner of processes,” the author of the study has observed. The open business environment has attracted multinational pharmaceutical companies and encouraged drug makers to invest in LATAM. Swift drug approvals and a traditional inclination toward free trade has worked in the favor of the healthcare sector in most LATAM countries and this has driven the pharmaceutical products market in the region. The CMO market in Latin America is primarily driven by the fact that a number of blockbuster drugs are going off patent in the next few years. “Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry has taken a hit owing to rising R&D cuts by federal banks and a decline in the productive outcomes of R&D,” the analyst states. “This, combined with patent expirations, have compelled large companies to seek synergies with CMOs through mergers and acquisitions.” About Us Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a market intelligence company, providing global business information reports and services.

What those corporations actually fork over every year, however, is much smaller. On the state level, 240 Fortune 500 firms avoided paying $126 billion in income taxes between 2008 and 2015, a study released Thursday by the non-profit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found. Of those 240 companies, 92 avoided state income taxes for at least one year during that period, and 49 paid no state income taxes for multiple years. (The institute examined 258 firms, and 240 made their state and local tax data available.) Some companies, such as Facebook, DuPont, Boeing, Merck and Eli Lilly, paid negative effective state tax rates for several of those eight years through rebates, credits or deductions, ITEP found. While state corporate tax rates, on paper, average at about 6.25 percent, according to the report, those firms—all of which were profitable during the period they were studied—paid an average rate of 2.9 percent. The study followed a similar report released by ITEP in March that pegged the average effective federal corporate tax rate, which Mnuchin and Cohn said would be slashed Wednesday, among 258 Fortune 500 companies at just 21.2 percent. A March report from the Congressional Budget Office using 2012 data more or less confirmed these disparities, while comparing statutory tax burdens shouldered by American companies to those of other countries in the Group of Twenty, or G-20, a consortium of developed nations. Although in theory the U.S. stood at the top of the list in terms of average combined state and federal corporate taxes, at 39.1 percent, it came in fourth when taking loopholes and subsidies into account, with an 18.6 percent rate. Corporate profits, meanwhile, have generally been on the rise. Just over three years ago, they hit their highest level in more than eight decades. After dipping slightly in 2015, they grew 22 percent between the final quarters of 2015 and 2016. Trump's plan is widely expected to accelerate the trend. In addition to winding down the statutory rate, the proposal called for a tax on the profits American corporations hold offshore, but would incentivize the return of those sheltered profits overseas with the promise of, as Mnuchin described it in the Wednesday press conference, “a very competitive rate that will bring back trillions of dollars.” The Treasury secretary, who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs, assailed the corporate rate in its current form, citing it as a reason companies hold many of their profits outside the U.S. “It is perhaps the most complicated and uncompetitive business rate in the world,” he said. “Not a surprise that companies leave trillions of dollars offshore.”National More Political Capital Are Shareholders About To Be Silenced?

Now a few companies are getting closer to mass production of higher-order tissues (bone, cartilage, organs) and other individually tailored items, including implants. This kind of precision medicine, treating patients based on their genes, environment, and lifestyle, could herald the end of long organ donor lists and solve other problems, too. Source: Organovo Organovo Holdings Inc. Based in San Diego; 120 employees What Organovo has successfully transplanted human liver tissue into mice to cure chronic liver failure. Pending the success of human trials, possible applications include the $3 billion market for inherited conditions such as hemophilia. Who Ten-year-old Organovo, co-founded by bioprinting pioneer Gabor Forgacs, a professor at the University of Missouri, has received more than $100 million in funding for its development of 3D-printed tissues. The company uses bioprinted tissue to test drug toxicity and effectiveness on behalf of Big Pharma companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Merck & Co. Next Steps The company says it plans to begin human clinical trials by 2020. It’s also developing printable bone tissue for skeletal disease research and co-developing 3D-printed skin with L’Oréal SA. Courtesy: Lavigne Films Aspect Biosystems Ltd. Based in Vancouver; 15 employees What Aspect prints tissue cells to create structures that resemble parts of the human body, such as an airway or meniscus, to spur easier research on treatments for, say, asthma or muscle tears. By taking muscle cells from a lung, for example, the company built respiratory tissue that responded to common asthma inhalers as a person’s body should. Who Engineering Ph.D. dropout Tamer Mohamed co-founded Aspect in 2013 with nanotechnology and biology experts. They’ve teamed with a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary to work on tissue development with their heavily customized printers. Next Steps The focus of the J&J partnership is a prototype artificial meniscus that could be implanted without the need for more invasive and expensive knee surgeries. The companies haven’t set a timetable for human trials, though Mohamed says he’s hoping to get there in the next few years.

Who Chief Executive Officer Fried Vancraen founded the $440 million company in 1990 and has joined with companies including Siemens AG and UL LLC to develop or manufacture medical equipment. Sometimes the items are as simple as glasses or custom hearing aids; sometimes they’re individually tailored models of a person’s organ designed to help surgeons spot potential trouble. Next Steps Materialise says a series of forthcoming research papers will strengthen its bone implant case with the FDA. The next hurdle will be persuading health insurers to cover its 3D-printed gear. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(Wu changqing - Imaginechina/Newscom) ALLISON GATLIN 4/27/2017 Reprints AstraZeneca (AZN) is pinning its hopes on immuno-oncology — rivaling Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) — after its first-quarter sales slid 12% and touched consensus forecasts, while earnings topped views by 17 cents. On the stock market today, AstraZeneca stock lifted 0.9% to 30.86, well above its 50-day moving average for the fourth consecutive trading day. Shares are forming a cup-with-handle and have a possible 31.98 buy point. For the first quarter ended March 31, AstraZeneca reported adjusted income of 99 cents per share, up 4% vs. a year ago even as revenue dove 12% to $5.4 billion. Results came amid increased generic competition as the patent protecting Crestor, a top-selling cholesterol drug for AstraZeneca, has expired. Year-over-year comparisons are expected to ease in the second half of 2017, following the impact of July 2016 entries of generic rivals to Crestor. Crestor sales accounted for 13% of total sales, declining 45% in the first quarter to $631 million. IBD'S TAKE: Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck are leading the market in terms of immuno-oncolgy drugs that target what's called the PD-1 protein. But other targets are sparking interest on Wall Street. Visit IBD's Technology page for a rundown of Bristol's and Merck's future rivals. "We anticipate the significant progress of the pipeline to continue, including our immuno-oncology and targeted treatments," Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said in a prepared statement. AstraZeneca expects to submit an application with the FDA in the second half of 2017 for its immuno-oncology combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab in advanced lung cancer. It's also looking for data on a trial of the combo in head and neck cancer.

The non-small cell cancer therapeutics (NSCLC) market is anticipated to witness significant growth during the forecast period. This can be attributed to the high investment by market players in the research and development of lung cancer therapy, presence of a rich pipeline, and increasing penetration of drugs during the forecast period. Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4838531/ Introduction of several drugs in various geographical regions is likely to drive the market during the forecast period. For instance, in October 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Alecensa (alectinib), a drug developed by Genentech to treat ALK-positive NSCLC as a first-line treatment. The drug has been approved in the U.S., Japan, Canada, Hong Kong, South Korea, Kuwait, and Israel. Presence of a strong pipeline of drugs for non-small cell lung cancer helps propel the market during the forecast period. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Orion Corporation, Merck KGaA, AstraZeneca, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, and Pfizer, Inc. have major molecules in the pipeline. Further key findings from the study suggest: By drug, Alimta accounted for the highest share in 2015. However, it is expected to witness decline in its share during the forecast period. Alecensa (alectinib) is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period. This is majorly attributed to the clinical benefit of the drug to treat ALK-positive NSCLC. Alecensa is expected to be a competitor to Pfizer’s Xalkori and Merck’s Keytruda during the forecast period. A superior progression-free survival rate of Alecensa was observed in the clinical trials as compared to Crizotinib. Geographically, North America dominated the overall industry in 2015. This is due to the early entry of drugs in the market, increased adoption of new treatment, and high cost of the drug. It is expected that North America would maintain its dominance during the forecast period and grow with the highest rate over the coming years due to expected entry of new drugs. Several players are operating in the industry. Geographical penetration and development of innovative & effective drugs are the key strategies of the players to increase their share.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Antidepressants Market Analysis by Top Key Player The Antidepressants Market report offers a comprehensive evaluation of the market. It does so via in-depth qualitative insights, historical data, and verifiable projections about market size. Currently, the market is highly fragmented and competitive in nature due to the involvement of both large and small pharmaceutical companies. AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Company, Forest Laboratories, GlaxoSmithKline plc, H. Lundbeck A/S, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer, Inc. and Sanofi S.A. are major companies operating in the antidepressants market. Antidepressants are drugs used for the treatment of depressive disorders including dysthymia, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, chronic pain, eating disorders, and neuropathic pain. Factors driving the antidepressants market are declining side effects and rising efficacy of drugs in various classes as well as growing geriatric population where rate of mental illness is higher.

The antidepressants market has been segmented based on the drug classes commonly used for the treatment of various types of depressive disorders. There are different types of antidepressant drugs available in the market such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), tetracyclic antidepressants, etc. Browse more detail information about antidepressants market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antidepressants-market… The regional analysis covers: North America (U.S. and Canada) Latin America (Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and others) Western Europe (Germany, U.K., France, Spain, Italy, Nordic countries, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg) Eastern Europe (Poland and Russia) Asia Pacific (China, India, Japan, ASEAN, Australia, and New Zealand) Middle East and Africa (GCC, Southern Africa, and North Africa) Please download sample copy of antidepressants market report if you’d like to receive a soft copy of this brief summary. www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… About Us Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

INC. -0.12 At Closing, April 27th 62.58 USD BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB CO +1.90 At Closing, April 27th 55.67 USD "Better than expected" doesn't necessarily mean "good" or "sustainable." Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analyst expectations, helped by better-than-expected sales of the immune-boosting cancer drug Opdivo. It's a hopeful sign that adoption of this new class of drugs continues apace, and Bristol shares rose 2 percent Thursday morning. But the results don't change Bristol's worrying strategic situation. And they likely won't assuage Carl Icahn and hedge fund Jana Partners, traditionally active investors who have recently built stakes in the company.  Eating Dust Bristol shares have lagged behind those of its cancer rivals since a highly anticipated lung cancer trial failed last August Source: Bloomberg The key to Bristol's success is maintaining Opdivo's lead in the increasingly crowded market for so-called immune-oncology (IO) drugs. Opdivo kept that lead in the first quarter with sales that topped analyst forecasts by more than $100 million. But there's little reason to think this says much about the future.  Bristol is still reaping some of the benefits of Opdivo's head start in treating lung cancer, the largest market available to this class of medicines. It was the first such drug approved by the FDA to treat the condition, ahead of Merck & Co. Inc's competing Keytruda. But Keytruda was approved in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients in late October -- an approval Bristol is still chasing after Opdivo failed an overly ambitious trial at about the same time (Opdivo is currently approved only for treating patients who have tried other treatments). Roche Holding AG's drug Tecentriq, meanwhile, was approved -- in that same busy October -- to treat the same lung-cancer patients Bristol's drug treats. The competitive pressure on Bristol will only increase the longer these rivals stay on the market. And a combination of Keytruda with chemotherapy could be approved to treat lung cancer by May 10. While Opdivo's latest quarter looks good on a year-over-year basis, it's important to note that sales fell 14 percent sequentially, the drug's first such drop and an unusual one for a recently launched cancer medicine. Crowding Competition in the IO market is accelerating Source: Bloomberg The laundry list of concerns that have cut $30 billion from Bristol's market value since the summer of 2016 and attracted potentially activist investors is still long. The company is overly dependent on Opdivo for sales growth and as a component of its R&D efforts. It has just one other substantial growth driver, the blood thinner Eliquis, and little in the pipeline that's not tied to Opdivo.  Bristol's prospects to keep a lead in the IO market rely largely on a combination of Opdivo with another IO drug Yervoy, which is already approved to treat melanoma. But the company elected not to seek accelerated approval for the duo in lung cancer. It may not measure up to Merck's chemo combo in terms of safety or its ability to get to market rapidly. And it could face competition from a similar combo by AstraZeneca PLC that is also in late-stage trials. If it wants to keep its leadership in the IO market, Bristol needs rivals to stumble while it flawlessly executes on trials of new Opdivo uses and combos. But that has not been a recent strength of the company. The last time the market bought into such a narrative, it was badly disappointed. The company's new big investors are unlikely to be satisfied with it.  High Hopes Sky high sales expectations for Bristol-Myers' Opdivo have been slashed due to disappointing trial results and rising competition Source: Bloomberg   This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Bristol-Myers' cancer drug Opdivo fuels Wall Street beat By Reuters Published: 10:35 EDT, 27 April 2017 | Updated: 13:40 EDT, 27 April 2017 e-mail By Michael Erman NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - Strong growth from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Opdivo and Yervoy cancer immunotherapies drove the company's first-quarter results past analysts' expectations and relieved some anxiety about increasing competition for the drugs. Bristol-Myers, which is facing pressure from activist investors after losing ground to rival Merck &amp; Co's cancer treatment Keytruda, mostly reversed an earlier cut to its 2017 profit outlook. Its shares rose nearly 4 percent. "Sales for Opdivo were strong despite a more competitive landscape," Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Caforio said on a conference call with analysts. "In the U.S., while we have seen some share loss in lung cancer, our share has shown signs of stabilization." Sales of Opdivo and Yervoy, which boost the cancer-fighting abilities of a patient's immune system, jumped 60 percent and 25 percent, respectively, in the quarter. Sales of blood thinner Eliquis, another important Bristol-Myers drug, gained 50 percent. "We have a favorable view of Bristol's solid position in the immuno-oncology market," said Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans. Opdivo sales beat expectations by 14 percent and should be "a key growth driver for the company," Evans added. OPDIVO VS. KEYTRUDA Bristol-Myers warned in January that the potential for earlier-than-expected lung cancer competition from Keytruda could sap Opdivo's earnings potential this year. Merck filed for speedy U.S. approval of Keytruda as an initial lung cancer treatment in combination with chemotherapy. Around the same time, Bristol-Myers said it would not seek accelerated approval for a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in first-line lung cancer and has not fully explained why. Still, Opdivo outperformed scaled-back sales expectations for the quarter, and the company now sees "the potential" for U.S. sales of the drug to grow in 2017. Activist investor Jana Partners began building a position in the company last year. While Jana has been quiet about its intentions, Bristol-Myers added three independent directors to its board after consulting with the investor. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has also taken a stake in the company, hoping it will be sold, according to the Wall Street Journal. Excluding one-time items, Bristol-Myers' earnings of 84 cents a share exceeded the analysts' average estimate of 74 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue also exceeded Wall Street expectations. Bristol-Myers increased its 2017 earnings forecast to a range of $2.85 to $3 a share.

Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai/Handout via REUTERS Big Pharma sees profit opportunity in fatty liver disease By Bill Berkrot Reuters 18 hrs ago (…) Sebastian Derungs A researcher in a file photo. REUTERS/File Large drugmakers with piles of cash are on the hunt for promising medicines being developed by small companies to treat NASH, a progressive fatty liver disease poised to become the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020. The eventual market for the complex disease, formally known as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, is forecast to be $20 billion to $35 billion as populations with fatty diets increasingly fall victim to a condition with no approved treatments.  With intense competition and pricing pressure eroding sales of medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other lucrative disease categories, and an already crowded field for developmental cancer drugs, big pharma sees NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making.  "We are actively looking on the outside for opportunities... to complement our internal program," Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer for internal medicine for Pfizer, told Reuters. GRAPHIC: THE GROWING THREAT OF NASH DRIVES DEALS Pfizer currently has three early-stage drugs in the clinic aiming to block or reverse fat accumulation in the liver. "We believe that even though we're a bit behind, we still might come out with the best-in-class molecules," Birnbaum said. Bristol-Myers Squibb also confirmed it is looking for additional assets to enhance its internally-developed NASH drugs. It presented promising data for its lead NASH candidate at the big European liver meeting in Amsterdam that ended on Sunday. "It's early days, but keep your seatbelts fastened," said Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and one of the world's leading liver disease experts. Estimates for the prevalence of NASH in nations with fatty diets range from 5 to 20 percent of the population with up to 15 million potentially affected in the United States alone. Driven by the obesity and diabetes epidemics, the disease guarantees an enormous pool of patients for decades, making it a prime target for deals for promising therapies for NASH and its consequences — advanced fibrosis and liver-destroying cirrhosis. The very early stages of many of the drugs, and the complicated nature of the disease itself, pose risks for drug developers and their investors alike. +1  A human liver afflicted with Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, or NASH, that has progressed to cirrhosis, is pictured in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters April 21, 2017. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai/Handout via REUTERS Handout . But the upside potential is still enticing to Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director and senior health care analyst at Rodman and Renshaw. He calls NASH one of the hottest spaces in the health care sector. "We anticipate that there will be more transactions, more licensing deals from big pharma involving emerging biotechnology companies," he said. Gilead a pioneer   Just a few years ago, Gilead Sciences was the lone large drugmaker talking about NASH. It was undeterred after its most advanced anti-fibrosis candidate failed, striking deals with two small companies to acquire additional NASH programs. Liver disease experts were impressed last year by Phase II data from a Gilead-developed drug that demonstrated fibrosis regression after just six months. Allergan became a top NASH contender with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics and a deal with private Akarna Therapeutics on the same day last year. Other big drugmakers with licensing deals or options on future deals in the space include Novartis, Merck & Co., Bristol-Myers and Johnson & Johnson . While many of the drugs in development are two-to-five years from reaching the market if they get that far, betting on the feverish deal activity gives investors a chance to profit near term. Many small companies developing drugs with a wide variety of approaches across the disease spectrum do not have partners. They include Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Galectin Therapeutics, Genfit and Galmed Pharmaceuticals, all with a chance to be among the first to market, as well as Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Durect Corp and little-known U.K.-traded Tiziana Life Sciences with assets much earlier in development. Galectin, which expects key data in December, has commenced preliminary partnership discussions, its chief operating officer told Reuters. Len Yaffe, who runs the StockDoc Partners health care fund and has long followed the liver disease space, said investors with tolerance for risk could do well to buy shares in several small-cap and micro-cap companies with promising NASH drugs in early development. He said if any one has stellar data, or lands a deal, the payoff could be considerable. When Allergan announced the $1.7 billion deal for Tobira, for example, that company's shares jumped from under $5 to over $30. Yaffe, who had singled out Tobira to investors prior to its acquisition, said the Durect drug "looks incredibly promising as it relates to inflammation and fibrosis." Enanta has the advantage of cash flow from its hepatitis C partnership with AbbVie to fund its NASH program. Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis How do they stack up?

Check our People in Business "You want to bet on companies that can survive even if they don't get a partnership this year or next year," Selvaraju said. Enanta Chief Executive Jay Luly said companies in earlier stages of development may have an advantage over the first wave of experimental treatments as regulators' thinking on clinical trial goals and what makes an approvable product in such a new market evolves. "When we get there, the development pathway could be not only more clearly defined, but more simplified," Luly said. Many shots on goal   Drugmakers are taking a wide range of approaches to treat the complex disease, given multiple health issues among NASH patients that contribute to the liver damage, such as heart disease and diabetes. There are drugs targeting inflammation to prevent or reduce fibrotic scarring. Some address lipid regulation to reduce liver fat, while others attempt to directly halt or reverse fibrosis. And some companies are testing diabetes treatments to assess their ability to also improve NASH. "The big sea change from two years ago — apart from an increased number of players — is a fairly rapid acceptance of the fact that we're going to be seeking combination therapies since it's a disease that involves multiple pathways," said Mt. Sinai’s Friedman. "In the end, whatever the mechanism is, it needs to yield decreased fibrosis," he said, noting that progressing fibrosis is what ultimately causes serious health consequences. The knowledge that multiple drugs will be needed for therapeutic combinations to treat NASH, and that most experimental drugs fail, are big drivers for deal activity. Drugmakers are looking to improve chances of success by amassing numerous experimental drugs for their NASH programs. Some experts said drugs that target late-stage fibrosis and cirrhosis, where the risk of cancer and liver failure is highest, are likely to gain earliest acceptance from insurers. That fits the strategy of tiny Conatus Pharmaceuticals, whose shares more than doubled when it signed a $50 million collaboration deal with Novartis. Conatus is targeting end-stage disease with the goal of preventing transplants. But given the millions of potential patients and expense of treating advanced disease, there should be incentive for insurers to embrace medicines that target earlier stage NASH as well. "There's still a major role for drugs that work on the front end," said Dr. Arun Sanyal, a leading liver disease expert whose Virginia Commonwealth University lab discovered the compound being developed by Durect. "One size will not fit all."  Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business. Get twice-daily updates on what the St. Louis business community is talking about.

The U.S. drugmaker, which has faced increasing competition for blockbuster Opdivo as well as pressure from activist investors, also raised its expectations for its full-year earnings, reversing a cut to its outlook it made in the previous quarter. Opdivo sales rose 60 percent in the quarter, while Eliquis and Yervoy sales rose 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Opdivo and Yervoy are immuno-oncology drugs, which target the body's immune system to fight cancer. Bristol-Myers reported profit of $1.57 billion, or 94 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $1.20 billion, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Bristol-Myers said it earned 84 cents a share. Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected the company to earn 74 cents a share. Revenue rose 12 percent to $4.93 billion, which was also higher than the average analyst estimate of $4.74 billion. The company had warned last quarter that the potential for earlier-than-expected lung cancer competition from Merck &amp; Co Inc could sap Opdivo's earnings potential this year. Merck had filed for speedy U.S. approval of its immuno-oncology drug Keytruda as an initial lung cancer treatment in combination with chemotherapy. That coincided with Bristol-Myers' decision not to seek accelerated approval for a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in first-line lung cancer. But Opdivo outperformed scaled-back sales expectations for the quarter, generating revenue of $1.13 billion, up from $704 million last year. The company increased its forecast for 2017 earnings to a range of $2.85 a share to $3 a share, up from its previous forecast range of $2.70 a share to $2.90 a share. In February, the company added three independent directors to its board, a move it said was supported by activist investor Jana Partners, which had built a position in the company. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has also taken a stake in Bristol-Myers. Bristol-Myers shares closed at $53.77 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. They are down around 8 percent in 2017.

Different forms of drugs can be utilized for aerosol therapy such as solid particles, liquid particles, solutions, and suspensions. Until recently, aerosol therapy concentrated primarily on treatment of asthma and COPD for which, pressurized metered-dose inhaler device was used. However, the role of aerosol therapy is expanding beyond the initial focus. This expansion eliminated CFC-based traditional metered-dose inhalers devices. This will ultimately boost the market growth of aerosol therapy in the field of gene therapy, inhalation therapy and vaccination. Aerosol therapy is a natural and easiest way to treat asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and broncho pulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Aerosol therapy is also used to deliver insulin, vaccines of influenza and measles, and pain medications. Aerosol treatment therapy gives an excellent and cost-efficient drug delivery. This therapy is effective for patients who cannot use metered-dose inhalers; primary inhalation devices are produced that guarantee breath-actuated aerosol delivery with minimal side effects. Aerosol therapy provides a fast and non-invasive way for treatment of lung disorders as the drug is delivered at the receptor site. Effectiveness of the therapy depends on how deeply aerosol particles infiltrate into the bronchial track and where the particles are deposited. A particle size under 2μm is ideal and can permeate up to the peripheral airways. That is why most commercially available aerosol devices produce droplets of roughly this size.

 Bristol-Myers beat on earnings thanks to sales of its drugs that use the immune system to treat cancer Michael Erman, Reuters Apr. 27, 2017, 10:09 AM 727 facebook linkedin twitter email print FILE PHOTO: Bottles of Plavix shown on display at a pharmacy in North Aurora, Illinois.Thomson Reuters NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on Thursday posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, helped by growth from cancer drugs Opdivo and Yervoy and blood thinner Eliquis. The U.S. drugmaker, which has faced increasing competition for blockbuster Opdivo as well as pressure from activist investors, also raised its expectations for its full-year earnings, reversing a cut to its outlook it made in the previous quarter. Opdivo sales rose 60 percent in the quarter, while Eliquis and Yervoy sales rose 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Opdivo and Yervoy are immuno-oncology drugs, which target the body's immune system to fight cancer. Bristol-Myers reported profit of $1.57 billion, or 94 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $1.20 billion, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Bristol-Myers said it earned 84 cents a share. Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected the company to earn 74 cents a share. Revenue rose 12 percent to $4.93 billion, which was also higher than the average analyst estimate of $4.74 billion. The company had warned last quarter that the potential for earlier-than-expected lung cancer competition from Merck & Co Inc could sap Opdivo's earnings potential this year. Merck had filed for speedy U.S. approval of its immuno-oncology drug Keytruda as an initial lung cancer treatment in combination with chemotherapy. That coincided with Bristol-Myers' decision not to seek accelerated approval for a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in first-line lung cancer. But Opdivo outperformed scaled-back sales expectations for the quarter, generating revenue of $1.13 billion, up from $704 million last year. The company increased its forecast for 2017 earnings to a range of $2.85 a share to $3 a share, up from its previous forecast range of $2.70 a share to $2.90 a share. In February, the company added three independent directors to its board, a move it said was supported by activist investor Jana Partners, which had built a position in the company. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has also taken a stake in Bristol-Myers. Bristol-Myers shares closed at $53.77 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. They are down around 8 percent in 2017.

 AstraZeneca wants to escape from its falling drug sales in the second half of 2017 Ben Hirschler, Reuters Apr. 27, 2017, 10:27 AM 552 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chief Executive of AstraZeneca Pascal Soriot leaves after appearing at a commons science committee hearing at Portcullis House in LondonThomson Reuters LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca, struggling with loss of patents on blockbusters like cholesterol pill Crestor, reported another quarter of falling drug sales on Thursday as it awaits pivotal clinical trial data that may revive its fortunes. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot believes 2017 will mark the trough for the British group, as it starts to put generic losses behind it and builds up sales of recently launched and experimental cancer medicines. "The pipeline continued to deliver in what we expect will be a pivotal year," he said. "The total revenue performance reflected the transitional impact of recent patent expiries, which is expected to recede in the second half of the year." Despite income from disposals and external deals, first-quarter revenue fell 12 percent to $5.4 billion, although core earnings per share (EPS) rose 4 percent in dollar terms to 99 cents - helped by one-off gains on the sale of short-term investments. Industry analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $5.4 billion and earnings of 82 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data. So-called "externalisation" revenue, which some analysts argue unduly flatters AstraZeneca's results, rose 2 percent to $562 million, while product sales fell 13 percent to $4.8 billion. Shares in the company fell 1.5 percent in early trade, with Berenberg analysts noting that several key new drugs had missed consensus sales forecasts, including heart drug Brilinta, Lynparza for cancer and diabetes treatment Farxiga. AstraZeneca reiterated its expectation that full-year revenue would decline at a low to mid single-digit percentage rate, with core EPS dropping by a low to mid-teens percentage. For investors, owning AstraZeneca shares represents a major bet on the company's oncology portfolio. It is already doing well with new cancer pill Tagrisso, but the really big opportunity lies in cancer immunotherapy. Results from its closely watched MYSTIC immuno-oncology (I-O) trial in previously untreated lung cancer patients are expected mid-year. Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche already have similar drugs approved for lung cancer but AstraZeneca hopes to carve out a market by proving the value of combining two I-O drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab. Analysts at Jefferies see a $20 billion opportunity for I-O drugs in first-line, non-small cell lung cancer, with sales split between I-O monotherapy (administering one such medicine on its own); I-O plus conventional chemotherapy; and combinations of two I-O drugs, as in AstraZeneca's approach.  Read the original article on Reuters.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Media & Advertising Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Bristol-Myers Beats Wall St Estimates ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Bristol-Myers Beats Wall St Estimates Published April 27, 2017 Industries Reuters Facebook Twitter Print Bristol-Myers Squibb on Thursday posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, helped by growth from cancer drugs Opdivo and Yervoy and blood thinner Eliquis. Continue Reading Below The U.S. drugmaker, which has faced increasing competition for blockbuster Opdivo as well as pressure from activist investors, also raised its expectations for its full-year earnings, reversing a cut to its outlook it made in the previous quarter. Opdivo sales rose 60 percent in the quarter, while Eliquis and Yervoy sales rose 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Opdivo and Yervoy are immuno-oncology drugs, which target the body's immune system to fight cancer. Bristol-Myers reported profit of $1.57 billion, or 94 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $1.20 billion, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Bristol-Myers said it earned 84 cents a share. Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected the company to earn 74 cents a share. Revenue rose 12 percent to $4.93 billion, which was also higher than the average analyst estimate of $4.74 billion. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The company had warned last quarter that the potential for earlier-than-expected lung cancer competition from Merck & Co Inc could sap Opdivo's earnings potential this year. Merck had filed for speedy U.S. approval of its immuno-oncology drug Keytruda as an initial lung cancer treatment in combination with chemotherapy. That coincided with Bristol-Myers' decision not to seek accelerated approval for a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in first-line lung cancer. But Opdivo outperformed scaled-back sales expectations for the quarter, generating revenue of $1.13 billion, up from $704 million last year. The company increased its forecast for 2017 earnings to a range of $2.85 a share to $3 a share, up from its previous forecast range of $2.70 a share to $2.90 a share. In February, the company added three independent directors to its board, a move it said was supported by activist investor Jana Partners, which had built a position in the company. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has also taken a stake in Bristol-Myers. Bristol-Myers shares closed at $53.77 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. They are down around 8 percent in 2017.   (Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Bill Rigby) Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

Kohls Global Research, April 27, 2017 Region: USA Theme: Environment, Media Disinformation, Science and Medicine Propaganda: “a message designed to persuade its intended audience to think and behave in a certain manner. Thus advertising is commercial propaganda. Or institutionalized and systematic spreading of information and/or disinformation, usually to promote a narrow political or religious (or commercial) viewpoint.” — from http://www.businessdictionary.com/ Mercenary: ”a person primary concerned with making money at the expense of ethics.” “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, and our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of…It is they who pull the wires that control the public mind.”  — Edward L. Bernays, the Father of Propaganda in America and Sigmund Freud’s nephew, from his seminal book Propaganda (1928).  “Entire populations, which were undisciplined or lacking in intellectual or definite moral principles, were vulnerable to unconscious influence and thus susceptible to wanting things that they do not need. This is achieved by manipulating desires on an unconscious level.” – Edward Bernays, From the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science (March 1947) I recently heard a talk given by the author of a book whose theme was “the war on science”. The author happened to be on the national steering committee that helped to organize last weekend’s March for Science. The author was not a scientist, but he appeared to be fairly well read about some of the issues about which I was also concerned, such as global warming, resource depletion, pollution, over-population and other highly probable environmental catastrophes. We were on the same page in opposing the Trump administration’s proposals to de-fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and regulatory agencies such as the EPA. We also both opposed the Trump administration’s threats to cut funding for pro-science initiatives such as dealing with the remaining un-remediated SuperFund pollution sites that have been created by reckless and unregulated corporations, municipalities and the American military. (NOTE: Pentagon Inc is the biggest polluter on the planet.) However, during the speech, I was disappointed to hear the author boldly state as fact a widely-propagated media, medical and pharmaceutical industry myth that falsely claims that vaccines (presumably including the 270 new experimental ones that are in Big Pharma’s pipeline) are totally safe and efficacious (when they are injected into the muscle tissue of tiny, even premature infants whose blood-brain barriers and immune systems are not yet developed enough to keep out the mercury, aluminum and live viruses). Obviously, unbeknownst to this non-scientist author, his statement revealed that he was ignorant or otherwise unaware of the voluminous body of documented, peer-reviewed and unbiased neuroscientific evidence that refutes the oft-repeated claim – or perhaps it just revealed the success of the indoctrination process that he and so many others, including far too many health journalists, had heard again and again. One only needs to recall Goebbels dictum: “If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it as truth.”   (For that evidence that refutes the lie about vaccine safety, go to:  https://go2.thetruthaboutvaccines.com/docuseries/replay/; www.nvic.org;   http://vaxxedthemovie.com/; www.vactruth.com;  http://www.vaccinationinformationnetwork.com; http://www.greatergoodmovie.org/learn-more/science/ The Fluoridation of America’s Water Supplies The author also disappointed me when he repeated the American Dental Association-propagated (and fluoride industry) myth that the widespread fluoridation of municipal water supplies with the hazardous waste by-product of the fertilizer industry (fluoride) has no downsides (implying that fluoride supplementation is totally safe for the bodies and brains of children, notwithstanding the documented proof  that the ingestion of that neurotoxic mineral can cause lowered IQ levels, hypothyroidism and brain damage, as well as fluorosis of bones and teeth. The statement also ignored the fact that the fertilizer industry’s waste products contain an variable combination of fluorosilicic acid, sodium fluorosilicate and sodium fluoride, in addition to untested-for-contaminants like arsenic. It is important to note that fluoridation of water supplies is banned in most municipalities in Europe (on the basis of good, unbiased science), with no evidence of any increase in the incidence of dental caries in those non-fluoridated communities. (Explore www.fluoridealert.org for much more – and also read the warning on the next tube of fluoridated Crest toothpaste that you can find on the grocery store shelf.) Edward Bernays, the Father of American Propaganda Edward Bernays is considered the Father of American Propaganda. His writings on propaganda inspired Nazi Party leader Joseph Goebbels, Hitler’s Minister of Propaganda and Public Enlightenment to be really good at his job. One of Bernay’s most influential corporate “accomplishments” occurred in the mid- to late-1940s, when he was hired by ALCOA (the Aluminum Company of America) to orchestrate a public relations campaign to convince political leaders and the public that it would be good if ALCOA’s highly toxic by-product (fluoride salts) were added to the nation’s drinking water supplies under the guise of preventing tooth decay in children. (Google “Edward Bernays, the Father of American Propaganda” and “A Chronology of Forced Fluoridation in America” for more.) Bernays’ propaganda campaign worked like a charm, with many state legislatures (including my state of Minnesota) passing laws that compelled reluctant municipalities to fluoridate their water supplies with the waste product that had up until then been responsible for so much poisoned air, water, soil, food, vegetation, livestock and other living things surrounding ALCOA’s aluminum smelting plants. The aluminum industry, with the help of the American Dental Association (which is still in denial about the serious neurotoxicity of the mercury in its dental “amalgam” fillings), was enabled to sell its otherwise unmarketable and poisonous by-product – and they made a profit to boot! Win-win-lose. Bernays’ and ALCOA’s fluoride caper was just another example of how cunning mercenary lobbyists that work for sociopathic corporations can convince non-scientist legislators to do their bidding, especially if the politicians also accept campaign contributions from those often criminal enterprises! (It should be noted, by the way, that, in recent years, most of the highly caustic fluoride powder that is purchased by American municipalities like Duluth comes from the toxic smokestacks of the phosphate fertilizer industry [rather than from the aluminum industry] and that the handlers of the fluoride powder need to wear hazmat suits.) It is obvious to any close observer of what industry calls “science” is that there are at least two types of science: 1) the biased, Big Business kind of science that hires well-trained scientists to perform the necessary research in order to develop products that will make money for the company and its investors, and 2) the unbiased kind of science that is in it for altruistic reasons – with scientists that work for the advancement of pure knowledge, the advancement of society and the creation of a more humane and prosperous world for everybody – hoping, of course, to make a decent living at the same time. The first kind of science – the one that has been dominant in American society for far too long – must be regarded with extreme suspicion, for it hires scientists that are expected do the will of the corporation’s non-scientist management and marketing teams that may be serial liars and manipulators of statistics. Far too often – because of the intense competition, corporations  find themselves unable to afford following ethical principles other than the so-called “business ethics” (an oxymoron) that they may have learned in the business administration course they once took in school. Mercenaries, Whether Scientists or Soldiers, Can’t be Trusted to do the Honorable Thing This type of corrupted corporate science that has been involved in the defense industries has always employed large numbers of mercenary scientists and other workers that have produced the most lethal weapons in the history of the world. It was clever German chemists that invented chlorine and mustard gas weapons of mass destruction in World War I, weapons that were rapidly replicated by Allied scientists on the other side of No Man’s Land – and then gleefully used. It was physicists, mathematicians, chemists and assorted scientists that invented the infamous uranium and plutonium weapons of mass destruction that incinerated and mutilated hundreds of thousands of mostly innocent women and children in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in a war that was could have ended weeks earlier with negotiations. And I recall reading that over half (perhaps 75%) of all American scientists during the Reagan years were employed by the nuclear weapons industries designing and building massive numbers of nuclear weapons of mass destruction, with the accumulation of 4 trillion dollars of national debt that is still unpaid and still paying massive amounts of interest to corporate and wealthy bond holders who are thankful for the war readiness agendas. And it was very smart scientists that invented the homicidal and suicidal weapons of mass destruction called Agent Orange (thanks to DOW Chemical and Monsanto). And mercenary scientists invented the ecocidal and neurotoxic CFCs (thanks to General Motors and DuPont), carcinogenic herbicides like Round-up (thanks to Monsanto, DOW, BASF, Bayer, Syngenta, etc) all of which are longer-lasting in the environment that the serial liars in those industries are willing to admit. That type of corrupted corporate science (as in Big Finance, Big Mining, Big Oil, Big Chemistry, Big Weapons, etc) has started wars in order to find cheap labor and extract valuable minerals and non-renewable resources from the earth and under the oceans, thus permanently scarring and polluting vast amounts of land and sea. The Corrupted Science of Big Pharma In my opinion, one of the most destructive examples of corrupted corporate science, is the multinational pharmaceutical industry that I call Big Pharma. That conglomeration of corporations produces inherently unsafe vaccines and addictive, potentially lethal and brain-altering/brain-destroying psychiatric drugs – and then has the hubris to claim that these drugs and vaccines are safe. Each and every one of their products is unaffordable and bankrupting to the families or systems that pay for them. Full disclosure of the risks of prescription drugs is never done prior to the patient’s consenting to take the drug. It would take too much time for the prescriber to do what is required. And the only obligation for the corporations supplying the chemical is not to do what is best for the patient-consumers of the product, but to make money for their corporation and its investors. That type of commercialized science is always at risk of being corrupted by unethical motivations that place profits ahead of patients, and so they let their covey of lawyers defend the drug deaths and disabilities in court, expecting to receive a wrist slap – rather than the death penalty – as the usual penalty for the use of their “unavoidably unsafe” products. In our highly competitive, let the buyer beware, crony capitalist system, truth-telling about the dangers of a corporation’s products is regarded as something only losers do. And any scientist with a conscience – the potential whistle-blowing insider – need not apply for employment. That type of corrupted science in Big Pharma is rampant in America, Britain, Australia, Canada and the European Union as well – wherever capitalism is unopposed by ethical regulatory agencies or social democratic leanings. Big Pharma has the big money to lavishly fund, design and manage its experimental studies, and it maintains tight control over those studies. Too often its scientists are asked to fudge the statistics so that the results will convince the FDA to grant approval for marketing the end-product. As would be expected whenever billions of dollars of potential profits are involved and the lure of another block-buster drug is in view, bribery and other unethical activities politics inevitably happen. The Way it Used to Be – or So I Thought Back in the day when I was an idealistic medical student, we students believed in the sanctity of pure science and ethical medicine and doing what is best for the patient. We followed the Hippocratic Oath. Medicine, to us, was the type of honorable science that looked for the truth, no matter where the evidence led. Free debate about health issues was allowed and encouraged. We students were naïve enough to think that our professors were also idealists and not influenced by the Big Business of medicine. Of course we had no idea about what was going on behind the scenes, but I doubt that any of our professors were multimillionaires that were in bed with corporations. But even then, there was the specter of Big Pharma influence on us lowly students. We were being groomed to be good prescription writers. Eli Lilly and other Big Pharma corporations gave us occasional free lunches, reflex hammers, stethoscopes and fake alligator leather doctor’s bags. Merck gave us Merck Manuals. Ciba-Geigy provided us with monographs of Frank Netter’s anatomic drawings. We got used to collecting the little corporate trinkets like pens, pizzas and post-it notes at the drug rep visits and medical conferences that we were invited to attend. And, like all cunning public relations strategies, no obvious demands were made on us at the time, but we got the fuzzy feeling that Big Pharma was a friend that would, just like us idealists, first do no harm. And perhaps it was so back in those seemingly more innocent times, before there were so many toxic prescription drugs out there that made billionaires of pharmaceutical company CEOs and millionaires of academic physicians. I suspect that other science-minded students of my era were also going into physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, etc wanted to just do honest science. Most of us had no intention of becoming millionaires. We thought that science was supposed to be fair and unbiased but we didn’t appreciate the greed of the sociopathic pharmaceutical, medical insurance, medical device, medical communications, healthcare providers and other medical corporations that now rule the world. The March for Science Following the above-noted speech that I began this column talking about, I checked out the website of the March for Science organization that the speaker was involved in and found – after a lot of searching – a list of advisory board members. In that list were representatives of a number of corporations, including some giant multinational pharmaceutical corporations such as Pfizer, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline, the latter two being major makers of vaccines that – since 1986 – have been totally immune from lawsuits when their inherently neurotoxic vaccines kill or sicken babies, children or adults. So I was somewhat ambivalent about participating in the March on Science last Saturday, not knowing if there would be a significant presence from the purveyors of the type of fraudulent science such as Big Pharma. According to the media reports that I have seen about the event, big corporations seem to have exerted no undue influence on the march, although there may have been some covert muting of  potentially embarrassing exposures of Big Pharma’s nefarious agenda. But there remain cunning, corrupted corporate science foxes in the pure science henhouse. Dr Kohls is a retired physician from Duluth, MN, USA.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Ronak Bora Global Contraceptives Market size to grow at over 6.8% CAGR by 2023 The report on “Contraceptives Market Size By Product (Drugs [Oral Contraceptive Pills, Injectables, Topical], By Devices Condoms, Diaphragms, Sponges, Vaginal Rings, Subdermal Implants, Copper IUD, Hormonal IUD], Industry Analysis Report, Regional Outlook (U.S., Canada, Germany, UK, Japan, China, India, Brazil, South Africa), Application Potential, Price Trend, Competitive Market Share & Forecast, 2016 – 2023”, Contraceptives Market has been a lucrative part of the healthcare industry, and taking into account the population concerns, the market will continue to grow significantly over the coming years.   Rising concerns regarding the population growth as well as increasing numbers of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) are primarily the factors driving the industry growth. As per CDC (Centers for disease control and prevention), 19 million cases of STD infection are registered every year among people aged between 15 to 24. It also suggests that 24000 women infertility cases are registered every year as a result of STDs. Moreover, half a million STD cases are diagnosed every year in the UK. These numbers show the prevailing growth of these sexually transmitted diseases which has become a matter of concern worldwide. Request for a sample of this research report – https://www.fractovia.org/request-sample/191 Another research from CDC depicts that 37% birth in US comes under the category of unwanted pregnancy. The U.S. federal policy has mandated contraceptives coverage by health insurance companies and has also permitted availability of emergency contraceptives (ECs) over-the-counter (OTC). The government is supporting the use of contraceptives in order to control the population growth, and also to curb the healthcare expenditure incurred during abortions and other sexual diseases. However, ethical and social issues pertaining to the use of contraceptives in some regions are likely to hamper the market growth over the coming years. The contraceptives market comprises mainly of two broad segments- drugs and devices. The drug segment includes Oral Contraceptive Pills, Topical, and Injectable drugs. Contraceptive devices can be classified as Condoms, Sponges, Diaphragms, Subdermal Implants, Vaginal Rings, Hormonal IUD, and Copper IUD. Oral Contraceptives market is pegged to grow at a CAGR of 5% over the period of 2016-2023 owing to the increasing awareness and government support. Condoms are likely to lead the device segment of the contraceptives market with an expected revenue target of USD 7.5 billion in 2016. This growth can be attributed to the campaigns spreading awareness about the use of condoms to prevent STDs. The North America contraceptives market is set to be the dominating region with revenue expectations of USD 8.9 billion by 2023. Factors like increasing awareness, rising abortion rates, and growing population of the women aged 15-44 will drive the regional growth over the coming period. US is estimated to be the major revenue pocket. Awareness programs via free sample distribution and government initiatives will boost the LATAM contraceptives market size. LATAM market is estimated to record a CAGR of 8.6% over 2016-2023. India and China will likely lead the APAC contraceptives market. The Asia Pacific growth will mainly be driven by increasing awareness by sex education campaigns, favorable government initiatives, and improved healthcare facilities. Major industry participants are Pfizer, Mayer Laboratories, Inc., Merck & Co., CooperSurgical, Inc., and Allergan PLC. The contraceptives industry is a fragmented industry with business space shared fairly by the new entrants as well as the established players. Enhancement of their respective product portfolios to meet the demand of the growing market will be the major growth strategy adopted by the industry participants to sustain their market position.

Apr 27 Jefferson and National Jewish Health form new respiratory institute in Philly Apr 27 Novel therapy for rare eye cancer holds promise for targeting other tumors Apr 25 More from Marie McCullough Arrow icon Eradicating cancer without damaging healthy tissue is the Holy Grail of cancer researchers. Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia is testing a novel, light-activated drug designed to do just that in the eye, raising hopes for the first ocular melanoma treatment that would preserve patients’ vision. Sparing eyesight could encourage earlier detection and treatment, thus reducing the chance of metastases — the deadly spread that killed acclaimed author and neurologist Oliver Sacks in 2015.  Roger barone / Wills Eye Hospital A close- up of the ophthalmic laser used to activate Aura Biosciences' experimental drug. “This could be a game-changer if it works,” said Carol Shields, an ocular oncologist at Wills Eye and Thomas Jefferson University. That’s still a big if. Shields treated the first patient, a 46-year-old man from Hazleton, Pa., in March. A dozen patients in all will be treated at Wills and five other centers over the next two years – and that’s just the first of three clinical trials needed to win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.   But if Aura Biosciences’ experimental therapy vanquishes the rare eye malignancy, it could pave the way for a new class of exquisitely precise cancer therapies. In lab experiments, the drug’s artificial viral nanoparticles — derived from groundbreaking technology pioneered at the National Cancer Institute — have been shown to zero in on and bind to many types of malignant cells without harming normal cells. “We decided to first focus on a cancer with medical need and no other drug option,” Aura's founding CEO, Elisabet de los Pinos, said of ocular melanoma. “But we think that our technology can be applied to other cancers,” including bladder and head and neck. A freckle in the eye Many people have a harmless freckle, or nevus, in their eyes, formed by the same pigment-carrying melanocytes that produce freckles in the skin. Just as in the skin, the eye spots can turn malignant. Sun exposure is not clearly linked to ocular melanoma, but fair skin and light eye color are risk factors.  Carol shields When a benign freckle in the eye turns malignant, it grows into an ocular melanoma, a rare but potentially life-threatening cancer. While the disease is rare, with about 3,100 new diagnoses and 330 deaths in the United States each year, it often goes undiagnosed until it affects vision. Sacks —  known for books including Awakenings and The Mind's Eye, in which he tells the story of his own cancer — said his symptoms hit suddenly, wiping out a triangular chunk of the vision in his right eye. Sacks decided to have a chip of radioactive iodine embedded in his eye to treat the tumor. It caused severe pain, hallucinations, and vision loss in the center of that eye. The radiation and, later, lasering, ultimately left that eye blind. Carol shields The dark spot in the upper center region is a benign freckle formed by pigmented cells called melanocytes. Other ocular melanoma treatments, including proton beams, gamma knife, and surgery to cut out the tumor, also have damaging side effects. If these fail to control the cancer, the eye must be removed. The first patient, Ed Tuggle, a maintenance supervisor for a food company, never had symptoms. In 2010, his ophthalmologist spotted a tiny freckle during a routine eye exam. Last year, the same doctor saw that the lesion had grown. Although it was still small — about one-tenth of an inch — he sent Tuggle to Wills, where Shields did a battery of tests and concluded that it was malignant. Patients with small tumors such as Tuggle’s often choose monitoring rather than immediate vision-damaging treatment. But holding off can be anxiety-provoking, given that studies indicate up to 40 percent of ocular melanomas metastasize. When Shields proposed another option — Aura’s clinical trial — Tuggle and his wife, Daneen, a nurse, were eager. The actual procedure in early March was a breeze, Tuggle recalled. Shields numbed his eye, injected the drug, and six hours later, used a laser to activate the light-sensitive dye that is part of the therapy. His dose was purposely low, intended more to test safety than effectiveness. Patients in the next trial will get multiple, higher doses. Still, a month after Tuggle’s injection, Shields was pleased to find that the tumor had begun to atrophy. Based on animal studies, it takes three or four months to gauge the response. “I’ve got a lot of faith,” said Tuggle, who said he has had no side effects. “In my mind, it’s already worked.”  Roger barone / Wills Eye Hospital Wills Eye Hospital ocular oncologist Carol Shields puts a  protective lens on patient Ed Tuggle's eye in preparation for a laser treatment. The laser activates an experimental, targeted cancer drug previously injected in his eye. A new way to target tumors De los Pinos, a molecular biologist who previously worked in Eli Lilly & Co.’s oncology division, founded Cambridge, Mass.-based Aura in 2009 with the goal of developing a highly targeted approach to cancer treatment. The first product candidate is built on decades of advances involving, of all things, the human wart virus  — human papillomavirus, or HPV. In the 1980s, certain virulent strains of HPV were shown to cause cervical cancer. In the 1990s, scientists figured out how to make harmless, empty HPV shells — called virus-like particles — to prime the immune system to ward off the real germ. Virus-like particles became the basis of Merck’s groundbreaking cervical cancer prevention vaccine, Gardasil, approved in 2006. More recently, a team at the National Cancer Institute led by John T. Schiller and Douglas R. Lowy deciphered how HPV infects certain cervical cells in the first place. Physically "disrupted" cells overproduce a carbohydrate molecule that normally helps with wound healing. The virus binds to that molecule, called heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Healthy intact cells, meanwhile, resist being bound. Using animal models, the NCI researchers showed that virus-like particles behaved like the actual virus, using the carbohydrate to attach to tumors. And not just in the cervix. In 2015, Schiller, Lowy, Aura's de los Pinos, and others published a study that showed virus-like particles  “can infect a broad range of cancer cell types,"  including ovarian and lung, by binding to the carbohydrate. Since virus-like particles are harmless on their own, Aura’s are coupled with a light-sensitive dye. When activated by laser light, the dye becomes toxic to the tumor cells’ membranes and — if all goes as expected — selectively kills the cancer. Although ocular melanoma is rare, Shields has long urged people to get annual eye checks because finding it early is critical. Now, she foresees a way to make early detection less dreadful. “We’re hoping this becomes a new alternative in the management of melanoma of the eye,” she said.

It uses substances either made by the body or in a laboratory to improve or restore immune system function. There are several types of cancer immunotherapies, including monoclonal antibodies, non-specific immunotherapies, oncolytic virus therapy, T-cell therapy, and cancer vaccines. FDA-approved antibodies include Alemtuzumab (Campeth-1H), Atezolizumab, Ipilimumab (Yervoy), Nivolumab, Ofatumumab, Pembrolizumab, Rituximab, etc. Besides monoclonal antibodies can be used as an immunotherapy, the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoints pathways are critical to the immune system’s ability to control cancer growth. Ipilimumab (Yervoy), Nivolumab (Opdivo), and Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) are examples of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Like monoclonal antibodies, non-specific immunotherapies or cytokine therapy such as interferons – interferon alpha (Roferon-A [2a], Intron A [2b], Alferon [2a]) and interleukins – interleukin-2, IL-2, or aldesleukin (Proleukin) also help the immune system destroy cancer cells. HPV vaccine and Hepatitis B vaccine are the two cancer prevention vaccines approved by the U.S. FDA.

REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo By Ben Hirschler | LONDON LONDON AstraZeneca (AZN.L), struggling with loss of patents on blockbusters like cholesterol pill Crestor, reported another quarter of falling drug sales on Thursday as it awaits pivotal clinical trial data that may revive its fortunes. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot believes 2017 will mark the trough for the British group, as it starts to put generic losses behind it and builds up sales of recently launched and experimental cancer medicines. "The pipeline continued to deliver in what we expect will be a pivotal year," he said. "The total revenue performance reflected the transitional impact of recent patent expiries, which is expected to recede in the second half of the year." Despite income from disposals and external deals, first-quarter revenue fell 12 percent to $5.4 billion, although core earnings per share (EPS) rose 4 percent in dollar terms to 99 cents - helped by a $161 million one-off gain on the sale of short-term investments. Industry analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $5.4 billion and earnings of 82 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data. So-called "externalization" revenue, which some analysts argue unduly flatters AstraZeneca's results, rose 2 percent to $562 million, while product sales fell 13 percent to $4.8 billion. "Earnings quality concerns persist," said Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, who rates the stock 'market-perform'. Shares in the company were down 0.5 percent by midday, with analysts noting that several key new drugs had missed consensus sales forecasts, including heart drug Brilinta, Lynparza for ovarian cancer and diabetes treatment Farxiga. AstraZeneca reiterated its expectation that full-year revenue would decline at a low to mid single-digit percentage rate, with core EPS dropping by a low to mid-teens percentage. BIG BET ON CANCER For investors, owning AstraZeneca shares represents a major bet on the company's oncology portfolio. It is already doing well with new lung cancer pill Tagrisso, but the really big opportunity lies in cancer immunotherapy. Results from its closely watched MYSTIC immuno-oncology (I-O) trial in previously untreated lung cancer patients are expected mid-year. Merck & Co (MRK.N), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Roche (ROG.S) already have similar drugs approved for lung cancer but AstraZeneca hopes to carve out a market by proving the value of combining two I-O drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab. "If combination works in a large range of patients, then certainly our market share should be expected to be pretty high," Soriot told reporters. It is a big 'if' for shareholders, who are waiting to see evidence that AstraZeneca can thrive as an independent company after spurning a takeover bid from Pfizer (PFE.N) in 2014. "For long-term investors, the jury remains out on the CEO, who rebuffed the 70 billion pounds ($90 billion) offer made by Pfizer," said EdenTree Investment Management fund manager Ketan Patel. Analysts at Jefferies see a $20 billion opportunity for I-O drugs in first-line, non-small cell lung cancer, with sales split between I-O monotherapy (administering one such medicine on its own); I-O plus conventional chemotherapy; and combinations of two I-O drugs, as in AstraZeneca's approach. Outside cancer, AstraZeneca dropped development of an experimental respiratory treatment licensed from Synairgen (SYNG.L), lopping 47 percent off the value of the small British biotech firm. ($1 = 0.7752 pounds) (Reporting by Ben Hirschler; editing by Jason Neely) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles Up Next RBS posts first quarterly profit since third quarter of 2015 LONDON Royal Bank of Scotland swung to a better than expected first quarter profit of 259 million pounds ($334.24 million), it reported on Friday, its first quarterly profit since September 2015. Barclays first quarter profit doubles, misses bond trading boom LONDON Barclays reported its first quarter profit more than doubled on Friday, but its investment bank missed out on a bond trading boom that saw earnings surge at its Wall Street rivals.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Global Malignant Glioma Market Report : 2022 Edition with Leading Players Malignant glioma’s are one of the common sub-type of primary brain tumors which are highly invasive, aggressive and neurologically destructive tumors among the deadliest human cancers. Gliomas account for around 45% of primary brain tumors where children are less likely to develop the risk of gliomas. Gliomas arise from the glial cells or non-neuronal cells hence the name and the cells are supposed to provide support and protection for neurons in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Gliomas are caused due to growing or invading into or creating pressure in nearby the normal brain tissues developing tumors in the brain and spinal cord. According to the grading by WHO (World Health Organization), the grade III tumors are malignant and lead to death within 12 to 24 months. Currently more than 60% of the clinical trials in gene therapy are focused on targeting cancer. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/10076 Cancer is one of the major and global health issue faced accounting for approximately 8 million deaths globally. Heredity, geography, exposure to electromagnetic radiation and gender are some factors responsible for most of the gliomas. There is no such population or geographies where the risks for malignant glioblastoma is less hence the treatment area is much wide and has large scope for future advancements. The factors which affect this market include the limitations of chemotherapy, approvals rate for various drugs and therapies by regulatory bodies and increasing population. Lifestyle changes is one of the leading factor to acceleration of this market and indulge companies to select promising novel treatments entering the clinical arena. Pharmaceutical companies have made significant contributions in the treatment of cancer since the past several decades along with increase in spending over cancer related R&D facilities. The market for cancer is steadily increasing due to advancements in the novel methods of treatment, product innovations and successful clinical trials conducted by pharmaceuticals. There are various activities carried out by the pharmaceuticals globally to overcome the technological challenges through mergers and acquisitions, funding and patents. Companies operating in oncology segments are pre-registering for, Pre-clinical, IND, Phase I, Phase II, Phase III. Depending on geographic region, malignant glioma is segmented into five key regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. In the Malignant Glioma Market the largest market share is gained by the U.S. where there are large incidence and prevalence cases, followed by Europe where the major pharmaceuticals have their blockbuster drugs and include the major funding associations. It is observed in a survey that 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women which accounts for almost 40% of the population in U.S. are at a risk of developing cancer in the coming years. The drug development costs are overriding the costs of investments in R&D and yet there are comparatively less approved drugs which pass the Phase III trials. The developing countries as India and China have a higher scope by collaborating with the large pharmaceutical industry players and develop new drugs.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Global Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) Treatment Market is Expected to Grow Fast by 2022 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in humans that involves glial cells. GBM is present in two variants namely, giant cell glioblastoma and gliosarcoma. Gliomas are tumors arising from glial cells and may occur in the spinal cord or the brain, the latter being more common. Gliomas are the most common type of brain tumor and can be either supratentorial or infratentorial.  Seizure, nausea, headache, hemiparesis and memory loss are some of the common symptoms observed in the patients suffering from GBM. GBM is most commonly found in male with the age of 65 years and above. Alcohol consumption and malaria are the possible risk factors for the development of GBM. In addition, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, von-hippel-lindau disease, Li-fraumeni syndrome and turcot syndrome are some of the genetic disorders that are associated with increasing incidences of gliomas. Glioblastoma multiforme is a World Health Organization Grade IV tumor that represents 15 to 20% of all primary intracranial tumors. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/10112 Increasing habits of alcohol consumption, changing lifestyle and increasing incidence of seizure are some of the drivers for the growth of GBM market. GBM is generally treated by first surgically removing the tumor then treating with chemotherapy and radiation. While this treatment plan is the currently accepted standard of care, it does not effectively prevent tumor recurrence, which ultimately causes death in GBM patients. This factor is expected to be the prime restraint for the growth of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme market. Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) market is segmented on the basis of treatment, end user and geography. Primary treatment involves surgery to achieve tumor debulking, followed by a multimodal regimen of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can be added to radiotherapy for patients with unfavorable low-grade glioma to improve progression free survival. The most frequently used chemotherapy regimens are a combination of procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine, or single-agent treatment with carmustine or lomustine. Temozolomide is recommended by NICE as an option for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. Concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide given during and after radiotherapy improves survival. This drug used along with chemotherapy or radiotherapy has led to the growth of GBM treatment market to a great extent. Region wise, the global recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) market is classified into regions namely, North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. North America and Europe dominates the global GBM market owing to rising awareness, population aging, changing lifestyle and increasing healthcare awareness accentuates the growth of GBM market in these regions. In addition, Asia-Pacific region is expected to be an emerging market due to increasing demand for better healthcare facilities.

Hoffman-La Roche, Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline plc., Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer, Inc., AngioChem, Inc. Vascular Biogeneics and others.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 April 2017 by Persistence Market Research Global Antidiarrheal Drugs Market Report : 2020 Edition with Leading Players Pharmaceutical sector is growing at a significant rate globally due to increase in the prevalence of diseases, rise in aging population and improvement in the healthcare facilities. Gastrointestinal drugs may be classified on the basis of different active ingredients used in it. Antidiarrheal drugs refer to a class of drugs that are used to treat diarrhea. Antidiarrheal drugs market is growing at a significant rate globally due to increasing incidence of diarrhea and growing awareness in this field. A sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/3325 North America, followed by Europe, dominates the global market for antidiarrheal drugs due to high prevalence of diarrhea cases and high adoption rate for antidiarrheal drugs. Asia is expected to experience high growth rate in the next few years in global antidiarrheal drugs market. China and India are expected to be the fastest growing antidiarrheal drugs markets in Asia. Some of the key driving forces for antidiarrheal drugs market in emerging countries are large pool of patients, increasing awareness and improvement in the healthcare facilities. Various factors that are driving the global antidiarrheal drugs market are growing awareness for antidiarrheal drugs, rising government initiatives for improvement in healthcare facilities and increasing prevalence for diarrhea cases. However, various side effects associated with the uptake of antidiarrheal drugs, such as constipation, fullness and bloating are restraining the global antidiarrheal drugs market. In addition, traditional and home remedies are still popular in emerging countries; this restrains the antidiarrheal drugs market from growing. Emerging countries hold a good potential for the global antidiarrheal drugs market. Discovery of some antidiarrheal drugs with less side effects is expected to offer good opportunity for global antidiarrheal drugs market. Decrease in the efficacy of other medicine if taken along with antidiarrheal drug is a challenge faced by antidiarrheal drugs market.

Veterinary vaccines thus offer protection to animals similar to the way humans are vaccinated against potentially incurable diseases. The way veterinary vaccines work may be different than human vaccines however. It is often encouraged for pet owners to vaccinate their pets regularly as it is much cheaper than opting for the treatment of a sick animal. It also helps reduce the transmission of germs and bacteria within animals and thus ensures a healthier environment for all animals and pets in an area. In the case of livestock, vaccination promotes a healthier output and prevents the transmission of harmful microorganisms to humans upon consumption of meat of animal products. The common diseases for which pets and livestock are vaccinated include brucellosis, pinkeye, E. coli, and rotavirus. The report on the global veterinary vaccines market offers a descriptive analysis of the factors that have been – and will be – responsible for the progress rate of the market. These factors are dissected based on the various segments available in the market for study and player diversity.

Browse full report on Veterinary Vaccines Market- www.transparencymarketresearch.com/veterinary-vaccines-ma… Global Veterinary Vaccines Market: Trends and Opportunities: The primary driver boosting the global veterinary vaccines market is the growing consumption of animal products across the world. With a large human population associated with the demand for dairy, meat, fish, and eggs, it is necessary for the animal husbandry industry to spruce up its vaccination policies and rates. In the case of pets, the amount of pet owners in the world has also gone up considerably over the past few years. Market research points to an even higher number of pet owners by 2024. At the same time, the expenditure made by each pet owner for the health and happiness of their pets has risen significantly, further pointing to a progressively inclined rate of veterinary vaccination. The problem of high restrictions still persists in the global veterinary vaccines market as players are often barred from commercial entry due to the high market standards, regulatory restriction, and the high cost of research and development efforts. Many governments have stepped in, providing incentives and awareness initiatives for the sake of getting a larger population of the domesticated animal kingdom to be protected from harm. Global Veterinary Vaccines Market: Region-wise Outlook: The global veterinary vaccines market is expected to reach US$11.4 bn by 2024, after being projected at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2016 to 2024. Regionally speaking, a large chunk of this current growth rate is attributed to the high demand shown by North America and its growing populations of pet owners and livestock. The emerging economies from Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East are simultaneously showing a very high growth rate in their consumption of veterinary vaccines owing to greater awareness and an increasing demand for animal products.

By EmmaCourt Reporter Gilead Sciences Inc. will be grappling with severely lowered expectations when the company reports first-quarter earnings, scheduled for Tuesday after the bell. But that might actually be a good thing for the Foster City, Calif.-based biopharmaceutical company GILD, +0.53% Wall Street analysts say. The company issued lowered 2017 sales guidance earlier this year after disappointing fourth-quarter sales, including big sales declines among the company’s hepatitis C drugs, Harvoni and Sovaldi. They cure the infectious disease and cost about $80,000 for a course of treatment. That guidance came in lower than Wall Street analysts expected, and some believe that could lift the company to a slight beat this quarter. See more: Gilead cured hepatitis C. That’s become its biggest problem There’s evidence that total hepatitis C prescriptions have stabilized, though they’re still down compared with previous years, said EvercoreISI analyst Umer Raffat, who believes Gilead will come out “slightly” ahead on hepatitis C drugs. Read: This is the most expensive drug in America “This could be a good name to rent, ‘rent’ on the quarter,” said Mizuho analyst Salim Syed. Because of Gilead’s below-consensus guidance, “some people think they kitchen-sinked it. And [prescription] data looks pretty good going in the first quarter.” Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Analysts expect Gilead to report first-quarter earnings of $2.28 per share, according to the FactSet consensus. Gilead has missed the FactSet earnings consensus in five of the last six consecutive quarters. The software platform Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from buy-side and sell-side analysts, hedge funds, academics and others, has the company earning slightly more, at $2.32 per share. Revenue: Analysts expect Gilead to report first-quarter revenue of $6.62 billion, according to the FactSet consensus. Gilead has missed the FactSet revenue consensus in five of the last six consecutive quarters. Estimize has Gilead earning more, or $6.74 billion. Stock reaction: Gilead shares have declined 3.7% over the last three months, compared with a 4.0% rise in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.06% Gilead’s average rating is overweight, according to FactSet, with a price target of $79.38. Still, a slight first-quarter beat may not lift Gilead’s shares much or at all, Raffat said, since expectations for the company have been lowered so much. What to watch for: Oncology drugs could be a “good near-to-medium term fix” for Gilead, said Mizuho’s Syed. And, though it’s still early, analyst and investors are keeping an eye on drugs being developed for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or fatty liver disease. Gilead is one of those companies and “long term, NASH could probably be interesting for this company,” Syed said. He also said, “I would argue that if anyone figures out the NASH puzzle and how to develop a cure for NASH, how to treat NASH, Gilead should definitely be in the running, at least. They do have a core competency in liver disease.” Investors should also keep an eye on HIV drug competition, said EvercoreISI’s Raffat, including drugs being developed by Merck & Co. MRK, -0.19%  and GlaxoSmithKline GSK, +0.25% Then there’s the hope for tax reform, a plan for which President Donald Trump discussed just this week, and which has tantalized many pharmaceutical companies. With $27 billion in overseas cash and $32 billion in cash world-wide, “tax reform, obviously, could be something that is beneficial to Gilead,” Syed said.

Approximately 10 million cases of venous thromboembolism occur annually. VTE refers to the formation of blood clots in vein. If the clot is in deep vein (usually leg), it is called as deep vein thrombosis, while a clot in lungs is termed as pulmonary embolism. There are around 100,000 to 300,000 VTE related deaths reported annually in the U.S. (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Inc.). The number is much higher in Europe, which is at 544,000 deaths annually. Moreover, it is also estimated that up to 60% of VTE cases occur during or after hospitalization. This preventable health condition is usually overlooked as a major public health problem leading to deaths.

On the basis of product type, the market is segmented as follows: Drug therapy Heparin Apixaban Dabigatran Rivaroxaban Edoxaban Warfarin Devices Thrombolytic therapy Heparin has been the gold standard for treating VTE. In a recent study published (2017) in the New England Journal of Medicine, Rivaroxaban has shown to be more effective in reducing the risk of a recurrent events in patients with venous thromboembolism in equipoise with continued anticoagulation medications compared to Aspirin. Devices used for treating VTE include compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression devices. Thrombolytic therapy includes administering tissue plasminogen activator. Ask for Discount before buying @ https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-discount/188 Innovative treatment and drugs to fuel growth of global venous thromboembolism market The APEX (Acute Medically Ill VTE Prevention with Extended Duration Betrixaban) trial reported in March 2017 that extended use of betrixaban post parenteral prophylaxis with enoxaparin lowers the VTE incidence among patients discharged from hospital. Currently, there no anticoagulants approved for extended-duration use in patients after hospital discharge and in those who are at high risk of VTE. This treatment approach could significantly benefit those patients and be a growth contributor for the global venous thromboembolism market. Global venous thromboembolism market regional overview Based on the article published by the steering committee of world Thrombosis Day in 2014, incidence rate of VTE in North America, Western Europe, Australia and southern Latin America (Argentina) was in the range of 0.75-2.69 per 1,000 individuals, which increase to 2-7 per 1,000 individuals in population aged 70 years and above. Moreover, according its research findings, awareness about venous thromboembolism is very low globally. Furthermore, the condition is largely undocumented, except in North America and Europe. Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited commenced a large scale clinical registry for cancer-VTE patients in Japan, in March 2017. This facility would enroll and follow up to 10,000 cancer patients for a year to achieve following objectives: Frequency of concurrent VTE Treatment status of VTE Investigate the incidence of VTE events, ischemic stroke, haemorrhagic events, and systemic embolisms Clarify appropriate use of Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC) including Lixiana (Edoxaban) This is expected to provide a tremendous stimulus to the venous thromboembolism market. Low public awareness is one of the major factors responsible for confined growth rate of VTE market, especially in emerging nations such as India, China, Brazil, Turkey, and Indonesia. The market is poised to grow with growing awareness level, increasing healthcare spending and easier accessibility for the masses.
