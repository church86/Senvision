Cancer treatments are poised to become the biggest earner in the pharmaceutical industry 06 January 2017 - 16:27 PM Agency Staff Picture: THINKSTOCK Berlin — Years before becoming a top cancer specialist, Eric Winer used to save money on his own medical care by talking US pharmacists into giving him expired treatments free of charge. Winer, who has a bleeding disorder known as haemophilia, knew the drugs would still work for a brief time after the official use-by date. The young physician was trying to stay within his insurer’s spending limit and avoid having to pay out of pocket one day. Decades later, he recollects that anxious time as he tries to make sense of the soaring prices of drugs for his own cancer patients. "Cancer is just viewed differently in our society," said Winer, 60, who is chief strategy officer and director of the Breast Oncology Centre at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. "It evokes more fear. And somehow, I think the manufacturers of these drugs are able to take advantage of that in terms of the prices they set." WHO says more Africans are at risk of chronic illness That cancer angst, combined with prices that have surpassed $200,000 a year for revolutionary new treatments, is poised to give oncology medicines the biggest share of the $519bn global pharmaceuticals market this year, eclipsing drugs for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases for the first time. And while drug makers claim the revenue will propel innovation, the costs are stoking patients’ distress and creating a rift between manufacturers, health authorities and payers in many markets. Take the new lung-cancer drugs from Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche, for instance. They are part of a new class of treatments known as immune therapies, which harness the body’s own cells to fight tumours and tantalise doctors with the possibility of defeating one of the most common causes of death in the developed world. The drugs are a game-changer for some patients, helping them live more than twice as long. They are also expensive: from $12,500 to $13,100 per month of therapy. And now they are being combined with other medicines. Bristol-Myers estimates a cocktail of its Opdivo drug with another immune product Yervoy, for melanoma patients, costs between $145,000 and $256,000 a year. It has received "very little push-back on the pricing," says chief commercial officer Murdo Gordon, because patients are living long enough to come back for annual checkups for the first time. "What about the people who can’t get coverage?" Winer asked in December. "Nobody can afford this." The prices also mean doctors must wrestle with how much benefit is worth the cost, even as they try to focus on which treatment is best for individual patients, he said. No death sentence Merck’s Keytruda, which harnesses the immune system and can help patients with a form of skin cancer that was once a death sentence, costs about $12,900 per month. Merck is studying biomarkers in the body to target the patients who will benefit most from the drug, and believes its value is being reflected appropriately, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Global revenue from branded oncology treatments may rise 12% to surpass $100bn this year, according to a Bloomberg Industries survey of analysts’ estimates, before climbing to about $150bn by 2020. Costly new medicines should not take all of the blame, because at least two other factors are at play. Drug makers are taking advantage of the rising tide to lift prices on older treatments as well, and cancer patients live longer, meaning they are left paying for drugs for a longer time. "That’s a mixed blessing," said Steven Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts Holding, one of the biggest managers of prescription-drug benefits in the US, the world’s largest market for pharmaceuticals. "We’re going to be able to help people who previously weren’t able to be helped, and so we’re very excited about that. On the other hand, it’s going to beg the question: Are we going to be able to afford it?" Deaths caused by lung and cervical cancers jump in SA Pricing principles Last year just two drugs, Celgene’s Revlimid and Novartis’s Gleevec, accounted for more than one-fifth of oncology spending through Express Scripts, one of the key intermediaries that negotiate with drug makers for rebates on the list prices on behalf of their customers. Novartis raised the price of Gleevec 19% in 2015, before it faced generic competition last February, according to Express Scripts. Neither drug is brand-new: Gleevec was first approved in 2003 and Revlimid in 2005. Celgene said it has "pricing principles" designed to keep developing cutting-edge medicines, but account for varying levels of affluence in countries around the world. Novartis points out that Gleevec’s US price has not budged since 2015 and drug makers need to recoup their research investment and fund further innovation. Express Scripts and its rivals have started pushing back. CVS Health in August said it will no longer cover some treatments for cancer in 2017, including Novartis’s leukaemia treatment Tasigna, and Medivation’s prostate cancer drug Xtandi. This is the first time brand-name oncology drugs have been taken off its standard formulary list. Express Scripts, which handles price negotiations on behalf of clients for pills and drugs that patients inject themselves, expects the cancer-drug spending it oversees to spike about 20% annually for the next three years. Pay for results? In response, the benefits manager says it is expanding a programme that allows for different prices depending on how effective drugs are, and grants refunds when treatment ends early. Express Scripts will not disclose details of the drugs involved, but the goal is to cover nearly one-quarter of the oncology pharmacy spending that it will oversee this year, up from 5% in 2016. Government authorities are taking note — and pushing back as well in some cases. US president-elect Donald Trump has declared himself an opponent of high drug prices, and said he would favour allowing the import of treatments from abroad. In Germany and the UK, the health systems rely on expert panels to assess whether new medicines help patients more than old ones, and pricing power follows. Unhealthy South Africans the lure for multinational drugs companies The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has turned down funding for a handful of new cancer medicines lately, saying their benefits do not justify their cost. It is currently debating a new Roche treatment for breast tumours called Kadcyla. Pay-for-performance would in theory be a way to maintain prices for cancer medicines that work and winnow out those that do not. But such a system is hard to introduce in the US, the world’s biggest pharmaceuticals market, where federal and private insurers are often on different reimbursement structures, said Nicolas Dunant, a spokesman for Roche. The company has been in talks with 20 European countries since 2012 on outcomes-based pricing and has already introduced package prices for some cancers in Italy and Switzerland. "We would welcome a system where we could price a medicine based on how it performs," Dunant said. "In order to pursue such an approach, we need data." In the meantime, patients — and especially those with inadequate insurance — are the ones left juggling financial worries alongside medical ones. Bloomberg Please login or register to comment.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Years before becoming a top cancer specialist, Eric Winer used to save money on his own medical care by talking U.S. pharmacists into giving him expired treatments for free. Winer, who has a bleeding disorder known as hemophilia, knew the drugs would still work for a brief time after the official use-by date. The young physician was trying to stay within his insurer's spending limit and avoid having to pay out of pocket one day.  Decades later, he recollects that anxious time as he tries to make sense of the soaring prices of drugs for his own cancer patients. "Cancer is just viewed differently in our society," said Winer, 60, who is chief strategy officer and director of the Breast Oncology Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. "It evokes more fear. And somehow, I think the manufacturers of these drugs are able to take advantage of that in terms of the prices they set." That cancer angst, combined with prices that have surpassed $200,000 a year for revolutionary new treatments, is poised to give oncology medicines the biggest share of the $519-billion global pharmaceuticals market this year, eclipsing drugs for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases for the first time. And while drugmakers claim the revenue will propel innovation, the costs are stoking patients' distress and creating a rift between manufacturers, health authorities and payers in many markets. Take the new lung-cancer drugs from Merck & Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Roche Holding Co., for instance. They are part of a new class of treatments known as immune therapies, which harness the body's own cells to fight tumors and tantalize doctors with the possibility of defeating one of the most common causes of death in the developed world. The drugs are a game-changer for some patients, helping them live more than twice as long. They're also expensive: from $12,500 to $13,100 per month of therapy. And now they're getting combined with other medicines. Bristol-Myers estimates a cocktail of its Opdivo drug with another immune product, Yervoy, for melanoma patients costs between $145,000 and $256,000 a year. It's received "very little push-back on the pricing," says Chief Commercial Officer Murdo Gordon, because patients are living long enough to come back for annual checkups for the first time. "What about the people who can't get coverage?" Winer said in December. "Nobody can afford this." The prices also mean doctors must wrestle with how much benefit is worth the cost, even as they try to focus on which treatment is best for individual patients, he said. No Death Sentence Merck's Keytruda, which harnesses the immune system and can help patients with a form of skin cancer that was once a death sentence, costs about $12,900 per month. Merck is studying biomarkers in the body to target the patients who will benefit most from the drug, and believes its value is being reflected appropriately, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Global revenue from branded oncology treatments may rise 12 percent to surpass $100 billion this year, according to a Bloomberg Industries survey of analysts' estimates, before climbing to about $150 billion by 2020. Costly new medicines shouldn't take the whole blame, because at least two other factors are at play. Drugmakers are taking advantage of the rising tide to lift prices on older treatments as well, and cancer patients live longer, meaning they're left paying for drugs for a longer time. "That's a mixed blessing," said Steven Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts Holding Co., one of the biggest managers of prescription-drug benefits in the U.S., the world's largest market for pharmaceuticals. "We're going to be able to help people who previously weren't able to be helped, and so we're very excited about that. On the other hand, it's going to beg the question: Are we going to be able to afford it?" Pricing Principles Last year just two drugs, Celgene Corp.'s Revlimid and Novartis AG's Gleevec, accounted for more than one-fifth of oncology spending through Express Scripts, one of the key intermediaries that negotiate with drugmakers for rebates on the list prices on behalf of their customers. Novartis raised the price of Gleevec 19 percent in 2015, before it faced generic competition last February, according to Express Scripts. Neither drug is brand-new: Gleevec was first approved in 2003 and Revlimid in 2005. Celgene said it has "pricing principles" designed to keep developing cutting-edge medicines but account for varying levels of affluence in countries around the world. Novartis points out Gleevec's U.S. price hasn't budged since 2015 and drugmakers need to recoup their research investment and fund further innovation. Express Scripts and its rivals have started pushing back. CVS Health Corp. in August said it will no longer cover some treatments for cancer in 2017, including Novartis's leukemia treatment Tasigna, and Medivation Inc.'s prostate cancer drug Xtandi. That's the first time that brand-name oncology drugs have been taken off its standard formulary list. Express Scripts, which handles price negotiations on behalf of clients for pills and drugs that patients inject themselves, expects the cancer-drug spending it oversees to spike about 20 percent annually for the next three years. Pay for Results? In response, the benefits manager says it's expanding a program that allows for different prices depending on how effective drugs are, and grants refunds when treatment ends early. Express Scripts won't disclose details on the drugs involved, but the goal is to cover nearly one-quarter of the oncology pharmacy spending that it will oversee this year, up from 5 percent in 2016. Government authorities are taking note — and pushing back as well in some cases. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has declared himself an opponent of high drug prices, and said he'd favor allowing the import of treatments from abroad. In Germany and the U.K., the health systems rely on expert panels to assess whether new medicines help patients more than old ones, and pricing power follows. The U.K.'s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has turned down funding for a handful of new cancer medicines lately, saying their benefits don't justify their cost. It's currently debating a new Roche treatment for breast tumors called Kadcyla. Pay-for-performance would in theory be a way to maintain prices for cancer medicines that work and winnow out those that don't. But such a system is hard to introduce in the U.S., the world's biggest pharmaceuticals market, where federal and private insurers are often on different reimbursement structures, said Nicolas Dunant, a spokesman for Roche. The company has been in talks with 20 European countries since 2012 on outcomes-based pricing and has already introduced package prices for some cancers in Italy and Switzerland. "We would welcome a system where we could price a medicine based on how it performs," Dunant said. "In order to pursue such an approach, we need data." In the meantime, patients — and especially those with inadequate insurance — are the ones left juggling financial worries alongside medical ones. © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

Jim Crumly (TMFSpeyside) Jan 6, 2017 at 8:21AM British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK) recently submitted a license application to the Food and Drug Administration for its new shingles vaccine, Shingrix, forging ahead in its effort to launch a new billion-dollar product. The vaccine has a high probability of commercial success if approved, and an important ingredient portends other big winners in the future. Image source: GlaxoSmithKline plc. Shingles, or herpes zoster, is a painful disease that afflicts 1 million people a year in the U.S. and is caused by the reactivation of latent chickenpox virus. Almost everyone born in this country before 1980 carries the virus and has a 30% chance of developing shingles in their lifetime. The virus lies dormant until the immune system weakens with age, which is the reason why the risk of developing shingles increases starting at age 50. Merck (NYSE:MRK) markets a live, attenuated virus shingles vaccine, Zostavax, but the product is only 51% effective. Even more unfortunate is the fact that the Merck vaccine is less effective in older patients, with efficacy dropping to 18% for patients 80 years old and above. Since the risk of contracting shingles increases with age, with people over the age of 85 having 1-in-2 odds of getting it, the vaccine is least effective in the population that needs it the most. Also, efficacy drops off significantly with time after the vaccine is administered, which has led the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to advise that people under 60 not be immunized even though the FDA has allowed it down to age 50. Since protection wanes within the first five years after vaccination and the duration of protection beyond that time is uncertain, the accepted practice is to delay vaccination so that maximum protection will be in place when the risk of shingles is higher. Shingrix should eclipse sales of the competition Phase 3 testing of Shingrix has shown dramatic advantages over Zostavax. Efficacy was measured between 90% to 97% in patients aged 50 to 80, and it almost completely eliminated the risk of postherpatic neuralgia, a complication of shingles that can cause severe, chronic pain for months or years. The persistence of the protection the vaccine provides remained absolutely flat for the four years of the tests. For this reason, Glaxo believes that ACIP will recommend vaccinating patients as early as 50 years of age, and vaccination rates in older patients should increase due to the dramatic improvement in effectiveness. Furthermore, Shingrix is a recombinant sub-unit vaccine rather than a live, attenuated virus like Zostavax. Live virus vaccines can't be used in immune-compromised patients, whereas Shingrix should have no problem getting approval for those situations. Merck sold $746 million of Zostavax in 2015, but analysts predict Shingrix will break the billion-dollar mark by 2021. It's not difficult to see how this could happen. Besides opening up the 50-60 age bracket and beating Merck with a vaccine that is more effective for all age groups, GlaxoSmithKline should be able to globalize the product to a much greater extent. Merck has been limited in the number of countries it has been able launch its product due to the manufacturing constraints of working with a live virus. The recombinant antigen that Glaxo has developed is much easier to manufacture and transport, so the company intends to have a global launch from the beginning. Finally, Glaxo intends to test Shingrix on patients who have already been vaccinated, so those who have already been treated with Zostavax, an estimated 25% of the target population, are also potential customers. AS01, a platform for vaccines for the elderly A billion-dollar product is good enough news about the Glaxo vaccine business, which in total ran at a $5.4 billion sales rate in the last 12 months. But even better news for investors is why the efficacy of Shingrix is so far ahead the competition. Along with the antigen, Shingrix includes a proprietary adjuvant system that GlaxoSmithKline calls AS01. Adjuvants are substances that are added to vaccines to stimulate a stronger response from the body's immune system, and have been in use for over 90 years. Adjuvant systems are more recent developments that combine multiple compounds for greater effect. Glaxo's AS01, also being tested in its malaria vaccine, provokes an unusually high immune response in frail populations. Vaccines typically have moderate efficacy in the elderly, but Glaxo believes that AS01 is a breakthrough in vaccinology that will enable a number of new, highly effective vaccines for that demographic. The company is working on new elderly vaccines utilizing AS01 for the life-threatening diseases respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the latter in phase 2 trials. Eventually the innovation could lead to an entire family of vaccines developed specifically for the growing population of older people across the world. GSK expects that Shingrix alone will provide one-third of the growth of its vaccine business through 2020. But if AS01 lives up to its promise, other vaccines that are highly effective in vulnerable populations will follow. Growing the slow-and-steady vaccine business as a counterweight to the risks in pharmaceuticals is a key part of the company's growth strategy, and vaccines have been a standout this year. GlaxoSmithKline is the leader in the global vaccine market, and Shingrix is a strong indication that the business will continue to perform well. Savvy investors with a long-term outlook should take notice that other blockbuster vaccines may lie ahead. Jim Crumly has no position in any stocks mentioned.

AS01, a platform for vaccines for the elderly A billion-dollar product is good enough news about the Glaxo vaccine business, which in total ran at a $5.4 billion sales rate in the last 12 months. But even better news for investors is why the efficacy of Shingrix is so far ahead the competition. Along with the antigen, Shingrix includes a proprietary adjuvant system that GlaxoSmithKline calls AS01. Adjuvants are substances that are added to vaccines to stimulate a stronger response from the body's immune system, and have been in use for over 90 years. Adjuvant systems are more recent developments that combine multiple compounds for greater effect. Glaxo's AS01, also being tested in its malaria vaccine, provokes an unusually high immune response in frail populations. Vaccines typically have moderate efficacy in the elderly, but Glaxo believes that AS01 is a breakthrough in vaccinology that will enable a number of new, highly effective vaccines for that demographic. The company is working on new elderly vaccines utilizing AS01 for the life-threatening diseases respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the latter in phase 2 trials. Eventually the innovation could lead to an entire family of vaccines developed specifically for the growing population of older people across the world. GSK expects that Shingrix alone will provide one-third of the growth of its vaccine business through 2020. But if AS01 lives up to its promise, other vaccines that are highly effective in vulnerable populations will follow. Growing the slow-and-steady vaccine business as a counterweight to the risks in pharmaceuticals is a key part of the company's growth strategy, and vaccines have been a standout this year. GlaxoSmithKline is the leader in the global vaccine market, and Shingrix is a strong indication that the business will continue to perform well. Savvy investors with a long-term outlook should take notice that other blockbuster vaccines may lie ahead. Jim Crumly has no position in any stocks mentioned.

QuickTake Drug Prices Winer, who has a bleeding disorder known as hemophilia, knew the drugs would still work for a brief time after the official use-by date. The young physician was trying to stay within his insurer’s spending limit and avoid having to pay out of pocket one day. Decades later, he recollects that anxious time as he tries to make sense of the soaring prices of drugs for his own cancer patients. “Cancer is just viewed differently in our society,” said Winer, 60, who is chief strategy officer and director of the Breast Oncology Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “It evokes more fear. And somehow, I think the manufacturers of these drugs are able to take advantage of that in terms of the prices they set.” That cancer angst, combined with prices that have surpassed $200,000 a year for revolutionary new treatments, is poised to give oncology medicines the biggest share of the $519-billion global pharmaceuticals market this year, eclipsing drugs for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases for the first time. And while drugmakers claim the revenue will propel innovation, the costs are stoking patients’ distress and creating a rift between manufacturers, health authorities and payers in many markets. Take the new lung-cancer drugs from Merck & Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Roche Holding Co., for instance. They are part of a new class of treatments known as immune therapies, which harness the body’s own cells to fight tumors and tantalize doctors with the possibility of defeating one of the most common causes of death in the developed world. The drugs are a game-changer for some patients, helping them live more than twice as long. They’re also expensive: from $12,500 to $13,100 per month of therapy. And now they’re getting combined with other medicines. Bristol-Myers estimates a cocktail of its Opdivo drug with another immune product, Yervoy, for melanoma patients costs between $145,000 and $256,000 a year. It’s received “very little push-back on the pricing,” says Chief Commercial Officer Murdo Gordon, because patients are living long enough to come back for annual checkups for the first time. “What about the people who can’t get coverage?” Winer said in December. “Nobody can afford this.” The prices also mean doctors must wrestle with how much benefit is worth the cost, even as they try to focus on which treatment is best for individual patients, he said. No Death Sentence Merck’s Keytruda, which harnesses the immune system and can help patients with a form of skin cancer that was once a death sentence, costs about $12,900 per month. Merck is studying biomarkers in the body to target the patients who will benefit most from the drug, and believes its value is being reflected appropriately, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Global revenue from branded oncology treatments may rise 12 percent to surpass $100 billion this year, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence survey of analysts’ estimates, before climbing to about $150 billion by 2020. Costly new medicines shouldn’t take the whole blame, because at least two other factors are at play. Drugmakers are taking advantage of the rising tide to lift prices on older treatments as well, and cancer patients live longer, meaning they’re left paying for drugs for a longer time. “That’s a mixed blessing,” said Steven Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts Holding Co., one of the biggest managers of prescription-drug benefits in the U.S., the world’s largest market for pharmaceuticals. “We’re going to be able to help people who previously weren’t able to be helped, and so we’re very excited about that. On the other hand, it’s going to beg the question: Are we going to be able to afford it?” Pricing Principles Last year just two drugs, Celgene Corp.’s Revlimid and Novartis AG’s Gleevec, accounted for more than one-fifth of oncology spending through Express Scripts, one of the key intermediaries that negotiate with drugmakers for rebates on the list prices on behalf of their customers. Novartis raised the price of Gleevec 19 percent in 2015, before it faced generic competition last February, according to Express Scripts. Neither drug is brand-new: Gleevec was first approved in 2003 and Revlimid in 2005. Celgene said it has “pricing principles” designed to keep developing cutting-edge medicines but account for varying levels of affluence in countries around the world. Novartis points out Gleevec’s U.S. price hasn’t budged since 2015 and drugmakers need to recoup their research investment and fund further innovation. Express Scripts and its rivals have started pushing back. CVS Health Corp. in August said it will no longer cover some treatments for cancer in 2017, including Novartis’s leukemia treatment Tasigna, and Medivation Inc.’s prostate cancer drug Xtandi for new patients without a special medical justification. That’s the first time that brand-name oncology drugs have been taken off its standard formulary list. Express Scripts, which handles price negotiations on behalf of clients for pills and drugs that patients inject themselves, expects the cancer-drug spending it oversees to spike about 20 percent annually for the next three years. Pay for Results? In response, the benefits manager says it’s expanding a program that allows for different prices depending on how effective drugs are, and grants refunds when treatment ends early. Express Scripts won’t disclose details on the drugs involved, but the goal is to cover nearly one-quarter of the oncology pharmacy spending that it will oversee this year, up from 5 percent in 2016. Government authorities are taking note -- and pushing back as well in some cases. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has declared himself an opponent of high drug prices, and said he’d favor allowing the import of treatments from abroad. In Germany and the U.K., the health systems rely on expert panels to assess whether new medicines help patients more than old ones, and pricing power follows. The U.K.’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has turned down funding for a handful of new cancer medicines lately, saying their benefits don’t justify their cost. It’s currently debating a new Roche treatment for breast tumors called Kadcyla. Pay-for-performance would in theory be a way to maintain prices for cancer medicines that work and winnow out those that don’t. Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email.

The company has been in talks with 20 European countries since 2012 on outcomes-based pricing and has already introduced package prices for some cancers in Italy and Switzerland. “We would welcome a system where we could price a medicine based on how it performs,” Dunant said. “In order to pursue such an approach, we need data.” In the meantime, patients -- and especially those with inadequate insurance -- are the ones left juggling financial worries alongside medical ones.

The country introduced discussion of infectious diseases to the G8 Summit’s agenda in Okinawa in 2000, a move that paved the way for the establishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global Fund) two years later. Today, Japan is the fifth-largest contributor. Infectious diseases, particularly those termed the Big Three — HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis — have been an international priority since the establishment of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals in 2000. Many healthcare-oriented nonprofits, such as the Global Fund, aim to eliminate these threats that are so prevalent in the developing world. One such organization, the Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund, has adopted a novel approach to fighting disease. Launched in Japan just three-and-a-half years ago, GHIT was founded on the principle of open innovation — also referred to as product development partnership. This approach to research and development (R&D) facilitates tie-ups between Japanese and international entities from the public, private, and civil/nonprofit sectors to streamline drug development. ORIGINS The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is among the nine founding partners of GHIT. Hannah Kettler, senior program officer, Life Science Partnerships at the foundation, commented: “The Global Health Innovative Technology Fund is a unique partnership model that brings together the government of Japan and private funds, and leverages Japan’s industry and academic expertise to fight infectious diseases in developing countries. Public–private partnerships like this are essential to developing new global health tools, and we are thrilled to support the important work of the fund.” The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is also a founding partner. Dr Mandeep Dhaliwal, director of the HIV, Health and Development Group, said: “It remains important that governments scale up their investments in promoting innovation in new medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics — as well as the building of resilient and sustainable health systems in low- and middle-income countries—so that universal health coverage and good health and well-being can be attained for all. UNDP salutes the vision and leadership of the government of Japan in supporting both innovation and access to health technologies.” GHIT’s founders also include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and five Japanese pharmaceutical firms: Astellas Pharma Inc; Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd; Eisai Co Ltd; Shionogi & Co Ltd; and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd. The fund was conceived in a conversation between GHIT CEO Dr BT Slingsby and Dr Tachi Yamada, a US physician who envisioned “Japan’s first truly international nonprofit.” At the time of founding, Slingsby — who was involved with the project from day one — worked for Eisai, where he developed new business models for R&D and oversaw market access in the developing world. He possesses both a strong business background — having aided numerous start-ups in Japan and the United States — as well as medical expertise, with a Medical Doctorate from George Washington University. Slingsby described the origins of the fund, which are rooted in business practices, namely leveraging the principles of product development used in the private sector for public purposes. “Our internal management practices reflect those of the private sector, affecting how we define strategy, structure the organization, etc; this is one of the reasons we have grown so quickly,” he said. By September 2013, GHIT’s first year of operation, the fund had logged $8.8 million in investment into novel R&D using Japanese innovation. By March 2016, the figure had risen to $96 million. Affiliate Partner GlaxoSmithKline K.K. (GSK) took part in the GHIT Fund as one of the first global pharmaceutical companies to contribute to Japanese research and development to fight neglected diseases around the world. “GSK is a science-led global healthcare company and has three world-leading businesses that research, develop, and manufacture innovative pharmaceutical, vaccine, and consumer healthcare products,” Communications Division Head Yukimi Ito told The Journal. “We wish to contribute to innovations originating from Japan as the company is committed to widening access to drugs, so that more people can benefit, no matter where they live in the world or what they can afford to pay.” Merck, the world’s oldest pharmaceutical and chemical company, said that there are two important relationships with GHIT — one as a leader of a consortium developing a new pediatric formulation of praziquantel, a drug used to treat parasitic worm infections, and more recently, its role as an affiliate partner. As this collaboration will expand investment into research and development for neglected diseases worldwide, it perfectly aligns with Merck’s contributions to improving the health of underserved populations. “As a partner of GHIT, we are part of a network of global and Japanese partners with proven excellence in global health,” Head of Corporate Communication Japan Ritsuko Shibagaki told The Journal. “This represents an important aspect for our current and future programs on infectious diseases, considering that our operating model is based on partnerships and collaborations with leading global health institutions and organizations. By joining forces with GHIT, our overall ability to provide the most vulnerable populations with suitable health solutions should increase.” 50-PLUS PROJECTS Investments managed by GHIT are stringently selected and monitored to ensure that product development milestones are met and donor dollars are not wasted. All 50-plus projects currently in its portfolio include drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics for malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases such as Chagas. According to UN figures, three in seven people worldwide are at risk of developing infectious diseases; one in seven are already infected. Multiple investments involve partners from the United States. Currently, one of GHIT’s top-funded projects to fight malaria brings together the expertise of Eisai, St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., and Swiss nonprofit Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). The product under development is a single, multi-component drug that would cure an affected patient after just one exposure to malaria, and provide substantial post-treatment protection from reinfection. Each partner has a well-defined role: Eisai will handle manufacturing of the pharmaceutical ingredients; St. Jude’s will manage the project and carry out initial studies at its facility; MMV will oversee the next phase of studies and define the drug protocol. Discussing the product development partnership model of R&D, Slingsby explains: “Products to treat infectious diseases are not naturally generated by the market. That is why we exist. A lack of profit [for pharmaceutical companies] necessitates a public–private model to propel R&D in this space. “The science is also very difficult. Maybe a company has the technology to develop an effective malaria treatment, but has no skilled scientists in that field; thus, we facilitate international partnerships. Or perhaps a research institute needs funding for a promising venture; we can provide that. These links define the virtual health/open innovation approach.” Shigetaka Komori, chairman and CEO of Fujifilm Corporation—a GHIT partner—applauds the open innovation approach. “The Ebola crisis reinforced for us both the urgent need for global health innovation as well as how effectively industry and the global health community can mobilize together to create and deliver new solutions. Partnering with the GHIT Fund helps us engage even more meaningfully in global health over the long term, enabling us to leverage our history of innovation,” he said. GSK’s Ito said, “Our commitment to open innovation, widening access, and transparency is aligned with the vision of the GHIT Fund and we believe this partnership will certainly add value to the research and development initiatives from Japan.” A pillar of GHIT’s mission is providing products that are “accessible and affordable to the poorest of the poor.” Founders believe that improved access to healthcare in the world’s poverty-stricken nations will have a direct impact on the economic potential of such countries. Healthy citizens are better prepared to innovate and work; thus, health makes wealth. Ko-Yung Tung, senior counsellor at Morrison Foerster LLP, serves on the Board of Directors at GHIT. As previous general counsel of the World Bank, Tung oversaw the establishment of the Global Fund. He notes how GHIT is particularly valuable in its provision of grants to R&D projects addressing neglected tropical diseases, which are not pursued by commercial pharma companies. Morrison Foerster is a sponsor of the fund, providing legal services and advice in accordance with its pro bono mission to help those who are marginalized. “GHIT is a unique public–private partnership that is vigorously supported by the Japanese government as part of the third arrow of Abenomics. Though it’s been in existence for only three years, GHIT has already shown impressive results,” Tung told The Journal. “From 1995 to 2004, a total of 1,556 new drugs were approved in the US. Only 1.3 percent of these new treatments were developed to fight infectious diseases in developing nations,” explained Miyoko Tanaka, director of communication and public affairs, Medical Company, Johnson & Johnson K.K. “We envision a world where everyone has the means to be healthy and can thrive. We are committed to using our capabilities, expertise, resources, and partnerships to fulfill our role in making the world a better, healthier place for generations to come.” Tanaka added: “We hope that our partnership with the fund enables the organization to continue investing in new, innovative technology for neglected diseases, as well as promising candidates that have recently entered clinical trials, or will eventually enter late-stage trials.” None of the fund’s managed products have hit the market yet, but several are in later stages of development such as clinical trials. Within the next few years, Slingsby said, we should see the launch of some exciting new technologies. In the private pharmaceutical sector, vaccines and treatments can take a decade or more to go to market. GHIT strives to get its products into the hands of people who need them most within five to 10 years. SCIENCE POWERHOUSE Apart from its open innovation approach, GHIT is distinct in its close collaboration with the Japanese government. In addition, each investment (grant) application must include at least one Japanese and one international partner. Projects may include as few as two or as many as six partners. Because it is a matching fund, every dollar committed by the government is matched by donors, be they private-sector companies or civil foundations. Tung highlights how, at the 2015 G7 Ise-Shima Summit, the Japanese government specifically named GHIT as an important initiative in a joint declaration on global health. It also doubled its funding commitment to projects fighting disease in the developing world. “The Japanese government has always been very committed to global health and international cooperation, seeking to approach problems through innovation. Innovation comes from science, and Japan is a science powerhouse. The potential for innovation is enormous here, but it’s questionable how much that has been realized in healthcare products; that is our role at GHIT. The government’s decision to invest in R&D specific to global health is rather novel, yet has become a prominent pillar of current government policy,” Slingsby adds. The Japanese government’s investment in the GHIT Fund is a direct realization of the country’s 2013 Strategy on Global Health Diplomacy, which is closely linked to the Healthcare and Medical Strategy, launched the same year. Kumi Sato, president and CEO of COSMO PR and American Chamber of Commerce in Japan Chairman Emeritus, serves as an advisor to the fund. Her company, which focuses on the healthcare field, supports nonprofits such as GHIT with similar missions. “Global health is a concept that was, until recently, relatively unknown or misunderstood. Given the importance of the topic, we wanted to be part of efforts to build the awareness needed for GHIT’s success. This is one of the reasons why I am personally excited to be involved with this organization,” Sato told The Journal. “As one of the first funds of its type in the country, GHIT demonstrates that the government recognizes the importance of this kind of new collaborative model, and gives Japan the ability to deploy investment into the field. In fulfilling a purpose previously unmet here — a public–private partnership designed to tackle the most complex challenges of global health — GHIT serves as a catalyst for substantive change, and the results of that change will speak for themselves.” Custom Media publishes The Journal for the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Glenmark x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Aurobindo x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Telling signs of a midlife crisis are apparent among top Indian drug makers as fatigue sets in on a marathon run of two decades selling generics in the US. A long hold by the US FDA on Indian manufacturing facilities has left the industry with sobered expectations. The narrative is moving to “building brands,” “portfolio balancing” and “predictable revenues.” Sun Pharma, Dr. Reddy’s, Glenmark, Zydus Cadila, Aurobindo and their ilk are embracing a new life. Deploying investments to bolster indigenous research and lapping up late clinical stage drugs or new brands is heralding a seismic shift from churning copies of drugs to the daunting world of innovative or differentiated brands. BUILDING BRANDS Top drug maker Sun Pharma is the first off the block in shaping those ambitious plans. Focusing sharply on ophthalmology, cancer and dermatology products, last month it paid Rs 1,190 crore ($175 million) to Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis for rights over Odomzo, a brand approved in 2015 by US FDA, that helps treat a form of advanced skin cancer. For the home grown drug maker the task, though uphill, is cut out. Odomzo will closely rival the $50 billion biotech behemoth Roche’s Erivedge. It is an odd match, critics say, but Sun has finite choices. Its founder and CEO Dilip Shanghvi is known for strategic manoeuvres that led his company to scale the top slot among the local peers. Moving into new research drugs over the next few years seems top of mind for the man thrifty with words. “Innovative brands as opposed to supplying generics to distributors is a significant shift. Indian companies are at a stage of maturity where building a pipeline is important,” says Sujay Shetty who heads the Indian lifesciences business for PwC, the global consulting firm. A similar view is expressed in a note from Chirag Talati of Kotak Institutional Equities. Talati said Odomzo can generate $80 million in sales by 2020-21 with peak potential of $120-150 million. The forecast appears modest against the money shelled out by Sun but the excitement is palpable in adding heft for the future. “Sun’s Levulan drug/device combination for actinic keratosis, a form of pre-cancerous cells, gives it access to dermatologists who account for 70% of prescriptions for laBCC (locally advanced basal cell carcinoma). Combined with MK-3222 (a drug licensed from Merck and being developed for psoriasis), we believe Odomzo will help raise Sun Pharma’s brand profile amongst dermatologists and help leverage the field force to drive prescription share,” Talati explained.Assets acquired by Sun over the last two years brings further clarity. In 2014, it bought MK-3222, a late stage experimental psoriasis drug from Merck. If approved by the US FDA, Sun will jostle with Janssen, Eli Lilly and Novartis. Opinion is divided on how well Sun can manage in reaping the rewards from its psoriasis drug against the established giants but it is largely seen as a calculated step. In Sept. 2015, Sun picked InSite Vision, which enabled the recent commercial launch of BromSite, its first branded eyecare drug. In October 2016, the company acquired Ocular Therapeutics for $40 million, digging further into the ophthalmology market. Odomzo could kick start a branded oncology play, as indicated by Kirti Ganorkar, the global head of business development at Sun Pharma at the time of announcing the deal. BRANDED PLAY “Going forward, we expect increased R&D spends in development of future product pipeline in specialty and differentiated products,” Sun Pharma told ET. While R&D is considered the engine that helps a company deliver products, brand marketing is an art and numerous examples abound of wayside kills. Sun Pharma is fueling top dollars to rope in talent from global drug firms to embellish its marketing unit in the US. An expert who has studied marketing trends in the US said if the efforts reach fruition, Sun may see its sales surge past a billion dollars from specialty and branded or OTC business as its US revenues could double to over $4 billion by 2020. PwC’s Shetty said the moves to grow a branding business is expected and will only intensify. “Profits from generics is cut to the bone except in a few cases. Companies are moving on the maturity curve and cherry pick brands in the next three to four years,” he noted reminiscing how Israeli giant Teva had a head start with its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone that clocked peak sales of over $4 billion. A similar roadmap but one that leans on a differentiated portfolio is being put into play at Hyderabadbased Dr. Reddy’s Labs. The company that reported revenues of $2.4 billion last year has for the past few years devised its differentiated strategy. It has about 85 pending filings (ANDA/NDA). Almost two-thirds of these are complex generics or those that have limited competition. Drilling further, injectables are likely to be a key growth driver accounting for a third of the revenues by 2020, the company told ET. Abhijit Mukherjee, COO, Dr. Reddy’s said most branded products have evolved out of in-depth research and work with physicians and patients. “We continue to work with physicians to create the Rx (prescriptions) pull and at the same time, collaborate with payers to have enough coverage for these drugs.” Between dermatology and neurology drugs alone, Dr. Reddy’s has fanned out over 100 sales employees in the US. Last year it launched Zembrace SymTouch, a novel drug and device combo to treat acute episodes of migraine pain. With its R&D spend spiraling to 11%-15% of sales, Dr. Reddy’s is hoping to gain further traction in its US brands business. It has identified drugs that require complex characterization, novel regulatory pathway and are approved at the back of large and complex clinical studies. Although its biosimilars ambitions is moving at a slow clip in India, its US filings for cancer drugs rituximab and Peg-GCSF as early as 2014 indicates interest in selling drugs with higher regulatory benchmarks, even it the clinical trials take a substantially longer time for regulatory reviews.. RIGHT REVENUE MIX Utkarsh Palnitkar, head of KPMG’s lifesciences practice said brand-based growth may take time to build but it is far less risky for larger companies as compared to generics. Over time it may help change the revenue mix, he said. Aurobindo Pharma is another company that is expected to dive deeper into selling complex drugs. Experts noted AB rated drugs in the US or drugs that show therapeutic equivalence to other drugs may be a potential area being explored by the company. The company did not respond to mails from ET. One market analyst believed Aurobindo’s contribution from complex generics could vault five-fold from a low base of $37 million in 2015-16 to about $200 million in 2020. Against that, its revenues from plain generics may seek a slower uptick from $753 million to $1.28 billion during the same time frame. Over its most recent earnings call, N. Govindarajan, Managing Director, Aurobindo Pharma informed analysts about plans to develop complex products like hormones, oncology, liposomal and microsphere depot injectables which can be expected to be filed from the beginning of the 2017-18. Mumbai-based Glenmark is another drug maker to have a strong ambition on discovering new drugs. With arguably the most successful track record in researching drugs and out-licensing them among its Indian peers, Glenmark envisages at least a third of its revenues to come from specialty and innovative drugs by 2025. At a recent media briefing, Glenmark showcased nine drugs that are in the works at its network of research labs based in the UK, Switzerland and India. Through its proprietary BEAT (Bispecific Engagement by Antibodies based on T-cell receptors) technology, Glenmark has built a pipeline of biological drugs to treat cancer. Company executives believe these have the potential to compete against drugs that are considered to be best in class at present. Zydus Cadila, the low profile Ahmedabad-based drug maker has similar plans on branded drugs. The drug maker is conducting Phase II trials for its flagship drug Saroglitazar in the US for diabetic dyslipidaemia and NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) commonly known as the fatty liver disease. CHALLENGES AHEAD While the market opportunities to sell brands appear optimistic, that road is less treaded by Indian companies and obvious challenges can lead to adversities. Developing drugs is a costly affair and in popular estimates a global drug maker typically spends close to $2.5 billion to get a drug from the lab to the market. Plus, regulatory clearances go through a tough screening process. That apart, acceptance in the market is subject to comparative effectiveness against competing brands and reimbursement by insurance companies. Drug makers are also besieged by manufacturing lapses at their Indian sites. Perpetual scrutiny by the US regulatory agency has dented confidence as barring a few exceptions, most firms are battling fundamental quality issues, some of which require serious remedial action failing which they may risk reputation. In the opinion of an analyst who has held a negative view on the sector growth, deficiencies at Indian sites may cloud near to medium term earnings. Although a few others believe the observations are on expected lines and may be resolved over two to three years. Also, an ongoing investigation by US federal agencies and the US Department of Justice could deter companies from charging a high price for the brands to the patients. “Although known to be business friendly, healthcare is a high decibel debate in the US. The new President will keep a tight lid on pharmaceutical companies – both generics and branded. It’s a leap of faith,” he cautioned.

Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

Stock Surged 11% in 2016 A rival's pain was this drugmaker's big gain in 2016. Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Jan 6, 2017 at 9:42AM Image source: Getty Images. What happened Shares of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), a U.S.-based global drug behemoth, climbed 11% higher in 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, slightly outpacing the 9.5% return of the S&P 500, and putting the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF in the rearview mirror with an outperformance of 35 percentage points. So what While Merck benefited from modest sales and profit growth in 2016, there were two considerably larger catalysts that pushed its valuation up by a double-digit percentage. The biggest bump came in August when rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) announced that its CheckMate-026 study involving cancer immunotherapy Opdivo had flopped as a first-line treatment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients whose tumors had PD-L1 expression of at least 5%. Just a few short weeks after announcing the failure of Opdivo in first-line advanced NSCLC, Bristol-Myers' trial data showed that progression-free survival actually favored the platinum-based chemotherapy arm instead of Opdivo, which was truly shocking (and disappointing for Bristol-Myers and its shareholders). Image source: Merck. At nearly the same time, Merck announced positive results from its KEYNOTE-024 trial involving cancer immunotherapy Keytruda for advanced NSCLC patients whose tumors had PD-L1 expression of at least 50%. Keytruda wound up cutting the risk of disease progression or death by 50%, while also providing a progression-free survival improvement of better than 70% to 10.3 months compared to six months for the placebo. There was also a clear-cut improvement in response rate in the Keytruda arm (45%) relative to the chemotherapy arm (28%). And most important of all, 80.2% of all patients were still alive at the six-month mark in the Keytruda arm compared to 72.4% in the chemotherapy arm. These bifurcated results from Bristol-Myers and Merck opens the door for Keytruda to snag the lion's share of first-line advanced NSCLC market share.   The other major catalyst for Merck came on Election Day when Donald Trump won the presidency. Hillary Clinton had taken a very hard-line stance on prescription drug reforms during her campaign, and it's possible that if she had won, drugmakers like Merck would have lost some of their precious pricing power. Meanwhile, Trump has vowed to tackle drug pricing, too, but his agenda is so full at the moment that there's a real possibility he simply doesn't get around to it. Additionally, with Republicans remaining in control of Congress, and with the their party preferring free-market economics when it comes to pharmaceutical pricing, it's unlikely that drug reforms pass anytime soon. That's good news for drugmakers like Merck. Now what As we head into 2017, what investors should really be paying close attention to is the ascent of Keytruda and the expected slow decline of type 2 diabetes blockbuster Januvia. Based on the data above, Keytruda's sales should continue ramping up nicely. With $356 million in sales in the third quarter, it's possible Keytruda pulls in closer to $2 billion (if not more) in fiscal 2017. Image source: Getty Images. However, the type 2 diabetes space is witnessing an upheaval with SGLT-2 inhibitors threatening DPP-4 inhibitors like Januvia. In clinical studies, DPP-4's demonstrated no superiority over the placebo in reducing cardiovascular death. By comparison, SGLT-2 inhibitors have demonstrated weight-loss and lowered systolic blood pressure in type 2 diabetes patients (Januvia is weight-neutral). The only SGLT-2 developers to have completed their long-term cardiovascular study -- Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Boehringer Ingelheim -- reported in 2015 that their drug, Jardiance, reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 38%. In other words, SGLT-2-inhibiting drugs have made a strong case to replace Januvia. The saving graces here are that Merck has a deep pipeline, it maintains its pricing power, and it has a delectable 3%-plus dividend yield. But, I will say that Merck no longer looks like a bargain based on its 2016 gains. Even at 16 times forward earnings, which is below the average of S&P 500, Merck could be priced richly considering the decline in sales expected from Januvia as SGLT-2 inhibitor use expands. My suggestion for the time being? Patiently wait for a pullback. Sean Williams has no material interest in any companies mentioned in this article.

By Robert Weisman Globe Staff  January 07, 2017 The new boss at Biogen Inc. speaks six languages, worked for drug makers in half a dozen countries, and ran marathons on three continents. But the peripatetic Michel Vounatsos — a 55-year-old French national of Greek extraction who was born and raised in Morocco — had never been a chief executive before Friday, when he assumed the top job at the Cambridge-based company. Advertisement In the coming months, Vounatsos is expected to lay out a path forward for Biogen as investors look for Massachusetts’ largest biotech to make a major move. He plans to bring a more global perspective to a company that’s now focused primarily on North America and Europe. Those are the key markets for its trio of industry-leading — and highly lucrative — multiple sclerosis drugs. And he’s also gearing up for a challenge that will be watched the world over: producing a breakthrough treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. One key goal is expanding the company’s geographic footprint, especially in Asia. Biogen doesn’t have business operations in China, South Korea, and Taiwan, three of the largest markets.

Sign up for more newsletters here “I’m a global leader who has been exposed to operating in different parts of the world and being educated on different cultures and societies,” Vounatsos said during an interview at Biogen’s headquarters. Speaking in heavily accented English, he cited his past roles leading biopharma divisions in farflung locales — from Poland to Saudi Arabia to China — for drug giants Merck & Co. and Novartis predecessor Ciba-Geigy AG. “We want to continue on the Biogen tradition of innovating, but also explore opportunities always in the US — it is the No. 1 market — but also beyond the US,” he said. “If you think about putting patients first, how can one ignore the most populous market?” Vounatsos’s wife, Martine, is a doctor, and two of their three children studied at universities in Boston. The family traveled the world together for 25 years as Vounatsos logged the many miles of his career path. The experiences along the way have made him especially flexible and strategic as an executive, said Peter Kellogg, chief financial officer of Celgene Corp. Kellogg worked with Vounatsos at Merck and sometimes plays tennis with him. Advertisement “He understands how markets are evolving and where opportunities are,” Kellogg said. “For someone to run businesses in Poland and France and then go to China, he’s obviously very adaptable.” Jonathan Wiggs/Globe staff/File 2015 Biogen is gearing up for a challenge that will be watched the world over: producing a breakthrough treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. Just after Biogen announced his appointment last month, Vounatsos, who only joined the company eight months ago as chief commercial officer, got an early Christmas present when the Food and Drug Administration approved Biogen’s Spinraza as the first treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, the leading genetic cause of death for infants. “We can bring hope to the infants and the toddlers” with the muscle-wasting disease, he said, calling it a “big responsibility.” It’s also a big money-making opportunity — Biogen priced Spinraza at $125,000 per dose. That amounts to between $625,000 and $750,000 in the first year of use, and about $375,000 annually in subsequent years. Most of the huge costs are expected to be covered by insurance for the thousands of spinal muscular atrophy patients. While acknowledging pricing is a sensitive issue — President-elect Donald Trump, like many other politicians, has said he wants to “bring down drug prices” — Vounatsos makes no apology for charging so much for a medicine that helps patients with no other options. He said Biogen executives consulted with dozens of health insurers as part of a “thorough” pricing analysis. “We want to be responsible; we want to be good citizens and price at the right level of value,” he said. “The unmet medical need here is significant. It’s a disastrous disease in terms of mortality and disability, and the value the drug brings is tremendous. We need to think about the return for shareholders, and we need to think also about how we fund other projects.” Unlike its top-selling MS medicines Avonex, Tysabri, and Tecfidera, which bring in billions of dollars annually and ring up 60 percent of their sales in the US market, Biogen expects to eventually generate about 60 percent of its revenue from Spinraza outside the United States. Vounatsos considers that a model for the company as it moves to expand its drug portfolio beyond multiple sclerosis. Spinraza’s launch this winter “will be a very good way to prepare the organization to be ready for Alzheimer’s,” he said, referring to the company’s quest to win approval of the first medicine for the neurodegenerative disease that afflicts about 47 million people worldwide. “Alzheimer’s is certainly the next huge opportunity that we have,” Vounatsos said. “This is the No. 1 epidemiology priority everywhere. The company that succeeds in this space will succeed big-time in terms of public health impact but also for the company.” Biogen’s experimental Alzheimer’s drug, called aducanumab, targets the buildup of plaque in the brain. It got a boost last month when Biogen released encouraging findings from an early-stage study not long after the clinical-trial failure of a rival Alzheimer’s drug from Eli Lilly & Co. Some analysts say Biogen is now in the best position to crack the Alzheimer’s puzzle, though it still needs to conduct years of testing before accumulating enough data for regulatory approval. In themeantime, after Spinraza starts shipping, the likelihood of Biogen bringing other new drugs to market anytime soonlooks slim — unless it takes a shortcut and buys a smaller biotech that’s got a medicine nearing the approval stage. Failing that, as Biogen faces slower growth from its MS drugs, some Wall Street analysts have suggested that it could be a takeover target itself. The board’s decision to tap Vounatsos — already on the inside and with more of a commercial background than a scientific one — could be a signal that it might be interested in selling the company if an attractive offer is made, biotech analyst Eric Schmidt at Cowen & Co. wrote in a recent note to investors. “Cynics would argue that Mr. Vounatsos is very closely aligned with the board, and that his appointment as CEO indicates the board wishes to retain very tight control over the key managerial decisions at Biogen,” Schmidt wrote. “For some, this might be viewed as a positive, as there has been speculation that some board members might wish to sell the company.” If he’s supposed to be readying Biogen for a sale, Vounatsos said, it’s news to him. “The board did not share that with me,” he said. He joined the company last year because of its scientific strength, he said, and he relishes the chance to help make it a pioneer in treating Alzheimer’s. When the previous chief executive, George Scangos, said he was stepping down, Vounatsos said, “I stood up” to seek the job. “With my 25 years of experience,” he said, “I believe I am ready.” He said he won’t be distracted by speculation about a takeover bid. “Biogen has 40 years of history, and I came for the next 40 years,” he said. Biogen is “smaller, a bit more agile, a bit more flexible, and it can be a bit more speedy” than Big Pharma companies, he said. And he views his new hometown much the same way: “We see the youth; we see the dynamism. It’s a privilege living here.” Robert Weisman can be reached at robert.weisman@globe.com.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published in 2015. The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11, 841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. According to a release available to the Ghana News Agency the trial was led by the World Health Organisation (WHO), together with Guinea's Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners. Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author said "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless." The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa but the 2013-2016 West African outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. It said the trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-GuinÃ©e, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. It used an innovative design, a so-called 'ring vaccination' approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox. Practically, it said when a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain 'contacts of contacts'. A total of 117 clusters (or "rings") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine's efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years. The statement said in addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so called "herd immunity"). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured," said Dr KeÃta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea. To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects. It was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea. "This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement," said Dr John-Arne RÃ¸ttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group. In January 2015, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300 000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure. It said additional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called 'compassionate use' that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. It said Merck and WHO's partners are working to compile data to support license applications. The rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO's R&D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics.

The law — House Bill 2 (HB2) — has incited a state-wide civil liberties battle. Here is the timeline of the so-called "bathroom bill." Ali Rizvi, Nicole L. Cvetnic and Sohail Al-Jamea / McClatchy The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) civil rights organization, and Equality NC, the statewide organization working to secure equal rights and justice for LGBTQ North Carolinians, and other civic leaders held a press conference on, Monday, Sept. 19, 2016 at the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center. Some companies that opposed House Bill 2 contributed money to the campaigns of lawmakers who voted for the law and the governor who signed it. John D. Simmons jsimmons@charlotteobserver.com 1 of 2 i By Jim Morrill and Gavin Off jmorrill@charlotteobserver.com goff@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Nearly 200 companies joined the fight last year against North Carolina’s House Bill 2, signing on to public protests and affirming their commitment to LGBT rights. But some of those same companies, mainly through their political action committees, contributed money to the campaigns of lawmakers who voted for the law and the governor who signed it. PACs representing a half-dozen companies gave almost $200,000 to North Carolina lawmakers who voted for HB2, according to an Observer analysis. Some support was less direct. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer gave $600,000 to the Republican Governors Association. The RGA in turn spent $3.6 million on behalf of former GOP Gov. Pat McCrory. Pfizer also gave $170,000 to a GOP group that spent almost a million dollars to re-elect Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a vocal HB2 supporter. When it passed last March, HB2 created a national backlash. Critics said the law, which requires transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate in government buildings, discriminates against the LGBT community. Many companies took a stand in protest. To be sure, many PACs and executives who publicly opposed HB2 also gave to Democrats and McCrory’s opponent, Roy Cooper. And companies, like individuals, have multiple interests. Bank of America’s PAC, for example, gave $2,000 to GOP and Democratic caucuses in the House and the Senate. “We interact on a bipartisan basis with public officials on a range of topics,” said spokesman Dan Frahm. “And we have been public and consistent with our support for repeal of HB2.” Gay rights advocates say contributors should consider a candidate’s stand on HB2. “We strongly encourage companies committed to leading the way forward to include LGBTQ legal equality among the priorities they consider when they’re supporting candidates,” said Stephen Peters, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest gay rights group. One Charlotte transgender activist, however, criticized the donations. “That’s hypocritical if they say they’re supporters,” said Erica Lachowitz. Pfizer’s contributions Last spring the HRC released a list of 130 companies and CEOs opposed to the law. Most of those companies – including prominent names such as Starbucks, Facebook, Apple, IBM and Kellogg’s – have no PACs registered in North Carolina and don’t routinely get involved in N.C. campaigns. Among those that do, a half-dozen PACs had given $192,000 to McCrory and Republican lawmakers who voted for HB2 through September, the last reports available. Final reports are due this month. New York-based Pfizer, which has a manufacturing plant in Sanford, gave $25,000 to GOP lawmakers through its PAC in addition to the company’s contributions to the RGA and the Republican State Leadership Committee. The RSLC spent $850,000 on behalf of Forest. “We contribute to policymakers from both sides of the aisle based on their stance on issues that impact patient access to innovative medicines and vaccines,” said spokeswoman Sharon Castillo. “Our contributions are not based on a policy maker’s position on any social, religious or political issue. To suggest otherwise is both inaccurate and misleading.” Wells Fargo’s PAC gave at least $61,700 to lawmakers who supported HB2. Asked about the contributions, Wells offered a statement saying, “Gov. McCrory and other elected officials were well aware of our opposition to HB2.” PACs for Merck, Pepsico and Time Warner Cable also gave to McCrory or lawmakers who voted for HB2. ‘Multiple interests’ The PAC for Merck, which has two state manufacturing facilities, gave McCrory and GOP lawmakers at least $41,000. Chairman and CEO Kenneth Frazier signed the HRC’s letter protesting HB2. “Our company is committed to participating constructively and responsibly in the political process,” Merck spokeswoman Lanie Keller said in a statement. “The PAC supports legislators from both major parties who understand and appreciate the work we do … “Our chairman and CEO … joined corporate leaders across the country in signing open letters that urge lawmakers in North Carolina to repeal HB2, because it sanctions discriminatory practices.” The Observer also looked at contributions through September from employees of the roughly 185 companies that publicly denounced HB2. Workers for at least 33 companies donated to North Carolina’s Republican Party or party leaders after the bill was signed. McCrory received more than $54,000, the Observer found. Employees making donations ranged from secretaries and accountants to professors and social workers. Some were retired. Workers at 65 of the companies gave to Cooper or the Democratic Party. Cooper received some $313,000 and the party, $344,000. Individuals give money for reasons of their own, including their party affiliation. Companies also give for a variety of reasons. For many it’s access. Campaign contributions typically flow to those in positions of power. “(Companies) have multiple interests,” said Eric Heberlig, a political scientist at UNC Charlotte. “If they think Republicans are going to be more helpful to them on taxes or regulations they still have an incentive to support them, even if they disagree on social issues or things like HB2.” HB2 has been blamed for the loss of jobs, sporting events and millions in lost visitor spending. Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality NC, said companies and their PACs should see the law as an economic issue. “Doing business in a state like North Carolina is that much harder when candidates actively work against LGBT equality,” he said. Staff writer Deon Roberts contributed. Contributions Some PACs whose affiliated companies publicly opposed HB2 contributed to N.C. Republican lawmakers who passed it and to former Gov. Pat McCrory. Here are some, along with company executives who signed an open letter from the Human Rights Campaign protesting the law.

One company that’s focused on these markets specifically is Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. The REIT owns and leases 24.5 million sq. ft. of life science properties, including a recent deal with Merck to take a 294,000-sq.-ft. building going up in south San Francisco. Peter Moglia, chief investment officer for the REIT, says life sciences real estate has never been stronger. Recently, he talked with NREI about the outlook for the sector in 2017 (the answers have been edited for clarity). NREI: What is the demand like today for life sciences real estate? Moglia: I’ve never seen the kind of demand that we have today. There are a number of trends that are pushing our rents and occupancy up. For example, you have more collaboration. More than 50 percent of prescription revenues today come from therapeutics that were discovered outside of commercial companies. That’s a pretty large increase from 34 percent 10 years ago. What that tells us is that large pharmaceutical companies are coming into our clusters to collaborate with the smaller biotech companies, because they’re seeing that it is a more productive business model—to come in and acquire either drugs that have been de-risked from the smaller companies that are in clusters, or acquire the know-how for particular technologies that they may not have in-house, basically externalizing innovation. Years ago, the model was that big pharma companies located in New Jersey, or Pennsylvania or New York; they would have their own research campus try to discover therapies and go through the clinic with them, and eventually a drug would occur. Well, that model broke, and productivity fell off a cliff. In the meantime, the biotech industry was started and flourished, with these nimble companies that were very innovative and came up with new technologies. These were some of our first customers. Over time pharma decided ‘Hey, these guys are really productive, let’s go and collaborate with them or purchase them to create a more efficient model.’ This has driven demand into the core markets, where the predominant academic research occurs. We’ve also seen the FDA become much more productive. There was a 64 percent increase in new drug approvals in the most recent timeframe of 2011 to 2015, compared to 2006-2010. The FDA also reduced the average review period for a new drug by 61 percent. What that has done, by increasing the amount of drug approvals and doing it faster, it’s allowed investment into R&D to be monetized and reinvested. That’s overall good for our business, as it creates more demand for lab space. Lastly, there’s the 21st Century Cures Act, which was recently signed by President Obama. The act will increase the National Institutes of Health budget and fund basic bio-science research. Those funds will go to entities that lease space from us. We’re already seeing an uptick in demand from the suburban D.C. market due to this funding. NREI: This past decade saw a number of large-scale merger and acquisition deals in the life sciences sector. Do you think this activity has played out, or are there more deals yet to come in the next three years? Moglia: I think that mergers and acquisitions are always going to be a part of the landscape in life sciences, but I don’t think you’re going to see as much large consolidation as we’ve seen the past few years. I think you’ll see a continuation of big pharma merging with bio-tech to get the technology and talent that resides in those companies. That trend is sure to continue, as it’s a much more productive model. NREI: With rental rates rising by double digits in some life sciences markets over the past few years, such in Boston/Cambridge, San Francisco and San Diego, would you say that tenants are concerned enough to pause on new leases or change tactics on location or office size? Moglia: The best companies spend a lot more money on human resources than on real estate, so even though rents are going up, these companies still have the cash flow and investment to take class-A space. They see this high rent as an investment, and the ability to hire the best and brightest, and to be in a location to collaborate with the best research institutions. As for the smaller companies, likely backed by angel investors or trying to make it on a paper-thin budget, these companies are having a hard time getting into the core markets, and they end up in suburban locations. However, I have to say that life science tenants still need to be close to the major universities and institutions. The trend of going to secondary markets for cheaper labor or rents hasn’t really hit the life sciences sector. There really is a large talent pool that exists for life sciences, and so far, companies have been able to get the employee base that they need. NREI: Making a comparison to the tech sector, it was widely believed that 2016 might mark the slide down for technology venture capital, after a huge drop-off in the first quarter. Did that scare affect the life science industry as well? Moglia: Well, at least for Alexandria, for our 2016 figures, we’re on pace to meet the same levels achieved in 2014. I do remember after the first quarter 2016, the numbers came in and venture capital investment was well below pace for 2015, and there was a lot of panic. We saw it mostly on the tech side in San Francisco. We were getting a lot of questions of whether the sky was falling in the San Francisco office market. However, Steve Richardson, our COO and also our market director in that market, pointed out that we were tracking more than 2.5 million sq. ft. of life science demand in San Francisco, and there was more than 5 million sq. ft. of tech market demand. That much demand was similar to what we’ve seen in the past two years. We just didn’t see any change in demand in 2016. It’s true, we’re not seeing the velocity of transactions going on, though that might also have to do with other factors weighing on the economy, including the election. Further, the tech sector absorbed quite a bit of space, and is probably satiated for now. But there was no dip in demand, and there’s been no increase in vacancy in that market. The subleasing pool has grown, but from what we understand a lot of that big block space is being taken off the market. You also have to consider that San Francisco is a unique office market because of a moratorium on office development. Only about 875,000 sq. ft. is allowed to be built per year. During the down years, an excess each year built into a six-million-sq.-ft. pool, but when the tech industry started to take off in 2010, that pool was taken down to zero. Another 875,000 sq. ft. was released in November, and developers are vying for it now. The reason I bring that up is, even with a slowdown in demand, if there is one, there is a [limit] on building in that market. That’s why rents are where they are at, and that’s why the multitude of projects in the queue are only slowly moving forward, allowing demand to still be ahead [of supply]. NREI: What would you say is the most important life science trend for 2017? Moglia: We get asked about the antics of high-profile cases like Martin Shkreli, who bought licenses for affordable drugs and hiked prices by more than 50 times the original per-pill cost. Our short answer is that we think the industry can be divided in two ways: innovators who are good corporate citizens looking to solve human health problems, and exploiters, who are not really research-oriented and shed a negative light on our industry. Our tenants are the former, the good guys. However, there’s also a lot of discussion of health care in the press these days, and while a lot of it has to do with pricing, it’s also about concerns about the increasing total cost of health care for the ordinary consumer, which is one of the main problems we face in the drug industry. If we can keep people out of the hospital and home care by giving them a drug, then maybe that will help lower the overall costs. A lot of people only concentrate on the drug side of the equation, but drugs are only 10 percent of the U.S. health care budget. About 90 percent of the costs are in hospital and home care and doctor visits and all of that. Something else that is not really talked about is the enormous amount of productivity lost not only by the patient by being sick, but also by the caregivers who have to take off work. Lost productivity is a large unknown factor that will probably come to light more over time. Because drug therapies are part of the solution to solve these problems, there’s going to be continued investment by the government and by biotech and pharma companies, through R&D, to solve these problems, and that translates into, and explains, the current high demand for lab space.

Licensing and co-development deals relating to T2DM therapeutics since 2006 has identified aggregate deal values of $9.2 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively, for deals with disclosed deal values. The report states that the emergence over the past decade of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors has intensified competition. These new drug classes have been highly commercially successful and are now well established within the T2DM treatment algorithm. The leading products within these drug classes are Novo Nordisk's Victoza, Merck's Januvia, and Janssen's Invokana, respectively. In 2015, these drugs generated $2.7 billion, $4.3 billion, and $1.6 billion, respectively. Fiona Chisholm, Analyst, notes: In spite of recent developments, there are still significant unmet needs for T2DM. Treatment regimens are often complex, and many drugs have limited long-term efficacy and side effects that are particularly undesirable for the T2DM patient population, such as increased cardiovascular risk factors or weight gain. Alongside the rapidly expanding prevalence population, this ensures that sustained investment in T2DM product innovation continues to be an attractive commercial prospect. Indeed, with 591 products in development, T2DM pipeline activity is very high in comparison to other related indications within metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 1 diabetes mellitus, which have 254 and 244 active products in development, respectively. T2DM therapeutics can often attract high values in licensing or co-development strategic consolidations. Despite this, the majority of first-in-class products in development for T2DM have no disclosed involvement in previous licensing or co-development. Among these products, the range of molecular targets is relatively wide, providing ample and diverse opportunities for potential investors. Entering into a licensing or co-development deal can have significant benefits for both parties, including shared product development risks, financial and R&D resource support, and portfolio or geographical expansion,"" Chisholm concludes Key Topics Covered: 1 Tables & Figures 2 Executive Summary 2.1 Large and Competitive Market Landscape Driven by Rising Prevalence 2.2 Investment in First-in-Class Innovation Remains Strong 2.3 Opportunities for Investment in First-in-Class Product Development are Considerable 3 The Case for Innovation 3.1 Growing Opportunities for Biologic Products 3.2 Diversification of Molecular Targets 3.3 Innovative First-in-Class Product Development Remains Attractive 3.4 Regulatory and Reimbursement Policy Shifts Favor First-in-Class Product Innovation 3.5 Sustained Innovation 4 Clinical and Commercial Landscape 4.1 Disease Overview 4.2 Classification of Diabetes Mellitus 4.3 Symptoms 4.4 Epidemiology 4.5 Etiology 4.6 Pathophysiology 4.7 Co-morbidities and Complications 4.8 Management and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 4.9 Insulin-Based T2DM Therapies 4.10 Overview of Marketed Products in Type 2 Diabetes 4.11 Unmet Need and Commercial Opportunities in T2DM 5 Assessment of Pipeline Product Innovation 5.1 Pipeline by Stage of Development, Molecule Type and Molecular Target 5.2 Comparative Distribution of Programs between the Market and Pipeline by Molecular Target Class 5.3 First-in-Class Programs by Molecular Target Category 6 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Signaling Network, Disease Causation and Innovation Alignment 6.1 Complexity of Signaling Networks 6.2 Signaling Pathways and First-in-Class Molecular Target Integration 6.3 First-in-Class Matrix Assessment 7 First-in-Class Target and Pipeline Program Evaluation 7.1 Pipeline Programs Targeting Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 and Insulin Receptor Substrate 7.2 Pipeline Programs Targeting G-Protein Coupled Receptor Kinase 5 (GRK5) 7.3 Pipeline Programs Targeting Type 2 Angiotensin II Receptor 7.4 Pipeline Programs Targeting Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP) 7.5 Pipeline Programs Targeting Nacht LRR and PYD Domains Containing Protein 7.6 Pipeline Programs Targeting Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1 Alpha (PPARGC1A) 7.7 Pipeline Programs Targeting Glucagon 7.8 Pipeline Programs Targeting Alpha Synuclein 7.9 Pipeline Programs Targeting Microtubule Associated Protein Tau 8 Strategic Consolidations 8.1 Industry-Wide First-in-Class Deals 8.2 Licensing Deals 8.3 Co-development Deals 8.4 First-in-Class Programs Not Involved in Licensing or Co-development Deals 9 Appendix For more information about this drug pipelines report visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/l572nk/frontier_pharma Media Contact: Laura Wood, Senior Manager press@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907 Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716     SOURCE Research and Markets RELATED LINKS http://www.researchandmarkets.com More by this Source Global Automotive Event Data Recorder Market to Grow 18% by 2021 - Driven by Increasing Numbers of Road Crashes - Research and Markets 13 Jan, 2017, 17:10 GMT Global Information Security Consulting Market to Reach $26 Billion by 2021: Increased Network Complexities Due to 3rd Party Applications - Research and Markets 13 Jan, 2017, 17:10 GMT Global Diagnostic Catheter Market to Reach $4 Billion by 2021: Growth in the Number of Diagnostic Imaging Center - Research and Markets 13 Jan, 2017, 17:10 GMT View all news by Research and Markets Journalists and Bloggers Visit PR Newswire for Journalists for releases, photos and customised feeds just for media.

One company that’s focused on these markets specifically is Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. The REIT owns and leases 24.5 million sq. ft. of life science properties, including a recent deal with Merck to take a 294,000-sq.-ft. building going up in south San Francisco. Peter Moglia, chief investment officer for the REIT, says life sciences real estate has never been stronger. Recently, he talked with NREI about the outlook for the sector in 2017 (the answers have been edited for clarity). NREI: What is the demand like today for life sciences real estate? Moglia: I’ve never seen the kind of demand that we have today. There are a number of trends that are pushing our rents and occupancy up. For example, you have more collaboration. More than 50 percent of prescription revenues today come from therapeutics that were discovered outside of commercial companies. That’s a pretty large increase from 34 percent 10 years ago. What that tells us is that large pharmaceutical companies are coming into our clusters to collaborate with the smaller biotech companies, because they’re seeing that it is a more productive business model—to come in and acquire either drugs that have been de-risked from the smaller companies that are in clusters, or acquire the know-how for particular technologies that they may not have in-house, basically externalizing innovation. Years ago, the model was that big pharma companies located in New Jersey, or Pennsylvania or New York; they would have their own research campus try to discover therapies and go through the clinic with them, and eventually a drug would occur. Well, that model broke, and productivity fell off a cliff. In the meantime, the biotech industry was started and flourished, with these nimble companies that were very innovative and came up with new technologies. These were some of our first customers. Over time pharma decided ‘Hey, these guys are really productive, let’s go and collaborate with them or purchase them to create a more efficient model.’ This has driven demand into the core markets, where the predominant academic research occurs. We’ve also seen the FDA become much more productive. There was a 64 percent increase in new drug approvals in the most recent timeframe of 2011 to 2015, compared to 2006-2010. The FDA also reduced the average review period for a new drug by 61 percent. What that has done, by increasing the amount of drug approvals and doing it faster, it’s allowed investment into R&D to be monetized and reinvested. That’s overall good for our business, as it creates more demand for lab space. Lastly, there’s the 21st Century Cures Act, which was recently signed by President Obama. The act will increase the National Institutes of Health budget and fund basic bio-science research. Those funds will go to entities that lease space from us. We’re already seeing an uptick in demand from the suburban D.C. market due to this funding. NREI: This past decade saw a number of large-scale merger and acquisition deals in the life sciences sector. Do you think this activity has played out, or are there more deals yet to come in the next three years? Moglia: I think that mergers and acquisitions are always going to be a part of the landscape in life sciences, but I don’t think you’re going to see as much large consolidation as we’ve seen the past few years. I think you’ll see a continuation of big pharma merging with bio-tech to get the technology and talent that resides in those companies. That trend is sure to continue, as it’s a much more productive model. NREI: With rental rates rising by double digits in some life sciences markets over the past few years, such in Boston/Cambridge, San Francisco and San Diego, would you say that tenants are concerned enough to pause on new leases or change tactics on location or office size? Moglia: The best companies spend a lot more money on human resources than on real estate, so even though rents are going up, these companies still have the cash flow and investment to take class-A space. They see this high rent as an investment, and the ability to hire the best and brightest, and to be in a location to collaborate with the best research institutions. As for the smaller companies, likely backed by angel investors or trying to make it on a paper-thin budget, these companies are having a hard time getting into the core markets, and they end up in suburban locations. However, I have to say that life science tenants still need to be close to the major universities and institutions. The trend of going to secondary markets for cheaper labor or rents hasn’t really hit the life sciences sector. There really is a large talent pool that exists for life sciences, and so far, companies have been able to get the employee base that they need. NREI: Making a comparison to the tech sector, it was widely believed that 2016 might mark the slide down for technology venture capital, after a huge drop-off in the first quarter. Did that scare affect the life science industry as well? Moglia: Well, at least for Alexandria, for our 2016 figures, we’re on pace to meet the same levels achieved in 2014. I do remember after the first quarter 2016, the numbers came in and venture capital investment was well below pace for 2015, and there was a lot of panic. We saw it mostly on the tech side in San Francisco. We were getting a lot of questions of whether the sky was falling in the San Francisco office market. However, Steve Richardson, our COO and also our market director in that market, pointed out that we were tracking more than 2.5 million sq. ft. of life science demand in San Francisco, and there was more than 5 million sq. ft. of tech market demand. That much demand was similar to what we’ve seen in the past two years. We just didn’t see any change in demand in 2016. It’s true, we’re not seeing the velocity of transactions going on, though that might also have to do with other factors weighing on the economy, including the election. Further, the tech sector absorbed quite a bit of space, and is probably satiated for now. But there was no dip in demand, and there’s been no increase in vacancy in that market. The subleasing pool has grown, but from what we understand a lot of that big block space is being taken off the market. You also have to consider that San Francisco is a unique office market because of a moratorium on office development. Only about 875,000 sq. ft. is allowed to be built per year. During the down years, an excess each year built into a six-million-sq.-ft. pool, but when the tech industry started to take off in 2010, that pool was taken down to zero. Another 875,000 sq. ft. was released in November, and developers are vying for it now. The reason I bring that up is, even with a slowdown in demand, if there is one, there is a [limit] on building in that market. That’s why rents are where they are at, and that’s why the multitude of projects in the queue are only slowly moving forward, allowing demand to still be ahead [of supply]. NREI: What would you say is the most important life science trend for 2017? Moglia: We get asked about the antics of high-profile cases like Martin Shkreli, who bought licenses for affordable drugs and hiked prices by more than 50 times the original per-pill cost. Our short answer is that we think the industry can be divided in two ways: innovators who are good corporate citizens looking to solve human health problems, and exploiters, who are not really research-oriented and shed a negative light on our industry. Our tenants are the former, the good guys. However, there’s also a lot of discussion of health care in the press these days, and while a lot of it has to do with pricing, it’s also about concerns about the increasing total cost of health care for the ordinary consumer, which is one of the main problems we face in the drug industry. If we can keep people out of the hospital and home care by giving them a drug, then maybe that will help lower the overall costs. A lot of people only concentrate on the drug side of the equation, but drugs are only 10 percent of the U.S. health care budget. About 90 percent of the costs are in hospital and home care and doctor visits and all of that. Something else that is not really talked about is the enormous amount of productivity lost not only by the patient by being sick, but also by the caregivers who have to take off work. Lost productivity is a large unknown factor that will probably come to light more over time. Because drug therapies are part of the solution to solve these problems, there’s going to be continued investment by the government and by biotech and pharma companies, through R&D, to solve these problems, and that translates into, and explains, the current high demand for lab space.

(MRK) Stock Is Defying the Bears! MRK stock gives bulls an early 2017 trading signal By Serge Berger, Head Trader & Strategist, The Steady Trader  |  Jan 4, 2017, 7:51 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: How Will Netflix, Inc.

(NFLX) Stock React to Q4 Earnings? Donald Trump Puts Humana Inc (HUM) Stock on My Buy Radar How to Trade Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock After Earnings View All Posts The first trading day of 2017 was a mixed session. Although the broader indices ended higher on the day, underneath the surface, things traded in a sloppy fashion. Healthcare stocks lead the bounce, however, and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in particular caught my eye. See, healthcare stocks struggled in 2016’s second half, at least in part due to regulatory concerns around where a new U.S. administration will come down on them. Donald Trump’s victory seemed to bring a little more clarity to the picture, though that didn’t last for long. But on Tuesday, MRK stock bounced off a technically important level — plus, shares look ripe for additional buying pressure. Before digging into the charts of Merck stock, let me reiterate that the first two trading weeks of January (basically through Jan. 15) typically exhibit some of the most volatile price action, and with a downward bias. As such, while what I’m about to present is a valid trade idea, in the name of risk management, I think it would be prudent to trade with reduced size and well-defined stop-losses in place. Merck next reports earnings on Feb. 2, which given the potential regulatory overhang may only be marginally important as to the stock’s intermediate-term direction. Still, for MRK stock, this is a date to circle. MRK Stock Charts First, let’s look at the multiyear weekly chart. Click to Enlarge We can see here that despite the sharp rally off the 2009 financial crisis lows, MRK stock over the past couple of years has continued to struggle overcoming the $60-$65 area (blue band on the chart) on a sustainable basis. However, through this lens, the stock’s choppy sideways action over the past couple of years could also be looked at as constructive consolidation, which ultimately should resolve the stock higher. Note that despite a couple of years of sideways price action from this perspective, MRK stock has managed to hold its 2009 support lines intact.

They used the same strategy that was used to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. Called ring vaccination, it calls for vaccinating people who have been in contact with patients, and contacts of contacts. Doctor Francis Kateh from Redemption Hospital volunteering to receive a trial vaccine against Ebola at Redemption Hospital on the outskirts of Monrovia. ZOOM DOSSO / AFP - Getty Images file It worked, the team led by the World Health Organization found. "Vaccine efficacy was 100 percent," they wrote in their report, published in Friday's issue of the Lancet medical journal. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless," said WHO's Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, who led the trial. Related: Experimental Vaccine Could Stop Ebola It's not a surprise - researchers had been working on an Ebola vaccine for years but because the virus only usually caused occasional, small outbreaks, it was hard to test it. “Vaccine efficacy was 100 percent.” Plus no governments or companies had invested the time or money needed to develop a vaccine. Then the epidemic started in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in late 2013. By the time it was completely stopped earlier this year, it had infected 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 of them. Researchers rushed several vaccines into production. This vaccine was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, which licensed it to a company called NewLink Genetics. Pharma giant Merck & Co. bought the license and is making it. Related: Ebola Vaccine Trials Offer Hope It uses an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The virus is harmless to people. Vaccine makers genetically engineered it to carry a little piece of Ebola DNA to stimulate an immune response. Experts including Dr. Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who helped led the campaign to eradicate smallpox, designed a ring vaccination trial. Henderson died in August. By the time all this work was done, the epidemic was waning. It's hard to test a vaccine if disease is not spreading, but the international team tried it out in a coastal region of Guinea where Ebola cases were still being reported. Related: Experimental Ebola Shot Looks Good The virus spreads by direct contact, either between people or with bodily fluids such as blood from someone very ill with Ebola, or who has died from it. The researchers tracked down every person who may have been in contact with a case, including family members and friends. Then they found people who had been in contact with those people. Each of these "rings" ended up including about 80 people. “We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured.” Half got vaccine and half did not. The trial was stopped when it became clear that the vaccine was truly protecting people from infection, even after they'd been in direct contact with an Ebola victim. The Food and Drug Administration gave the vaccine breakthrough designation to allow quick licensing. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, has made a $5 million down payment to Merck to make sure the vaccine is available when it's next needed. Merck has promised to make 300,000 doses of the vaccine available for emergency use. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured," said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, coordinator of the Ebola response in Guinea.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) are compounds which interfere with this function of histone deacetylase. HDIs display promising potential in oncology for applications such as diagnosis, cancer detection and prognosis. HDIs are emerging class of oncology therapeutics for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. Based on the classes, histone deacetylase are classified into class 1, class 2 and class 3 HDAC. HDAC inhibitors leads to accumulation of acetylated nuclear histones in both tumor and normal tissues, providing an alternate marker for the biological activity of HDAC inhibitors. Inhibition of HDAC also results in acetylation transcription factors such as GATA-1, p53 and estrogen receptor-alpha. HDIs are potent anti-proliferative agents with moderately little effect on normal tissues. Get Sample Research Report: http://bit.ly/2ijrcHQ Based on applications, histone deacetylase inhibitors are categorized into oncology, neurology and others diseases. Presently there are four approved HDI products in the market namely Vorinostat (Zolinza), Romidepsin (Istodax), Vidaza and Dacogen. Consequently, global biopharmaceutical companies are conducting research for its application in different indications. North America leads the histone deacetylase inhibitors market with rapid acceptance of these products in this region. Globally, this market would be growing at a very rapid pace owing to a tremendous potential of this class of drugs in oncology therapy. Rising incidence of oncology and aging population would be the driving factors for this market. Some of the key players in this market include Merck & Co., Inc., Celgene Corporation, Eisai Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, Acetylon Pharmaceuticals, Celleron Therapeutics, Envivo Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer, Inc. These companies are aiming to discover new products in this class, through prospective pipeline, collaborations and ventures.

and Markets Jan 06, 2017, 13:10 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Jan 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Anti-hypertensive Therapeutics in Asia-Pacific Markets to 2022 - Increasing Prevalence of Hypertension Drives Market Growth despite Weak Pipeline" report to their offering. Asia-Pacific anti-hypertensive therapeutics market to hit $27 billion by 2022, despite low innovation. The market for anti-hypertensive therapeutics across the five Asia-Pacific (APAC) countries of India, China, Australia, South Korea, and Japan, is set to grow from $19.1 billion in 2015 to $27 billion by 2022, at a compound annual growth rate of 5.1%. The company's latest report states that this relatively solid rise in market value will be driven by the increasingly elderly population - where the prevalence rate of hypertension is highest - and increases in risk factors such as obesity, low physical activity levels, urbanization, and smoking. Indeed, growth will not be aided by the weak anti-hypertensive pipeline, due to lack of innovative products in late-stage development. Gautam Arora, Analyst, explains: The anti-hypertensive pipeline consists of 112 pipeline products, most of which are small molecules. The limited presence of other types of molecules in the pipeline suggests that large pharmaceutical companies are refraining from developing novel molecules and are more inclined to focus on patient-compliant combination therapies. It is therefore unlikely that any completely novel molecules will enter the market during the forecast period. Prestalia is an example of a recently improved drug that offers an improvement to hypertension therapy. In a Phase III trial it provided a better benefit-to-risk ratio than either treatment alone. The drug was approved by the US FDA in January 2015, and it is marketed by Symplmed. Of the APAC countries covered in the report, however, it is available only in Australia, and it is under development in Japan and South Korea. Overall, late-stage products will not change the treatment paradigm of hypertension during the forecast period. With the lack of any new premium-priced drugs in this setting and the prescription of relatively cheap generic versions of anti-hypertensive drugs to continue, it's expected the status quo of drug treatment will persist in the APAC region. Arora concludes: Despite the availability of a large number of blood-pressure-lowering agents, the need remains for safer and more effective anti-hypertensive treatments. Although the APAC market is likely to see steady growth, it will continue to be obstructed by a weak pipeline and low diagnosis and treatment rates.

article NEW YORK, Jan. 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The global animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2016 to 2021, to reach USD 4.73 billion by 2021 from USD 3.77 billion in 2016. The growth of this market is mainly attributed to rising demand for animal-derived food products, growing demand for pet insurance and rising animal health expenditure, and increasing incidences of zoonotic diseases. In addition, the implementation of the regulations for preventing the spread of animal diseases and increasing awareness about animal healthcare are further expected to drive the growth of this market. However, growing resistance to the antibiotic and antimicrobial agents, dearth of new antibiotics, and replacement of routine prophylactic use of antibiotics by good husbandry and hygiene practices may hinder the growth of this market to certain extent. Untapped emerging market such as China, India offers significant growth opportunities. Based on the type of product, the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market is segmented into tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolides, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, cephalosporins, and other antimicrobials and antibiotics. On the basis of mode of delivery, the market is further segmented into premixes, oral powders, oral solutions, injections, and other modes of delivery. Similarly, on the basis of type of animals the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market is segmented into food-producing animals and companion animals. The food-producing animals segment accounted for the largest share of the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market in 2015. Geographically, the global animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Rest of the World. In 2015, North America commanded a major share of the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market. This is mainly due to the increasing adoption of companion animals, growing pet insurance industry, increasing demand for animal-derived food products, and rising veterinary healthcare expenditure in the region. However, Asia-Pacific is expected to witness the highest growth rate during the forecast period. Growth in the Asia-Pacific market can be attributed to rising companion animal population and increase in the demand for animal-derived food products. Some of the prominent players in the animal antibiotics and antimicrobials market include Zoetis, Inc. (U.S.), Eli Lilly and Company (U.S.), Merck & Co., Inc. (U.S.), Bayer AG (Germany), Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH (Germany), Virbac (France), Ceva Sante Animale (France), Vetoquinol S.A.

Elizabeth Nolan Brown|Jan. 6, 2017 11:45 am STEVE GSCHMEISSNER/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/NewscomThis week marks the end of the House of Representatives panel looking into fetal-tissue procurement by U.S. research companies. Using tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research is legal in America, though profiting off the sale of said tissue is illegal. Despite a 15-months-long investigation into Planned Parenthood practices regarding tissue from aborted fetuses, the now-disbanded Select Investigative Panel could not show that the nonprofit health-care conglomerate made a profit off of fetal-tissue provided to researchers. The panel's final report suggests that fetal-tissue procurement companies DV Biologicas and StemExpress may have violated this no-profit mandate, but the most it said about Planned Parenthood was that one of its hundreds of clinics, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, "may have violated both Texas Law and U.S. Law when it sold fetal tissue to the University of Texas" by using an imprecise or unapproved method of determining reimbursement costs. The matter was referred to the Texas Attorney General's Office. Still, the panel recommended that Planned Parenthood be barred from accepting Medicare patients going forward (a move Republicans have misleadingly described as "defunding" Planned Parenthood) and that the National Institutes of Health stop funding fetal tissue research. "Human fetal tissue research makes a vanishingly small contribution to clinical and research efforts," the panel's final 413-page report states. But as Science writer Meredith Wadman points out, several key statements used to support the assertion that the impact of fetal-tissue research has been negligent are wholly and demonstrably false. Wadman, a veteran science journalist with a medical degree from the University of Oxford, dissected three of these false claims yesterday, starting with the statement that "in over 100 years of unrestricted clinical research, human fetal tissue has failed to provide a single medical treatment." In fact, "several important medicines now on the market were created using fetal tissue," notes Wadman. "Amgen's Enbrel battles rheumatoid arthritis; Genentech's Pulmozyme helps children with cystic fibrosis clear the thick mucus that clogs their lungs; and Nuwiq, made by Octapharma, treats boys and men with hemophilia, a life-threatening bleeding disorder." Equally untrue: the Congressional panel's claim that "none of the nearly 75 vaccine formulations currently licensed in the United States is produced using human fetal tissue." In reality, "the WI-38 and MRC-5 cell lines, derived from two fetuses that were aborted, respectively, in 1962 in Sweden and in 1966 in the United Kingdom, are used to produce" quite a few vaccines that are licensed and marketed in the U.S., notes Wadman. These include vaccines for rabies, chicken pox, shingles, Hepatitis A, polio, rubella, and the adenovirus, produced by pharmaceutical companies including Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, and Sanofi-Pasteur. Along these same lines, the report's claim that "human fetal tissue has never been used to make the polio vaccine" is inccorect. Swedish scientists used fetal cells to develop and propagate polio vaccines in the 1950s; Yugoslavia did so in the 1960s; and U.S. polio vaccines made by Pfizer in the 1970s were derived from fetal-cell lines. French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur still uses polio vaccines derived from cells from an aborted fetus.

We're still using the lines from two fetuses decades ago. I find it hard to believe we need hundreds of new fetuses every year. And aren't adult stem cell research almost to the point that they can accomplish everything fetal stem cells can do? I just never though this was that big of an issue either way. With adult stem cells, it will be a moot debate pretty soon anyway. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply Bubba Jones|1.6.17 @ 11:57AM|# Short answer: yes.

And I am laughing at the claim that those recombinant drugs were made from fetal tissues. What they mean is that the sequences were cloned from an RNA library made from fetal tissues. This is common because fetal tissues produces lots of RNA splicing variants and you don't have to dig through as many tissues as if you use adult sources. However, with an extra week of effort, they could have done the same work with adult tissues.

Also, depending on how you look at it, it's very much in the same vein where an extra week of work now (or even in the past already) pays dividends forever.

And Sigmund Rascher developed the life-saving hypothermia treatment technique called rapid active warming. The question isn't whether we can, or what benefit we can get from it independent of the cost. It's whether acting like this still qualifies one to a claim of humanity. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply Fist of Etiquette|1.6.17 @ 11:57AM|# Yeesh.

The question congress should have been asking (but didn't because they're politicians and not scientists) is what have RECENT cell lines brought us? I don't know the answer to that question. But the fact-checking article doesn't establish any value in that. Essentially, what major contributions have been made by cell lines harvested since 1966? Basically every objectionable sentence from the congressional report that is quoted here could be made interesting and valid by just specifying that they are only talking about cell lines harvested in the last 5 decades. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply Password: pode$ta|1.6.17 @ 12:02PM|# Oh and on a less-sciency note, I also don't give a fuck because PP SHOULDN'T BE RECEIVING HALF A BILLION IN TAXPAYER MONEY EVERY YEAR REGARDLESS.

I suppose it depends on how broadly we define human unpersons. They have to be human, so that we can benefit from harvesting their body parts, but they also have to be legal unpersons, so that we avoid technicalities about homicide and trafficking in human remains.

Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp, CFP (TMFAlison) Jan 6, 2017 at 5:17PM In this episode of Motley Fool Answers, Alison and Robert take their fans behind the scenes at a special Motley Fool member event in Boston. Tune in as David Gardner, Raj Sisodia, and Morgan Housel share their insights on investing, conscious capitalism, and the nature of innovation. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Nov. 29, 2016. Alison Southwick: This is Motley Fool Answers. I'm Alison Southwick and I'm joined, as always, by Robert Brokamp, personal finance expert here at The Motley Fool. How ya doing, Bro? Robert Brokamp: I'm splendid. How are you, Alison? Southwick: I'm good. In today's episode, we are sneaking our listeners into a recent member event in Boston so that you can eavesdrop on some of the highlights. We'll also answer your question about how we, personally personal finance. All that, and more, on this week's episode of Motley Fool Answers. __ Southwick: It's time for Answers, Answers and today's question comes from Albert. He writes: "I am starting to get proactive about my expenses, but I feel I am still a newcomer. Can you provide advice on what inspires you both to think high-level about your finances in life? I haven't had much guidance growing up and just want to hear what any of your long-term goals are and how you build your plans to achieve them." Any personal examples and obstacles along the way Albert would also like to hear about. Do you want to go first? Brokamp: I'll go first. It's a very interesting question. I was thinking about how I created my beliefs about money in general, because he talked about expenses, and I've always been someone who was frugal. I was never comfortable spending a lot of money and I guess that comes from my parents, although looking at some of the expenses from other people in my family ... my sisters! Southwick: Do they listen to the show? Hope not. Brokamp: I doubt it. A couple of them are more comfortable with spending money than I am, so I don't know if it came from my parents. But we all did go through an experience in high school when my dad's business went belly up and we went through some hard times. I think that was very informative for me. So when I think of my goals as a father, it is to have financial security for my family and that really breaks down into two main categories: college and retirement. Those are the things that motivate me. Those are the things that whenever ... It was my funny. We were sitting around the table and my wife said, "What if you won the lottery?" She's asking everyone at the table, "What if you won the lottery? What would you spend the money on?" And then she looked at me and said, "You can't say retirement and college. Choose something else." And how I stay on top of them is basically I do run my numbers at least once a year in terms of whether we're on track to have enough money to do those things. In terms of obstacles, it's really time. So having the time, on the weekend or whatever, to do all the little, silly personal finance stuff that you probably should do to make your life a little better. Southwick: So I am also a naturally frugal person. Most of my money lessons I learned from my mom and my dad, of course, and they are both completely different. I think I said this before on the show. My mom used to like to say, "Alan, you're good at making money and I'm good at saving money." I think that's what she used to say. Because my dad is very good at making money, but he's also very good at spending money. He came from a family that didn't necessarily have a lot of money, and rather than becoming frugal as a result, he ended up being the "Who knows about tomorrow? Let's have a good time today and have all these good experiences and spend money." And for most of his life he was very good at making money so it wasn't an issue. My mom, on the other hand, came from a fairly wealthy family. She was just naturally frugal and I think often lived under the fear that you may not have money tomorrow. And one of her stories that I will retell to you all, and now Mom gets to hear one of her stories told back to her, was that her mother, my grandmother, once joked that she was down to her last $20. My mom, as a child, heard this and got very worried. And, of course, it wasn't her last $20. Maybe she was just saying it was the last $20 she had in her wallet. It was not their last $20, but for some reason my mom, as a child, thought, "This is our last $20 and we're going to be out on the street." And she was terrified. I think that was kind of an offhanded comment that her grandmother made, but it really affected my mom long-term. So I learned most of my frugal habits from my mom, but I also think I learned from my dad to also spend money and enjoy yourself, so Ron and I will not hesitate to spend an insane amount of money on a really nice meal, which is probably one of the most ridiculous things you can spend a lot of money on next to like a boat. But that's what we enjoy doing, so we're not afraid to treat ourselves now and then. That's how both my parents influenced my thinking on money. I'm naturally frugal and scared of not having money. I like having money. Also I would point out that Ron and I have both been very lucky that we've always been employed and we have good health. I think if either one of those went away, we would be in such serious trouble ... not because we didn't make good, sound financial decisions, but just because that can absolutely sink you. Brokamp: Right. That's true. One of the biggest causes of people who go into bankruptcy is because of medical issues. Southwick: Right. So on the one hand we try to make a series of one good decision after another. Not spend too much. Live within our means. Brokamp: And you've been planning for a while. I know both of you have been saving for retirement for a while. Southwick: Yeah. And I'm not particularly worried, but as far as goals go, I think just not being out on the street is a pretty good one. I guess I was saying that we make one good decision after another and to just be thankful for what we have. That we've been set up to also succeed, as well, thanks to our parents, and our decisions, and luck. I don't know. I don't know what else to say. I mean, we don't buy anything until we have the money for it. I know that sounds dumb and not terribly profound, but we've been saving up for a new car for like 10 years now. That comes after everything else. The new car fund doesn't get money into it until everything else has money in it, including college fund, retirement fund, blah, blah, blah. Brokamp: That's impressive, actually. Southwick: That what? Brokamp: That you do that. I know it's a crazy thing in America to say this, but that you save until you have the money to pay for something to buy it, as opposed to going into debt to get it. Southwick: I don't know. Rick, how about you? Rick Engdahl: I am not on that side of the glass because I am not a frugal person, not particularly disciplined, and I don't have a lot of inspiration when it comes to personal finance. It's not a subject that interests me. Which is why I wholeheartedly believe in automation, because I can set it up so that my check comes in and savings automatically drips into all my various accounts, and that's that. And then whatever is left over I can spend. Southwick: And do. Engdahl: And do. Once I paid off my credit card years ago, my rule has just been that when the bill comes in, I pay it in full and that's it. Brokamp: And you've been an investor for years, and we know, now, that you are saving for your kids' college education, so that's good. Engdahl: I've always been saving for their educations, but now I'm saving by way of a 529 ... whatever that thing's called. Brokamp: Yes, right. Yes, that thing. That's the thing you're doing. Engdahl: But investing for years means I automated that. That's automated, too. Everything is automated, because I don't like to think about it. Brokamp: That's good advice. Southwick: I wouldn't say that Ron or I do anything necessarily that's terribly sophisticated or complex. It's just like make money. Be sure you're making money. And then spend less than you're making. And try to make the most out of what you didn't spend. Brokamp: That's actually a pretty good formula though. Southwick: We'll see. Brokamp: We'll see. Southwick: We've got a few years ahead of us in retirement, so we'll be OK. Villages, here we come. Brokamp: Here we come. __ Southwick: For today's episode we're doing a little eavesdropping on a member event that we just held in Boston for our ONE members. But, even though you're not a member, you're going to get to sneak into the room. It's cool. You're with me. We're highlighting three speakers from the event. Bro, you attend a fair number of member events. Can you set the stage? What's it like? Brokamp: Well, it's usually in a nice place in a nice city. We often have keynote speakers and then breakouts. We try to bring in prominent thinkers about investing or some aspect of society, so it's not always investing-related. We try to bring in some executives, particularly if it's the executives and companies from recommendations in any of our services. And really the great thing is just to meet all the people who are Motley Fool members. Southwick: Yeah, they're great. Brokamp: They are. They're the best. Southwick: So let's start with a familiar voice. David Gardner was interviewed by Chris Hill, and Chris asked him for some investing tips. David talked a bit about how winners tend to keep winning, so you shouldn't sell your stocks that have experienced huge gains just because the media tells you they can't possibly keep on winning. And then David continued with some additional advice. __ David Gardner: I think most people are looking, understandably, at near-term results, both for their own investment portfolios and at the businesses that they own. Looking at the near-term results when, of course, it's the long term that matters for both of those things. I think people are often looking at the wrong things that way. Another example is for people -- and we all do this -- each of these things is natural. It's also just natural to look at the win-loss record. It's also very natural to look at what's not working and to think that the stock that just lost 25% yesterday is much more important than the stock that you might have purchased 10 years ago and has been a good holding and went up only 3% yesterday. But often the math works out really well. I think you should be focused on your winners, so learning lessons from our winners and not too many lessons from our losers. Psychologists, too, remind us that the pain of loss is three times the joy of gain, so again it's understandable why people care so much about something that's down, but I much prefer to focus on what's up. And then maybe a third and final example (I'm going to say these words carefully, just because they matter) is I think most people, again, are looking at the wrong thing. I think many people are looking at the valuations of beaten-down also-rans; and that's where they're fishing, often, for their next investment. And by direct contrast, looking at the right things, I prefer to look at not the valuation but the performance of not beaten-down also-rans, but the performance of innovative leaders. Those are a few examples. Chris Hill: The last time you and I were onstage talking, it was FoolFest. You had just had your 50th birthday. Here we are, now. Your service, Rule Breakers, has just had a birthday -- much younger, though -- 12 years. When you think back over the last 12 years, two questions. First, what are one or two lessons that you have drawn from 12 years of rule breaking investing? Gardner: I think probably the most important lesson that I've learned -- and that we've all learned if you're a rule breaker, or if you followed our scorecard of what we've done -- is learning to fail. In fact, I bounced away from my talk this morning to see a local university that my son is applying to, and one of the things they say at this school is "we're looking for 'risk-takers' willing to fail." And I think that we have failed grandly and far more often in Motley Fool Rule Breakers than I think any other service at The Motley Fool. And I don't like that. We have 48 stocks that have lost 50% or more of their value. I've picked, with the help of my team, two stocks every single month since we launched in October, 2004, so 12 years ago this month that's 288 stocks. Forty-eight of them have lost 50% or more of their value. But we're a winning service, and so the important statistic that you need to know, I think, is that the 48th best stock that we've selected as of this morning (pre-market open ... I haven't updated my numbers) is Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which is up 187.4%. So if you do the math with me, I hope you're willing to lose 50% or more 48 times in order that your 48th best pick would be well above 100% gain. If you do the math with me, you'll see that that's a game you want to play every time, but it's very hard for many people, especially who have just joined Motley Fool services, and that's not true of this august crowd. But many people come and when their first stock drops 10% if it has bad earnings, that's very upsetting for them. So I think we've learned that lesson. If you're a rule breaker you know it. You're a risk-taker willing to fail, and the good news is our top two picks, alone, have wiped out all of those losses from all the other 48 worst picks we've ever made. Hill: This may be an unfair question, but I'll ask it anyway. Gardner: Go for it. Hill: Go back 12 years in time and think about your mentality, your approach as a rule breaker. Has your approach stayed the same throughout, and if not, in what ways has the rule breaker approach changed for you? Gardner: Well, ostensibly the rule breaker approach is the same. I mean, of course we're all adapting and evolving constantly, so it doesn't matter whether you're 70, 50, 30, or younger than that. You're going to change again and your mentality will. I can say, ostensibly, we haven't changed because the bedrock of what I wrote in the book Rule Breakers, Rule Makers -- that Tom and I wrote in 1998 -- those six traits that I wrote about then are exactly what we use today in 2016. The world may have changed some in the last 18 years, but we're still doing the same Fool thing in that way. But at the same time, yeah, my mentality 12 years ago was I didn't quite as much value the importance of culture at companies, where today I know I'm not the only one at the Fool. When I talked about how you're in a room full of people and you're hearing from people today who understand what matters, I think the culture of the institutions matters a great deal; much more than I appreciated 12 years ago. And I hope I was generally consistent with this 12 years ago, but I am only reminded, more and more today, of how important it is for me that the companies that I recommend in Rule Breakers do things that improve the world. That are admirable companies. When they succeed, I want us all to feel great about it. I want to feel great about that company succeeding. One thing that I wrote a couple of years ago, which is one of my favorite things that I've written, is just make your portfolio your best expression of your hopes for our future. I think that should be true of the things that you're invested in. When they win, we all win and you feel great about what happened. Southwick: I love that so much I want to embroider it on a pillow. Isn't it the best? It is. "Make your portfolio your best expression of your hopes for our future." I love that. Brokamp: My hopes for our future are that everyone goes out and gets Starbucks coffee while they're visiting a Home Depot because those are stocks in my portfolio. And they get surgery from a robot through Intuitive Surgical. Southwick: Buying some Disney products on Amazon Prime. Brokamp: There you go. Make sure you check your Facebook. Engdahl: It sounds like we're going to need a disclaimer this episode. Brokamp: Every company I just mentioned I personally own. Southwick: You're making fun of me in seeing this is like a very nice, motivational thing, but I do think it's nice. Like I do like the idea of living in a world where Disney movies exist. I don't know. Brokamp: That's what's really exciting about David's style. I mean, he really is looking for trends and the ways that the future will change compared to the other companies he mentioned -- the beaten-down has-beens or something along those lines. It can be a successful way of investing, but it's certainly not as exciting as what David does. Southwick: You're making fun of me for being a little schmaltzy. Whatever. Brokamp: I'm sure I'll love your pillow. Southwick: All right. Next up Tom Gardner interviewed Raj Sisodia. He's the co-founder of the Conscious Capitalism movement and author of the book, Firms of Endearment. Raj started off researching marketing and looking at effective ad spending, but he noticed something ... that some companies didn't have to spend much on advertising at all. Hm! Why was that? He spoke with Tom Gardner about what he learned about the common characteristics of conscious companies and how that equates into higher performance. Raj Sisodia: Well, what about the companies that don't spend a lot and yet have extremely high loyalty and trust? What are they doing? And what can we learn from them? And to me that constitutes marketing excellence. That's the holy grail -- customer loyalty and trust. And so when we started to identify companies just based on that simple lens, we started to find companies like Whole Foods, for example. Whole Foods, at the time, was spending only 10% of the industry average on marketing. They didn't have a chief marketing officer. They didn't have an ad agency. Ninety percent of what they did spend was spent at the store level, not at headquarters. Ninety percent of that related to their community activities, so they somehow thought of marketing as that. I said, "That's not what we teach. That's not supposed to be marketing." But marketing was almost an afterthought. Starbucks had never advertised once in their history at that point. I don't think they have even now, as far as I can tell. There was very little of that. So we started to find these companies. What we soon discovered was it wasn't about the marketing. That for these companies, even their employees were highly loyal and trusting. Their communities deeply embraced these companies and welcomed them. In fact, people waited and camped out in the parking lot before there were new stores or locations opening for some of these businesses. We found that their suppliers had long-term, stable relationships with these companies. So they were really in a stakeholder frame of operation. In other words, they were looking after the well-being of all of their stakeholders. Not just customers, but employees, suppliers, communities. Even the environment, etc. So we saw they were treating everybody the way customers should be treated. Understanding their needs and really creating value consciously for all of their stakeholders. And then beyond that, we found that they had a reason for being. It's not just another airline, or just another retailer, or just another furniture shop, or CarMax. They were trying to reinvent, or change the way something was being done. They had a purpose. So it's not a business with a mission. This was like a mission with a business. Whole Foods was trying to change the way people eat and think about food, and change the way we run our food system, and the health of the planet, and all of that is impacted by the way that they define their business. The Container Store is trying to help you get organized so you can feel less stressed out and more relaxed. Southwest was trying to bring freedom to the skies and enable more people to travel. Make it fun. Make it affordable. Make it accessible. So they all have a reason for being. CarMax was trying to reinvent the used car selling business, which of course, as we know, you feel like you walk in there and you're going to get victimized. So there was a purpose -- a higher purpose. We discovered that these businesses have a higher purpose. They're stakeholder oriented. And then we also discovered their leaders were different. They're typically, in many cases, still the founders. Even if it's not the founder -- if it's a 100-year-old company -- somebody who has a passion for what this business is about. What they're trying to do. They're driven by service to the purpose and service to the people -- and not so much about power and their own personal ego and enrichment. They're much more, I would say, down to earth. More like servant leaders than your command-and-control, top-down, almost like a legal type of leader. And then lastly, we found the cultures. The Motley Fool has a fantastic culture. You only know them as clients, but if you go and visit them, they pay a lot of attention to the culture. It's a lot of fun. There's a lot of trust, there's a lot of transparency, and there's caring. There's authentic caring for human beings at the heart of these companies. [Northwest] Airlines -- the stock market symbol is LUV. L-U-V, right? What they talk about is we love our customers. We love. We love everyone to death. It's all rooted in that. And most businesses, unfortunately, are rooted in fear and stress. They think the way to get people to perform is to just constantly put pressure on them. Carrots and sticks. Think about that. What animal belongs between a carrot and a stick? A jackass -- not a human being. And yet we use that kind of language and people start behaving that way. They're still trying to get the carrot and avoid the stick. So that's the big difference and those are the four pillars. Let me now describe Conscious Capitalism but they were really uncovered in that book. Halfway through I said it's not about marketing. We're discovering all these people talking about love, and care, and trust, and compassion, and all of that. So I was calling it "Share of Heart" for a while. And I said, "You know in marketing, we used to talk about share of market and then we had share of wallet." And our editor said, "So now you're talking about share of heart? What comes next? Share of soul?" A cynical view of marketing. Fortunately we didn't stick with that and we ended up calling it Firms of Endearment. Companies that are loved by everybody and how you do that. And the icing on the cake -- at the end of all of our research and selecting the companies based on these criteria -- we did the financial analysis. And we said, "You know, these companies are paying their people better." Certainly at the front lines. Costco pays double of Wal-Mart. The Container Store pays double the prevailing wage in the industry. They provide much better benefits. Starbucks provides generous healthcare even to part-time employees, for example. They're taking care of their customers. Providing great customer care. They're not squeezing their suppliers. Suppliers are profitable, and innovative, and healthy. They're investing in their communities. They're investing in the environment. They're paying taxes at an average rate of 34% -- that sample of companies. We said, "Maybe investor returns are good but nothing phenomenal because they are spending in all these other areas." What we found actually stunned us -- that these companies outperformed the market 9 to 1 over a 10-year period. That would have been 1996 to 2006 because the book came out in 2007. We had 18 public companies in that. We thought we had made a mistake. We went and redid the analysis. How can this be? Because we still had that zero-sum mentality. That if you need to do more for employees you'll have to take it away from investors. If you want to pay more, maybe your margins will have to suffer. Well, no. Business is not a zero-sum game. It's the ultimate positive-sum game on this planet. I don't think anything else comes close. You create extraordinary amounts of value when you align everybody together around a shared sense of purpose. So you're excited to go to work on Monday. You don't say, "Thank God it's Friday." Do you know that heart attacks are highest on Monday morning, by the way? Twenty percent higher. Monday morning at 4:00 a.m. is the peak. That's the state of affairs we have. So what we found is that these companies have broken that trade-off mentality, and when you align everything together you create this virtual cycle of higher performance. And nobody has to suffer in that. Everybody matters, and everybody can win when you do business in the right way. And it's not about making money, and having a bunch of side effects. These businesses are able to operate with a spectrum of positive effects. It's not just financial. It's intellectual capital. It's social capital. It's emotional well-being. It's spiritual well-being. Physical well-being. Ecological well-being. It has a positive impact on the culture, and those are all the consequences of how we choose to operate. So as I said, that book turned my life around, because until then I just had a job and a bit of a career in marketing, and now I had a calling. And I still remember sitting in Pennsylvania in the Poconos at some writing retreat and I had tears in my eyes as we were writing some of the stories about these companies, and the deep humanity that exists inside corporations, or can exist if you allow it to. Because human beings are wired to care and corporations are designed to snuff that out for the most part. You're supposed to leave that at the door. Put on your mask and armor and show up for battle. It doesn't have to be that way. Why can't we combine love and work? Those are the two aspects of being human. Southwick: As part of my job here at The Motley Fool, I also do media relations and so sometimes that means getting our analysts out there talking about investing. Sometimes it means talking about workplace culture at the Fool. And it's funny to me how there's this tone, generally, that work sucks. Brokamp: Right. Southwick: And I guess that it does, and it historically has, really, been hard and difficult work; but many people today, including all of us here at The Motley Fool, have the opportunity to have really rewarding work. And work doesn't have to suck -- but it does suck for many people. I don't know how to reconcile that. Someone's got to clean toilets and I love them for that. Brokamp: I want a pillow that says "make love and work." That's all I'm saying. Southwick: You be careful. Christmas is coming up. Be careful what you wish for. Brokamp: I look forward to it. Southwick: Love and work on a satin pillow. A gift for you and Mrs. Brokamp. All right. Finally friend of the podcast Morgan Housel gave a speech titled, "You Are Not Too Late." He begins by showing the audience an iconic photo of one of the most momentous events in human history. Morgan Housel: This is Wilbur and Orville Wright on December 17, 1903. This picture is the first second of the first flight in human history. And we know, in hindsight, that this is one of the most important events in human history. If you go to the Library of Congress, where I found these papers, you'll find two things that I think are pretty astounding. One is that the first passing mention of the Wright brothers in The New York Times was 1906, three years after their first flight. Even more astounding, I think, is in 1904 (so one year after their first flight) The New York Times interviewed a European count who was a hot air balloon tycoon of sorts. And they asked him if human flight -- what they called back then the flying machine (that's what they called them back then) -- if flying machines would ever become a reality. And this is what he said. He said, "In the very, very, far future," said the Count, with a crescendo accent on the "very" and a shoulder shrug that suggested an eternity, "there may be flying machines, but not now. Not now." This was a year after the Wrights' first flight, in the nation's newspaper of record. There are so many interesting stories that come from the Wright brothers, but to me the most fascinating is this five-year gap between when they changed the world and they convinced people that they changed the world. And I think what's really important is that if you look into it, this is an extreme example, but almost every innovative product throughout time (every big invention that really changes the world and goes on to be one of the most impactful inventions or innovations) is almost never understood at first. The products that are instantly adored are adored because they're familiar, and they're familiar because they're usually just slight improvements over what's already available. But when you have products that are totally transformational, almost nobody gets it at first. And that process between inventing it and getting people to understand it isn't something that takes months or years. It can take decades. We know in hindsight that the car was one of the most transformational inventions of the 20th century, but it took us a quarter of a century to figure that out. This is true for TV, too. This is The New York Times in 1927 talking about the first use of television. It says: "Pictures are Flashed by Wire and Radio Synchronizing with Speaker's Voice." That's the clunky way of describing what a TV is. This is a little different. They were really excited about the TV when it first came out, because it was amazing to watch. But you see this line here: "Commercial Use in Doubt." And here, too, the first TVs came around in the mid-1920s. It wasn't until the 1950s that it was a pretty viable, sustainable commercial enterprise. It took a quarter of a century to get there. This is really interesting. It was true for penicillin, as well. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin pretty much by accident in 1928. And if you had to make a list of the most important discoveries or inventions of the 20th century, penicillin would be at or near the top. Depending on whose estimates you use, penicillin saved between 80 to 200 million lives since it was put into practice. It's a huge gap, but whatever the number is, it's enormous. It wasn't until 1942 -- so 14 years after discovery -- that Merck, the pharmaceutical company, made 10 doses of penicillin and realized that it was actually pretty great. And the first mass-scale production actually came for D-Day in 1944. They made 2 million doses. But that was 16 years after we first discovered it. Here, too, we have more than a decade between discovering something that changes the world and convincing people that it's actually going to change the world. With any big breakthrough technology I, at least, want to think in hindsight (and I think it's common to think in hindsight) that the gap between invention and adoption is quick. And it almost never is. I think every big innovative technology follows an eight-part path that goes something like this. First when it's invented people say, "I've never heard of it. Nobody knows about it." And then after a while, they say, "I've heard of it, but I don't understand it." And then after a while they say, "I understand it, but I don't see how it's useful." And then as time goes on, they say, "I see how it could be fun for rich people, but not for me." And then they say, "I use it, but it's just a toy. It's not practical. It's just fun to play with." And then they say, "It's becoming more useful for me." And then they say, "I use it all the time." And then they say, "I could not imagine life without it." I think every innovative product goes through this cycle, and the important thing to understand is that this cycle can take decades and it rarely, if ever, takes less than five years. So what does that mean for you as an investor? That's why you're all here. I have two things for you to think about. The first is that when innovation is measured generationally, results should not be measured quarterly. You can imagine in hindsight going to Wilbur and Orville in 1904, a year after their flight, and saying, "How's revenue? How's net income? How did you perform in the last 90 days?" You can imagine going to Bill Gates in 1979 and saying, "It looks like your growth in the last quarter is kind of slowing down. This is really concerning to me." It sounds ridiculous in hindsight, because it is ridiculous in hindsight. But people do that today with companies like Google and Facebook -- that are really doing big, innovative things -- but are still judged by quarterly results. A lot of what we call "pessimism" is just impatience in disguise. This headline I found two days ago. It was perfect timing. It says: "Why the next 20 years will see a lot less technological disruption than the past 20 years." I'm not saying this is wrong. This might very well be true. But this headline is ubiquitous across time. You could go back 20 or 40 or 50 or 100 years and find the same kind of pessimism. We're always kind of stuck in this idea, this trap that we used to innovate in the past, but we don't anymore. That idea has been around for hundreds of years. It's almost always present. And I think the reason that it feels like we haven't innovated in 20 years is because it takes 20 years for us to notice what we've innovated. Marc Andreessen, who is a famous venture capitalist who started Netscape (one of the first internet browsers), told a fascinating story recently. He went to Silicon Valley in, I think, 1992. It was really early on in the internet days. And he said that even in the early '90s, there was a palpable sense in Silicon Valley that they missed the internet. That it was too late. That it was something that happened in the previous years, but if you got there in '92 or '94 or '95 it was too late. You missed it. And in hindsight, we know that's ridiculous because even in 1995 and even in 1999, that was just the early seedling days of the internet. But at the time they had this sense that it was something in the past. That the things that we're making now are not that important. Not having that much impact. That they were too late. About one year ago, Kevin Kelly, who is the executive editor of Wired magazine (Wired is a big technology magazine) was asked basically that same point ... whether we're too late to invest in technology. We've made so much progress over the last 50 years and built so many great companies: companies like Google, and Facebook, and Amazon. But is it too late? We've missed the boat and it's too late. And he gave a great three-sentence answer that I'd love to wrap up with today. He said: "The greatest products of the next 25 years have not been invented. If they have, you might not even know about them yet. You're not too late." Southwick: I remember when I bought Amazon -- way back in 2014 ... Brokamp: Wow! Southwick: ... yeah. I had this fear that I was too late and that I'd already missed my chance. But it's doubled since then! And, of course, for every Amazon in my portfolio I can show you three companies that have tanked, but that's my best example of thinking I was too late and I wasn't too late. Brokamp: That's a good one. Southwick: [00:34:25] Brokamp: That goes back to one of David's points -- that in your portfolio you're going to have losers. You're going to have losers. That's just part of what happens. But ideally you also have the Amazons. I think it was Buffett who said that he thought he was too late to buy Wal-Mart many years ago, and I think he said that he was instead sitting around sucking his thumb because he got around to it too late. He never bought it, and he totally regrets it. And Wal-Mart, at that point, had already been around for probably 25 or 30 years. He said he thought it was too late and he was wrong. So even Buffett does it. Southwick: We could also put that on a pillow. That's the show. It's edited doggedly by Rick Engdahl. For Robert Brokamp, I'm Alison Southwick. Stay Foolish everybody.
