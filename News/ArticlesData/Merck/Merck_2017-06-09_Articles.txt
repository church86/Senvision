Hopkins 17 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Moody's: Number of distressed US retailers grows Sirius XM buys stake in music streaming site Pandora At a Chicago convention jammed with thousands of doctors in 2015, a buzz of excitement rippled through the hall as a researcher revealed data showing that a Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. drug cocktail had remarkable success in fighting a deadly form of skin cancer. Quotes in the article Bristol-Myers Squibb Co BMY ▲ 53.75 +0.90 +1.70% Merck KGaA MKGAF ▼ 118.75 -2.25 -1.86% Merck & Co Inc MRK ▲ 64.39 +1.19 +1.88% Pfizer Inc PFE ▲ 32.77 +1.02 +3.21% It was a high point in the development of promising cancer treatments known as immunotherapy that have the potential to radically change the course of the disease and generate billions of dollars in sales. And Bristol-Myers stood at the forefront with its drug, Opdivo, with high hopes of dominating the market by treating other forms of cancer as well. That euphoria has worn off.  In the past year, Bristol-Myers has seen $37 billion in market value wiped out after it gambled -- and lost -- on a clinical trial of Opdivo that could have made it a treatment in the lucrative market for new lung cancer patients. Its top rival, Merck & Co., is now viewed by investors as the favorite in that race. This week, coming out of the same cancer-research meeting that seemed so promising two years ago, Bristol-Myers shares have continued to slide as talk swirls about a possible sale, and are down about 4 percent this week, to $52.79, as of 9:31 a.m. on Friday in New York. “This is a blisteringly fast race for patients,” said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at Leerink Partners, who rates Bristol-Myers stock “outperform.” He called the company’s decision on lung cancer “a major misstep.” At least one prominent investor wants Bristol-Myers to expand its immune-therapy portfolio as much as possible or consider a merger with another drugmaker to accomplish that, according to a person with knowledge of the shareholder’s thinking. Analysts have mentioned Pfizer Inc. as potential suitor, along with Novartis AG and Gilead Sciences Inc. Opdivo Optimism Bristol-Myers is urging patience as it awaits scientific data on a host of combination therapies -- including mixing Opdivo with other medicines. That would expand the market for Opdivo, the company’s best-selling drug and a key to its oncology program. Cancer has become increasingly important to Bristol-Myers, which shed its diabetes unit in 2013. The company’s website lists just one new drug in a late-stage trial -- for cancer. Load Error “We are addressing cancer from all angles and our deep understanding of cancer biology and industry-leading pipeline will enable us to identify the right treatment, for the right patient, at the right time,” said Audrey Abernathy, a spokeswoman. Bristol-Myers’s cancer business had fallen into a dry spell before the company went on a deal-making spree over the past decade. Its 2009 purchase of Medarex, which was developing Opdivo, changed that. The drug, which harnesses the body’s own immune system to attack tumors, now accounts for almost 20 percent of Bristol-Myers’s $19.4 billion in annual revenue.  Opdivo’s success in treating melanoma had investors hoping that the company would have similar results in lung cancer, a field with vastly more patients. Other rivals -- including Merck -- saw the same potential, and were developing similar drugs. Facing Choices As New York-based Bristol-Myers geared up for a race, it had a choice. It could either go for a wide group of lung cancer patients who had a low level of a tumor protein that indicated the drug might help them. Or it could build a trial around a narrower group -- and smaller market -- of patients with high concentrations of the biological signal. Some of Bristol-Myers’s external scientific advisers raised concerns about the broad approach, according to two people familiar with the matter. The company went ahead anyway. Bristol-Myers didn’t respond directly to questions about its internal discussions. It also decided to have the trial measure whether its treatment stopped patients’ tumors from getting worse, instead of whether the drug actually helped them live longer -- the gold standard in cancer research. That was in hopes of showing positive results sooner than Merck, one of the people said. In August, Bristol-Myers was stung when the trial failed to pave the way for Opdivo to be used on its own for many more lung cancer patients. The news sent its shares plummeting 20 percent over two days. Five months later, the drugmaker said it wouldn’t seek accelerated U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for paring Opdivo with another drug, Yervoy, a sign that the trial results for that combination may also be underwhelming. Merck Boon Meanwhile, Merck’s Keytruda, a similar drug, is now being tested in more than half of the 1,000 imunotherapy trials underway. It’s on track to outsell Opdivo in 2018, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s a reversal from last year, when Keytruda’s sales were less than half of Opdivo’s. Merck benefited by taking a narrower approach than Bristol-Myers. It studied its drugs in a smaller population of cancer patients, those who had biomarkers indicating that the treatment was more likely to succeed. “Merck has clearly won the battle in lung cancer,” said Alex Spira, an oncologist at the Virginia Cancer Institute who overees the institute’s early-stage trial program. Merck declined to comment. Bristol-Myers Chief Science Officer Thomas Lynch, who served as a board director until he was tapped to lead research and development in March, says the company remains committed to developing first-line treatments for lung cancer, which will come from combinations of different drugs. Lynch wants to strike more partnerships while emphasizing biomarkers, and take a disciplined approach to trial design. He compared the company’s position to that of the New England Patriots football team, which overcame a 25-point deficit to win the Super Bowl in February. “We are early in the game,” said Lynch, an oncologist who who spent more than two decades at Massachusetts General Hospital. “It is just the first quarter.” Activist Action Investors might not be so patient. In February, Bristol-Myers added three new directors and agreed to buy back $2 billion of its shares after holding discussions with the hedge fund Jana Partners LLC. The activist investor Carl Icahn also purchased a stake, according to the Wall Street Journal, fueling speculation about a possible sale. A spokesman for Jana, which has since reduced its stake, declined to comment. Icahn couldn’t be reached for comment. Merck is only one competitor Bristol-Myers needs to worry about. Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc are also in the race to develop treatments. Now Wall Street is waiting to see the results of Bristol-Myers’s combination trial to understand how well the cocktail works in lung cancer patients. “If that trial’s not successful, or it’s equivalent, what’s next?” said John Schroer, sector head of health care at Allianz Global Investors, which own Bristol-Myers shares. “That’s a conversation I don’t think a lot of investors want to have.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Such "tumor-agnostic" drugs from companies including Merck &amp; Co and Loxo Oncology may help overcome misgivings by health insurers, who have balked at covering large-scale tests looking for genetic mutations in tumors, and quell concerns of some top cancer doctors who question whether enough patients benefit from such tests. Last month, Merck's immunotherapy Keytruda became the first cancer treatment ever to win U.S. approval based on whether the tumor carried a specific genetic glitch, irrespective of the tumor's location. More recently, Loxo showed that its drug larotrectinib helped shrink tumors in 76 percent of patients with a wide variety of advanced cancers who carried a specific genetic defect. The surprising results suggested a benefit of testing many patients for the same defects. "Insurance companies had an easy out" before the Merck approval and Loxo data, said Dr. David Hyman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Hyman presented the Loxo results at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting last weekend. "They have asked, 'Show me the evidence this helps patients.' It didn't exist," he said. "Now we have these data." A second company, Ignyta Inc, has developed a drug that targets the same genetic glitch as Loxo´s larotrectinib, and both treatments are under expedited review by U.S. regulators. At the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, cancer chief Dr. Richard Pazdur said he is "very supportive" of the tumor-agnostic approach and believes more such approvals are likely. "What we're seeing is the result of a lot of work that has been done to determine how these drugs work," Pazdur told Reuters. Such evidence may begin to sway insurers, but it's not clear how quickly. Aetna Inc said it is studying the Keytruda approval and will base its decision about testing based on the medical evidence and whether the treatments improve quality, reduce waste and provide members with access to affordable care. Dr. Jeffrey Hankoff of Cigna Inc said the company "generally does not cover multi-gene panels" unless they are recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit group that sets cancer treatment guidelines. "Ultimately, it's a matter of having actionable information from genetic testing that is based on evidence, not on conjecture," Hankoff said. ENTHUSIASM WANING In 2001, Novartis drug Gleevec transformed the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) from a fatal blood cancer to a treatable condition for most patients. The drug takes aim at a single genetic defect, raising hopes for a new age of targeted drugs that work better and more safely than traditional chemotherapy. Since then, gene sequencing has become exponentially faster and cheaper. Five years ago, companies such as Foundation Medicine introduced genetic profiling tests that look for a range of cancer-causing genes to match patients to a handful of targeted drugs for lung, skin and breast cancer or to clinical trials testing new agents. Many doctors have embraced the practice, hoping to find a treatment for patients with advanced cancers who were out of options. But insurers have been slow to pay for the tests, which cost $1,000 to $5,000 and can result in the off-label use of targeted drugs with no evidence that they work. In late 2015, a randomized trial showed such testing yielded no survival advantage compared with conventional therapy. The finding triggered a fierce debate in medical journals, with some experts questioning whether hype has gotten ahead of the science. "There are patients that benefit, but it's very much a minority of the patients," said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a colorectal cancer specialist at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Hyman argues that the Keytruda approval based on a single genetic defect "changed the field overnight" and will gain momentum with the likely approval of larotrectinib, which targets a defect called TRK fusions. Experts estimate up to 1 percent of all cancer patients have TRK fusions. Dr. John Heymach, an oncologist from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas who was not involved in the Loxo study, said it underlines "the importance of expanding what we're looking for."

It was a high point in the development of promising cancer treatments known as immunotherapy that have the potential to radically change the course of the disease and generate billions of dollars in sales. And Bristol-Myers stood at the forefront with its drug, Opdivo, with high hopes of dominating the market by treating other forms of cancer as well. That euphoria has worn off.  In the past year, Bristol-Myers has seen $37 billion in market value wiped out after it gambled -- and lost -- on a clinical trial of Opdivo that could have made it a treatment in the lucrative market for new lung cancer patients. Its top rival, Merck & Co., is now viewed by investors as the favorite in that race. This week, coming out of the same cancer-research meeting that seemed so promising two years ago, Bristol-Myers shares have continued to slide as talk swirls about a possible sale, and are down about 4 percent this week, to $52.79, as of 9:31 a.m. on Friday in New York. “This is a blisteringly fast race for patients,” said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at Leerink Partners, who rates Bristol-Myers stock “outperform.” He called the company’s decision on lung cancer “a major misstep.” At least one prominent investor wants Bristol-Myers to expand its immune-therapy portfolio as much as possible or consider a merger with another drugmaker to accomplish that, according to a person with knowledge of the shareholder’s thinking. Analysts have mentioned  Pfizer Inc. as potential suitor, along with Novartis AG and Gilead Sciences Inc. Opdivo Optimism Bristol-Myers is urging patience as it awaits scientific data on a host of combination therapies -- including mixing Opdivo with other medicines. That would expand the market for Opdivo, the company’s best-selling drug and a key to its oncology program. Cancer has become increasingly important to Bristol-Myers, which shed its diabetes unit in 2013. The company’s website lists just one new drug in a late-stage trial -- for cancer. “We are addressing cancer from all angles and our deep understanding of cancer biology and industry-leading pipeline will enable us to identify the right treatment, for the right patient, at the right time,” said Audrey Abernathy, a spokeswoman. Bristol-Myers’s cancer business had fallen into a dry spell before the company went on a deal-making spree over the past decade. Its 2009 purchase of Medarex, which was developing Opdivo, changed that. The drug, which harnesses the body’s own immune system to attack tumors, now accounts for almost 20 percent of Bristol-Myers’s $19.4 billion in annual revenue.  Opdivo’s success in treating melanoma had investors hoping that the company would have similar results in lung cancer, a field with vastly more patients. Other rivals -- including Merck -- saw the same potential, and were developing similar drugs. Facing Choices As New York-based Bristol-Myers geared up for a race, it had a choice. It could either go for a wide group of lung cancer patients who had a low level of a tumor protein that indicated the drug might help them. Or it could build a trial around a narrower group -- and smaller market -- of patients with high concentrations of the biological signal. Some of Bristol-Myers’s external scientific advisers raised concerns about the broad approach, according to two people familiar with the matter. The company went ahead anyway. Bristol-Myers didn’t respond directly to questions about its internal discussions. It also decided to have the trial measure whether its treatment stopped patients’ tumors from getting worse, instead of whether the drug actually helped them live longer -- the gold standard in cancer research. That was in hopes of showing positive results sooner than Merck, one of the people said. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up In August, Bristol-Myers was stung when the trial failed to pave the way for Opdivo to be used on its own for many more lung cancer patients. The news sent its shares plummeting 20 percent over two days. Five months later, the drugmaker said it wouldn’t seek accelerated U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for paring Opdivo with another drug, Yervoy, a sign that the trial results for that combination may also be underwhelming. Merck Boon Meanwhile, Merck’s Keytruda, a similar drug, is now being tested in more than half of the 1,000 imunotherapy trials underway. It’s on track to outsell Opdivo in 2018, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s a reversal from last year, when Keytruda’s sales were less than half of Opdivo’s. Merck benefited by taking a narrower approach than Bristol-Myers. It studied its drugs in a smaller population of cancer patients, those who had biomarkers indicating that the treatment was more likely to succeed. “Merck has clearly won the battle in lung cancer,” said Alex Spira, an oncologist at the Virginia Cancer Institute who overees the institute’s early-stage trial program. Merck declined to comment. Bristol-Myers Chief Science Officer Thomas Lynch, who served as a board director until he was tapped to lead research and development in March, says the company remains committed to developing first-line treatments for lung cancer, which will come from combinations of different drugs. Lynch wants to strike more partnerships while emphasizing biomarkers, and take a disciplined approach to trial design. He compared the company’s position to that of the New England Patriots football team, which overcame a 25-point deficit to win the Super Bowl in February. “We are early in the game,” said Lynch, an oncologist who who spent more than two decades at Massachusetts General Hospital. “It is just the first quarter.” Activist Action Investors might not be so patient. In February, Bristol-Myers added three new directors and agreed to buy back $2 billion of its shares after holding discussions with the hedge fund Jana Partners LLC. The activist investor Carl Icahn also purchased a stake, according to the Wall Street Journal, fueling speculation about a possible sale. A spokesman for Jana, which has since reduced its stake, declined to comment. Icahn couldn’t be reached for comment. Merck is only one competitor Bristol-Myers needs to worry about. Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc are also in the race to develop treatments. Now Wall Street is waiting to see the results of Bristol-Myers’s combination trial to understand how well the cocktail works in lung cancer patients. “If that trial’s not successful, or it’s equivalent, what’s next?” said John Schroer, sector head of health care at Allianz Global Investors, which own Bristol-Myers shares. “That’s a conversation I don’t think a lot of investors want to have.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Such "tumor-agnostic" drugs from companies including Merck & Co and Loxo Oncology may help overcome misgivings by health insurers, who have balked at covering large-scale tests looking for genetic mutations in tumors, and quell concerns of some top cancer doctors who question whether enough patients benefit from such tests. Last month, Merck's immunotherapy Keytruda became the first cancer treatment ever to win U.S. approval based on whether the tumor carried a specific genetic glitch, irrespective of the tumor's location. More recently, Loxo showed that its drug larotrectinib helped shrink tumors in 76 percent of patients with a wide variety of advanced cancers who carried a specific genetic defect. The surprising results suggested a benefit of testing many patients for the same defects. "Insurance companies had an easy out" before the Merck approval and Loxo data, said Dr. David Hyman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Hyman presented the Loxo results at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting last weekend. "They have asked, 'Show me the evidence this helps patients.' It didn't exist," he said. "Now we have these data." A second company, Ignyta Inc, has developed a drug that targets the same genetic glitch as Loxo's larotrectinib, and both treatments are under expedited review by U.S. regulators. At the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, cancer chief Dr. Richard Pazdur said he is "very supportive" of the tumor-agnostic approach and believes more such approvals are likely. "What we're seeing is the result of a lot of work that has been done to determine how these drugs work," Pazdur told Reuters. Such evidence may begin to sway insurers, but it's not clear how quickly. Aetna Inc said it is studying the Keytruda approval and will base its decision about testing based on the medical evidence and whether the treatments improve quality, reduce waste and provide members with access to affordable care. Dr. Jeffrey Hankoff of Cigna Inc said the company "generally does not cover multi-gene panels" unless they are recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit group that sets cancer treatment guidelines. "Ultimately, it's a matter of having actionable information from genetic testing that is based on evidence, not on conjecture," Hankoff said. ENTHUSIASM WANING In 2001, Novartis drug Gleevec transformed the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) from a fatal blood cancer to a treatable condition for most patients. The drug takes aim at a single genetic defect, raising hopes for a new age of targeted drugs that work better and more safely than traditional chemotherapy. Since then, gene sequencing has become exponentially faster and cheaper. Five years ago, companies such as Foundation Medicine introduced genetic profiling tests that look for a range of cancer-causing genes to match patients to a handful of targeted drugs for lung, skin and breast cancer or to clinical trials testing new agents. Many doctors have embraced the practice, hoping to find a treatment for patients with advanced cancers who were out of options. But insurers have been slow to pay for the tests, which cost $1,000 to $5,000 and can result in the off-label use of targeted drugs with no evidence that they work. In late 2015, a randomized trial showed such testing yielded no survival advantage compared with conventional therapy. The finding triggered a fierce debate in medical journals, with some experts questioning whether hype has gotten ahead of the science. "There are patients that benefit, but it's very much a minority of the patients," said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a colorectal cancer specialist at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Hyman argues that the Keytruda approval based on a single genetic defect "changed the field overnight" and will gain momentum with the likely approval of larotrectinib, which targets a defect called TRK fusions. Experts estimate up to 1 percent of all cancer patients have TRK fusions. Dr. John Heymach, an oncologist from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas who was not involved in the Loxo study, said it underlines "the importance of expanding what we're looking for."

Dr. Jeffrey Hankoff of Cigna Inc said the company “generally does not cover multi-gene panels” unless they are recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit group that sets cancer treatment guidelines. “Ultimately, it’s a matter of having actionable information from genetic testing that is based on evidence, not on conjecture,” Hankoff said. Many doctors have embraced the practice, hoping to find a treatment for patients with advanced cancers who were out of options. But insurers have been slow to pay for the tests, which cost $1,000 to $5,000 and can result in the off-label use of targeted drugs with no evidence that they work. In late 2015, a randomized trial showed such testing yielded no survival advantage compared with conventional therapy. The finding triggered a fierce debate in medical journals, with some experts questioning whether hype has gotten ahead of the science. “There are patients that benefit, but it’s very much a minority of the patients,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a colorectal cancer specialist at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Hyman argues that the Keytruda approval based on a single genetic defect “changed the field overnight” and will gain momentum with the likely approval of larotrectinib, which targets a defect called TRK fusions. Experts estimate up to 1 percent of all cancer patients have TRK fusions. Dr. John Heymach, an oncologist from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas who was not involved in the Loxo study, said it underlines “the importance of expanding what we’re looking for.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

They now have a “buy” rating on the stock. 6/2/2017 – OncoSec Medical had its “buy” rating reaffirmed by analysts at HC Wainwright. They now have a $6.00 price target on the stock. They wrote, “We believe preliminary interim data—based on the first 16-20 patients—could be reported in late 2017 or early 2018. Management have indicated that an ORR of at least 30% would be considered a success for the PISCES study. We note that positive results from the interim analysis may allow the company to apply for Breakthrough Therapy designation in patients who have failed anti- PD-1 monotherapies. In addition, OncoSec may report 24-month follow- up data from the Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial later this year. In the wake of this update, we reiterate our Buy rating and $6 price target. 43% ORR in Phase 2 combo trial. A prior investigator-sponsored Phase 2 combo study of ImmunoPulse IL-12 and Keytruda in 22 metastatic melanoma patients reported positive data. These patients were predicted to have low likelihoods of response to anti-PD-1 monotherapies based on biomarker assays. The results showed a 43% (9/21) ORR at 24 weeks by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. There were 24% (5/21) complete responders and 19% (4/22) partial responders. Of note, nine out of the 22 patients enrolled had prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy; ORR for this subset of patients was 33% (3/9). The data showed that intra-tumoral electroporation of interleukin-12 DNA, combined with pembrolizumab, can effectively alter the tumor microenvironment and increase tumor- specific CD8+ T-cells, which drive a systemic anti-tumor immune response. The combo therapy had an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated.”” 6/2/2017 – OncoSec Medical was downgraded by analysts at ValuEngine from a “sell” rating to a “strong sell” rating. 5/22/2017 – OncoSec Medical was given a new $6.00 price target on by analysts at HC Wainwright. They now have a “buy” rating on the stock. 5/18/2017 – OncoSec Medical had its “buy” rating reaffirmed by analysts at Maxim Group. They now have a $5.00 price target on the stock. They wrote, “Oncosec’s PISCES study (IL-12 + Keytruda) prepares to launch in June. Merck (MRK – $63.00 – NR) will supply Keytruda on an investigational basis to support the study.”” 5/12/2017 – OncoSec Medical had its “buy” rating reaffirmed by analysts at Noble Financial. 5/12/2017 – OncoSec Medical had its “buy” rating reaffirmed by analysts at Maxim Group. They now have a $5.00 price target on the stock. They wrote, “Oncosec announced a collaboration and supply agreement with Merck (MRK – $64.43 – NR) to evaluate Immunopulse IL-12 + Keytruda in the upcoming P2b study (PISCES) in metastatic melanoma that have progressed on PD-1 therapy.”” Shares of OncoSec Medical Inc (ONCS) traded up 1.79% on Friday, hitting $1.14. 90,724 shares of the company were exchanged.

More navigation items News Light touch boosts reactions 10-fold By Katrina Krämer9 June 2017 No comments First standardised photoreactor ups photoredox reactions and reduces reproducibility concerns Source: The American Chemical Society The standardised photoreactor will ensure that chemists are comparing apples with apples when it to their results  A new photoreactor can increase the rate of light-mediated reactions up to 10 times compared with the same reactions run using standard setups. The benchtop device allows researchers to precisely use light as a reagent for the first time and promises to further the field of photoredox catalysis. Organic photoredox catalysis can enable bond-making that is difficult or impossible using other types of chemistry. The number of scientific reports published on the topic has increased exponentially, from less than 20 in 2010 to roughly 200 in 2015. However, photons only penetrate reaction vessels to a depth of about 2mm. Until now there has been no consensus on how to maximise photon exposure – individual research teams have come up with various lab-made solutions, which makes comparing and reproducing reactions tricky. This apparatus would be easy for people to use in a regular research lab and I think many people would want to try Chao-Jun Li, McGill University This is how David MacMillan from Princeton University, who led the new study together with Ian Davies from Merck & Co, came up with the idea of a standardised photoreactor. ‘[Davies and I] were sitting in a coffee shop and we were talking about the fact that there’s all these photoredox reactions that pharmaceutical companies have adopted, which is fantastic – but working as a consultant, I get emails all the time asking me “Do you run it with the light here? Is the vial 6cm away, is it 2cm away?”.’ Their team has developed a small photoreactor that allows researchers to fine-tune reaction conditions without worrying about experimental setup and reproducibility. Surprisingly, the reactor also speeds up the rate of known photocatalytic reactions and enables reactions with substrates that have previously proven problematic. Source: The American Chemical Society Integrated photoreactor with different modular components, along with labeled cutaway view of the entire device Transformations such as cross-electrophile couplings and decarboxylative arlyations are up to 10 times faster when carried out in the reactor compared with running them in a vial next to a lamp. The reactor maximises light exposure of the reaction vessel while minimising heating. Moreover, it also allows researchers to precisely control the lamps’ intensity and use photons like a reagent, adding the same ‘amount’ every time. ‘I think there’s the perception that except for very specialised labs, photochemistry is difficult to control,’ says Chao-Jun Li from McGill University, Canada, whose trifluoromethylation reaction is one of those Davies and MacMillan tested in their photoreactor. ‘But this apparatus would be easy for people to use in a regular research lab and I think many people would want to try.’ Merck & Co decided not to patent the design in the hope that competition will drive down the device’s cost. Penn Optical Coatings, a company MacMillan’s physicist brother is involved with, is already working on a commercial model. ‘A large number of companies have agreed to adopt [the reactor] as a standardised system,’ MacMillan tells Chemistry World. ‘The benefits may be most obvious among companies but may also facilitate collaboration between academic groups (or academics with industrial partners) by avoiding any issues that are simply based on the reaction setup,’ agrees Corey Stephenson, a photoredox catalysis expert from the University of Michigan, US. ‘It’s definitely a technology that we will incorporate into my lab as soon as possible.’ References C Le et al, ACS Cent.

Kolon Life Science's Invossa, a gene drug for osteoarthritis, will receive an approval from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety later this month at the earliest, according to sources. This would make it the world's first medicine for the degenerative joint disease. SK Chemicals is also expecting authorities to give the green light to its shingles vaccine in the coming months, the biotech company said. The new vaccine will break the current monopoly held by MSD Korea, the local unit of U.S. pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co, in the market estimated at some 80 billion won (US$71.35 million) in value. Green Cross Corp., another leading drugmaker, is also preparing to release its tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine for adults later this year, after receiving an approval from the government in November, the sources said. South Korea currently imports all Td vaccines. "The research and development capability that has been accumulated over the years by the local pharmaceutical industry is starting to bring about results," said Lee Jae-kook, senior executive at the Korea Pharmaceutical and Bio-Pharma Manufacturers Association.

Kolon Life Science's Invossa, a gene drug for osteoarthritis, will receive an approval from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety later this month at the earliest, according to sources. This would make it the world's first medicine for the degenerative joint disease.  This file photo taken on Aug. 23, 2016, shows South Korea`s leading pharma event, CPHI Korea 2016, under way at a convention center in Seoul. The event showcases products in the medical industry. (Yonhap) SK Chemicals is also expecting authorities to give the green light to its shingles vaccine in the coming months, the biotech company said. The new vaccine will break the current monopoly held by MSD Korea, the local unit of U.S. pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co, in the market estimated at some 80 billion won (US$71.35 million) in value. Green Cross Corp., another leading drugmaker, is also preparing to release its tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine for adults later this year, after receiving an approval from the government in November, the sources said. South Korea currently imports all Td vaccines. "The research and development capability that has been accumulated over the years by the local pharmaceutical industry is starting to bring about results," said Lee Jae-kook, senior executive at the Korea Pharmaceutical and Bio-Pharma Manufacturers Association.

Leadership Search Search NSANSA Backtracks on Sharing Number of Americans Caught In Warrantless Spying Fortune 500Silicon Valley Isn’t The Only Out-Of-Touch Tech Bubble TelevisionNearly 20 Million Viewers Watched James Comey’s Senate Testimony TwitterTwitter Account of Journalist, Activist Hacked to Spread Fake News Fortune 500 White Men Account for 72% of Corporate Leadership at 16 of the Fortune 500 Companies Stacy Jones Jun 09, 2017 Even if only 16 Fortune 500 companies share detailed demographic information about their employees, it’s important to point out that the data that is available represents the race, gender and job category of more than 800,000 people – everyone from the CEO through service staff. That’s an awful lot of workers. If that group were one giant U.S. company, it’d be second only to Walmart in terms of size. And it would take at least 26 skyscrapers to give each of those 5,089 executives and senior officials a corner office. (The average skyscraper has about 50 floors; the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission fully explains which job titles get the “executive/senior officials and managers” designation in a footnote here.) Of those high ranking officials, 80% are men and 72% of those men are white. Using those 16 companies as a representative sample for the entire Fortune 500 cohort would result in a pretty wide margin of error: 24.3%. So, it's important to point out that what the workforce looks like at 16 companies that share data isn't a perfect predictor of what happens at the other 484. However, it seems likely that women at Fortune 500 companies see better representation in senior official roles than they do among CEOs. The Most Powerful Women team reported on Wednesday that 32 of the CEOs on this year’s list are women. It’s an historic high-water mark that pushes their representation to 6.4%. Related Fortune 500Silicon Valley Isn’t The Only Out-Of-Touch Tech Bubble Fortune 500 Silicon Valley Isn’t The Only Out-Of-Touch Tech Bubble Seventy-three percent of the senior executives, men and women, are white. The rest are 21% Asian, 3% Latino/a, 2% black, 0.6% two or more races, 0.2% Native American and 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. Compared to the demographics of the overall employed workforce, Asian and white workers at these 16 companies are overrepresented in senior leadership by 15 and 10 percentage points, respectively. Latino/a and black executives are underrepresented by 9 and 13 percentage points. People who represent two or more races are three times as common in the overall workforce as they are in senior executive roles. Meanwhile, Native Americans and Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders are underrepresented by 0.3 and 0.4 percentage points. There’s lots of evidence, statistical and otherwise, that corporations struggle most with increasing diversity among their top leadership. In fact, a former senior executive at American Express – which is ranked at #85 on this year’s list – talked to the Wharton School about in 2006. He’s quoted in the Wharton article saying that just the mere presence of blacks in the CEO or chairman positions have an impact. “It promotes change among the employees who are able to look at their peers in an entirely different light than [they did] in the late 1970s when I was in government,” said Weldon J. Rougeau, who was director of federal contractor compliance at the Department of Labor during the Carter administration. “That’s all very good,” he continued. “Does it mean that there are not any problems in the workplace? No, of course not.” At the time the article was published, American Express’s first black CEO, Kenneth Chenault, was 5 years into his now 16-year tenure. When he was named as the head of the company in 2001, he became the third black CEO of a Fortune 500 company. TIAA’s (then TIAA-CREF) Dr. Clifton R. Wharton, Jr. was the first in 1987. In 1999 he was followed by Fannie Mae’s Franklin Raines, who was eventually ousted after the 2008 mortgage crisis. As of the release of the 2017 list, there are currently four black CEOs among the cohort: Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., another TIAA CEO; Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck; Chenault at American Express; and J.C. Penney's CEO Marvin R. Ellison. In January Xerox’s Ursula Burns, who became the first black woman CEO on the list in 2009, stepped down from her post. That meant there were no more black women among the Fortune 500 CEOs and that was still true when the new list was released yesterday. There are just two women of color on the list: Geisha Williams, the Latina who runs PG&E and Indra Nooyi, the Indian American (she would be counted in the Asian category on an EEO-1 Report) CEO at PepsiCo. One of those problems Rougeau may have been referring to when he talked about corporate diversity in 2006 is the way tokenism manifests for high-ranking people from marginalized communities. They wind up bearing the implicit responsibility to make sure other employees who look like them achieve a similar level of success. That, said Dr. Kira Banks, leaves too many people on the bench when it’s time to increase corporate diversity and retention. She’s an associate professor at St. Louis University and co-founder of The Mouse & The Elephant, a consulting firm that helps corporations execute on diversity initiatives. (They tell the story behind their name, based on a 2010 book by Laura Liswood, here.) When Banks looked at the above diversity data for senior executives at 16 Fortune 500 companies, she was careful to point out that it need not be a depressing reminder that women and people of color – and other marginalized groups that aren’t counted on the EEO-1 Report – struggle to make it to the upper echelons of corporate America. Rather, she said, we should delight in the number of potential allies who work for these titans of industry. “I think the burden is on the predominantly white men in these positions to be intentional in speaking out about the pipeline and mentoring issues. It shouldn’t be our goal to say, ‘Hey, look, there’s another Asian woman who’s in this leadership position and that means I can make it too,’” she said.“That perpetuates tokenization.” It’s often the case that the demographics of leadership are treated as a death sentence for the upward mobility of minority employees. It wasn’t until last August that Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs whose companies represent 15 million workers, specifically cited diversity at the top of its list of characteristics to consider for board composition in its Principles of Corporate Governance guide. "Diverse backgrounds and experiences on corporate boards, including those tho represent a broad range of society, strengthen board performance and promote the creation of long-term shareholder value," the report said. This was such a significant departure from previous editions of the report that it got a call out in The New York Times’ DealBook. And on that point, it would seem the CEO group and Banks agree. “You don't have to be a person of color or a woman or a person from another marginalized identity to be a champion for diversity,” she said.

(Graphic: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Technavio has published a new report on the global veterinary vaccines market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail June 09, 2017 01:23 PM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--According to the latest market study released by Technavio, the global veterinary vaccines market is expected to reach USD 6,893.72 million by 2021, growing at a CAGR of almost 5%. This research report titled ‘Global Veterinary Vaccines Market 2017-2021’ provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. This market research report also includes up to date analysis and forecasts for various market segments and all geographical regions. The global veterinary vaccines market is expected to benefit from the growing concern over food safety. The dependency on livestock products like meat, milk, and other products is increasing, and the mortality rate associated with infection transmission from animals to humans through these products is increasing. These factors are pushing the vendors to invest in R&D to improve and expand their product portfolios, thereby driving the market growth. An increase in the number of pets worldwide and improved treatment options will fuel the market to grow during the forecast period. Looking for more information on this market? Request a free sample report Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio’s healthcare and life science research analysts categorize the global veterinary vaccines market into the following segments by technology. They are: Live attenuated vaccines Inactivated/Killed vaccines Recombinant vector vaccines Toxoid vaccines DNA vaccines The top three technology segments for the global veterinary vaccines market are discussed below: Live attenuated vaccines The live attenuated vaccines segment accounted for a market share of almost 40% in the global veterinary market in 2016. Live virus vaccines are prepared from attenuated microbial strains that are almost free from virulence and can produce a protective immune response. They exhibit long-lasting immunity within one or two doses, as they produce strong cellular and antibody responses and can multiply in the host cells to continue antigenic stimulation. The major diseases in animals such as rabies, anaemia, anthrax, Newcastle disease, and WNV are controlled using attenuated vaccines. According to Amit Sharma, a lead infectious and rare disease research analyst from Technavio, “The demand for live attenuated vaccines is higher in developed economies such as the US and the UK due to their enhanced infrastructure, which allows them to follow the strict storage conditions successfully. As per the United States Department of Agriculture, 310 live attenuated vaccines were approved for animals, which contributes to almost 40% of the total vaccines approved.” Inactivated/Killed vaccines The inactivated vaccines segment accounted for a market share of almost 40% in the global veterinary market in 2016. It is produced by killing disease-causing microorganisms by thermal, chemical, or radiation methods. Compared to live vaccines, inactivated vaccines are more stable and safer. This stability makes them more accessible for people in developing countries. “The market penetration for inactive vaccines will be smooth as there are no stringent requirements of storage conditions. Inactive vaccines cover a wide spectrum of diseases. The market is expected to grow in a stable manner in developed countries. However, in developing economies, inactivated vaccines are expected to boost the overall share,” says Sapna. Recombinant vector vaccines The recombinant vector vaccines segment accounted for a market share of more than 11% in the global veterinary market in 2016. Recombinant vector vaccines mimic a natural process of infection, but they contain the harmless or attenuated virus and a specific portion of the genetic code, which produces antigens within the cell. The recombinant vector vaccines have added a new dimension to the current veterinary vaccines market with their multiple advantages. Merial is one of the leaders in recombinant vector vaccines. They have the maximum USDA approvals for various indications like Bursal disease, canine distemper, encephalomyelitis, and equine influenza. Biomune is also a growing company in the market, with USDA approval against diseases like avian encephalomyelitis, Marek's disease, and New Castle disease. The top vendors highlighted by Technavio’s research analysts in this report are: Elanco Merck Merial Zoetis Browse Related Reports: Global Rabies Treatment Market 2017-2021 Global Orphan Drug Market 2017-2021 Global Animal Parasiticides Market 2017-2021 Become a Technavio Insights member and access all three of these reports for a fraction of their original cost.

Login Register Public Release: 9-Jun-2017 New study design holds promise for drug safety research New method effective measure of a drug's safety over time University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Share  Print  E-Mail Philadelphia - As the pace of drug approvals accelerates and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) faces potential budget cuts, a new research design from Perelman School of Medicine scientists offers a new way to successfully assess safety of newly approved drugs, as well as drugs that have been on the market for a long time and have had a marked rise in their use. The study, published in the July issue of the journal Epidemiology, offers benefits over typically used randomized clinical trials, as such studies are often too small to identify rare side effects or may be performed in a group of patients who do not take other types of medications or have other conditions that could skew the drug's effect in a broader group following approval. Also first-in-class drugs may not have an applicable comparator drug, and traditional follow-up studies may give inaccurate results if those who take a new drug are different from those who took the comparator drug. In this new, unbiased, "trend-in-trend" design, researchers monitor changes in frequency of outcomes as they relate to changes in an exposure to a drug across groups that adopt the drug at different rates. This method can be used to study newly approved drugs or any drug that has a rapidly increasing or rapidly declining trend in consumption. The trend-in-trend concept, designed by senior author Sean Hennessy, PharmD, PhD, a professor of epidemiology in the department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology & Informatics, and his colleagues, may be a welcome addition to an industry in need of support. The FDA review process for new standard drugs is accelerating - from 12 months in FY 13 to 10 months in FY 14. Drugs the FDA designate as "priority," those deemed to have a particularly significant impact - are reviewed even faster, in a median of 7.9 months in FY14. Ninety-two percent of priority classified drugs were approved in their first review cycle in FY14, up from 78 percent in FY13. Approvals for standard drugs also increased from 54 percent in FY13 to 60 percent in FY14. The U.S. approves drugs faster than Europe and Canada does. This means that drugs can have unknown safety issues at the time of approval. A fifth of all drugs receive a black boxed warning (the highest level of warning on a drug's label) after approval, and 4 percent of drugs are ultimately withdrawn for safety reasons. The U.S. President's proposed budget includes an 18 percent cut to the department of Health and Human Services (which oversees the FDA) and calls for rolling back regulations across many industries. These changes create uncertainty for health providers and consumers about whether the agency will be able to maintain drug safeguards in place. Using the example of the pain reliever rofecoxib, which was sold under the brand name Vioxx, and the occurrence of heart attack, the researchers reproduced that known association between the two using the new research method. When Vioxx was approved it was rapidly embraced by patients, but then quickly lost favor as safety concerns came to light, making it an ideal model to demonstrate this design. "Epidemiologic studies can get the wrong answer if there are differences between people who take the drug and people who don't take the drug," said Hennessy, who is also a Leonard David Institute of Health Economics senior fellow. "This kind of study is immune to that bias, because it's not comparing users to non-users, it's looking at trends in the frequency of outcome as a function of trends in the frequency of exposure. Even when there are unmeasured factors that are different between groups and those factors affect the outcome - this study will give the correct answer." This also applies to drugs that are already popular but have not been sufficiently examined. The team has applied for a grant looking, for instance, at potential cardiac risks associated with testosterone supplementation. Testosterone became rapidly popular and then rapidly unpopular -- circumstances which would allow the research team to study the cardiovascular effects of testosterone which are uncertain because of the limited number of people studied in randomized trials. ### Co-authors on this paper include Xinyao Ji, Dylan S. Small, and Charles E. Leonard, all from Penn. Hennessy serves as a consultant to Merck on topics unrelated to this paper.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio Auto focus Clean Tech Emerging Entrepreneurs Flight Plan India File India Interior Pulse Technophile Luxe New Manager ‘Walking the walk’ on AMR report PT Jyothi Datta comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Jayasree K Iyer The young set running drug firms is raring to team up with Access to Medicine Foundation When Jayasree K Iyer met Cipla doyen YK Hamied for breakfast recently in Mumbai, the ground was in a sense being prepared for the Access to Medicine Foundation’s first report on generic drugs. Only this one would be focussed on anti-microbial resistance (AMR), a global concern gripping governments as people develop resistance to antibiotics leading to their illnesses not subsiding even with the most powerful antibiotics. Jayasree heads Netherlands-based Access to Medicine Foundation, a non-profit whose past reports on innovator drug companies and their approach to medicine access and pricing have delivered interesting insights. Sometimes even contrary to the common perception of large drug companies being the villain of the piece. This time though Jayasree is looking at the other side of the medicine divide, at generic companies that make medicines which are chemically equivalent to an innovator medicine. And she is pleasantly surprised by the ‘speed’ and commitment shown by the younger brigade running companies including Cipla, Lupin, Wockhardt and Dr Reddy's, towards participating in this report. The report should be ready by December, she says sitting in a noisy coffeeshop at the heart of the Bandra Kurla business hub. The idea is to ‘motivate’ generic makers to get involved with access issues, and in this case with a focus on AMR and the best practices around it, she explains. Companies making antibiotics and anti-infective drugs need to do more in terms of surveillance and packaging, look at appropriate use in sales, she says of how companies can extend themselves. An interesting feature involving the Foundation’s reports is its interplay with investors. Tangible details are pitched to investors who then rely on the information to push ethical behaviour. Investors see an opportunity as access means volumes, but they also see reputaional risk or a ‘bad deal’ when there is a breach, fine or the cost of government sanctions. “Investors don’t want unethical behaviour,” she says emphatically. Transparency & access Just months ago the Foundation came out with a vaccine report featuring eight major developers, including big-revenue companies like GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co, Pfizer, Sanofi, and one of the largest sales volume companies, Pune-based Serum Institute of India. The report quotes World Health Organisation’s estimates that 19.4 million infants miss out on basic vaccines. For the Foundation, the vaccine report was like navigating a minefield, where practices are evaluated and not products, she says, as a critical report can become an ammunition for the anti-vaccine lobby. Be it Pfizer, Sanofi, GSK or Serum, they need to do more in terms of public disclosure, price transparency, faster development of key molecules, supply chain commitments, she points out. Making the ethical point again, she says, the landscape you are selling into has changed and to be a market leader you need to offer the product in a more responsible way. It’s no longer just transactional, she says, as companies are being forced to reinvest in land, recast royalties, etc. But what about conflict of interest in a vaccine report, since one of the Foundation's funders, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is also a big supporter of global vaccine programmes? “We have an independent board. Even though there are many influences, we have very strict rules and bring it back to a multi stakeholder discussion... you need to have a consensus,” she says. The Foundation is also funded by UK AID and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Cancer report Last month, the Foundation released a report on cancer care in the developing world and the role of drug companies. It found that market leaders in oncology were in fact addressing cancer care for the poor, with 129 separate initiatives up and running. But coming back to the task ahead with 20 plus generic drugmakers, including Indian companies, Jayasree says, they are progressive and keen to do things differently. The effort is to show that investing in healthcare is critical. “Talking the talk is no longer accepted, it’s time to walk the walk,” she says, of the report that will look to measure outcomes around AMR.

By EmmaCourt Reporter Katie Golden has been in constant pain for the last six years. It’s cost the 36-year-old a master’s degree, her job as a commercial real estate banker and even friends. Not that anyone would think it to look at her. Golden suffers from migraine, often described as an “invisible disease.” Though she has found some relief through daily medication and other measures, the continuous pain still affects her every day. Most people think of migraine as headaches. But head pain is commonly accompanied by severe, disabling symptoms like nausea, vomiting, dizziness and sensitivity to light, sounds and smells. The disease is far more widespread than realized: About 38 million Americans, or 12% of the population, have them, according to the non-profit Migraine Research Foundation. But treatment options are limited. Just a handful of drugs were developed specifically for migraine, though drugs for other conditions including blood pressure and epilepsy have been found to work, too. Still, there haven’t been any new drugs in development for some time, experts say. A promising new group of drugs, named after calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neurotransmitter tied to migraine, has changed that. CGRP drugs are being developed both to prevent migraines before they happen, and to stop attacks once they occur. The former category is closest to being available for patients. About seven million patients would likely get the treatment, estimates Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat, with an $8 billion to $10 billion potential market size. Elisabeth Viilu Photography Though most patients with migraine experience discrete attacks, Katie Golden has lived with constant pain for the last six years. Golden blogs about her experience with migraine. Amgen Inc. AMGN, +0.87%  has already filed for approval, and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, +1.17%  and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. TEVA, +2.34%  have plans for later this year. Alder BioPharmaceuticals Inc. ALDR, +1.20% is also developing a preventive CGRP drug, and further research on the drug class is expected at the American Headache Society’s annual meeting, which began Thursday and runs through Sunday. But price and access remain a persistent question. Projections begin at about $8,500, concerning patients and headache experts alike. Dr. Lawrence Newman, director of the headache division at NYU Langone Medical Center and immediate past president of the American Headache Society, says that could add on to the “double whammy” of having migraines, which describes the symptoms and stigma patients face. “I’m concerned that the patient will again be exposed to that double whammy,” he said. “They’re made to suffer because of the disease they have and because the insurance company won’t allow them access to a potentially effective therapy.” A nearly 30 year journey Until relatively recently, migraine pain was thought a result of widening blood vessels in the brain, because of how patients’ heads felt during attacks. Then, in the late 1980s, neurologists Peter Goadsby and Lars Edvinsson did early work tying migraine instead to neuron activity. CGRP seemed then like it could be important. But so did another neuropeptide called substance P. That could help explain why it’s taken so long to advance CGRP drugs, Goadsby said, since companies began to target substance P, and only came back to CGRP some years later. Now, with four drugs either in late-stage clinical trials (Alder’s eptinezumab) or having completed them (Amgen’s erenumab, Eli Lilly’s galcanezumab and Teva’s fremanezumab), CGRP medications could be on the market as early as next year. Read: Amgen shares tick higher on positive migraine drug study and Eli Lilly reports positive results in trial of migraine treatment Not every pharmaceutical effort has made it. For example, Merck & Co., despite promising mid-stage results, decided to discontinue a drug in 2009 after concerns about liver toxicity. Experts say CGRP drugs could fill a big hole in treatment options. For one, medications like it are in short supply. When it comes to relieving painful attacks, patients have some options in the way of so-called acute medications, including general pain drugs and popular migraine medications called triptans. See: Opioids are ravaging the U.S., but they’re still the best pain drug we’ve got EvercoreISI’s Umer Raffat These are current FDA-approved migraine therapies. Peak sales for triptans, which are currently the biggest class of anti-migraine drugs and cost about $2,500 a year, were $7 billion in the U.S., according to EvercoreISI’s Umer Raffat. But preventive medications, which can stop attacks from happening, are especially limited. Only Allergan’s AGN, +1.29%  Botox is approved for patients with more than 15 days of headache a month, Newman noted, though those with fewer headache days have more options, including high-blood pressure pills and anti-epilepsy drugs. Related: Driven by Botox, Allergan’s 2017 expected to be a standout There are drugs being developed for acute migraine, including a CGRP drug from Allergan called ubrogepant and a non-CGRP drug from Eli Lilly called lasmiditan, both in late-stage development. But there’s a particular enthusiasm among experts around preventive CGRPs, which are the furthest along and have shown results for those with more than and fewer than 15 days of headache a month. They are “the first migraine-specific preventive ever developed,” said Goadsby, who is the director of the NIHR-Wellcome Trust King’s Clinical Research Facility and a neurology professor at King’s College London and University of California, San Francisco. That’s “a very big deal,” said Goadsby, who has done clinical trial work with all the companies in this space and sits on Amgen’s scientific advisory board. Bloomberg News/Landov Allergan’s Botox is the first and only treatment approved to prevent migraine in chronic patients, who have more than 15 days of headache a month. “Up until recently there were no new agents in the pipeline. It’s very discouraging for the patient, and it’s very discouraging for the doctor,” Newman said. Not having another option for a patient who is suffering is “one of the worst feelings as a physician… You never want to take away hope.” Though developed by four different companies, the preventive drugs are fairly similar. They’re injected about once a month, seem to reduce headache frequency in half of patients by about 50% and appear to have minimal side effects, Newman said. There are some slight differences, Newman said: the patient may be able to self-administer with an auto-injector for three of the drugs, while the fourth is intravenously administered. Three target the CGRP molecule itself, with the other targeting the receptor. (Another CGRP preventive drug developed by Allergan, atogepant, is in mid-stage clinical trials and is intended to be an oral drug.) This all may beg the question of how to tell the difference between these preventive drugs. Experts and drugmakers told MarketWatch it’s too early to tell, though it could come down what labels the drugs, if approved, get and individual patient conditions. Cost is also sure to be a factor. CGRP drugs will likely start at about $8,500 a year, according to Evercore ISI’s Umer Raffat, priced similarly to cholesterol-controlling PCSK9 inhibitors. The analogue brings the question of price to the forefront. Health insurers have restricted access to PCSK9 inhibitors because of their high price tag. And insurance coverage varies within the migraine community, said Golden. For example, “on Medicaid, your medications can be really expensive. It’s hard to pick between ‘can I get these six pills’ or ‘can I fill my car with gas this month,’” she said. “I’m lucky I don’t have to make those choices but they happen every day.” More from MarketWatch Mortgage rates slide to nearly seven-month low Bill Gates and Warren Buffett agree all entrepreneurs need this quality Nasdaq tumbles on tech selloff while Dow climbs to record close Quote References AMGN +1.41 +0.87% LLY +0.94 +1.17% TEVA +0.69 +2.34% ALDR +0.20 +1.20% AGN +2.95 +1.29% Show all references Most Popular Sex in an airplane seat?

But there’s a particular enthusiasm among experts around preventive CGRPs, which are the furthest along and have shown results for those with more than and fewer than 15 days of headache a month. They are “the first migraine-specific preventive ever developed,” said Goadsby, who is the director of the NIHR-Wellcome Trust King’s Clinical Research Facility and a neurology professor at King’s College London and University of California, San Francisco. That’s “a very big deal,” said Goadsby, who has done clinical trial work with all the companies in this space and sits on Amgen’s scientific advisory board. Bloomberg News/Landov Allergan’s Botox is the first and only treatment approved to prevent migraine in chronic patients, who have more than 15 days of headache a month. “Up until recently there were no new agents in the pipeline. It’s very discouraging for the patient, and it’s very discouraging for the doctor,” Newman said. Not having another option for a patient who is suffering is “one of the worst feelings as a physician… You never want to take away hope.” Though developed by four different companies, the preventive drugs are fairly similar. They’re injected about once a month, seem to reduce headache frequency in half of patients by about 50% and appear to have minimal side effects, Newman said. There are some slight differences, Newman said: the patient may be able to self-administer with an auto-injector for three of the drugs, while the fourth is intravenously administered. Three target the CGRP molecule itself, with the other targeting the receptor. (Another CGRP preventive drug developed by Allergan, atogepant, is in mid-stage clinical trials and is intended to be an oral drug.) This all may beg the question of how to tell the difference between these preventive drugs. Experts and drugmakers told MarketWatch it’s too early to tell, though it could come down what labels the drugs, if approved, get and individual patient conditions. Cost is also sure to be a factor. CGRP drugs will likely start at about $8,500 a year, according to Evercore ISI’s Umer Raffat, priced similarly to cholesterol-controlling PCSK9 inhibitors. The analogue brings the question of price to the forefront. Health insurers have restricted access to PCSK9 inhibitors because of their high price tag. And insurance coverage varies within the migraine community, said Golden. For example, “on Medicaid, your medications can be really expensive. It’s hard to pick between ‘can I get these six pills’ or ‘can I fill my car with gas this month,’” she said. “I’m lucky I don’t have to make those choices but they happen every day.” More from MarketWatch Citigroup shares jump to 2009 levels as fading Trump-policy hopes prompts upgrade The Nasdaq just blew its biggest lead in more than a year as tech stocks unravel Nasdaq tumbles on tech selloff while Dow climbs to record close Quote References AMGN +1.41 +0.87% LLY +0.94 +1.17% TEVA +0.69 +2.34% ALDR +0.20 +1.20% AGN +2.95 +1.29% Show all references Most Popular Sex in an airplane seat?

"This treatment might keep some of them in remission for a long time," he said. (Courtesy of Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center) 6378683 A-A+ By Laurie McGinley The Washington Post The oncologist was blunt: Stefanie Joho’s colon cancer was raging out of control and there was nothing more she could do. Flanked by her parents and sister, the 23-year-old felt something wet on her shoulder. She looked up to see her father weeping. “I felt dead inside, utterly demoralized, ready to be done,” Joho remembers. But her younger sister couldn’t accept that. When the family got back to Joho’s apartment in New York’s Flatiron district, Jess opened her laptop and began searching frantically for clinical trials, using medical words she’d heard but not fully understood. An hour later, she came into her sister’s room and showed her what she’d found. “I’m not letting you give up,” she told Stefanie. “This is not the end.” That search led to a contact at Johns Hopkins University, and a few days later, Joho got a call from a cancer geneticist co-leading a study there. “Get down here as fast as you can!” Luis Diaz said. “We are having tremendous success with patients like you.” What followed is an illuminating tale of how one woman’s intersection with experimental research helped open a new frontier in cancer treatment — with approval of a drug that, for the first time, targets a genetic feature in a tumor rather than the disease’s location in the body. The breakthrough, made official last week by the Food and Drug Administration, immediately could benefit some patients with certain kinds of advanced cancer that aren’t responding to chemotherapy. Each should be tested for that genetic signature, scientists stress. “These are people facing death sentences,” said Hopkins geneticist Bert Vogelstein. “This treatment might keep some of them in remission for a long time.” In August 2014, Joho stumbled into Hopkins for her first infusion of the immunotherapy drug Keytruda. She was in agony from a malignant mass in her midsection, and even with the copious amounts of OxyContin she was swallowing, she needed a new fentanyl patch on her arm every 48 hours. Yet within just days, the excruciating back pain had eased. Then an unfamiliar sensation — hunger — returned. She burst into tears when she realized what it was. As months went by, her tumor shrank and ultimately disappeared. She stopped treatment this past August, free from all signs of disease. The small trial in Baltimore was pivotal, and not only for the young marketing professional. It showed that immunotherapy could attack colon and other cancers thought to be unstoppable. The key was their tumors’ genetic defect, known as mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency — akin to a missing spell-check on their DNA. As the DNA copies itself, the abnormality prevents any errors from being fixed. In the cancer cells, that means huge numbers of mutations that are good targets for immunotherapy. The treatment approach isn’t a panacea, however. The glitch under scrutiny — which can arise spontaneously or be inherited — is found in just 4 percent of cancers overall. But bore in on a few specific types, and the scenario changes dramatically. The problem occurs in up to 20 percent of colon cancers and about 40 percent of endometrial malignancies — cancer in the lining of the uterus. In the United States, researchers estimate that initially about 15,000 people with this defect may be helped by this immunotherapy. That number is likely to rise sharply as doctors begin using it earlier on eligible patients. Joho was among the first. A diagnosis Even before Joho got sick, cancer had cast a long shadow on her family. Her mother has Lynch syndrome, a hereditary disorder that sharply raises the risk of certain cancers, and since 2003, Priscilla Joho has suffered colon cancer, uterine cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Stefanie’s older sister, Vanessa, had already tested positive for Lynch syndrome, and Stefanie planned to get tested when she turned 25. But at 22, several months after she graduated from New York University, she began feeling unusually tired. She blamed the fatigue on her demanding job. Her primary-care physician, aware of her mother’s medical history, ordered a colonoscopy. When Joho woke up from the procedure, the gastroenterologist looked “like a ghost,” she said. A subsequent CT scan revealed a very large tumor in her colon. She’d definitely inherited Lynch syndrome. She underwent surgery in January 2013 at Philadelphia’s Fox Chase Cancer Center, where her mother had been treated. The news was good: The cancer didn’t appear to have spread, so she could skip chemotherapy and follow up with scans every three months. By August of that year, though, Joho started having relentless back pain. Tests detected the invasive tumor in her abdomen. Another operation, and now she started chemo. Once again, in spring 2014, the cancer roared back. Her doctors in New York, where she now was living, switched to a more aggressive chemo regimen. “This thing is going to kill me,” Joho remembered thinking. “It was eating me alive.” She made it to Jess’ college graduation in Vermont that May. Midsummer, her oncologist confessed he was out of options. As he left the examining room, he mentioned offhandedly that some interesting work was going on in immunotherapy. But when Joho met with a hospital immunologist, that doctor told her no suitable trials were available. Joho began planning to move to her parents’ home in suburban Philadelphia: “I thought, ‘I’m dying, and I’d like to breathe fresh air and be around the green and the trees.’” Her younger sister wasn’t ready for her to give up. Jess searched for clinical trials, typing in “immunotherapy” and other terms she’d heard the doctors use. Up popped a trial at Hopkins, where doctors were testing a drug called pembrolizumab. Hope arrives “Pembro” is part of a class of new medications called checkpoint inhibitors that disable the brakes that keep the immune system from attacking tumors. In September 2014, the treatment was approved by the FDA for advanced melanoma and marketed as Keytruda. The medication made headlines in 2015 when it helped treat former President Jimmy Carter for melanoma that had spread to his brain and liver. It later was cleared for several other malignancies. Yet researchers still don’t know why immunotherapy, once hailed as a game changer, works in only a minority of patients. Figuring that out is important for clinical as well as financial reasons. Keytruda, for example, costs about $150,000 a year. By the time Joho arrived at Hopkins, the trial had been underway for a year. While an earlier study had shown a similar immunotherapy drug to be effective for a significant proportion of patients with advanced melanoma or lung or kidney cancer, checkpoint inhibitors weren’t making headway with colon cancer. A single patient out of 20 had responded in a couple of trials. Why did some tumors shrink and others didn’t? What was different about the single colon cancer patient who benefited? Drew Pardoll, director of the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Hopkins, and top researcher Suzanne Topalian took the unusual step of consulting with the cancer geneticists who worked one floor up. “This was the first date in what became the marriage of cancer genetics and cancer immunology,” Pardoll said. In a brainstorming session, the geneticists were quick to offer their theories. They suggested that the melanoma and lung cancer patients had done best because those cancers have lots of mutations, a consequence of exposure to sunlight and cigarette smoke. The mutations produce proteins recognized by the immune system as foreign and ripe for attack, and the drug boosts the system’s response. And that one colon-cancer patient? As Vogelstein recalls, “We all said in unison, ‘He must have MMR deficiency!’” — because such a genetic glitch would spawn even more mutations. The abnormality was a familiar subject to Vogelstein, who in the 1990s had co-discovered its role in the development of colon cancer. But the immunologists hadn’t thought of it. When the patient’s tumor tissue was tested, it was indeed positive for the defect. The researchers decided to run a small trial, led by Hopkins immunologist Dung Le and geneticist Diaz, to determine whether the defect could predict a patient’s response to immunotherapy. The pharmaceutical company Merck provided its still-experimental drug pembrolizumab. Three groups of volunteers were recruited: 10 colon cancer patients whose tumors had the genetic problem; 18 colon cancer patients without it; and 7 patients with other malignancies with the defect. The first results, published in 2015 in the New England Journal of Medicine, were striking. Four out of the 10 colon cancer patients with the defect and 5 out of the other 7 cancer patients with the abnormality responded to the drug. In the remaining group, nothing. Since then, updated numbers have reinforced that a high proportion of patients with the genetic feature benefit from the drug, often for a lengthy period. Other trials by pharmaceutical companies have shown similar results. The studies were the foundation of the FDA’s decision on May 30 to green-light Keytruda to treat cancers such as Joho’s, meaning malignancies with certain molecular characteristics. This first-ever “site-agnostic” approval by the agency signals an emerging field of “precision immunotherapy,” Pardoll said, one in which genetic details are used to anticipate who will respond to treatments. For Joho, now 27 and living in suburban Philadelphia, the hard lesson from the past few years is clear: The cancer field is changing so rapidly that patients can’t rely on their doctors to find them the best treatments. “Oncologists can barely keep up,” she said. “My sister found a trial I was a perfect candidate for, and my doctors didn’t even know it existed.” Her first several weeks on the trial were rough, with an early hospitalization after she cut back too quickly on her fentanyl and went into withdrawal. She still has some lasting side effects today — joint pain in her knees, minor nausea and fatigue — but they are manageable. “I have had to adapt to some new limits,” she acknowledged. “But I still feel better than I have in five years.” The FDA’s decision was an emotional moment. Diaz, now at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, immediately texted her. “We did it!” he exulted. “I got chills all over my body,” Joho said. “To think that I was at the end of the road, with no options, and then to be part of such a change.” 17388464 Share this story By Laurie McGinley The Washington Post More from Health Health officials vow to develop drugs to curb the opioid epidemic Exercises, mental tips can help incontinence How much weight gain is normal during pregnancy?

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition of the central nervous system where the coating around nerve fibres (called myelin) is damaged, causing a range of symptoms. More than 100,000 people in the UK have MS. Symptoms usually start in your 20s and 30s and it affects almost three times as many women as men. Once diagnosed, MS stays with you for life, but treatments and specialists can help you to manage the condition and its symptom. Now hope is on the horizon... Dr Su Metcalfe is sitting quietly reading through some documents in the lobby of the Judge Business School when I arrive for our interview. It would be easy to walk right past her and not know you were in the presence of a woman who could be on the verge of curing multiple sclerosis. MS, an auto-immune condition which affects 2.3million people around the world, attacks cells in the brain and the spinal cord, causing an array of physical and mental side effects including blindness and muscle weakness. At the moment there’s no cure, but Su and her company, LIFNano, hope to change that, reports the Cambridge News. “Some people get progressive MS, so go straight to the severe form of the disease, but the majority have a relapsing or remitting version,” she says. “It can start from the age of 30, and there’s no cure, so all you can do is suppress the immune response, but the drugs that do that have side effects, and you can’t repair the brain. The cost of those drugs is very high, and in the UK there are a lot of people who don’t get treated at all.” But now a solution could be in sight thanks to Su, who has married one of the body’s cleverest functions with some cutting-edge technology. The natural side of the equation is provided by a stem cell particle called a LIF. Read More Virgin Active in Whitley to become David Lloyd Coventry Su was working at the university’s department of surgery when she made her big breakthrough: “I was looking to see what controls the immune response and stops it auto-attacking us,” she explains. “I discovered a small binary switch, controlled by a LIF, which regulates inside the immune cell itself. LIF is able to control the cell to ensure it doesn’t attack your own body but then releases the attack when needed. “That LIF, in addition to regulating and protecting us against attack, also plays a major role in keeping the brain and spinal cord healthy. "In fact it plays a major role in tissue repair generally, turning on stem cells that are naturally occurring in the body, making it a natural regenerative medicine, but also plays a big part in repairing the brain when it’s been damaged. “So I thought, this is fantastic. We can treat auto-immune disease, and we’ve got something to treat MS, which attacks both the brain and the spinal cord. "So you have a double whammy that can stop and reverse the auto-immunity, and also repair the damage caused in the brain.” Presumably Su, who has been in Cambridge since she was an undergraduate but retains a soft accent from her native Yorkshire, was dancing a jig of delight around her lab at this point, but she soon hit a snag; the LIF could only survive outside the cell for 20 minutes before being broken down by the body, meaning there was not enough time to deploy it in a therapy. And this is where the technology, in the form of nano-particles, comes in. “They are made from the same material as soluble stitches, so they’re compatible with the body and they slowly dissolve,” says Su. “We load the cargo of the LIF into those particles, which become the delivery device that slowly dissolve and deliver the LIF over five days. "The nano-particle itself is a protective environment, and the enzymes that break it down can’t access it. "You can also decorate the surface of the particles with antibodies, so it becomes a homing device that can target specific parts of the brain, for example. So you get the right dose, in the right place, and at the right time.” The particles themselves were developed at Yale University, which is listed as co-inventor with Su on the IP. But LIFNano has the worldwide licence to deploy them, and Su believes we are on the verge of a step-change in medicine. She says: “Nano-medicine is a new era, and big pharma has already entered this space to deliver drugs while trying to avoid the side effects. The quantum leap is to actually go into biologics and tap into the natural pathways of the body. “We’re not using any drugs, we’re simply switching on the body’s own systems of self-tolerance and repair. There aren’t any side effects because all we’re doing is tipping the balance. "Auto-immunity happens when that balance has gone awry slightly, and we simply reset that. "Once you’ve done that, it becomes self-sustaining and you don’t have to keep giving therapy, because the body has its balance back.” Read More Sexual health warning as syphilis cases reach highest levels since 1940s LIFNano has already attracted two major funding awards, from drug firm Merck and the Government’s Innovate UK agency. Su herself is something of a novice when it comes to business, but has recruited cannily in the form of chairman Florian Kemmerich and ceo Oliver Jarry, both experienced operators in the pharma sector. With the support of the Judge, the company hopes to attract more investment, with the aim of starting clinical trials in 2020. “The 2020 date is ambitious, but with the funding we’ve got and the funding we’re hoping to raise, it should be possible,” says Su. “We’ve got everything we need in place to make the nano-particles in a clinically compliant manner, it’s just a case of flicking the switch when we have the money. "We’re looking at VCs and big pharma, because they have a strong interest in this area. We’re doing all our pre-clinical work concurrently while bringing in the major funds the company needs to go forward in its own right.” Immune cells have been a big part of Su’s career, and as we talk, her passion for her subject is obvious. “I wanted to understand something that was so simple on one level but also so complex,” she says. “The immune cell is the only single cell in the body that is its own unity, so it functions alone. It’s probably one of the most powerful cells in the body because it can kill you, and if you haven’t got it you die because you haven’t got it.” And MS may just be the start for LIFNano. “MS is our key driver at the moment, but it’s going to be leading through to other major auto-immune disease areas,” Su adds. “Psoriasis is high up on our list, and diabetes is another. Downstream there are all the dementias, because a LIF is a major health factor for the brain. So if we can get it into the brain we can start protecting against dementia.” Now that would be something. Download our all-new mobile app to get the latest news, sport and whats on.

We like this definition. The global market for oral vaccines is primarily driven by increasing prevalence of infectious diseases in developing countries, bioterrorism, resistance to existing vaccines, etc. New York, NY — (SBWIRE) — 06/09/2017 — In past few years, there has been tremendous increase in the demand for needle-free vaccines due to obvious choice to more comfortable oral delivery over parenteral administration. Oral vaccines hold potential to take immunization to new level of excellence, due to more adherence to vaccination regime. For highly infectious diseases such as seasonal flu, people prefer oral vaccines to avoid risk of contaminated needles & syringes to health workers, require less qualified health workers and also are less costly than injectable vaccines. The first oral vaccines came into market was Sabin attenuated strains trivalent polio vaccine (tOPV), which witnessed huge success since in terms of immunization and population acceptance in Americas, Europe and Western Pacific, since 1999. Oral polio vaccines stimulate mucosal immunity and thus is more effective in transmission of virus. With the development of oral vaccines global efforts to control contagious diseases, such as cholera and flu, are entering a new level as they offer an opportunity to prevent outbreak among population living in vulnerable areas. Oral vaccines are also preferred for immunization for wildlife population for dreadful diseases such as rabies. Some of the examples of commercial oral vaccines include Vaxchora (cholera), Vivotif, (typhoid), RABORAL V-RG (rabies), Tetramune, Rotateq, Rotashield, (Rotavirus), Dukoral (Cholera, diarrhea), LUIVAC (respiratory infection), Biostim (Klebsiella) and many others. The global market for oral vaccines is primarily driven by increasing prevalence of infectious diseases in developing countries, bioterrorism, resistance to existing vaccines, etc. In addition to this, patient adherence to needle-free vaccine regime, preference to oral vaccines by children and geriatric population, cost effective nature, recent FDA approvals to oral vaccines for diseases such as cholera etc. are some of the factors expected to fuel the growth of global oral vaccines market. However, compromised immunogenicity in children and cost for maintaining a cold chain, inaccessibility in remote areas etc. are some of the factors limiting growth of global oral vaccines market. For instance, maintenance of cold chain for oral vaccines across the globe costs over US$ 300 Mn per year. Development of new delivery system for oral vaccines may result in more efficiency of these products and may result in less failure rate for clinical trials. Development of low cost oral vaccines for new indications not yet covered by existing vaccines presents huge opportunity for researchers in this field as this may increase the uptake of countries with low immunization accessibility. Currently, several oral vaccine products are being evaluated in clinical trials, but they require more extensive human studies to establish the efficacy. Based on product type, the global oral vaccines market has been classified as live attenuated vaccines, killed/inactivated vaccines, recombinant vaccines and others (ribosomal fractions, antigenic preparations). Among all product types, killed/inactivates vaccines segment is expected to take maximum share in the global market due to high adoption for safety and efficacy. Based on end user, the global oral vaccines market has been classified as hospitals, clinics, government vaccination centers, and research institutes. Government vaccination centers are expected to contribute highest market share in the global oral vaccines market due to strong patient pool towards national immunization programs. Request to View Tables of Content @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/14395 On the basis of regional presence, global oral vaccines market is segmented into five key regions viz. North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. North America is expected to lead the global market due to existence of highly planned healthcare reimbursement schemes and power of purchasing expensive vaccines In the U.S. Oral vaccines hold special advantage in developing countries where there is a high incidence of infectious diseases and also simple logistics for oral vaccines are highly effective for mass immunization programs.
